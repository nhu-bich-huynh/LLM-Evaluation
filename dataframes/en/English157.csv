"Text"
"We must learn from the Minister and President-in-Office precisely what he is doing to prepare the economy for the next round of structural funds."
"While we might know what is in the financial envelope, it is not good enough."
"It is important that we should know the strategic priorities that will be put in place."
"As a representative of the NorthWest and the border counties, I must of course make the case for continuing support for a region lacking in infrastructure."
"The border counties have suffered more than any other region in Ireland and possible more commercially than Northern Ireland, remembering that the national plan was in place prior to the cessation of violence."
"In conclusion, can I say that the marine industry is the backbone of the coastal regions."
"The industry is concerned about the slowing down of structural funds."
"It is for another Minister to address the reduction in capacity."
"The rural areas require funding from cohesion funds that should have a rural, a social and a regional factor and not just an economic factor."
"Mr President, in its priorities for the coming months the Irish presidency has made it clear that it is in favour of virtue and firmly opposed to sin."
"A solid commitment to monetary union; firm and fair enforcement of Union law across all Member States; completion and entrenchment of the single market; few in this House would argue with these objectives."
"But, as we all know, the real world has a way of making life more complicated."
"As ever, my own country throws up the most paradoxes."
"The government proclaims its staunch support for the single market, but threatens to exclude the UK from the single currency."
"What it fails to realize is that an opt-out from the single currency, taken to its logical economic conclusion, will lead to a lock-out from the single market."
"I hope that the Irish presidency will devote time and energy to explaining these facts of life to the British Government."
"In so doing, it may finally turn on its head the old Anglo-Saxon misconception about the intellect of England's Celtic neighbours."
"My group is firmly committed to the achievement of EMU within the timetable and the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaties, but we will not find the political support necessary for such a move unless we show greater concern for the welfare of our citizens."
"18 million unemployed and 50 million living in poverty provide a damning verdict on political leadership and government responsiveness in democracies which depend on political consent."
"We must not allow the pain of transition to undermine the whole European project."
"The cost of a palliative is small, the absence of it will cost us much more and if the Irish presidency can achieve one thing, it should be to administer the painkiller."
"Mr President, it is obvious that the fundamental concern of the economic policy of the European Union and its Member States is the application of convergence plans in order to arrive shortly at a single currency, whereas the subject of employment seems only to be a consequence of arriving at the single currency. In other words, it is not a fundamental objective."
"What is also clear in my view is that, during the years when we are applying the convergence plan, there is neither a resolve nor an effort to resolve the problem of unemployment."
"I wish all the best for the Irish presidency but I would call upon it, since I think that the Florence Summit was a failure, to give serious thought to reorienting the macro-economic aggregates so that unemployment is made a fundamental objective which should be overriding all of the other economic policies."
"From this point of view, I should like to make this remark, Mr Quinn, about the way in which the convergence policies are being applied in different countries."
"Mr Quinn spoke about budgetary adjustment and consolidation."
"That is all very well but in my country moves are afoot, with the blessing of the economic authorities of the Monetary Union, to privatise the most profitable undertakings in the public sector and in the medium and long term we are going to de-capitalise and it will not be possible to maintain low enough public deficits in the future."
"Mr Quinn also spoke about wage restraint policies."
"Yet demand is depressed because we are deliberately depressing it and we are keeping salaries down and demand is needed to reactivate the economy."
"I could continue this list of contradictions in the application of the convergence plans ad infinitum."
"In any case, I do wish the Irish presidency good luck and I would like to make a request on behalf of my group: I would like the presidency to give serious thought, in the chapters on economic policy, to the need for implementing an internal market and not only a single currency by means of fiscal harmonisation of profits, a thorny and complex issue but a fundamental one."
"We cannot continue to develop the internal market unless we look at this aspect in a decisive way."
"Mr President, once again the mounting unemployment in Europe has been cited, yet once again few speakers have acknowledged the real causes."
"The President of the ECOFIN Council is also trying to pretend that the EU has nothing to do with the loss of millions of jobs, that the neoliberal crash course we have triggered off with the convergence criteria, and which is apparently to be pushed through at any price, simply does not exist."
"It is almost cynical to speak of the responsibility of the Member States for employment policy in full awareness of the fact that the convergence criteria have deprived the Member States of their last vestige of control over their own employment policies, that they are practically forced to consolidate their budgets with fast, hot money from the social security budgets instead of through necessary structural reforms."
"On the other hand, however, there is no competent body and no money to pursue a European employment policy."
"We are rushing headlong into monetary union without first creating a social union."
"We have mounted the horse before bridling it, and we should not be surprised if we suffer a nasty fall."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying it, it has to be said: despite the improvement in inflation, monetary stability and interest rates we are having great difficulty producing the necessary growth to stimulate the jobs market."
"A number of theoretical mechanisms described in the guidelines are not currently working."
"A number of mechanisms which are not working are the reason why growth is recovering only very slowly and why there is no visible fall in unemployment."
"I thus call for a far more resolute policy on jobs."
"I should like to address myself primarily to the President of the ECOFIN Council."
"The ECOFIN Council has a bad reputation as regards measures to combat unemployment."
"It is overwhelmingly the fault of the ECOFIN Council that Jacques Delors' White Paper has so far largely remained a dead letter as far as the funding of trans-European networks is concerned."
"I urge the new President of the ECOFIN Council, and I am counting on him, to do his utmost to make the funding of the trans-European networks more than a symbolic battle, but rather to come up with a powerful instrument of revitalization as a counterweight to the inevitable, and possibly deflationist, repercussions of the necessary revision of the convergence criteria."
"In conclusion may I draw attention, particularly the attention of the Commissioner and Council President, to the current debate on the stability pact."
"I appreciate that a good, sound Euro requires the consolidation of convergence."
"But I would warn against us consolidating the deflationary effects of this."
"Like Alan Donnelly, I thus advocate specific treatment of investment spending."
"I advocate a sufficient degree of flexibility to accommodate short-term economic conditions."
"I also advocate a discussion of fiscal erosion in the context of the stability pact."
"If fiscal erosion continues the stability pact will put increasing pressure on social security systems and this will impart further deflationary impulses to the economy as a whole."
"Mr President, I wish to welcome Mr Quinn here to the European Parliament and to congratulate him on the seriousness and skill of his efforts to date to work himself into the whole business of organizing the affairs of the Union for the next six months."
"I welcome the fact that he has made unemployment and sound money his priorities."
"In fact, these two are the same priority."
"I am amazed that so many people are arguing that by being lax with monetary policy we can help to create jobs or improve the economic environment."
"In fact, if you look around the European Union and look at the countries which have done well over the years, the ones which have created a lot of jobs and given their people higher standards of living, they are all the countries which have pursued sound money policies."
"If they have unemployment - and it is, I have to say, then new to them - they look after their unemployed better than do other countries."
"I can therefore see no good reason behind the demand for lax monetary policies so far as unemployment as a priority is concerned."
"Obviously, it is an admirable priority."
"The European Union can do some things."
"The completion of the internal market made this Union more competitive."
"It led to better business and greater confidence and competitiveness."
"Consumers were able to get better value."
"But it did not necessarily or automatically resolve the unemployment problem."
"The same is true of the single currency."
"We should not claim that a single currency will resolve unemployment."
"It will make business more convenient; it is a further step towards making the European Union more competitive and more efficient; but it does not necessarily resolve the unemployment problem."
"There is a danger in going out to the citizens of the European Union and saying to them that Maastricht was about unemployment, the single currency is about unemployment and then saying - if we fail - that Europe has failed us and let us down."
"Today most of the instruments which affect employment prospects for their citizens are still in the hands of the Member States - rates of wages and social welfare, the length of hours worked and infrastructure within the individual states."
"I hope that interest rates will be harmonized as time goes on."
"But most of the instruments which can affect the growth of employment are still in the hands of the Member States."
"We set the framework at European level and, as time goes on, there will be an evening up."
"The single currency will be another step."
"We worry unduly about the countries which will stay out and pursue soft currency policies in order to gain competitiveness."
"Experience shows us that in the very short term they may succeed but the only thing those countries can do is to provide their own workers with lower standards of living."
"The only thing they can gain from a soft monetary policy, devaluing their currency in order to gain competitiveness, is to reduce the wages of their own people and create greater poverty for the low paid."
"In the end the single currency will prove an asset to the Community."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his resolve."
"I wish to welcome the President-in-Office and wish him well during the course of the Irish presidency."
"He will know the critical tone of Parliament's resolution on the broad guidelines last month."
"We share with the Council concerns on the unemployment crisis, but there is genuine and real frustration with the slow pace of policy change."
"For example, subject to overall budget constraints, we believe taxation on the lower paid should be reduced."
"It is in this year's guidelines; it was in last year's guidelines; it was in the guidelines the year before and it was in the Delors White Paper."
"Commissioner Monti's paper for Verona establishes clearly that tax on the low paid has gone up."
"It is regression not progress: that is an issue of substance."
"I do not have the time to develop any kind of linguistic or analytical subtlety on my next point."
"But take the broad guidelines on fiscal and monetary policy: it is not only a question of style, but of substance."
"The President-in-Office said the Council cannot share Parliament's view on the evolution of monetary policy."
"Does he reject the OECD view the day after our resolution?"
"I quote from the OECD: ' There is scope to use lower interest rates.'"
"I quote from the OECD: ' A policy challenge in Europe will be to ensure that simultaneous fiscal consolidation does not have substantial adverse short-run effects on activity.'"
"I quote from OECD: ' Monetary policy will have to be used to avoid this short-run risk."
"The OECD calls a spade a spade."
"President-in-Office, too much of what we want to say is lost in Jesuitical sophistry in our text."
"If there is no difference of substance, let us call a spade a spade and let us do what we need to do."
"Mr President, on the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States and the Union little could be hoped of the declaration of this Council whose presidency, on the other hand, is the cause of some hope."
"This is yet again an illustration of the much talked about squaring of the circle."
"In truth, it is with some expectation and hope that this presidency is regarded as one which will take a multi-faceted look at political activity considering that it should not only be economics, and its monetarist form, that affects social life and cannot only be the big states which are in charge of the game."
"Ireland would be in an excellent position to put such a perspective into practice."
"It is a small state and it has shown acknowledged positive national economic results nor does it seem at all likely to forget or belittle social issues, especially that of unemployment."
"But will it be possible even to do this given the broad economic policy guidelines to which it is subjected?"
"Basic priorities with which we have to agree have been set out: employment, security, financial solidity and peace."
"But I wonder whether those basic priorities are compatible with a fundamental and vital priority, namely the entrenched guidelines of economic politics, that road to the final stage of economic and monetary union all of which is conditioned by magic numbers and inflexible dates which impose on both States and the Union economic policies which are more than anti-inflationary, they are deflationary, and which stop growth and prevent the fulfilment of social needs. All they do is multiply and concentrate financial capital while aggravating inequalities and imbalances."
"It is strange that we should be debating the broad economic policy guidelines since, by definition, they cannot be discussed. Therefore, we think that something has to be done, and done urgently."
"It is this: we must discuss the broad economic policy guidelines not only for the Union; it is very important that we discuss the economic policy of the Member States, seeing that there are different realities that are juxtaposed and which must co-exist in cooperation."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to welcome my Dublin colleague, Ruairi Quinn, the Irish Minister for Finance and the President-in-Office of Ecofin, to Parliament this afternoon."
"As indicated this morning by Dick Spring, the President-in-Office of the Council, maintaining the momentum towards Economic and Monetary Union is one of the main priorities of the Irish presidency."
"So, by the end of the year, I hope that we will see real progress on issues such as the maintenance of stability in stage 3, the exchangerate relationship between the Euro and the pre-in currencies and, especially, on the technical preparatory work for the legal framework of the Euro."
"A major part of this work will be ensuring greater economic policy coordination between all 15 Member States."
"In this regard, I have two main criticisms to make of Ecofin and European Council work so far - and I mean this in a very constructive way."
"Too much attention has been given to the monetary aspect of EMU and not enough to the economic provisions."
"I am not arguing for revision of the Maastricht convergence criteria, but I feel greater acknowledgement should be given to the 'E' in EMU."
"A more balanced economic policy mix is required."
"EMU must meet the needs not only of central bankers but also of the millions of unemployed throughout the Union."
"The President-in-Office has heard that from the Members here this afternoon."
"I know that there are not many here, but others are following in their rooms on their monitors."
"They will read the text."
"So what we require of him is to look after those millions of unemployed and to take that into account."
"Secondly, the Council is paying little or no attention to Parliament's legitimate and legally enshrined role in the moves towards EMU."
"I would specifically like an assurance from the President-in-Office that the key decisions will not be taken by the Irish presidency until we in Parliament have been given the chance to offer our own opinions."
"I, too, want to wish him well in the work he is going to do for us in the European Union over the next six months."
"Mr President, the Council admits in its text on the broad economic guidelines that since it presented its broad economic guidelines to Parliament in July 1995, the situation in Europe has deteriorated in contrast to what was expected."
"Growth has been below expectation and unemployment has continued to rise."
"Yet once more the Council continues to argue for the continuation of the current macroeconomic policies given the 'fact' that the fundamentals remain sound."
"When Europe has such a high and rising unemployment rate and social welfare burden, can the Council really argue that the economic fundamentals are sound?"
"What does soundness mean in this context?"
"When the OECD is forecasting in its annual employment outlook, published last Monday, a deterioration in the levels of employment in European countries such as France and Germany over the next 18 months, can the Council really be arguing that Europe should carry on the same policies regardless of the results, in the hope - not in the reasoned expectation, but the hope - that things will somehow turn out to be all right?"
"Furthermore, one has to contend with the problems faced by governments and by business as governments pursue the current form of fiscal strictness."
"A report by the European Construction Industry Federation - by the business sector, not by politicians, indeed not by socialist politicians - estimates that the restricted economic policies of the Union will cause the loss of more than a quarter of a million jobs in the construction sector by the end of next year."
"Since these policies inevitably undermine the perception at the grassroots of the well-foundedness of the common currency project, the German building federation believes that the Maastricht deficit criterion should be relaxed or monetary union delayed in order to ease pressure upon this sector."
"Fiscal strictness undermines our march towards the common currency which I, at least, support."
"Despite that, we have had from Mr Waigel the proposal that not only should there be no relaxation of fiscal strictness but that we should have an additional dose of even greater fiscal strictness after we have reached a common currency."
"A high level of growth, increased employment, social protection and economic convergence can be achieved only through long-term investment, especially in infrastructure projects."
"Here we see exposed the non-fulfilment of the White Paper on Growth Competitiveness and Employment."
"Public investment must be encouraged and conditions for private investment must also be improved through the reduction of interest rates."
"I am surprised that the President-in-Office, whose serious attitude I absolutely honour and salute, seems to have so misunderstood the tenor of Parliament's resolution regarding monetary policy."
"What Parliament was saying with reference to an easing of monetary policy is that there is no chance of reducing unemployment if the policy mix remains so unidirectional as it is now."
"It is the frightful one-sidedness of the guidelines that Parliament wished to escape from. But I am afraid, from your reaction, that we have missed our target."
"The Council is essentially single-mindedly pursuing one target: control of inflation below 2 %, below 1 % - even below zero % perhaps - forgetting that there might be such a thing as a natural rate of inflation."
"I am surprised that the hardened monetarists who write those papers and are so ready to accept that there is a natural rate of unemployment have forgotten that there might be a natural rate of inflation and that if you try to squash prices below that you might cause a reaction in the economy analogous to what happens when you go below the natural rate of unemployment."
"This one-sidedness of policies is what really frightens us and what we have to escape if we are to have anything more than ritualistic reference to the reduction of unemployment."
"Mr President, I understand the constraints of time, and colleagues will bear with me if I do not address in full all the questions posed to me."
"At the outset, in response to Alan Donnelly's question, the changes made by the Monetary Committee were made on behalf of the Ministers who are represented in Ecofin."
"So, between the Commission and the Ecofin there is this technical working group on which both Ministers from the various Member States and the central banks are represented."
"In his second question he suggested that perhaps the relationship between ECOFIN and Parliament needs to be reviewed and suggested that in September or early October we could meet to discuss in what way that relationship could be improved from an institutional point of view."
"On behalf of the presidency, I am prepared to have such a meeting and to investigate it."
"It is in the interests of all our citizens and the necessary political support to which I will address myself in a few seconds that a better understanding and a better form of communication between us should be established."
"Therefore, anything that encourages and improves this communication has to be welcome."
"So without prejudice to whatever conclusions may be arrived at and without in any way committing Ecofin during my presidency to a particular form of institutional change, I can certainly say that we will meet to discuss what Mr Donnelly suggested."
"With regard to the stability pact, I have to say that it is my impression that a clear majority of the members of Ecofin are committed to a stability pact being framed within the context of the Treaty and consequently accountable to all the institutions of the Union."
"There is a wide-ranging debate in relation to this and I will not go into it because of time constraints, but the Union can only move forward on a Treaty-based premise and we have to ensure that the concerns of those people who feel that the Treaty may not be strong enough to provide us with the sort of pact we require are also addressed and we have to seek within the framework of the Treaty the sort of pact that will bring about its objective, namely permanent monetary stability and sound finances."
"I agree with Mr Cassidy that we have to look not just at best practices in employment terms within the European Union but also at the other two pillars of economic activity in the global market, the Asia-Pacific rim and North America, to see if we can transpose from those totally different cultures best practices that are suitable to adaptation within the European social model."
"I have long held the view that the European social model of social protection which I, as deputy leader of the Irish Labour Party, fully support, cannot safely transpose itself into the next century in the context of a global market."
"We do not have to abandon the principles which brought about the construction of the social model of protection, but we certainly have to redesign it to the new reality which it has to confront."
"Coming from the Left in Europe I have an obligation - and I have said this elsewhere in this building over the last twenty-four hours - to ensure that we address that issue honestly and frankly without in any way appearing to compromise on our principles."
"The general question centred around whether monetary policy can be relaxed or whether in fact Ecofin is too obsessed with monetary policy."
"To some speakers - our Finnish friend from the Green Group - I would have to say that if spending money made countries wealthy, an awful lot of the highly indebted countries in the European Union at the present time would be immensely wealthy, including my own, which under the leadership of Mr Gallagher's party thought it could spend itself into a fortune at one stage - my children's children would still be paying off the debt of that mad escapade of crazy economics!"
"Sound monetary policy is the prerequisite."
"The fact that we are moving slowly but inexorably towards economic and monetary union is the sole policy objective that is driving the broad consensus within Ecofin and, I dare say, within this Chamber as well."
"The fact that we have 18 million unemployed is an absolute tragedy but I would put it to you that if we had loose monetary policy without the completion of the internal market, given the reality of the global market competition to which Mr McCartin referred, this figure would be higher."
"In conclusion, I have heard clearly what this Parliament has said in response to the debate on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"I have heard Mr Cox and others refer to looking at a range or a better mix of policy instruments other than the one set out in the economic policy guidelines."
"This is the start of the Irish presidency."
"This is the month of July and I should like to be able to come back at some stage between now and the end of the presidency."
"I will carry a very clear message to my colleagues in Ecofin, namely the concern of this Parliament that while being fully committed to EMU and to the project of the single currency, you are concerned about the failure in relation to employment and the consequent lack of popular support to live with the discipline necessary to create the single currency."
"We all ignore that lack of support at our peril and therefore we have to find ways within the framework of budgetary discipline, within the framework of the convergence criteria to address a concern which you, as elected representatives, are properly conveying here in this democratic assembly."
"Mr President, very briefly, while adding my own best wishes to those already expressed in this House for the success of the Irish presidency, I would like to make three quick points to provide a degree of reassurance, and perhaps dispel a degree of misunderstanding, regarding unemployment and economic and monetary union, the stability pact and the present state of the economy."
"As regards the relationship between economic and monetary union and unemployment, I have no doubt at all that the Euro is a precondition for the creation of jobs, for two very good reasons."
"The first is that, in order to move forward to the single currency, we have to reduce our public deficits."
"Well, today, public deficits in Europe are siphoning off 40 % or 50 % or perhaps even more of domestic saving, which would be better used to finance productive investment and job creation rather than debts inherited from previous generations."
"The second reason is that Euro means stable exchange rates."
"I have noticed that each time we reanalyse the monetary fluctuations of the spring of 1995, we find that the damage - in terms of growth and job losses - is constantly greater than we thought."
"At present, we believe that the monetary fluctuations of 1995 cost Europe about 1.2 to 1.5 % growth over two years, and 1.5 million jobs."
"So the discipline and monetary stability that economic and monetary union will bring will undoubtedly allow an increase in growth - and growth means employment."
"Next, as far as the stability pact is concerned I would say this: don't worry, it will not have any deflationary effects."
"The stability pact is a necessity."
"It is, ultimately, the guarantee of the necessary soundness to derive maximum benefit from economic and monetary union."
"In due course, after the end of the summer, this House will be invited to consider our proposals on this, and you will find that they include very specific objectives, which are not to be confused with the reference criteria for the transition to economic and monetary union."
"They will also include ways and means for achieving that objective."
"I should add that there is no question here of creating, or establishing, additional conditions for the transition to the Euro for those who are not among the first group."
"I can assure you, too, that we are concerned with remaining within the scope of the Treaty and that, as the Commission sees it, the stability pact must not be concluded outside the Treaty."
"The Treaty provides us with all the legal bases necessary to ensure a successful outcome for this instrument which is itself a necessity."
"I am thinking in particular of Article 103(5), as regards multilateral surveillance, and Article 104c as regards excessive government deficits."
"Even so, I do have confidence in the Irish presidency."
"I can tell you that the preparatory work, whether it concerns the stability pact or the legal status of the Euro or even the new European monetary system, all this work being currently of a technical nature, is progressing normally and on schedule."
"This preparatory work will be concluded under the Irish presidency, and the Euro will come into being on 1 January 1999."
"Few people today can have any doubt about that."
"Finally, as regards the economic situation, I have the impression that the slow-down is behind us and that growth is returning."
"What prompts me to express reasoned optimism is partly the fact that, for the first time for some months, I have noted a stabilization of economic forecasts in the European Union, and partly the recovery of investment."
"The investment indicators are good (plus 8 % for 1996)."
"This is encouraging, because the recovery of investment shows that industry is anticipating a renewal of growth, and it seems to me that the upward trend of investment is likely to be sustained because the production capacity utilization rate is already high within the European Union."
"I hope then, as I view these future prospects, that the Irish presidency will be able to steer the European vessel - I must not say down the right road, since we are talking about a maritime country, but through calm waters, which will bring it to port in ideal conditions at the end of the year."
"The debate is closed ."
"Abduction of children"
"The next item is the oral questions by Mrs Banotti, Mrs Green, Mr Martens, Mr De Vries, Mr Newman, Mrs Ahern, Mrs Bennasar Tous, Mr Bertens, Mr Bowe, Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Christodoulou, Mr K. Collins, Mrs Crawley, Mr Crowley, Mr Cushnahan, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, Mrs Fouque, Mr Gahrton, Mr Gillis, Mr Harrison, Mr Hendrick, Mr Kellett-Bowman, Mr Killilea, Mrs Kinnock, Mr König, Mr Lambrias, Mr McCartin, Mrs McIntosh, Mrs McKenna, Mr McMillan-Scott, Mrs Miranda de Lage, Mr Perry, Mr Rack, Mr O. Rehn, Mr Rothley, Mr Rübig, Mrs Schmidbauer, Mr Stenmarck, Mr Tannert and Mrs van Dijk, to the Council (B4-0671/96-0085/96) and to the Commission (B4-0672/96-0086/96) on child abduction in the Member States."
"Mr President, I hope colleagues will indulge us for a few minutes if we eat into question time, but I hope we can hold at least part of this debate with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner present."
"It is now 12 months since President Hänsch appointed me as his special mediator on transnationally abducted children."
"In that time I have dealt with 12 cases and almost daily requests for information and for help."
"He has also appointed Ms Ann Hennon to assist me and I am also happy today to acknowledge the presence, in the gallery, of Mr Adair Dyer, who is the deputy secretary-general of the Hague Conference on private international law, specifically charged with the Hague convention dealing with this issue."
"In the last few years happily, there has been an increase in marriages between citizens from different countries, but this brings with it also its own problems."
"When these marriages break down there is often an anguished debate about who the children will live with afterwards."
"We have two pieces of international legislation to deal with this issue: the Luxembourg Convention and the Hague Convention."
"The Hague Convention is a good piece of legislation, though it is not quite good enough."
"The main problems which exist with its implementation are the slowness of the procedures, the lack of free legal aid in some of our countries, and the excessive recourse to the use of the exemption clauses."
"For these conventions to be effective the implementation of the procedures must be extremely rapid and almost automatic."
"Another problem is the lack of knowledge of the procedures among some lawyers and judges who only deal very rarely with these cases."
"In some cases the children are never found."
"Figures from Interpol show that at the moment there are 60 children reported missing in the European Union and none of them have been traced."
"Many of these may not in fact be cases of parental abduction, but may be simply criminal abduction."
"There is a need for an independent, centralized European organization to which all missing children should be reported."
"I say this having visited in the United States last week the Institute for Missing and Exploited Children."
"Every year in the United States, with a population less than the European Union, they deal with the disappearance of approximately 367, 000 children, I repeat 367, 000."
"A great proportion, though by no means all of them, are parentally abducted children."
"Many of them are run-away children, sometimes running away with adults, not their parents."
"Many of them are children who simply disappear and are murdered and are never found again."
"We have a problem in Europe because we simply have no idea of the numbers of children affected."
"I believe, as I have said, that we need a centralized system."
"I would suggest that Europol would be a very appropriate place to have this centralized agency capable of responding within 24 hours."
"I must stress again the need for rapid action on these issues."
"The police have all too often been reluctant, unable, or unwilling to actually start looking for these children until tragically sometimes it is too late."
"We need recognition between Member States of custody orders given in each country."
"This would cut down a great deal on abductions."
"We also continue to have a serious problem for abductions outside the Community."
"You will recall that the first mediator on abducted children was appointed in response to the Algerian mothers' campaigns in Belgium and France."
"Parents need to be aware of some of these issues before they marry or before they create children."
"It is all very well to fall in love on your holidays, but when the realities of life begin to strike home the romance wears off very quickly and sometimes at considerable cost to the parents and to their children."
"Premarital arrangements might be a good idea simply to concentrate the mind."
"All too often when there is one abduction there is a re-abduction by the other parent."
"We need specialized, centralized courts in all our countries who will be well briefed and will deal with these cases within 24 hours of them being brought to their notice."
"We also need more adequate training for our lawyers and for our judges."
"Remember that at the heart of all these issues there is fear, love and all too often, unfortunately, revenge."
"A great many of our children have suffered."
"I have been totally and absolutely devastated by some of the stories I have heard over the last year."
"I look forward very much to hearing what the Council and the Commission propose."
"Mr President, the abduction of children across national boundaries is a matter of great concern and an issue that is now being addressed by the Council."
"I would like to acknowledge the role that the European Parliament played in bringing this issue to the attention of a wider audience in Europe."
"In particular, I would like to acknowledge the role played by our own Irish MEP, Mrs Banotti, as Parliament's special mediator on transnationally abducted children."
"A draft convention on the scope, jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters is currently under consideration by the Council."
"It is the view of the Council that this instrument, when it comes into force, will greatly help many citizens in the European Union."
"Discussions are ongoing on the draft convention."
"It is proposed that the convention, when it comes into operation, will apply to civil procedures relating to the invalidity of a marriage, divorce, and the legal separation of spouses."
"In addition, it will apply to civil procedures on parental authority for the children of both spouses undergoing matrimonial proceedings."
"Regarding jurisdiction, the draft convention provides that the authorities of a Member State shall be competent to rule on matters relating to the invalidity of a marriage on the basis of certain criteria founded, on the one hand, on the habitual residence of one spouse or both spouses subject to certain conditions and, on the other hand, on the nationality of both spouses or the joint domicile established on a permanent basis."
"It is also stipulated that the authorities of the Member State in which a ruling is given on actions relating to the annulment of the marriage, divorce or separation of the spouses shall be competent to take decisions on the exercise of parental authority over every child of both spouses on certain specific conditions, particularly where the children have their habitual residence in the same Member State."
"Subject to the working party's discussions, the draft convention provides that the competent authorities shall rule on the exercise of parental authority in conformity with the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction."
"Regarding recognition and enforcement of judgments arising from these cases, the draft convention provides that any judgments given concerning the invalidity of a marriage, divorce or the separation of spouses shall have legal effect in the other Member States of the European Union."
"This is also the case in judgments relating to the exercise of parental authority over the children of both spouses."
"It is clear from what I have said that the adoption of this convention will make it possible to establish a more open legal regime in this area."
"This will be a regime in which judgments given in one Member State of the Union will normally be recognized and enforced in another Member State."
"The aim is to adopt the approach provided for by the Brussels Convention of 1968 which determines the jurisdiction of Member States' courts in civil and commercial matters to facilitate recognition of judgments and to establish a swift procedure for the enforcement of judgments."
"No special procedure will be necessary for recognition of judgments."
"The honourable Members of the European Parliament will wish to be aware that the Council has examined the provisions in the draft convention on jurisdiction."
"At present Council work is focusing on recognition and enforcement provisions of the draft convention."
"Due to the complexity of the legal issues involved with this draft convention, it is not possible at this stage to estimate with any certainty when work on the convention will be completed."
"However, I would like to underline that the Council regards conclusion of this convention as a major priority in work under Title 6 of the Treaty in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"May I add that I note the specific suggestion of Mrs Banotti that Europol or some such agency should have a specific role."
"This is a suggestion which has much merit and I will communicate this suggestion to the Irish President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"I will say that, in pursuing this, I believe that the European Parliament and those Members of Parliament who have taken a particular interest in it have done a signal public service."
"Mr President, custody questions are sensitive ones."
"They concern our children's future."
"They also concern the conditions under which parents can fulfil their role as parents properly."
"Traditionally, responsibility for decisions on custody has rested with national authorities."
"There are no intergovernmental instruments governing situations where the dispute is between parents from different Member States."
"In many cases this has resulted in legal disputes which were heart-rending for both parents and children."
"Nevertheless, it would be natural for children to have both a father and a mother even after a separation."
"It is against this background that the Commission has been working actively to ensure that the custody issue is governed by the convention on family law issues, the Brussels II convention, which is currently being debated by the Council."
"The intention from the outset was that the convention should lay down clear rules on jurisdiction and the procedures for the execution of decisions in respect of marital disputes involving more than one Member State."
"As a result of the study which the Commission presented in September 1995, among other things, the field of application has been expanded to include custody issues."
"The study demonstrated shortcomings in the existing international legislation and showed that there was a clear need for a future Community instrument to regulate custody issues."
"Under the draft of the convention which is now being debated by the Council the court which is competent to decide on issues such as divorce, separation or the annulment of a marriage should also be competent to decide on custody."
"One principle is that the children should have to be resident in the country where the issue is decided."
"If this is not the case the court would still be able to decide the matter if this was not contrary to the children's best interests and if neither parent was opposed."
"I really do hope that work on the convention will be concluded soon."
"For its part, the Commission will work actively to ensure that solutions can be found to the remaining issues."
"Once the convention is in place it will be possible to avoid conflicts resulting from the fact that courts in different Member States arrive at contradictory decisions in the same cases."
"Finally, Mr President, as the Europol Convention stands today, it does not include any provision which would allow Europol to take on cases involving abducted children."
"However, as the honourable Minister said, there is nothing to prevent the presidency taking an initiative on this."
"I just wish to ask the Commissioner: if a child is abducted by a non-parental person, surely that is a criminal offence and should be dealt with by Europol?"
"I know there is a different set of criteria for abduction by parents, but surely we should not make so great a distinction between criminally and parentally-abducted children?"
"It is difficult to answer that question."
"As the Convention stands today Europol's competence covers trafficking in people, which can of course include trafficking in children, but it does not cover disputes."
"These would require a special initiative, as I see it."
"However, as I said, it is important that the Council should take an initiative on this."
"Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner."
"The debate is suspended and will be resumed at 9 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-0681/96)."
"Question No 1 by James Nicholson (H-0573/96)"
"Subject: Peace Policy"
"Will the Council define the present policy objective, in view of the current tension in Northern Ireland and the continued refusal by the IRA to reinstate a ceasefire?"
"In reply to the honourable Member, on behalf of the Council, I should like to say that all Member States wish to see a lasting, peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland and a renewal of the ceasefire."
"The European Union has always unreservedly supported the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland."
"In Essen, moreover, the European Council confirmed the European Union's commitment to providing its support for reconciliation and the restoration of sound economic foundations."
"Having said that, it is not for the Council to comment on the conduct of the peace process and the positions of the parties involved, which are matters coming outside its sphere of responsibility."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"Although he has, to a large extent, given me the answer I expected, I have no doubt he would also agree with me that many people were devastated when the IRA called off its ceasefire - which was so welcome for that period of time."
"Would he also welcome the fact that, through the trying circumstances of recent days, the loyalist ceasefire has still held in Northern Ireland?"
"That has been very crucial over the past few days."
"Would he also further agree with me that we cannot forget the bombs at Canary Wharf and Manchester and the wanton destruction and loss of life that that entailed, or, indeed, in his own country, the discovery of the bomb factory in County Laois and the worry that gives, because people just do not make bombs or hijack lorries to plant bombs without serious intent?"
"Would he not agree with me and urge everyone - including the Provisional IRA - to accept the Mitchell principles as laid out by other parties in the talks in Northern Ireland and allow a way for dialogue because, as we all know, dialogue must take place in the long term."
"That is the challenge to them."
"There is no one keeping them away: they are keeping themselves away."
"The opportunity is there for them."
"Would he not agree with me on that?"
"This whole area falls outside the remit of the Council."
"But perhaps I may, on a personal basis, respond to the honourable Member."
"Firstly, I agree with him that everybody in the island of Ireland was devastated when the IRA called off its ceasefire."
"I certainly welcome the holding of the loyalist ceasefire and would look forward to a full restoration of the IRA ceasefire at the earliest possible time, which is something we are all working to bring about and hoping and praying for."
"We certainly cannot forget what happened at Canary Wharf and Manchester or in County Laois, or the murder of a Detective Garda in County Limerick in recent times, for that matter."
"I would say to the honourable Member, who I know to be an honourable man, that the problem of Northern Ireland is a problem of double minority."
"I do not know whether you have ever heard it described in that way: it is my personal description of the problem."
"In my view, nothing can be done without bringing both minorities along. The unionists are a minority on the island of Ireland, the nationalists are a minority within Northern Ireland."
"We have come a long way, over a long number of years, in trying to change the view that nationalism in Ireland has of itself."
"But when we see a nationalist minority being treated in a way that is contemptuous of their minority status, it makes our role very difficult."
"What I would say to the honourable Member is that both sides must work to respect minorities on the island so that we can respect each other's traditions and bring about a lasting peace in which we do not threaten each other."
"I certainly, on behalf of the presidency, will take into account and bear in mind the comments which the honourable Member has made in a very balanced and evenhanded manner, which is his usual mode of communication."
"All of us, as Labour MEPs, have been enormously saddened by the events of the past week or so."
"The bombing at Enniskillen, the rioting across large parts of Northern Ireland, and a clear attempt by the IRA to mount yet another bombing campaign in the mainland of the United Kingdom: all of these events must stand condemned."
"The rule of law must be upheld without any equivocation."
"But also we must ensure that these events - horrible as they have been - do not deter us in our determination to keep going with the peace process."
"Clearly one of the most emotive issues over the last week or so has been the Orangemen's marches."
"My question to the President-in-Office is: in his view, would it be helpful if the United Kingdom Government set up an independent commission which would examine the conduct of parades in Northern Ireland, help to ensure that the routes for such parades are fair and consistent, and would also examine the existing law relating to such parades?"
"Would that be helpful?"
"In response to the honourable Member I should like to say that the position of the Irish Government is well-known in this regard, but I am here today answering questions on behalf of the Council of the European Union."
"I reiterate what the Tánaiste said earlier in the House."
"Events have taken place over the last 10 days which have led to serious instability in Northern Ireland and have placed in peril the substantial achievements of the peace process over the last two years."
"The origins of the recent disturbances are deeply rooted in the fundamental divisions which exist within Northern Ireland and must be addressed by achieving a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland, between the peoples of Britain and Ireland, and by agreeing new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships."
"Nothing can excuse the widespread violence and intimidation of the last 10 days."
"Violence may be an outlet for frustration, but it can only worsen an already bad situation and will not solve the problems which lie at its root."
"Solutions will be found exclusively through dialogue, negotiation and compromise."
"It is essential that the primacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted."
"The rule of law must be seen to prevail and be effectively policed in an impartial manner."
"A solution must be found to the issue of contentious parades which served to provoke the recent unrest."
"That is what the Tánaiste said to the House this morning."
"I think if people reflect on that they will find it deals with the matter raised by the honourable Member."
"Mr President, I should like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that if people are treated equally under the law and if political authority holds as it did not hold in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland this last time, it does not matter how many minorities there are on an island or indeed a continent: we can all enjoy our identities and indeed, our allegiances, provided we are all treated equally under the law."
"Can he not answer the question of the honourable Member and state that the Council does abhor violence under all circumstances, that the Council does want to see the IRA cease-fire restored, can encourage the IRA cease-fire to be restored and indeed congratulate the Loyalist cease-fire for holding in these very trying circumstances?"
"The events of the last 10 days have been absolutely terrible for those of us who have held to non-violent and to political traditions over the past 25 years in the most terrible and difficult circumstances."
"We cannot continue to maltreat - indeed, crucify - people who have held to the political process, who have tried to maintain peace at all costs, political activity at all costs and to hold violence at bay."
"We must now support that in whatever way we can."
"I ask the Council here today to answer the question properly."
"As the record will show, I have answered those questions unequivocally and properly."
"I reject any suggestion that I have not done so."
"I am sure the honourable Member who placed the question heard me quite clearly say how much I wanted to see the IRA cease-fire restored, how much I condemn the IRA activity, and that I did share with him and welcomed the Loyalist cease-fire."
"Perhaps if Members listened to the debate they might contribute more light than heat."
"This is a very important and delicate situation and one to which we should all do our best to contribute a solution, not to be seen simply to utter words, but to make a contribution to solving the problem."
"It is a very complex problem."
"I am probably the only Member here present who has studied Irish politics at Queens University in Belfast and who has been a practising politician for 17 years now on the island of Ireland."
"I am sure the honourable Member from Northern Ireland who placed this question heard me unequivocally answer the question that he has put."
"I hope that the record of this House will show very clearly where we stand in relation to this question."
"Question No 2 by Saara-Maria Paakkinen (H-0513/96)"
"Subject: Continued joint funding for NGOs"
"For more than 20 years the European Union has allocated funding to NGOs involved in development cooperation to cover projects implemented in the developing countries and information programmes dealing with development issues."
"Efforts have been made to establish a legal basis for this cooperation, which has produced excellent results, but the Council has failed to reach a unanimous decision on the proposal for a regulation at its last two meetings."
"What measures does Italy, as the country holding the Council presidency, intend to take to bring an end to this stalemate and guarantee continued joint funding?"
"Since 1976 the Community has been co-financing development projects with non-governmental organizations."
"The funding has gradually increased over the years and in 1996 amounts to ECU 174 million in commitment appropriations."
"Until now, funding has been executed by the Commission without the adoption by the Council of a legal basis."
"However, in 1995, following an agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the necessity of a legal basis for budget lines, the Commission made a proposal on this issue."
"Unfortunately the Council has not yet been able to adopt a common position on this proposal."
"The Irish presidency intends to do all it can to ensure that a common position on the nongovernmental organizations co-financing regulation is adopted as rapidly as possible."
"Under Article 7 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities annexed to the Treaty, the Commission may conclude agreements for the laissez-passer issued to Members and servants of the Community's institutions to be recognized as valid travel documents within the territory of third countries."
"There is an agreement between the Commission and the Swiss authorities in effect since January 1975 recognizing the validity in Switzerland of the laissez-passer for Members of the European Parliament."
"There has been no change to that agreement."
"It would appear that the incident in question was an isolated one."
"However, may I suggest that the honourable Member put his question to the Commission which, having negotiated the agreement in question, is best placed to give a definitive answer on this issue."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"But, after all, it is also the Council which is competent for countries outside our European Union and especially for a question which has political connotations."
"My question is simply: has the Council been informed about the changing attitude in Switzerland?"
"It is not the first time this has happened."
"Recently it has happened several times."
"Would it not be useful to inform the Swiss authorities that they should inform their own people that there has been such an agreement made with the Commission?"
"There has been no change in the agreement."
"If there has been a change in attitude I will undertake to communicate the concerns of Parliament to the Swiss authorities."
"Question No 4 by Thomas Megahy (H-0531/96)"
"Subject: ' Irreversibility' of EU membership"
"In a summary of proceedings at the Intergovernmental Conference presented to Members of the European Parliament on 5 June 1996 by Elisabeth Guigou (Fr-PSE) and Elmar Brok (Ger-EPP), the following statement was made:"
"' On the issue of a Member State repeatedly and deliberately violating human rights, or ceasing to be democratic, most representatives agreed that it should be possible to sanction such a State... without, however, going so far as to expel a Member State as this would undermine the irreversibility of membership.'"
"Does the Council agree that membership of the Union is 'irreversible' ?"
"If so, could it indicate where this principle is enshrined in the Treaty of Rome?"
"Does it agree with the view that the curtailment of human rights and democratic norms in a Member State would not, under any circumstances, result in expulsion?"
"Is the general belief that membership of the Union is a voluntary matter, which can be terminated by the democratic decision of a Member State misplaced?"
"In reply to the honourable Member's question, I should like to emphasize that under Article N of the Treaty on European Union, the Council is not party to the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for amending the Treaties."
"Thus, the Council is not empowered to adopt any position on the ideas raised in the honourable Member's question."
"He will therefore appreciate that the Council has never discussed the question of the irreversibility of EU membership."
"The honourable Member will appreciate that it is for the Intergovernmental Conference alone to consider any possible amendment to the Treaty in this respect."
"Mr President, I must congratulate you on a perfect Council answer."
"I wondered what kind of answer I was going to get."
"Quite obviously, as you have never talked about it, you do not have a view about it, but it is very, very strange that the representatives of the various countries who are taking part in the preliminaries for this seem to be expressing views, so they must be lurking around in the Council somewhere."
"Would the Presidentin-Office take back this message to the Council from me, just in case they ever get around to talking about these things?"
"Would he say that this view of irreversibility is totally wrong, is not to be found in any of the treaties, and therefore, as in fact we have already seen in the case of Greenland - part of the Danish State - which has already seceded, there is no legal obstacle, whatever other practical obstacle there may be, to any country deciding voluntarily to leave the Union?"
"I would hope also that there might also be a precedent whereby there might be some chance of expulsion of countries exercising undemocratic practices over a long period of time."
"I am surprised that this was ever said, because I got the feeling that some other countries were so fed up with the present actions of the British Government at the moment they were actually talking about booting them out."
"I dare say that that has never been discussed either in the Council of Ministers."
"I am not in a position to comment on the last proposal put forward by the honourable Member, but may I say that the Council of Ministers has been preoccupied not with expelling or allowing countries to leave the Union but with the 12 countries which are knocking on the door wishing to join, so attractive does the Union seem to them."
"Having answered the question on behalf of the Council, may I say in a personal capacity that Ireland is open to considering positively the development of sanctions in the event of a Member State consistently violating human rights."
"This is a sensitive issue with far-reaching political implications and one which needs further reflection."
"I may say also that, as the Irish Member of the Reflection Group, I do recall that matters of this kind were discussed by the Reflection Group and if the Council ever does get around to discussing it, it will be as a result of the report of the Intergovernmental Conference and I am sure that the honourable Member's views that he has communicated so well here today will be taken into account."
"Mr President, I am aware of the concept of irreversibility of membership of the European Union."
"The supplementary question that I want to put is this: would the Minister agree with me that it is an abstract term and that it refers to the knitting together in an interdependent way of the economies of the European Economic Union, so that it becomes very difficult for countries to withdraw, while at the same time recognizing that it is a voluntary organization and whoever wants to leave can do so?"
"I have often said in reply to people from the United States asking about the lack of solidarity that is observed sometimes in the European Community that we do not have a National Guard that we can call out; and if we can build a European Union without the necessity to force anybody to stay, then it will be all the stronger and will have a better chance of becoming, in moral terms, irreversible."
"I hope the Minister would agree with that."
"I have known the honourable Member for a long number of years and I find very little to disagree with him about."
"As usual he has crystallized this whole idea and put it very well."
"I would like to - just for the sake of debate perhaps - raise one point which certainly entered my mind during the discussions of the Reflection Group."
"That is this that the European Union is open to democracies only."
"What would happen, for example, either now or some time in the future if a general turned up a European Council meeting in place of the Head of Government or State?"
"Should the Union be in a position not only to allow a Member to leave but also to expel a Member because it no longer meets the criterion, which is that it must be a democracy?"
"The whole question then of human rights sanctions was also considered by the Reflection Group."
"These questions and practices have not arisen so far in the Union and certainly what Mr McCartin has said here today is something that I would very much identify with and support."
"As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses."
"Question No 6 by Georges Berthu (H-0538/96)"
"Subject: Free-trade area"
"At the working meeting of the European Union's Ministers of Agriculture of 7 May 1996 in Otranto (Italy), the President-in-Office of the Council presented a document warning of the risks of a proliferation of free-trade areas while observing, according to the press, that this policy failed to take any account of the sectoral consequences of such agreements, or took it for granted that entire production sectors could survive the opening up of the markets."
"Does the Council intend to publish this document and forward it to all Members, and more particularly the members of the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on External Economic Relations?"
"Does the Council not consider it appropriate to launch an impartial and pluralist study (for which the Commission would have no remit in respect of the implementation, award or signature of contracts), on the ramifications of the Community's free-trade policy?"
"How does the Council propose to bring the Commission back to its role of strictly applying the guidelines it lays down?"
"Could it not take the opportunity afforded by the IGC to remove the ambiguities raised by Articles 113 and 228 on the Commission's degree of autonomy in this matter, by increasing the transparency of international trade negotiations and by clearly denying the Commission any power of prior signature capable of committing the Community de jure or de facto?"
"The document presented by the presidency at the informal Agricultural Council in Otranto, Italy, on 7 May 1996 regarding the establishment of free-trade areas and their effects on Community agriculture retains the status of an informal presidency working document and has neither been adopted not endorsed by the Council."
"With regard to the official Community position on the establishment of free-trade agreements with third countries, as adopted by the Council on 22 June 1995, the Council decided that before taking any future steps the Commission should assess the compatibility of all planned agreements with World Trade Organization rules."
"In addition it should assess the impact of such agreements on the common policies and on relations with the Union's main trading partners."
"It was also agreed that such assessments be examined by the Article 113 Committee, COREPER and the Council before approval of corresponding negotiating directives."
"Furthermore, the Florence European Council, on 21 and 22 June of this year, invited the Council to present the report on the development of the commercial policy and the preferential agreements of the Community to the Dublin European Council in December."
"Finally, the Council is not party to the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for amending the treaties."
"Thus the Council is not empowered to adopt any position on any possible revision of Articles 113 and 228 of the Treaty, such as suggested in the honourable Member's question."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for that answer, though I find it only half satisfactory because, underlying the specific points I was making, there was a general question, which is this: at the start of this Irish presidency, has the Council decided to change its policy towards the Commission?"
"Has it decided to reassert control of the Commission and no longer allow it to act as it pleases, as it has been doing for several years and especially since the signature of the GATT agreements?"
"We can see today that the Uruguay Round contains very substantial shortcomings in monetary, social, environmental and agricultural matters."
"We are wondering today how we are going to be able to turn back the clock, and this at a time when the Commission is launching free trade initiatives in all directions and even, as Sir Leon Brittan announced recently in Geneva, seeing a need to go even further in the liberalization of world trade."
"Well, Mr President, liberalization by all means, but on a sound basis, taking account of all the unquantified external effects, whether favourable or adverse for the economies, and especially the external effects on employment which Ireland has rightly made the first priority of its presidency."
"This, then, is an essential matter, and that is why we believe that Ireland must reassert its grip over the international negotiations and reassert its grip over the Commission."
"That is why, for every case of free trade put before us, we absolutely must have a quantified and objective impact study, so that in future the European Parliament should no longer have to deliberate blindfold."
"I note what the honourable Member has said in his contribution."
"The Florence European Council on 21 and 22 June did invite the Council to present a report on the development of the commercial policy and the preferential agreements of the Community to the Dublin European Council in December."
"That will obviously take place under the Irish presidency."
"I note that there are concerns."
"The respective roles of the Council and the Commission, like all the institutions, are being examined by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In that context perhaps the institutional arrangements need to be examined."
"But I wish to point out that there already has been discussion of the increased importance of regionalism within the World Trade Organization."
"The WTO has set up a committee on regional trade agreements to monitor new and existing regional trade groupings."
"Discussion of regionalism at Singapore has already been called for by a number of World Trade Organization members and will probably be discussed there."
"So there is an opportunity to consider this matter in Singapore and at the Dublin European Council meeting in December."
"Question No 7 by John McCartin (H-0548/96)"
"Subject: The EU wool industry"
"Has the presidency any plans in the coming six months to place the serious situation of the home-produced wool industry on the agenda of the Agriculture Council?"
"I can only stress that at this point the Council has not received any Commission proposal relating to the wool industry sector."
"The presidency notes the Member's concern and will give careful attention to any proposals which the Commission may bring forward."
"I welcome the President-in-Office to Parliament officially since it is the first time I have had this direct contact with him."
"I appreciate not only his efforts in helping to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference but his long-standing interest in European affairs and his long-term efforts to promote the integration and the union of Europe."
"I want to put it on record that he has been one of the most constructive politicians in the Irish Parliament in so far as Europe has been concerned."
"It did not just occur when he became directly involved through the presidency."
"I have raised this question because representations have been made to me by an organization at European level that is interested in the wool industry."
"We had a previous report in Parliament by Mr Hyland, an Irish Member."
"I would like to suggest to the Minister that this is potentially an important industry within the European Union."
"European Community policies have promoted the development of the sheepmeat industry, but wool is another product that it is possible to develop and add value to."
"Within the European Union we have 60, 000 farmers depending on sheepmeat and milk."
"Those farmers get ECU 2 billion from the Union."
"Would the Minister think that it might be a good idea to promote the development of the wool industry so that farmers would have a better income and perhaps would need less of the ECU 2 billion subsidization that we pay annually?"
"As I have just said, the Council has not received a Commission proposal and if we do the Council will certainly act on such a proposal."
"May I say in reply to the question posed by the honourable Member that I am very well aware of the difficulties faced by sheep farmers, not just in Ireland, but in Europe generally."
"I am aware of the report brought forward by Mr Hyland which he has referred to."
"I will certainly draw the exchanges in this Question Time to the attention of Minister Yates, who is President-in-Office of the Agriculture Council to ensure that he is aware of the concerns of the honourable Member."
"President-in-Office, I would like to join Mr McCartin in extending a very warm welcome to you."
"We had the opportunity of meeting you in the lead-up to the presidency and we found our working relationship with you quite cordial."
"I am pleased with your response, but could I urge you through the Agricultural presidency to make contact with the Commission to ensure that the request is put on the agenda so that it can be dealt with during the Irish presidency."
"I say that particularly because of the commitment of the Irish presidency to job creation and, hopefully, also to rural development."
"The wool sector provides the potential to generate good employment in rural areas, provided we have proper structures in place."
"Can I ask the President-in-Office to initiate a move himself with the Commission to ensure that a proper request is put before the presidency to be dealt with during your term of office?"
"I will endeavour to be of assistance to the honourable Members in this regard and I will draw this matter to the attention of Mr Yates, President-in-Office of the Agriculture Council."
"I should also like to thank Mr McCartin and Mr Hyland for their warm wishes at the commencement of the Irish presidency."
"I very much appreciate this."
"As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses."
"Question No 9 by Brian Crowley (H-0558/96)"
"Subject: Combating drug smuggling"
"Is the Council satisfied that Member States responsible for combating the activities of drug smugglers along the Union's external frontiers, particularly maritime frontiers, are allocating sufficient personnel and equipment to undertake this task, and will the Council consider allocating funding from the EU budget towards assisting those Member States responsible for policing the Union's extensive maritime frontiers to discharge their responsibilities on behalf of the Union?"
"It is one of the major priorities of the Irish presidency to secure more coordinated and effective action at European level against drug-trafficking and drug abuse."
"One of the important tasks which the presidency will undertake in this area is to set in motion a thorough review of the adequacy of cooperation in protecting the external borders of the European Union against importation of drugs by land, sea and air."
"The presidency has already initiated a discussion on the external frontier customs strategy."
"It has put forward proposals on training, technical aids, control equipment, intelligence, risk analysis and improved communications."
"It intends to propose a joint action to serve as a legal basis for the allocation of funds from the budget of the European Communities."
"These proposals are aimed at achieving a more effective level of cooperation against drug smuggling and will fulfil one of the action points on the list adopted by the Madrid European Council in December 1995 with regard to drugs."
"The Council will also give priority to the review of the Naples Convention on mutual assistance between customs administrations and the Customs 2000 strategy programme for the third pillar as well as EU participation in the strategic plan of the world customs organization for implementing an operative measure on the Balkan drug smuggling route."
"The presidency will also bring under scrutiny the present arrangements for joint customs surveillance operations at external frontiers."
"This examination will be with a view to improving their efficiency."
"A global mandate will be sought from the Council for these operations so that Council approval does not have to be obtained each year as at present."
"It will also seek to encourage cooperation between Member State customs authorities and private trade and shipping interests in the fight against drug trafficking."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"I also congratulate him on ensuring that this matter is dealt with at the highest level during the presidency."
"However, it is with some concern that I read in some newspaper reports back in Ireland that the Taoiseach is putting forward a suggestion for a European coastguard."
"My fear with regard to this is that monies that are badly needed for the Irish naval service to upgrade its fleet and to cover 140, 000 square miles of territorial waters, not only protecting the Irish coastline but also protecting a European frontier and European fishing ground, would be diverted into some other area."
"Could we ask for a commitment from the President-in-Office that monies will not be diverted from the existing agencies that are operating very efficiently but unfortunately are being under-resourced."
"As I said, the presidency and the Council's concern is with cooperation and the protection of the external frontiers of the European Union."
"Drugs come in by land, sea and air."
"Different routes are used, depending on the nature and origin of the drugs."
"Drugs are brought in by various means - by people in unaccompanied cargo, hidden in cars, ships and containers and, especially in the case of cannabis, in small craft."
"That is why it is important that there be a review of cooperation so that we can determine how the resources of the European Union and the Member States can best be deployed."
"While thanking Mr Crowley for his kind wishes, which I very much appreciate, may I add that I would see any suggestion which the Taoiseach may have floated as being additional to and not a replacement of existing arrangements."
"I might just mention that, for example, for a long number of years, as Mr Crowley knows well, coming from a part of Ireland which has often had maritime disasters, there has been cooperation between the RAF and the Irish Air Corps."
"This is very loose but effective cooperation."
"So coastguard cooperation might be very loose or it could be something more structured."
"But the idea itself is worth exploring."
"I emphasize, however, that it is not a question of diverting existing resources."
"Any possible evolution in this area will be by way of additional resources and additional assistance."
"I welcome our President-in-Office here this afternoon."
"I must say that I disagree fundamentally with Mr Crowley."
"The fact that the Irish presidency has highlighted the drugs issue and that all of the Members who spoke here this morning, nearly the majority, considered drugs a priority issue to be tackled by this presidency in an effective way gives carte blanche to the Irish presidency to go ahead and deal with this issue as they see fit."
"I think the idea of the coastguard for Ireland is particularly important because we are an island."
"It has been repeated here so often that is what is needed."
"I am delighted to hear that Mr Mitchell has now said that discussions are already in place in regard to the review of external borders and the land, sea and air services, etc."
"I would like him to clarify for us now exactly where this funding for the coastguard service will come from."
"We had, unfortunately, a terribly long delay with regard to the agreement for the funding on the TENs."
"I hope that we do not anticipate the same delay in relation to this very vital service."
"I also thank Ms Malone for her good wishes."
"On my first day in Parliament the good wishes and support of the Irish Members of the European Parliament are particularly welcome and have been a great source of help to me."
"In relation to the question that the honourable Member has asked, as she will be aware, a joint action is an enabling statutory procedure under the Treaties, specifically the second and third pillars as provided for in the Treaty on European Union."
"The Irish Government intends to propose a joint action to serve as a legal base for the allocation of funds from the budget of the European Communities."
"Of course this is not something that we can act on alone and we hope we will win the support of other Member States for this approach."
"It is certainly something which needs to be attended to, in my view."
"I said earlier in response to another debate in the House on the common foreign and security policy area that I believe that we need to do much more as a region in a coordinated way to tackle this problem."
"Each Member State is trying to deal with the problem as best it can."
"The Member States must primarily have the role to respond to Member States' needs, but collectively the European Union, as a region, is very weak in dealing with this problem."
"This is the approach that the Irish Government intends to take in its role as presidency."
"Mr President, the battle against crime and drugs is an issue close to the hearts of the general public."
"People understand that there is a need for cross-border cooperation in this area."
"It is positive that the presidency attaches such weight to these issues and we look forward expectantly to an initiative on drugs, not least concerning police and customs cooperation."
"I should like to take the opportunity as a Swedish Member to offer you my good wishes."
"My question concerns an area where improvement is possible and which could be included in such an initiative. Why have the same opportunities for practical, everyday cooperation and exchanges not yet been created for police officers as we have for the immigration and customs services?"
"As far as customs are concerned, the Mattaeus programme includes some good proposals and if one examines the plan of action in this area it is concerned primarily with exchanges between police training colleges."
"Why not consider developing police cooperation to the same standards as represented by the Mattaeus programme?"
"I thank the honourable Member for her kind words, which I appreciate."
"In relation to the question she poses, the third pillar is very much in an embryonic stage."
"It has not been very long in existence."
"I certainly hope that with the passing of the Europol Convention we will now see greater cooperation under the third pillar."
"The issues raised by the honourable Member have much merit and should be examined and advanced at an early stage."
"We need collectively to do much more than we are in dealing with this problem."
"I might point out that in the presentation of the European Union priorities of the Irish presidency, which was made by the Tánaiste in the House this morning, one of the priorities which we set out under our drugs and organized crime proposals is an exchange and training of law enforcement officers."
"I am very pleased to concur with the suggestion put forward by the honourable Member."
"I would like to take questions tabled by Mr Collins, Mr Apolinário and Mr Torres Couto together as, despite dealing with different aspects of the employment issue, all three questions concern ways and means of meeting the major challenge posed by unemployment."
"Europe has benefited from the evolution of a particular model of society on our continent - an evolution achieved often at the cost of great sacrifice."
"It is this model which characterizes our free and democratic societies, giving them a special place in the worldwide concert of nations."
"The continuation of the European model of society would be strengthened by a successful response to the questions posed by unemployment."
"We must wage the campaign against unemployment now so that we do not condemn our children and our children's children to continuing suffering and injustice."
"The employment of young people is particularly important."
"In principle, I share Mr Apolinário's assessment and consider, like him, that we must do our utmost to promote the employment of young people, for they will take our place and be charged with responsibility for advancing European civilization."
"As the Commission has made clear, the Confidence Pact on Employment is a flexible process which aims to enable all those concerned to enter into specific commitments in order to create a macroeconomic framework favourable to employment."
"It aims to exploit to the full the potential of the internal market, to speed up the labour market reforms and to make better use of the Union's policies in the interest of growth and employment."
"The European Council in Florence last month indicated its conviction that the trans-European networks, the development of small and medium-sized industries and scientific and technical research can make a vital contribution to job creation and competitiveness."
"In this context, it took note of proposals submitted by the President of the Commission to the effect that, firstly, the coverage of the agricultural guidelines will remain unchanged and the structural funds heading will also remain untouched."
"Secondly, the expenditure commitment ceiling in heading 3 - internal policies - will be raised by ECU 1 billion over the period 1997-1999 and will be mainly intended for priority transport infrastructure networks."
"However, the related budgetary payments will be settled within the current limits of the overall ceiling previously agreed for actual expenditure."
"Thirdly, this raising of the ceiling will be accompanied by a further effort to redeploy the available appropriations within heading 3 to help the sectors concerned, allowing an increase in the total available funds of ECU 1.2 bn."
"These proposals represent an integrated approach designed to make the best possible use of existing resources in order to achieve tangible results in terms of employment, while also finding new sources of funding."
"For the sake of completeness, I wish to add that the aim is to pursue a policy which fully respects and reflects the principle of subsidiarity."
"I have already thanked Mr Collins in his absence for his kind words earlier and I appreciate his introductory remarks."
"The Irish presidency will progress as far as possible the measures adopted by President Santer in support of job creation in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council."
"In addition, a central task of the presidency will be to prepare the second annual report on employment for the Dublin Council in December."
"This will analyse the effectiveness to date of the Member State's implementation of the Essen guidelines to their multiannual programmes on employment."
"This will also provide pointers for the future."
"In this process particular emphasis will be placed on groups requiring special attention, such as young people seeking their first job, the long-term unemployed and unemployed women."
"As a general political philosophy I support the whole concept of enterprise and competitiveness and the need to reward effort and initiative and that has to be at the core of job creation."
"But throughout the European Union now, we have unprecedented levels of material wealth, unprecedented at any period during the history of Europe, and yet there are a large number of people who do not share in the progress which has been achieved."
"I make no apology to anybody for the second principle which I think has to be present and that is the principle of social justice."
"When we create wealth we can distribute it, but we must create it first and we must encourage those people who can create it."
"I would commend to the House an examination of the Irish Government's programme on local development which is an effort to redistribute some of the wealth in such a way that it helps the poorest urban and rural communities."
"It is specifically targeted at job creation, education, training, environmental improvement and state management training because the living conditions of people can actually add to their handicap."
"This is an integrated approach which I hope to address in a later question by another Member of the House."
"I do not think it is all simply down to enterprise."
"We must encourage enterprise, we must facilitate enterprise but we must also at the same time have a sense of social justice and those two, so to speak, must go hand in hand."
"Certainly this is something which we as a presidency will try to advance as best we can during our six months in office."
"I might also inform the House that we are awaiting the Commission detailed proposal on the TENs issue which the honourable Member has addressed."
"At the meeting on 8 July, finance ministers agreed to the setting up of a high-level group, as the Members of the House will be aware, to examine this issue."
"The Irish presidency will explore through this group the extent to which the basis for an agreement exists among partners and will endeavour to secure a decision."
"Mr President, thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your kind words."
"I should just like to follow up by expressing a couple of concerns."
"The first one is of a general kind: employment is undoubtedly one of the great challenges for the European Union and it would be by working on the employment aspect that the Irish presidency would attain - or not - its objective."
"In the case of young people aged under 25 years I should like to point out that Eurostat data show that the unemployment rate for that category is double the overall rate - April statistics showed 21, 5 % unemployment for young people aged under 25 compared with 10, 9 % for overall unemployment - which means we must step up our effort in initiatives for local development and support to small and medium-sized undertakings in connection with questions relating to the environment, social welfare and social benefits, as well enabling special action to be taken to create jobs for young people."
"The second aspect of my supplementary question refers to policy on the structural funds and I should like the President-in-Office of the Council to give a fuller explanation of what he said. Am I right in saying that he promised that the Council's position would be to stick to all agreements already included in the financial perspectives?"
"I think that this was the promise which he gave, in other words no changes to the financial perspectives for the structural funds."
"I should like him to confirm this."
"What I said in reply to the question was that the expenditure commitment ceiling in Heading 3, internal policies, will be raised by ECU 1 billion over the period 1997-1999 and will be mainly intended for priority transport infrastructure networks."
"However, the related budgetary payments will be settled within the current limits of the overall ceiling previously agreed for actual expenditure, that is payment appropriations."
"I also said that this raising of the ceiling would be accompanied by a further effort to redeploy the available appropriations within Heading 3 to help the sectors concerned, allowing an increase in the total available funds of ECU 1.2 billion."
"Can I say in general terms, that we are all very concerned about employment, but the reality is that we do not do what we should do."
"We should make the creating of a job the most attractive thing that anybody with any sense of entrepreneurship can do."
"The reality is that if any of us here won our national lotteries the likelihood is that we would invest it in property or something of that kind which we would get a return on and which would not require us to take on the difficulties of employment."
"We give tax incentives for machines and we put payroll taxes on employment."
"So I think there has to be a fundamental rethink which encourages enterprise and rewards effort and one which has to deal with, as the honourable Member said, some of the structural problems which exist."
"Mr President, the question is very simple."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am extremely satisfied with the head-on way in which you tackled this subject and I hope you will forgive me if I am slightly acrimonious in respect of the supplementary question which I am putting - but I have been here for some years now and when these questions are put to the Council about employment it seems to me that they are beginning to become an exercise in sadomasochism because these questions were first put by me and other colleagues when unemployment in Europe was reaching a level of 11 to 12 million."
"Declarations of intent and other promises by successive presidencies have been quite solemn and constituted exercises of all seriousness."
"But it happens now that we are facing 18 million unemployed and 50 million marginalised citizens in the European Union and I think that this question is well answered by the phrase you uttered at the end of one of your speeches: ' We have to create wealth first and then we have to distribute it.'"
"But I think that this question has now become a fundamental one."
"Do you think that this practical and exclusively monetarist approach which has been taken in relation to employment questions is the way that you have found to be most reasonable and most positive for creating jobs?"
"Do you think it will be possible for us to think of a concrete way of fighting unemployment simply by means of monetary policy without taking into account very effective measures in terms of the labour markets, active employment policies, support for small and mediumsized companies or selective aids to dynamic sectors which call for support?"
"I think that these are the fundamental questions and there is another one: a few years ago, when Jacques Delors presented here the White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment, he said that there are no national solutions for the problem of fighting unemployment."
"What is happening now is that the ideas which are being put to us seem to claim that the solution for fighting unemployment cannot be specifically European but has to be dealt with on a national basis and that the principle of subsidiarity must be respected."
"I think that this is what divides us and this is what could lead to yet another failure in the case of the Irish presidency, in relation to the urgent fight against the problem of unemployment."
"I do not know where the honourable Member has been for the last few minutes but he certainly has not drawn that conclusion from anything I have said here."
"I hope he will forgive my forthrightness because this is an important question."
"I have been very clear on what I have said."
"I have spoken about employment and entrepreneurship and social justice."
"I have spoken about redistribution."
"I have spoken about the local development programme in Ireland."
"I am sure there are similar programmes in other countries, but the OECD report on local development in Ireland is one which I would commend to Members of this House."
"I have not spoken about any monetarist approach."
"Furthermore, the local development programme in Ireland is a partnership, first of all between the European Union and the state, and secondly between the state and the social partners: business, trade unions and the rural area's farmers."
"I am sorry that the honourable Member did not pick up what I said on the first occasion but I hope he will now."
"Furthermore, we should get it into our heads that we are not running economies, we are running states."
"Jobs have a therapeutic value as well as an economic value."
"Far from not wanting new ways at European or Member Statelevel of approaching this problem, I am one of the most ardent supporters of new approaches and I am the Minister responsible - as it happens, at the Prime Minister's office - for local development in my own country."
"I would welcome some opportunity to discuss this matter of local development and the contribution it can make, not just to employment creation, but also to tackling social injustice throughout the European Union more generally."
"Question No 13 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0564/96)"
"Subject: The 'Journalisten' affair"
"In the pleadings it submitted to the Court of Justice in the case, shortly to be decided, between it and the 'Journalisten' newspaper, the Council explained its position on openness and the principle of public access to official records."
"What legal force do the Code of Conduct and the decisions taken by the Edinburgh Council have as regards openness?"
"In the Council's opinion, what force does the declaration on openness made by Sweden during the membership negotiations have?"
"The honourable Member will be aware that my response to his question must be somewhat circumspect as the case of the Journalisten newspaper v. the Council, which is currently before the Court of First Instance, renders some matters sub judice ."
"Nonetheless I would make the following comments."
"The statement of defence in question was brought into the public domain by the Journalisten newspaper via the Internet."
"Following that incident the Court of First Instance decided to suspend proceedings in the case."
"In reply to the first part of the question, I would refer the honourable Member to the judgment of the Court of Justice on 30 April 1996 in Case No C-58/94, Netherlands v. the Council."
"In that case that Netherlands sought the annulment of the Code of Conduct concerning public access to Council and Commission documents."
"This action was ruled inadmissible by the Court on the ground that the Code of Conduct is a voluntary expression of coordination made by the Council and the Commission and 'is therefore not intended in itself to have legal effects' ."
"This is also the case for declarations adopted by the European Council."
"The Court of Justice gave a ruling on 13 January 1995, in Case C-264/94P, that European Council declarations are not acts whose legality can be governed by Article 133 of the EC Treaty."
"Regarding the honourable Member's second question, it involves a political assessment which the Council was not required to make."
"It simply states that the declaration in question was accompanied by another declaration made by all the Member States."
"Mr President, I would thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply which I thought was both clear and unambiguous."
"I have here the pleadings, marked 'secret' , which are concerned in this case."
"In this document the Council of Ministers argues rigorously against openness and quite rightly states that the Code of Conduct does not imply any legal right to obtain a document, simply what is called a 'policy orientation' ."
"My impression is that you confirm this standpoint."
"My question concerning the Swedish declaration during the membership negotiations was whether you regard that declaration as having any legal force whatsoever."
"Is it possible to refer to it in the course of legal proceedings?"
"Further to this I have two other questions."
"The Council writes in its pleadings that in making available a document which is secret within the EU Sweden is violating Community law."
"My first question is this. Is it the view of the Council that countries which apply national principles on openness which are more radical than those of the Union are violating Union law?"
"My second question concerns the fact that some months after the case involving the 'Journalisten' newspaper another Swedish journalist asked for the same document which the Council had previously refused to hand over to the 'Journalisten' newspaper and on that occasion the document was provided."
"I wonder why."
"Have views changed on the matter?"
"On what judgement and on what policy was this based?"
"Like many others here I should like to wish the Irish presidency a warm welcome and every success."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, given that the Council's obligation of transparency differs according to whether it is acting as legislator or as executive, could the Council confirm that when a document is submitted it is without any real political value and can therefore be published, something that did not take place when the first request was made?"
"My second question is whether or not the European Union must take into account all of the constitutional traditions of all Member States, on the basis of mutual respect - given that in Sweden there is a greater tradition of transparency - and that when a given Member State receives a document affecting another Member State it should observe a code of ethics, especially if that document is then disseminated over Internet ?"
"Mr President, I know that the previous questioner received a reply on an issue of some importance to us from Sweden."
"The reply is extremely important in that the requirement of openness was included in the Swedish declaration and the question was as follows: does the Council of Ministers consider that Sweden would be violating Union law if we handed over a document classified as secret in the EU?"
"It is extremely important that we receive an answer from the Council of Ministers, since it is a matter of whether arrangements made and agreements reached during the negotiations have any force or not."
"I am in some difficulty regarding a particular case because it is sub judice ."
"I know Members are making comments for reasons other than that they expect me to respond."
"Can I assure the House, not simply on behalf of the presidency, but also as the Irish Member on the reflection group which went into a lot of these issues, that this matter is being examined in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and the presidency will do everything in its power to try to advance openness and transparency, while at the same time recognizing the right of Member States to have their business conducted in a way which is agreeable to everybody through a code of conduct."
"- The Council attaches the greatest importance to respect for human rights and democracy in Turkey and does not hesitate to condemn violations of them in its contacts with the Turkish authorities."
"The Council has repeatedly made it clear to the Turkish Government, and will keep on doing so, that observance of a state of law and basic liberties, to which all citizens of Turkey are entitled, underlie closer relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"The Council continues to monitor carefully the situation of human rights and democratic development in Turkey."
"I add my welcome and my best wishes to the Irish presidency."
"The Scots are here to welcome you as well, President-in-Office."
"I am afraid I am rather disappointed in that response."
"My supplementary question is: Can the President-in-Office foresee a position where we would go beyond mere condemnation of continued violation of human rights to the point where the Council will actually take some action such as suspending cooperation agreements if violations of human rights continue on the scale which exists at the moment?"
"As we speak the Tánaiste Mr Spring is meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in Dublin."
"I can assure the House that the concerns which Mr Smith raises here - and I appreciate his comments and may I say go raibh mile maith agat - are issues which are regularly raised when meetings of this kind take place."
"This is a very fine judgment."
"The question really is: can we best advance our influence in the sphere of human rights by continuing to conduct the sort of relations we have with Turkey as we do at present and the judgment has been that we can."
"We can have more influence over them through the present vehicle than we could have otherwise."
"In other words we can get more from the carrot than from the stick."
"The Union has made a judgment in relation to the customs union for example which this House has ratified and endorsed."
"By bringing Turkey into the Western way of thinking in relation to issues such as human rights, we can best influence them."
"Please rest assured that the matter raised by the honourable Member is very much in the minds of the Council and is being raised at every opportunity."
"I should like very much to share in offering congratulations to the President-inOffice, because he is a young man and Irish."
"Sadly, however, the answer that he has given me on this matter obliges me to express pity for him, because all he has done is repeat the fairy tales that we have been fed for the last 15 years."
"Mr President-in-Office, no part-session goes by without some discussion of concrete instances of violation of human rights in Turkey."
"No part-session goes by without mention of the slaughter of Kurds, of the erosion of the Turkish people's rights, of their not being allowed to form political parties, or of the dissolution of the political parties that they do form if Mrs Çiller or the military disapprove."
"And you come here, as an Irish president-in-office, as an Irishman, and show not one iota of sensitivity, when you ought to be more sensitive than others about such things, and give an answer like that!"
"Forget about carrots and suchlike - just do what you say. If a general came to the Council and said that he wanted to join the Union, not only would you not listen to him, you would throw him out."
"Yet along comes a woman, all dressed up, along comes an Islamist, and you give them the customs union and the MEDA programme with large amounts of funding."
"That is what we are getting at."
"It is measures like that that we are talking about."
"Not carrots and sticks, but the suspension of those measures which benefit Turkey, which benefit that regime."
"Can you do that?"
"It is your obligation. Forget the fairy tales and all the talk about respect for human rights and observance of a state of law and the importance that you attach to them."
"I should inform the House that Turkey is not a member of the European Union and therefore we are not in a position to dictate to them how they conduct their affairs or to share with them, in the way we might share with Member States, a pooling of consensus on the way we approach problems."
"It is a very finely balanced question which is a very genuine one and a very important one."
"I thank him for his very kind wishes."
"I wish to assure him that the aim of the European Union is to encourage progress in the process of democratization and the protection of human rights in Turkey."
"While I was speaking I said that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Dublin this evening meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister."
"The House can be assured that on every occasion that meetings of this type take place, these issues are raised."
"In my view true diplomacy, by opening and keeping open channels, is our best hope of advancing our views in relation to dealing with these problems."
"That is the road the presidency intends to continue going down."
"Question No 16 by Kirsten Jensen (H-0572/96)"
"Subject: The situation in Burma"
"This week Danish consul James Leander Nicols died in a prison in Burma."
"The cause of death is unclear: the Danish authorities are now trying to obtain clarification of the detailed circumstances of the death and have asked for a post-mortem examination to be carried out on the body by forensic experts independent of the Burmese Government."
"How does the EU intend to react to this tragic incident and does it intend to implement sanctions against Burma?"
"On behalf of the Council I should like to extend sincerest sympathy to the family of the late Mr James Leander Nichols who died on 22 June 1996 whilst in custody for the unauthorized use of fax machines and telephones."
"Mr Nichols was the honorary consul of Denmark and he also represented Finland, Norway and Switzerland in Rangoon."
"On 5 July 1996 an EU declaration was issued which expressed deep concern at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Myanmar, Burma."
"In that declaration the EU indicated that it expected a full and satisfactory explanation from the Burmese authorities of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death of the late Mr Nichols."
"In addition, the EU called for an investigation by the United Nations' special rapporteur on Myanmar into the death of Mr Nichols."
"The situation and possible EU action has been the subject of lengthy discussions at the CFSP Asia-Oceania Working Group on 2 July last and subsequently at the Political Committee on 5 July last."
"Furthermore, the issue of coordinated EU action is being discussed at an extraordinary meeting of the CFSP Asia-Oceania Working Group in Brussels today in the light of discussions by Ministers at the General Affairs Council on 15 and 16 July earlier this week."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for what has been done so far."
"However, the fact is that everything which he described lies in the realm of what might be called diplomatic censure."
"The President-in-Office said in connection with Turkey that it was a question of keeping the diplomatic channels open, but in this case the diplomatic channels have already been blocked."
"According to a Burmese newspaper, Mr Nichols was a scoundrel who deserved to die."
"But he was one of the diplomatic links we had with the regime in Burma."
"He is now dead, and what the opposition, the democratic movement, is calling for is that we should take economic sanctions."
"I think that the situation is very much as it was in South Africa."
"All the opposition is asking for economic sanctions to be applied."
"So it is not as if we would be taking them against the will of the people in Burma."
"I would therefore ask the President-in-Office once again to consider whether we should not meet the wishes of the opposition in Burma and introduce sanctions against the illegal junta which is now occupying the government."
"May I inform the House that this is an issue which has been very strongly raised by the Danish Foreign Minister and with me personally when we had occasion to meet recently in Sweden."
"I know it is of concern not only to Danish Members but to the House generally."
"Concerning the comments by the Burmese Government, they are wholly unacceptable and uncivilized in the circumstances."
"I assure the House that this matter was discussed only two days ago by the General Affairs Council and that it is being pursued by the CFSP Asia Oceania Working Group in Brussels today in the light of what was discussed at the General Affairs Council, and that it will be a matter which we will pursue in every way possible."
"Could the President-in-Office be more specific on the question of economic sanctions."
"Is he aware that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the democratic opposition in Burma, has called for practical economic measures, which, she says, is the only way that we will see political change in her country?"
"Should we not listen to her in the way that we did not listen to the calls from the ANC in South Africa for economic sanctions during those apartheid days?"
"In Aung San Suu Kyi's view, the poor people of Burma are suffering enough already and economic sanctions would just hasten the day when we could see the return to democratic, accountable government."
"I would like to ask you, President-in-Office, what your position will be in Djakarta at the Asean Conference next week when the Council will be represented?"
"What will you say to the Slorc, who have been given official observer status at that Conference - much to the disgust of the international community?"
"What, indeed, will you say to those Asean countries, those neighbouring countries, who are rushing in to reinvest in Burma where Heineken, Carlsberg and others have pulled out?"
"The working group is considering all issues: nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out, and the Council does not rule out sanctions; all issues by way of response are under examination."
"I can further confirm to the House that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Spring, who will be in Djakarta, will raise this matter in a very forceful way and will ensure that the views of both the General Affairs Council and this House and, indeed, the people of Europe are communicated in a strong way so that nobody is left in any doubt as to our rejection and abhorrence at what has happened in these circumstances."
"Mr President, can the presidency tell me why it is considering sanctions against Burma, a move for which I have a certain amount of sympathy, whereas sanctions against Cuba, for example, are felt to be counterproductive?"
"I should like to know basically whether there is a general political line on sanctions."
"We want to enforce respect for human rights."
"We have economic interests."
"We must strike a balance between these, but we should not apply double standards."
"I remind the honourable Member that what I said is that the Asia-Oceania Working Group is examining the issue in the light of discussions held by the ministers at the General Affairs Council earlier this week."
"I ruled nothing in, and I ruled nothing out: the matter is still under examination."
"Question No 17 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0578/96)"
"Subject: Eradication of drift nets"
"With regard to the position of Spain and the opportunities for the Member States to table amendments and present proposals, it is apparent that there is an increased possibility of differentiation of the Baltic fishing grounds and that this would change the position of Germany and Austria. The Fisheries Commissioner has publicly called on the Spanish Government to present proposals; it will undoubtedly seize the available opportunities and incorporate Parliament's position in its proposal."
"As the honourable Member will be aware, the current legislation on the use of driftnets prohibiting the use of nets over 2.5 kilometres long in Community waters was adopted by the Council in 1992."
"In April 1994 the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a regulation to ban such fishing gear."
"The Council has considered that proposal on a number of occasions in the light of the opinion delivered by the European Parliament in July 1994, without coming to any decision on the matter."
"The subject was last discussed at the Fisheries Council meeting on 22 April 1996 when the Commission did indeed say that it wanted to see progress made and would be prepared to welcome any constructive ideas put to it by delegations in order to arrive at a qualified majority on its proposal."
"On another point, the discussion also enables the Council to reiterate the importance it attaches to compliance with the present Community legislation and to express its satisfaction at the progress made in the implementation of provisions."
"Proceedings on the proposal for a regulation are taking their course and the matter is still before the Council."
"It is not possible at this stage in discussions to pre-judge the position that will be taken by the Council."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, could you tell us whether the Spanish Government, if it wanted to, could present a new proposal taking into account the new situation in Italy and taking account of the possibility of differentiating the Baltic Sea and changing the current situation?"
"In other words, given that if the Spanish Government has that power and does not use it this is something to be condemned, can the Council state whether the Spanish Government could present a new proposal?"
"As the honourable Member will be aware from my reply, the Commission did submit a proposal for the regulation to ban fishing gear."
"These proposals have been under discussion."
"It is up to any Member State in response to the proposal to make whatever proposals it considers would be helpful in all the circumstances."
"I would hope that the arrangements on surveillance on monitoring which operated in the tuna fishery in 1995 ensured that most of the difficulties of previous years were eliminated."
"The same arrangements in 1996 will ensure the continuation of at least an orderly fishery and the tuna fishery is now one of the most closely monitored fisheries in EU waters."
"So some progress has been made in that regard."
"But it is up to Member States, if they wish to respond to the Council proposal, to put forward their reaction for other Member States to consider and for the Commission to react to."
"Question No 18 by Susan Waddington (H-0585/96)"
"Subject: Irish presidency - social exclusion"
"The Irish presidency has put social exclusion at the top of its agenda."
"Given that the fragmentation of policy instruments across the Commission services (Employment - DGV, Socrates & Leonardo - DGXXII, Urban - DGXVI), and the portfolios of several Commissioners (Flynn, Cresson, Wulf-Mathies, Fischler), is a major obstacle to integrated action, will the presidency ask President Santer to establish an internal 'Task Force' , of all Commissioners involved, with a common purpose to develop strategies and coordinate resources to combat social exclusion in Europe?"
"And does the presidency agree that the Task Force's first priority should be to present a report to the Dublin European Council in December?"
"Social exclusion and long-term unemployment, though not synonymous, are related."
"Therefore, policies, both structural and programme activities, which target long-term unemployment, have a direct impact on social exclusion."
"As I said earlier, in my own country we have put in place exciting new structures to counteract social exclusion in two ways."
"Firstly, by involving local communities and empowering them to address their own needs in partnership with the statutory authorities and the social partners."
"Secondly, we are resourcing these partnerships to address in a flexible, targeted and integrated way the complex interaction of factors which generate poverty and social exclusion."
"Through a strategic approach which links education, training, enterprise, employment and estate management, especially in urban areas, we are empowering the communities themselves to put a virtuous cycle in place of the vicious cycles of long-term unemployment and social exclusion, and this has both an urban and rural application."
"The Irish presidency is supportive of developing in the IGC a more secure basis for tackling social exclusion."
"In the short term, we have much to learn from each other and the Irish presidency is very anxious to give a lead in this exchange of ideas and experiences."
"I also wish to thank the President-in-Office for the very interesting reply he gave us about the Irish experience."
"Will he use that successful experience as a means of persuading the different Commissioners and the different directorate-generals to work together to develop a common purpose and common strategies, using their common resources to combat both social exclusion and long-term unemployment?"
"First, I must apologise to the honourable Member."
"I gave her the second page before I gave her the first so I am afraid I gave the answer in reverse order."
"Nonetheless, what I wanted to say is now on the record and I hope will be of assistance to the honourable Member."
"In relation to the question, the Council fully accepts that social exclusion and the marginalization of increasing numbers of people who were previously financially secure is an unacceptable phenomenon which undermines the very foundations of society."
"This constitutes a major challenge which will have to be addressed with the greatest determination."
"The Council considers that all resources should be marshalled against this corrosive problem."
"The Council is of the opinion that a primordial element in combating social exclusion is the reduction of unemployment."
"The Florence European Council for its part has noted in its conclusions the possibility of focusing structural policies increasingly on job creation."
"As regards the suggestion made in the honourable Member's question, these matters rest within the sole competence of the Commission because they relate exclusively to the internal organization of the services of that institution."
"The Council is therefore not in a position to address this particular issue."
"Regarding the whole question of social exclusion and long-term unemployment, these are very much at the heart of the Employment Pact proposals developed by President Santer and the Irish presidency is committed to developing the pact process."
"In that sense we are according the highest priority to these topics."
"In addition, with the support of the Commission, we are organizing a presidency conference on local development initiatives in Dublin in November during our presidency."
"This will provide an opportunity to exchange information, ideas and experiences on how local development strategies, such as those which have developed in Ireland, give an effective response to the problems of unemployment and social exclusion."
"This is particularly timely given the emphasis of territorial employment pacts in the Commission proposals."
"The Irish presidency welcomes this emphasis."
"It is entirely in accord with our own experiences and priorities."
"In addition, the Commission is organizing a conference on rural development in Cork during our presidency."
"This will provide an opportunity to reflect on the measures which are being developed at both national and European levels to address the problems of rural development."
"I note what the honourable Member has said."
"I hope she will note my reply that it is mainly within the remit of the Commission."
"So far as the presidency is in a position to advance tackling the issue which she has raised, I hope she will take from the reply and from our own experience that this is something we would like to advance as far as we can during our presidency."
"I believe one intriguing question concerns the extent to which the presidency considers it possible within the framework of the Essen guidelines to expand the consultations between the Member States on their employment policies to include a discussion of the ways in which structural funds are used."
"The second question concerns the part played in these consultations by genuine discussion of the macroeconomic policy options and by the presentation of a new policy mix for discussion, as requested by the European Parliament, a policy mix going beyond the tautological old argument that a sound economic policy will eventually lead to a sound employment policy."
"One of the things which concerns me very much is the fact that when we have had phenomenal growth rates, these have not converted into employment."
"This is something that certainly needs to be studied."
"I hope it is something that will be addressed in the context of the second annual report on employment which will come before the European Council in Dublin."
"I reiterate something I said earlier."
"A job is not just of economic value."
"It is of therapeutic value."
"We have to start thinking in new ways because unemployment is not just bad for the person who is unemployed, it creates terrible problems for society and for communities."
"It is our job, the job of politicians, not economists, to try to find ways - new ways and novel ways - of raising this particular issue."
"The issue of social exclusion is a matter to which the presidency attaches a high priority."
"One of the issues which the honourable Member raises is the question of the Essen strategy which included, incidentally, a report on local initiatives and the contribution they can make."
"At an informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers on 10-12 July in Dublin the general issue of social protection and long-term unemployment was discussed with particular reference to making social protection systems more effective in helping the most disadvantaged members of society to gain access to employment."
"Further debate on these topics will be led by the presidency which will seek to build on the experience and expertise gained to date and will try to construct a common approach to social exclusion and poverty."
"In addition, the legal basis for Community action to combat social exclusion is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It would therefore be premature to draw any conclusions on the outcomes of the deliberations of the Conference."
"Nonetheless, I do think that there is a point in the phrase which the honourable Member used."
"I do not know whether we should rely on old macroeconomic ways for tackling this problem."
"I think we have to look at solutions to the problem without boundary."
"To some extent we have a blinkered approach."
"It needs more imagination and more innovation."
"I certainly would like to see this being explored to a greater extent."
"I hope during our presidency we will be able to contribute in some way to that."
"As the time allowed for Question Time has been used up, Questions Nos 19 to 28 will be answered in writing."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order with regard to the speed with which written questions are replied to by the Council."
"I understand that there is an undertaking that the Council will reply to MEPs' questions within six weeks, but quite often replies come two, three or even four months late."
"I know that the Council actually lacks staff perhaps to deal with these questions, but I hope the Irish presidency will give priority to answering the questions as quickly as possible and preferably within the six-week deadline."
"This is a matter which concerns me."
"I am not too sure that we can solve the problem during the Irish presidency, which is a relatively small state, but we will look at how the situation can be improved."
"It may well be that in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference we will have to do something more structural to deal with the problem."
"But I realize that a problem exists."
"Quite honestly I am not too sure what I can do about it, but we will look at it and see if some improvement can take place."
"Thank you very much, Mr Mitchell, for your cooperation."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Abduction of children (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral questions on child abduction in the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of children is a phenomenon which frequently occurs, and in which the children are the main sufferers."
"They are snatched from their familiar surroundings and plunged into a situation of conflicting feelings which may have serious consequences on their further development, which can then be put right only with a great deal of difficulty."
"I have had plenty of conversations on this subject with many of the people involved and also with NGOs, and I also know what it is like for the children."
"Yet in these various processes the children involved are not sufficiently listened to and taken seriously."
"We cannot close our eyes to the fact that very often the family, in the traditional sense of the word, no longer exists."
"The statistics in every country, and in the Union, show us that the number of single parents is increasing."
"In order to be fair to the children in such cases, statutory provisions are necessary."
"I should like to see the Convention on the Rights of Children added to the existing conventions mentioned in this motion for a resolution."
"Furthermore, I should like to point out that the existing conventions have not yet been ratified by all Member States and incorporated into their own legislation."
"In addition, I would ask the Commission to inform us about all forms of cross-border abduction of children within the Union, and not only about the type that we have been talking about today."
"On this subject an appropriate investigation should be set up, financed and coordinated, in order to determine what the results of the European integration process are as far as children are concerned."
"I would also ask the European Council, at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, to designate children as an independent group of persons."
"I believe that it is important that children should be given independent rights."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mary Banotti for having drawn our attention to children and the psychological and physical abuse they can suffer."
"The question of appropriate legal instruments to protect children is now being seen as fundamental to the development of our society."
"Application of the 1989 Council of Europe Convention on Minors and of the UN Convention on Children is frequently discussed at meetings and conferences and receives regular media attention."
"Many national voluntary schemes have, over recent years, increasingly tried to bring the subject to the public's attention and to offer young people specific and timely help when nothing is organized."
"One example, that I should like to mention, is that of 'telefono azzurro' , a spontaneous Italian initiative run by specialists and volunteers, who, with the help of private donations, have set up a free telephone helpline for all children and young people."
"At international level, a great deal of work is being done on legal texts for the recognition of children's rights and duties, that both offer specific protection and serve as valid instruments for the appropriate protection of human potential."
"As promised by the Italian presidency, the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 4 June studied Member States' positions on a proposal for a common position on the Hague Convention and the protection of children."
"The Italian presidency also wanted that Council to examine the progress of work on revising the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of foreign court orders under family law."
"The proposed amendment provides for, among other things, coverage of cases concerning children."
"As national representatives failed to reach agreement, the Irish presidency has undertaken to include the subject on the agenda of forthcoming Justice and Home Affairs Councils, particularly as regards the provision of cross-reference clauses in the two texts to avoid legal overlaps."
"These steps are useful and important, but are not enough."
"Children need to be seen for what they are: our society's greatest resource in terms of human capital."
"It would be a crime, sheer suicide, to neglect our children."
"The problem we are discussing here - the abduction of children - is just one small aspect of the whole issue."
"Children are in fact disputed between two people of different nationalities who no longer share the conjugal home; they have lost the right to the human relationships that are vital to their happy development; they suffer because of conflicts between their parents; they have become a kind of 'lost property' ."
"In the specific case of abductions, they undoubtedly also suffer both psychologically and physically, and may even be taken by force."
"The European Union must be able to look to the future and assume a small but important exemplary role."
"I should like to think that this will be just one of the plenary sessions at which European Parliament will truly give its attention to children."
"Mr President, a British friend of mine lives in fear that her Greek ex-husband will snatch their small son and take him to Greece."
"The child is thoroughly confused and lives shut up in a cellar."
"One of my Dutch friends is terrified that his French ex-wife will abduct the children and he will never see them again."
"The children are undergoing psychiatric treatment."
"These are examples picked at random."
"That we, as adults, make a mess of things is our problem. But we must not make the children suffer and we must limit the damage as far as possible."
"Children are entitled to both parents."
"Also in our frontier-free Europe where the parents are resident in different countries after a divorce."
"Our own Irish colleague, Mary Banotti, as a European conciliator, is snowed under with all the desperate problems she has to deal with in such cases."
"For this reason too the Liberal Group believes that Europol must be empowered to keep a register of children who have disappeared and been abducted."
"I urge the Irish presidency, jointly with the Dutch, whose turn it will be next, to take this initiative and set up structures for cross-border cooperation and information exchange between police and justice authorities."
"I was pleased to hear such positive noises this afternoon from both Minister Quinn and Commissioner Gradin."
"We would also like to see harmonized procedures and specialized courts to implement the conventions of The Hague and Luxembourg. And then European legislation containing procedures for the automatic enforcement of court orders."
"Here too it is splendid that a new Brussels II convention is currently in the making."
"The sooner the better."
"But this must also include European legislation on visiting rights for natural children and guarantees of legal aid."
"Lastly, we want a clause on cooperation in abduction cases to be included in agreements between the European Union and third countries."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"Through clear and harmonized legislation, cooperation between police and justice authorities and Europol, we can prevent an awful lot of misery for an awful lot of children."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Banotti for raising this very important issue in the House."
"There are few more traumatic experiences for children than to be the subject of disputes between parents."
"If, added to that, is the experience of being taken from one jurisdiction to another and denied access to a mother or father - indeed, to grandparents and extended family - then the trauma is magnified."
"The European Union would make an important contribution to taking the deepest concerns of people everywhere in the Union seriously if it could produce a binding framework for the Member States."
"Let me put on record that it is important that we tackle issues of real importance to people in Europe, not just the global issues, not just the grande politique , but real issues that affect real people's lives."
"If we regard these issues as merely domestic, as has been reflected in national legislation on many issues regarding the family, then we do ourselves and the people of Europe a gross injustice."
"I am pleased that Mrs Gradin said that the Commission would deal speedily with this, but I am dismayed that the Council says that it has no timetable in its agenda."
"That is no reflection on the current President-in-Office of the Council."
"I realize the situation but, for the sake of people everywhere dealing with this issue, please speed this up."
"I have experienced this myself and I know how urgent it is to get this resolved for people in Europe."
"Mr President, as is highlighted in the resolution on the protection of children, child abuse - from maltreatment to the abduction of, and even trade in, children - is often associated with poverty and social marginalization."
"As a recent European Parliament report showed, poverty in Europe is on the increase, and worryingly so, and it is the weakest social groups, and especially women and children, who are the first to suffer the consequences."
"In Italy, for example, there are 1 200 000 poor children, that is, one child in six is living in absolute poverty, in families that are often families only in name."
"It is, therefore, vital that the Commission and Council should, in collaboration with individual Member States, promote a set of measures to combat poverty and, of course, to combat unemployment."
"As regards the specific issue of child abuse, the first thing we need to do is to draft serious European regulations to protect children's rights, with particular attention being given to legislation on adoption."
"Secondly, we need to launch an information campaign to increase awareness of the causes and results of child abuse."
"Thirdly, we need to provide economic support to ensure that children who are the victims of any kind of abuse, as well as their families, receive the health care, psychological support and legal help they need."
"And finally, we need to encourage the forces of law and order in the various Member States to work out a joint plan for collaboration to contain, at international level, the problem of child abduction and, as I said before, the trade in babies and children in general."
"Mr President, this debate deals with the harrowing and distressing circumstances of tug-of-love, transnationally abducted children of separated parents living in different countries."
"We have had over the years a number of petitions from people affected by this."
"Many MEPs have raised cases from their constituencies and those cases are increasing."
"The European Parliament has no powers in this area and should not pretend to, but our handling of this issue has been improved by the appointment and work of Mary Banotti who has a serious and realistic approach."
"Movement on the Brussels Convention is important, as has been said."
"We need to ensure that custody orders in the court of one Member State are not defied by the illegal abduction of children to the jurisdiction of another country, sometimes even another Member State."
"Putting it bluntly, why should, for instance, British courts cooperate in the removal of transnationally abducted children from their Britishbased parent, if the court of another Member State contravenes the spirit - and sometimes the words - of the Hague Convention and the Luxembourg Convention and refuses to do the same when a child is abducted to its jurisdiction; or, as we see quite often, when the police and authorities do not seriously seek out the kidnapped children and their abductors."
"The welfare of children must come first, not nationalism, not machismo but the welfare of the children."
"Everything should be done so that children of separated parents have the best possible chance of contact with both their parents, providing one of the parents is not going to try and abduct them, with the likelihood of a loving and secure upbringing."
"The work that Parliament and its appointed mediator, Mrs Banotti, do in this area needs the serious encouragement of all Members, and I hope that the response we heard from the President-in-Office and that of the Commission point us in the right direction and that the powers-that-be will take this issue seriously for the benefit of our children."
"Mr President, I welcome the initiative by Mrs Banotti on this issue."
"This debate on the abduction of children is very important."
"However, I want to concentrate on another aspect, namely, violence against children."
"I urge Parliament to hold a full and open discussion on violence against children in the autumn."
"Violence against children takes many forms."
"It is a shocking indictment of our society."
"Revelations about the abuse of children are now all too frequently the subject of media headlines."
"Some who were entrusted to be guardians of our children have shamefully betrayed that trust."
"The European Union is now engaged in a fundamental reassessment of the Treaties."
"Appropriately, today I call on the President-in-Office to indicate what he plans at EU level concerning not only the issue of child abduction but the protection of children against all forms of violence, including the sexual exploitation of children, child abuse and the misuse of technologies, such as the Internet, by paedophiles who have furthered their own discreditable actions through the new technologies."
"In addition, I ask the presidency to give a clear commitment today that, through the IGC negotiations, it will work for the inclusion of a chapter containing provisions relating to the human rights of minors, whereby they will be entitled, in the same way as any other citizen, to enjoy fully the fundamental rights and freedoms recognized by the Community - barring those restrictions, of course, laid down by law specifically where children are concerned."
"We need a crusade for children aimed at ensuring that their rights as European citizens are fully safeguarded."
"Finally, I take this opportunity to welcome my constituency colleague, Gay Mitchell, to the presidency of the Council and I wish him every success in the coming six months."
"Mr President, in the European Parliament, the room for young people and children is still, even now, equipped in only a very Spartan fashion."
"The rights of the next generation are weak, and the political realization, on the part of Member States, that the European Union should be given more powers in this field, is only growing slowly."
"I think that the Intergovernmental Conference offers us the chance to make progress here."
"One particularly sensitive area is that which concerns all forms of force used against children, and particularly the abduction of children, which we are discussing here today."
"When marriages break up, there is often considerable dispute about custody rights, and often this escalates into a power struggle between the parents."
"In binational marriages, there is an additional potential for conflict arising from differences in tradition, language, culture or even religion, and in this emotional stress situation extreme cases, in which children are actually abducted, are increasing at an ever more alarming rate."
"Back in 1991, in my report to the Committee on Youth and Culture, I pointed out this phenomenon and asked for a record of children who had disappeared, and I gave a warning about the lack of cooperation between Member States."
"In the 1993 report on measures to prevent the abduction of children, it was again proposed that there should be better coordination and use of the International Conventions of Luxembourg and The Hague."
"Since the completion of the internal market and as a result of increasing mobility, which is also linked to international migration patterns, the number of binational life-partnerships is increasing, but so are the cases of conflict."
"Mrs Banotti, as the person specially responsible for this question, has given a very graphic report on this situation."
"But now we want to see some results at last."
"We are asking the European Commission to give us information on all aspects of cross-border child abduction, and also on the measures that can be taken with regard to third countries."
"Here in Parliament, we have on several occasions put forward very specific proposals concerning various aspects, including the harmonization of procedures, facilitating the return of abducted children, support measures for selfhelp organisations, better information, and the automatic provision of mutual assistance between courts."
"As far as the people involved are concerned, they need help, and they need it now."
"We are placing great hopes on the initiative announced by the Irish presidency of the Council, which aims to set up a corresponding EUROPOL register."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Banotti."
"I shall begin be referring to the fact that this very serious problem of the abduction of children, which has got worse in Europe in recent times, is a consequence of the break-down of families which itself is a result of a worsening social situation, a moral, cultural, economic and social crisis, which has affected us all and which has not been paid the proper attention it deserves by Community authorities."
"I think this is a challenge which is facing us all and which imposes on us especially serious responsibilities."
"I should like to say, in fact, that facing this new situation, it would be very hypocritical for us to stand by and hope that problems of this type and with such impact can be dealt with by national legislation."
"It is fundamental that there should be considerable effort for convergence and extremely close cooperation in the scope of the third pillar."
"I think that this problem, which is covered by the Brussels Convention, is one way which could help in fact to give a new legal framework to safeguard the essential rights of children to prevent situations of this kind from continuing to develop, with all the tragic consequences for children's upbringing - as they suffer irreparable damage in these situations."
"It is obvious that we need a new legal framework and I also think that, in debates of this kind, we should not be prisoners of legal solutions because these problems also call for a fresh approach to economic and social questions on a European scale."
"Families have been deeply affected and it is families which are at stake as an essential kernel of a dynamic and healthy society. Therefore we must create all of the right conditions so that families stop suffering the kind of attacks that they have in recent years."
"Initiatives like Mrs Banotti's are fundamental."
"I think that we are on the right track and the Council and Commission must, on the basis of our debate, waste no more time. They must create a proper legal framework to deal with problems of this kind."
"Mr President, we have had a lot of valuable debate today on issues such as CFSP, HelmsBurton, the IGC and so on - very important issues in their own right."
"But this issue, concerning the physical, psychological and physiological safety of the Union's children must be seen by our citizens to command a priority position on the Union's agenda."
"I have practised in family law myself for a number of years and I have seen the difficulties and delays suffered by couples of mixed marriages involved in child-abduction cases."
"While the rise in the number of bi-national marriages within the Community is certainly to be welcomed - indeed they promote cultural links between Union citizens - it is very clear that this increase in bi-national marriages - and this has been mentioned by many speakers - has led to a corresponding rise in the level of child abduction within the Member States."
"For example, statistics from Ireland - the country that myself and Mr Mitchell represent - reveal a significant increase in such cases, with 70 children abducted from the state last year, and I understand that 16 of these cases have yet to be resolved."
"From my experience, the main problems stem from a lack of uniformity of laws under the two existing international conventions in this area, together with a lack of cooperation at intergovernmental level."
"On this latter point, I note that Belgium is the only Member State still to ratify the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil aspects of child abduction and I would urge it to do so immediately."
"Finally, it is clear to me that, due to wide divergence in national laws, the resolution of this type of case requires expensive, specialist, legal advice."
"While I welcome the current Commission proposals concerning consumer access to justice, I am very disappointed to see that family access to justice, which is a human right, has not yet received the same level of attention."
"So I would ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue of the harmonization of national laws on access to legal aid for all."
"I look forward to heaving from the Council."
"I just hope he is going to heed the calls from many of us."
"He has already responded in a most clear and positive way."
"I wonder whether he hopes to come back to Parliament before the end of the presidency with some clear indication that action has been taken."
"He has committed himself to that and I hope he will."
"I am particularly interested in the issue of a central registry where all children abducted - whether they are parental or criminal abductions - will be notified and action taken."
"As I mentioned in my own speech this needs to be done with great speed."
"With every day that passes it becomes more difficult to find these children."
"Mr President, I have very little add to what I said in response to the debate earlier this afternoon except to say that Mrs Ahern must have missed by speech."
"She clearly did not get the points I made earlier on."
"I should like to join with those who have thanked Mrs Banotti for the way she has pursued and raised this issue and to thank Mr Andrews for his kind words of welcome and encouragement."
"I have listened to this debate with great interest."
"I understand the sentiments and concerns expressed by those interested in this matter."
"It is an important and sensitive issue and it is one on which the Council is taking action, as I said earlier in the debate."
"I will report what I have heard here today to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Mrs Nora Owen, who is President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"I know that she will be reporting in detail to the relevant committee of this House in the coming weeks."
"I have no doubt it is one of the issues that will be raised."
"I will draw her full attention to this debate."
"I hope it is not a sexist remark to say that I was very struck by the number of women Members who contributed to this debate."
"As it happens, we have a woman Minister for Justice in Ireland who is President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and would be particularly sensitive to the issues which have been raised here."
"It would fall to her to ensure that the response of the presidency and the Irish Government will be made to the relevant European Parliament committee."
"I will certainly ensure that this is drawn to her attention."
"I do not know if the House knows that Mrs Owen is Mrs Banotti's sister and that is a happy coincidence."
"It is very useful on this occasion that the Member who is pursuing this so vigorously has the ear and direct access to the Minister."
"I have been very taken with the debate today and I will be sure, on behalf of the presidency, to make sure that what has been said here today is drawn to the Minister's attention."
"Mr Andrews raised a broader question which in turn is worthy of examination."
"I would encourage him in his endeavours to raise this matter again in the autumn."
"Proposals coming forward from Parliament in this regard would be welcomed by the presidency."
"It is an issue which for far too long we have either chosen to ignore or for one reason or another have not been aware of."
"The debate today has been a very useful and helpful one and it will inform the presidency in our approach to pursuing this issue in the Council of Ministers."
"I assure the House that the President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council will be made fully aware of the concerns of the House by me and by my department following tonight's debate."
"Mr President, I would just like to say for clarification that I wanted Council to set a timetable."
"They did say earlier that they could not do that."
"I am glad that the Minister has now given assurances that it will be dealt with speedily and perhaps in view of the exchanges that we heard just now, the relevant Minister for Justice could appear before this House to give her personal assurances on the issue before December."
"I thank Mr Mitchell for his sensitive reply."
"This House looks forward to having him with us during the Irish presidency."
"I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Customs union with Turkey"
"The next item is the report (A4-0197/96) by Mr Kittelmann, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision laying down the procedure for adopting the Community's position in the Customs Union Joint Committee set up by Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council on the implementation of the final phase of the Customs Union (COM(96)0018 - C4-0126/96-96/0020 (CNS))."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to present the Kittelmann report, and then I should like to explain the position of the Committee on External Economic Relations with regard to that report."
"On 1 January 1996, the Customs Union with Turkey came into force."
"It has now been operating for almost seven months."
"Today, Parliament is being asked to approve a Council Decision laying down the procedure for implementing the Customs Union, a decision which we should actually approve."
"This will take place in a committee known as the Customs Union Joint Committee, which was set up by Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council, on the implementation of the final phase of the Customs Union."
"It is a question of making sure that the Customs Union operates in accordance with the rules, and of guaranteeing the free movement of goods between the two partners."
"The Council is to be responsible for defining the Community's position, while the Commission is to define the Community's position on the technical provisions and on anti-competition practices, so as to be able to negotiate with our Turkish partners afterwards."
"Both the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on External Economic Relations have unanimously approved the proposal."
"I would just like to emphasize once again that the purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the Customs Union operates correctly from the point of view of trade policy."
"In doing so I should like to make it quite clear that this particular procedure has nothing directly to do with financial cooperation or with issues of a political nature, for which it is not the Joint Committee that is responsible, but the Association Council."
"What we are looking at here is a technical regulation, in other words a provision for the implementation of the Customs Union."
"As far as the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations is concerned, the committee also regards this Council Decision as a technical measure, but a measure which is necessary in order to implement the Customs Union."
"It would like, by means of its opinion, to help to make the work of the Customs Union Joint Committee as correct and as transparent as possible, and at the same time to give the European Parliament a comprehensive update on the technical aspects."
"The opinion contains two amendments proposed by me, as rapporteur."
"On Article 1, the Committee on External Economic Relations proposes that reference should be made not only to Article 113, i.e. trade policy, but also to the various other relevant statutory provisions, for example those concerning intellectual property and industrial property."
"It therefore seems to me to be necessary to propose a slightly different form of words for Article 1, laying down that a Council decision should be adopted in accordance with the procedures laid down for the adoption of internal rules for the area in question. The other amendment concerns Article 2."
"Here, a sentence should be added to the effect that the European Parliament should be kept regularly informed of the decisions taken by the Joint Committee."
"I would remind you that in all aspects of the Customs Union the European Parliament's controlling and advisory function should be guaranteed."
"Both amendments have also been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and included in Mr Kittelmann's report."
"As the draftsman of this opinion, may I therefore ask you to adopt this report, and in doing so I would deliberately emphasize the technical quality of this proposal."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I can say that the report on the Community's position in the Customs Union Joint Committee presents no special difficulties and can be supported provided the amendments are adopted."
"However, I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize that adoption of the customs union with Turkey by the European Union has been made subject to a number of political conditions relating to respect for human rights, the democratic process, the rule of law and international law and for the maintenance of good neighbourly relations and the territorial integrity of the Member States."
"In other words, if that country wishes to benefit from cooperation with Europe, it must operate within the framework of the international legal order and not outside it."
"Unfortunately, Turkey's conduct so far has been very disappointing."
"In addition to continuing with violations, it is persisting with provocative political claims against Greece and Cyprus - the one a Member State and the other a candidate for accession to the Union."
"This behaviour, which poses a threat to the peace and security of the region, must change."
"To assist towards that, the Council, in approving the MEDA programme a few days ago, issued a stern warning to the new Turkish government of Mr Erbakan."
"We await its reaction, and our action in the European Parliament and any possible initiatives will be dependent on that reaction."
"In that regard, Mr President, I think that it would be advisable for the Council and Commission to keep us informed about the progress of implementation of the customs union with Turkey, particularly now when the government of the new prime minister of Turkey has expressed reservations about the customs union, whereas previously it supported a renegotiation of the agreement."
"Mr President, Mr Kittelmann, I know that this is really more of a technical report, but nevertheless we must also look at the political background, as the previous speaker has already said."
"Last December, we, the European Parliament, took an important decision regarding the EU's relations with Turkey."
"That decision was based only partially on real changes, for example in the constitution."
"Much of it was based on promises and hopes which the European Parliament expressed at the time."
"Mrs Çiller, who was then the Turkish Prime Minister, appealed to us to support her in keeping the fundamentalists out of power."
"Yet now all that has been forgotten."
"She shares the government of the country with them, and is now Foreign Minister."
"Promises, such as respect for human rights, and the positive revision of proceedings against those members of parliament who were condemned on the basis of a very problematical law, have been forgotten."
"How will Turkish women retain their equal rights?"
"Why are people still being tortured?"
"Why do people disappear, and why are people still dying after being tortured in police stations or after being interrogated?"
"What, if anything, has changed, and what, if anything, has improved?"
"I feel that Mrs Çiller has disappointed my hopes of a Europeoriented Turkey."
"If things go on like this, I shall no longer need to worry about what basis the Joint Committee should work on, but I have to ask myself whether the money that the EU is making available might not be better invested in other countries."
"Mr President, we could agree to the changes to the Commission's text proposed in Mr Kittelmann's report, but only if we ceased to be aware of their context, i.e. the customs union with Turkey."
"In this false framework, however, such proposed technical improvements, which in practice are sensible, would not produce any better result in substance."
"I can still remember very well how seven months ago, in this house, we voted in favour of a customs union with Turkey."
"Now the Islamic fundamentalists are in government, and Mrs Çiller has helped them to get there."
"So what lessons have those who once recommended the customs union learned from the failure of their strategy?"
"It seems to me that instead of drawing certain conclusions they are now simply sticking their heads in the sand and acting as though nothing has happened."
"But this ostrich-like policy, this strategy of going ahead with our eyes firmly closed, is probably something that we shall very soon come to regret."
"There must be no preferential treatment for a state which does not even respect the most elementary fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion, and which is waging a dirty war against a section of its population, namely the Kurds."
"The European Parliament should therefore take no further steps in the wrong direction, and should forget about any decisions to push ahead with the customs union - and here I am talking only about the financial protocols - until democracy and peace have been restored in Turkey."
"I would ask all those who agreed at the time to review their decision again, and to think about the reasons for their agreement."
"Mr President, the Kittelmann report touches on legal and institutional questions."
"First of all, it expresses the desire for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights to be consulted about the legal basis."
"I deplore the fact that this did not happen. Next, the report refers to the consultation of Parliament."
"However, following the example of previous speakers, I would like to speak mainly about political aspects."
"I recall the arguments that were put forward at the time the customs union agreement was ratified."
"I personally, and the whole of my group, were opposed to that ratification for four reasons: the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish government at the time, the Cyprus situation, the human rights situation and, fourthly, the fact that Turkey, however hard it might try, could not become part of the European Union, whereas customs union was apparently perceived by many of its sponsors as a first step towards accession as such."
"There has been no fundamental change, and I regret that the majority in the House failed to stand by its initial position, which was to refuse consent to customs union."
"Today there is an Islamic government in Turkey, although we were told that by voting in favour of customs union we would prevent the Islamic faction from coming to power. The Turkish Government has adopted an aggressive posture towards two Greek islands."
"Has the situation changed, or were those who expressed their opposition to customs union right after all?"
"I could have simply read out the explanation of vote which I gave at the time."
"It ended in these words: I am not unaware of the commercial aspects of the agreement before us, but I cannot in all conscience vote in favour of it, for the reasons I have just mentioned."
"Mr President, the report - and Mr Schwaiger has emphasized this point - says that this is primarily and exclusively a technical regulation."
"Of course we should agree with that definition, and therefore I shall also give my full agreement to this decision."
"However, I did not, at the time, agree to the customs union with Turkey, and I feel that subsequent developments have more than vindicated my decision."
"I am sure that many of the people who said yes at the time must now be looking at their decision with increasing doubt and growing dissatisfaction."
"Let us just remember, it was made emphatically clear to us at the time that the conclusion of the customs union would be a crucial argument in preventing large sections of the Turkish electorate from giving the fundamentalists the majority in that country."
"And yet that politician, who at the time stated so emphatically that she wanted to halt this fundamentalist upsurge, has now formed an alliance with that party, which in spite of everything was successful in the elections."
"I do not know whether it is true, as a Turkish opposition politician has stated, that this is a joint venture, the main purpose of which is to prevent the surprising wealth of both party leaders from being investigated by parliament."
"One thing, however, is clear: what is being done is to make possible all those things that we were told, before the election, were going to be prevented."
"We have already been told how many promises Turkey has failed to keep, and it is now time that we asked ourselves seriously whether the present government really wants to take Turkey along the path to Europe."
"Mr President, the customs union with Turkey is a reality."
"And I can only agree with the previous speaker in saying that I am already experiencing a certain amount of disappointment, when I hear that the current prime minister, an Islamic fundamentalist, believes that he no longer needs this customs union, this agreement with the European Union."
"I therefore believe that, in addition to the technical adjustment that the present decision is concerned with, we should ask ourselves what the customs union with Turkey has actually achieved, in economic terms, in the last ten months."
"I believe that in setting up this customs union we have failed to grasp the problem of increasing unemployment in Turkey."
"I also believe that this customs union as a whole has helped only a part of industry and a part of the economy, but has not, to a large extent, helped the entire national economy of Turkey."
"The technical adjustment that we are dealing with today must therefore be examined from this angle, and we shall have to see whether this amendment, this technical adjustment, and the continued operation of this customs union with Turkey, will really ensure prosperity and freedom in that country."
"Mr President, the resolution before us relates to the technical realization of the customs union which has been concluded with Turkey."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs has decided to support this proposal while at the same time putting forward two amendments, one of which relates to Parliament's right to be informed of the decisions of the Joint Committee."
"Although the decision at issue here relates only to the technical aspects of the customs union, it is appropriate in this connection to state our well-founded concern at the human rights situation in Turkey."
"It is unfortunate that the progress which the Turkish authorities hoped to demonstrate at the time of the heated debate in connection with the adoption of the customs union, has proved short-lived."
"The news which we have received concerning prisoners in Turkey is disturbing."
"However, in the debate on the situation in Turkey it needs to be stated plainly that the outside world must respect every country's election results and a religious trend must not in itself be a ground for disapproval."
"At the same time, I cannot approve of terrorist acts in any form."
"However, we must state clearly that continuing human rights violations give reason to think seriously again about our cooperation with Turkey."
"It is impossible to work together if one side continually takes an indifferent attitude to the conditions for cooperation."
"Mr President, in his report Mr Kittelmann proposes two amendments which the Commission cannot, however, approve."
"The reasons are these: regarding the first amendment, we must remember that the Joint Committee on the customs union is purely technical and commercial in nature."
"It monitors compliance with the free movement of goods in the area of the customs union and ensures in particular that Turkish legislation is constantly harmonized with Community legislation in those areas relating directly to the activity of the customs union."
"The Joint Committee can make its recommendations to the Association Council, which makes the necessary decisions while observing the procedures in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"The powers of the Joint Committee fall within the scope of Article 113."
"Therefore, in confirming the common position of the customs union in the Joint Committee, the Council does so by qualified majority."
"In its second amendment, Parliament asks to be given information on the decisions of the Joint Committee."
"It should be noted that Parliament is already given information."
"When the Commission sends the Council a proposal for a common position, this is also sent to the European Parliament for information."
"The same procedure is followed in cases in which proposals for a common position are discussed in the Joint Committee."
"It should also be stated that the recommendations of the Joint Committee approved by the Association Council are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Draft supplementary and amending budget No 1 for 1996"
"The next item is the report (A4-0245/96) by Mr Elles and Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft supplementary and amending budget No 1 for the 1996 financial year."
"Mr President, can I thank both rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Miranda, for the reports they have put in front of us."
"Can I especially thank Mr Miranda for being here."
"I want to talk to the general budget rather than Parliament's budget."
"Three things are worth mentioning when we look at the figures within that budget."
"It will be remembered, certainly in my mind, for three areas."
"We could actually call it the UK rebate budget; the UK gets its rebate of about ECU 2.8 billion, but this has been corrected downwards."
"Within that rebate was hope of a payment from the social lines B3-4004 and B3-4003."
"Thankfully, a touch of genius from our colleagues in the Social Affairs Committee has meant that the Budgets Committee amendment that will be put forward will ensure that the people who those lines are aimed at are not disadvantaged."
"The Commission did their best to make sure that they were not disadvantaged but the tactic that has been adopted by Parliament is to be commended."
"Even though the UK will get its rebate, and quite rightly so, those lines will not contribute towards that."
"Secondly, we can say that it is the 'mad cow' supplementary and amending budget."
"The fact is that ECU 1.2 billion will be reallocated within Category 1 because of the effects of the mad cow disease."
"That is a lot of money, which in one sense, could have gone back to the Member States."
"In another sense, if the Commission had succeeded in what it was trying to do, it could have been reallocated to trans-European networks, to research and development and to small and medium enterprises."
"That was not to be and therefore we have a supplementary and amending budget where we see a figure of ECU 1.2 billion being reallocated because of mad cow disease."
"The third aspect of this particular budget is that it could be called the Member States jackpot budget because the Member States really have landed lucky."
"When we look at the carry-overs from 1995, we have something like ECU 9.2 billion of unused resources in 1995, now being carried over into 1996, which means that when Member States have to pay their own resources there will be ECU 9.2 billion less that they have to pay for this year's budget."
"This sounds fine and I am sure the Member States will welcome that."
"The tragedy is, certainly in one area, that we find that the structural funds are underspent in 1995 by ECU 4.4 billion."
"Whilst it might be the Member States jackpot budget it is not something we should be celebrating when we look at the structural funds."
"Mr President, this supplementary and amending budget was born under the star of the decision on own resources, which has now finally been ratified, and we have ECU 81.94 billion at our disposal in the 1996 budget."
"At the same time we have a balance of ECU 9.21 billion left over from the previous year."
"This money either does not need to be paid by the Member States, or else it goes back to them."
"However, that is still more than 10 % of the present year's budget."
"If we had not had BSE and a number of corrections in individual categories, for example those that were made necessary by enlargement or by the newly created Ombudsman's Office, then the figure would have been far more than 10 %."
"Now it is not Parliament that is responsible for this fact."
"Surely it is mad to commit resources to the agricultural sector and the structural funds, and then not use them, whilst in sectors which are important for the future of Europe, and which require close cooperation between undertakings within the region and the citizens of Europe, both the Commission and the Council are being stingy."
"And this is particularly true in Categories 3 and 4."
"The Commission and the Council must ask themselves the following question, ""Can't you do any better, or is it just that you don't want to?'"
"As far as the 1997 budget is concerned, there are signs that it is indeed a question of not wanting to. Our group will be approving the supplementary and amending budget, and it emphasizes that in so doing it is also expressing its solidarity with those affected by BSE and its consequences."
"One of the main points of interest to our group is also the supervision and control of expenditure on projects under the MEDA, PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"However, the Commission should know that we would not fall in with its proposals if it were to use the room to manoeuvre, provided by us, in order to re-introduce mini-budgets."
"The administration of the European Parliament should also know that decisions by the Committee on Budgets and the European Parliament - and I am referring here to the Miranda report - are law, and should not be open to interpretation."
"Our group will be approving this supplementary and amending budget."
"Mr President, at the time of the vote on the original budget for 1996, my group could only protest against a draft budget that was irresponsible because it was constantly increasing."
"For the same reasons, we cannot support the supplementary and amending budget which is now before us."
"Let me cite just three examples."
"First, the use of this supplementary and amending budget to distribute, in the first instance, an additional ECU 31 million, adopted by Parliament, to reduce the extent of property investment."
"This end-of-year bonus sanctions a ruinous property policy (ECU 217, 900 million for 1997), which is still being pursued on the sly through year-end transfers and supplementary and amending budgets."
"This approach is intolerable for Europe's tax payers, and anything but a credit to Parliament."
"A second example: the report envisages, as we previously complained at the time of the discussion of Parliament's draft estimate, giving the Ombudsman - yet another supplementary institution created by the Maastricht Treaty - three additional jobs, although negotiations on this matter with the Council and the Commission have barely begun."
"Finally, my third and last example illustrates the principle - endorsed by this House - of a continuous and continuing increase in the Community budget at a time when the governments of all our countries are struggling to reduce public spending."
"We note that more than ECU 9, 215 million out of the 1996 budget has not been spent: it is high time to stop this spending spiral and pay more attention to existing and underused resources."
"A word, too, about the Brinkhorst report - somewhat previous, but I hope you will forgive me - to deplore the rapporteur's intention to reduce the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditures."
"Mr President, you seem to be trying to tell me that my time is up. So I shall leave it to other Members of my group to say what they think about this second report."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur for his report and make a comment on the general budget, focusing on the specific aspect of social dialogue, to which my colleague, Mr Wynn, has already referred."
"As the Commissioner well knows, the UK's opting out of the social protocol has this year already blocked execution of the budget line concerning transnational meetings of workers' and employers' representatives; as in the case of the preliminary draft budget for 1997, the executive committee is therefore proposing to divide the line in the amending budget, with the specific intention of distinguishing meetings involving representatives of fourteen Member States from those involving representatives of all fifteen Member States."
"But the European Parliament cannot accept this approach, for various reasons."
"On the operational level, it would be extremely difficult to manage and the social partners have already pointed this out."
"Furthermore, by introducing into the budget the possibility of 'made-to-measure' funding based on the interests of the various Member States, it represents a dangerous challenge to the principle of solidarity of the Union."
"The Committee on Budgets is, therefore, asking Parliament, which will tomorrow be voting on the amending budget, to adopt an amendment that avoids these problems and most importantly makes it possible to use the available funds."
"There are already plans for meetings of workers' and employers' representatives, which are simply waiting for the go-ahead from the competent Directorate-General of the executive Commission."
"It would, therefore, be absurd for the Union not to be able to allow this."
"Certainly, we attach considerable importance to social dialogue, but we must also demonstrate that in our choices concerning budget management; I believe that this amendment will enable us to do that."
"Mr President, I have to tell you the bad news that I am also deputizing for the author of the report, Mr Elles, who is supposed to be introducing the joint Elles-Miranda report."
"Since Mr Elles cannot be present, he has asked me, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, to introduce his report, but the debate on that report had already started before I was able to reach the building."
"I should therefore like, before I go on to give my comments as a representative of the Socialist Group, to make three comments on behalf of Mr Elles."
"You have seen how good the cooperation is between the Christian Democrats, the Socialists and all the others in this Committee on Budgets."
"The first comment is that I should point out that this budget makes a spectacular repayment, which might have been even bigger if we had not had to take BSE into account."
"Therefore all the balance sheets and calculations that are being drawn up in the Member States on the subject of the net-payer function will now have to be scrapped."
"Because with this repayment, which amounts to more than ECU 9 billion, my country alone will receive 28 % net paid back into its national budget, or 28.2 % to be precise."
"And this applies to all the other Member States as well."
"Therefore the balance sheet will not be correct until these repayments, which are not one-offs, but will also play a role in future years if spending develops as anticipated, are taken into account, and a balance sheet is drawn up on the basis of this repayment."
"Secondly, I should point out that the rapporteur is very anxious to expressly draw attention to the fact that, following the Council's decision on the MEDA, TACIS and PHARE programmes, to delete the expanded comments which were intended to make it possible to evaluate the projects being carried out in these countries, we disapproved of this deletion of the comments and therefore the rapporteur has proposed that they be reinstated."
"Therefore - and I shall explain this tomorrow before the vote takes place - there is a mistake in the motions that we adopted on Monday, namely an expression in brackets, in which the headquarters is named."
"This was not intended, but we shall correct the mistake early tomorrow in the various language versions."
"Thirdly, I am to point out that the apportionment of resources between 14 or 15 Member States - as Mrs Ghilardotti has just explained - is not in line with this House and with the ideas of this House."
"We have therefore thrown the ball back to the Commission, by drafting two budget lines, one for the 14 Member States with a p.m. and one for the 15 Member States with the total figure in the column."
"We have amended the comments accordingly."
"However, I would like to make one thing clear. We could have made things so difficult for the Commission that it would have had to ask us if it thought it should have entered a figure in the p.m. column."
"Then we would simply have put the p.m. column into another chapter, and then there would have had to be a transfer from chapter to chapter, with the corresponding transfer of resources by us."
"We did not want to go that far - we trust the Commission."
"And therefore we put the p.m. column in the same chapter."
"But we expect that the Commission is very much in line with the new comments, which no longer make any reference to the Directive on joint works committees, or to the Euro-Works Commission, but make it clear that we carried out this activity at a time when there was neither a social protocol nor a Directive on Euro-Works Committees."
"We therefore expect that this will be taken into consideration for the 15 Member States in the corresponding column."
"Now, as speaker on behalf of the Socialist Group, let me just make a comment on the accusation levelled against the Socialist Group by Mrs Müller."
"Mrs Müller, I should like to say to you quite clearly, that we are now standing, in fact, at a critical point in the development of the Community's spending policy."
"And it is just resorting to cheap polemics to try to give the impression that the great Group of Socialists in this House is of the opinion that we should not support the proceedings before the Hague Tribunal."
"The Hague Tribunal is an organ of intergovernmental cooperation."
"It is run by those who are responsible for the intergovernmental financing of this undertaking."
"We in this House - and that includes your group, Mrs Müller - have always emphasized the fact that we only participate in matters in which we as the Community have decision-making powers."
"And this is the difference between, for example, financing projects via Echo for the UNHCR, where we have the final say as to whether we are prepared to make these funds available, and a case like the present one, in which, if we leave the door open for the financing of intergovernmental organizations where we would be making our contribution in the form of a blank cheque, in which case we would be doing precisely what we are constantly accusing the Council of doing, and what has now proposed again as a transfer of resources, in which the OSCE is to be given a subsidy of 3 million, without the competent staff of the Commission having to change anything, except for the handing over of the cheque."
"Yet this cannot be the purpose of our work."
"Therefore we have said that we are against this amendment, not because we do not want to support the work, but because we do not want to open this door any further."
"I will immediately support you if, in your amendment, you demand that we should invite the Member States of the European Union to make the necessary resources available intergovernmentally, so that the Hague Tribunal can carry out its work properly."
"I believe that this is an invitation that the whole House - or my group at any rate - will support."
"Mr President, as previous speakers have pointed out, by means of this proposed supplementary and amending budget we shall, as it were, be paying back to the Member States over ECU 9 billion."
"Since we, as the elected representatives of these Member States, know all about the budgetary problems that all our governments are having to cope with - amongst other things in order to meet the much-quoted Maastricht criteria - I welcome this enormous sum which we are in fact making available to our countries."
"By so doing we are also clearly demonstrating the fact that there is no such thing as a Brussels operating quite separately, but that we can, and will, bring about the construction of Europe only on the basis of our Member States and only with those States."
"I should also like to emphasize the fact that we, the European Parliament, are trying to bring this about as quickly as possible, inasmuch as we have made it clear that we do not need a second reading in order to adopt this supplementary budget."
"I hope that the Council, as the representative of our Member States, will give a correspondingly positive response to this signal."
"What strikes me, however, when I read the Elles-Miranda report, is the listing of the resources not used in 1995, according to the various budget categories."
"When I read, for example, that over 15 % of Categories 3 and 4 was not spent last year, then I ask myself whether the Commission is unwilling to carry out the wishes of the budgetary authority, or incapable of doing so."
"I hope that on this point the Commission will be able to give us a satisfactory explanation during the current consultations on the forthcoming 1997 budget."
"Mr President, I will be brief and just give a few elements of the supplementary and amending budget for 1996."
"First, this supplementary and amending budget for 1996 will finally implement a new own-resource decision which goes back to the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992."
"With the new decision, burden sharing among the Member States is fairer and the Union now has a significant margin of resources to finance its current obligations and quite a few future ones as well."
"It has been a very slow process, and without pressure from the European Parliament we might still be waiting."
"But the slow ratification process also shows that it becomes more and more difficult to convince national parliaments of the additional financial needs of the Community."
"This experience underlines the importance of using the resources which the Community now has available as rigorously and productively as possible."
"Secondly, the SAB makes it possible to budgetize significant reductions in the estimated needs for a number of agricultural sectors."
"These reduced needs have so far made it possible to finance the meat measures which were decided to address the BSE crisis while respecting the agricultural guidelines."
"Further, with the SAB, the Community also fulfils its obligations under the Treaty of Maastricht - whatever we think of this part of the Social Protocol - to provide a mechanism permitting the financing of actions based on the Social Protocol by those Member States signatory to it."
"As long as the United Kingdom is not a participant these measures have to be taken over by the other Member States."
"Finally, the additional budgetary commitments for PHARE, TACIS and MEDA will improve transparency and permit improvement in the quality of execution of these programmes as well as their control."
"Experience will show whether the formulations to be adopted will correspond in all respects to these objectives."
"If problems remain we must come back to this in future budgets."
"The Commission will also support the budgetary authority in its review of ECHO operations in order to assess the effectiveness of the existing monitoring procedures as requested in your resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"1997 budgetary procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0246/96) by Mr Brinkhorst, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 'ad hoc procedure' for the 1997 budget provided for in Annex II on interinstitutional collaboration in the budgetary sector to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 29 October 1993 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure."
"Mr President, I refer to paragraph 11 of the motion for a resolution of the Brinkhorst report."
"While the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development certainly considers it necessary to review some of the Commission's forecasts, we will comment on the draft budget after 25 July, when it is published."
"The Committee on Agriculture has not discussed the actual draft budget and, therefore, cannot concur with the figures in Annex II."
"However, we agree that there ought to be a reserve and monies from lower forecasts be put in this reserve with any money which becomes available from wherever we can get it."
"Any surplus money in a reserve should be reallocated to aspects of rural economy by Members of the European Parliament."
"I congratulate Mr Brinkhorst for his efforts to include all interests in his decisions and I feel we have developed areas where agriculture interests and budget interests can combine to negotiate with the Commission and with the Council when they attend."
"He has improved procedures."
"We should thank him."
"Mr President, no-one should underestimate the importance of this report, because when Parliament votes on it tomorrow, we may well kill the idea that it is just the budget mafia that comes forward with these proposals - it will be Parliament that gives its backing to what Mr Brinkhorst has put forward."
"The Council of Ministers may well have thought that this issue was dead and buried last December when the Court of Justice made its ruling."
"Whilst Parliament did not win its case, it did not necessarily lose it, because what the Court of Justice said was that Parliament and the Council together have to reach an agreement on what is and what is not compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure within category 1."
"Unfortunately, the Council has just ignored that ruling and has gone on its own sweet way and that means that it has ignored the ad hoc procedure."
"What Mr Brinkhorst is now proposing is something which, in effect, says: look, Council, we are serious about this issue and unless you begin to take the ad hoc procedure seriously we are going to have major problems again, as we had with the 1995 budget."
"Do not take them as veiled threats: they are actual threats, because we need a resolution to this."
"I hope we will get a reserve, as proposed, and will be able to allocate that reserve from the resources within category 1 and that we will get cooperation with meaningful discussions with the Council when we are doing this."
"But the Council has to realize that this is a genuine fight on behalf of Parliament - a fight for what we believe to be right."
"What is right is that not all expenditure in category 1 is necessarily compulsory expenditure."
"We have to bear in mind that expenditure which is non-compulsory has a direct effect on the maximum rate of increase, which has a direct effect on other areas of all our policies."
"This report will be voted on tomorrow."
"I am sure it will be successful."
"Once we have that backing from Parliament, I hope the Council will take note of that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament, at the initiative of its general rapporteur, has thus instituted the ad hoc procedure, on which we are now being asked to pronounce, since we indicated our disagreement with the Council on the preliminary draft budget for 1997."
"The main argument put forward by the rapporteur, our colleague Laurens Brinkhorst, is based on the substantial volume of unused appropriations in the compulsory expenditure sector which lead him, through the device of a global appropriation reserve intended exclusively for agriculture, to foresee even today that the price situation in 1997 could be as favourable as in 1995 and that, consequently, the possibility exists of accepting immediately that, since some of the appropriations are of no use, these could be transferred to a special, single reserve from which funds could be drawn in due course."
"I am bound to say that I am impressed by the way in which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has gone along with this brilliant reasoning, to the point of having accepted the establishment of this reserve."
"Even so, I would like someone to tell me how appropriations, which cannot be carried forward, can be placed in reserve, since the financial rules of our institutions forbid it."
"It might be as well to recall from time to time a few fundamental budgetary rules, such as the yearly-review rule, which will not be observed."
"This House does in fact have a degree of latitude with regard to non-compulsory expenditure, although it has none with regard to compulsory expenditure, which of course includes agricultural expenditure."
"I hope that in plenary session tomorrow, at voting time, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will get a grip on themselves and see how seriously they have been misled."
"As far as our group is concerned, we have no intention of accepting the idea that this reserve is possible on the grounds that part of the EAGGF guarantee would not be compulsory."
"We are therefore firmly opposed to the setting-up of a general reserve, the legal bases of which seem to us to be highly dubious."
"I would now like to consider the question of the 1997 budget perspectives as a whole, because I believe this is the crux of the debate."
"Next year is a crucial year for all the fifteen nations that constitute the European Union. Because it is upon that budget year that the definitive arrangements for certain States to move forward to the single currency will be based."
"Each nation has therefore embarked upon an extremely rigorous budgetary policy, and it is hard to conceive that the union's budget - which is exclusively fuelled by money raised from the tax payers in the Member States - can be significantly increased at a time when the national governments will be unable to look any further than just doing the best they can."
"In recent years, the strategy of placement in reserve has become the guiding principle of the Committee on Budgets, by hunting down wrongly estimated appropriations and underutilization."
"This praiseworthy effort now reaches its apotheosis in the Council's intention of reducing appropriations because there is no point, at a time of restrictions, in retaining obvious overestimates in a budget."
"This is an illustration of the principle of the punishment fitting the crime."
"In conclusion, let me make one final observation."
"The Edinburgh decision of December 1992 gave our Parliament a power of codecision which is valuable in principle though difficult to implement."
"I would like to caution the general rapporteur about his responsibility in the conduct of affairs during this year."
"The pass that we have to negotiate is littered with pitfalls."
"Our group, naturally, as you will have realized, is going to reject his report."
"Let him draw the appropriate conclusions and, in particular, let him understand that a period of crisis is no time to launch a vigorous attack on the foundations of the structure."
"As we see it, the common agricultural policy is one of those foundations."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I am extremely critical of this report."
"I should also like to emphasise straight away that if the vote which was taken in the committee is repeated in the Plenary and if the vote which we held in the Plenary is repeated in the vote on the 1997 budget there is no way that we shall have a budget."
"I would draw attention to this aspect and the need for greater consensus on this matter. What is at stake with the Brinkhorst report is not only the important question of classifying expenditure or the question of our positive influence on the management of agricultural spending."
"What is at stake is a matter of far greater importance, ranging from enlargement to the question of EMU, from structural funds to economic and social cohesion - that is what is at stake in this report and it is necessary for us to deal with this question clearly."
"The first question which arises is this one: How is it possible for us, without any transparency, to discuss issues of this importance by means of an ad hoc process."
"Of course, I cannot accept this situation."
"This is obviously the wrong way to do things and obviously I cannot accept it."
"But more than this: the very substance of the report."
"By this I mean that this is the first time I have had to face such a question in ten years of activity at the European Parliament."
"The central question of this report is not set out in the resolution but is put into the appendix, where of course it is placed as an indicative question."
"This I find unacceptable! I cannot accept that the substantial question of this report is in the appendix and put as a mere indicative question."
"I think that this is a total perversion and this has never happened before as far as I can remember in the ten years in which I have been a Member of this Parliament."
"I, therefore, think that the whole process has been contaminated by a lack of transparency and was bound to go off the rails as I suggested in the committee, in particular, now that we know the intentions of the Council following this report, the only correct position for us to take would be to stop even looking at this report and not go down this dead-end, which only covers up the fundamental fact which is at stake at the moment."
"Not even the rapporteur himself had the courage to speak openly about what is really at stake in relation to this report."
"Dear Mr Brinkhorst, it is not true that, for example, two new budgetary lines were created for enlargement. What are the intentions lying behind this attitude?"
"It is so that by means of an ad hoc process what has to be discussed in another way has already been politically conditioned when instead we should be having a much more serious and rather more transparent debate on the same subject."
"Obviously, this means we are going to oppose this report."
"We are going to oppose it because of its implications as I have already said and, in particular, the reactions to it from the Council in particular the intention to reduce the structural funds by one billion ECU, something which we are not going to accept and something which actually stems from this report."
"This is something which has to be said!"
"We cannot accept the withdrawal of one billion ECU in this underhand way. This is the issue and we are calling into question this lack of transparency and we think that the whole matter calls for a re-think."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one should be under any illusion about the rapporteur's intentions: not the Commission, unless it is involved in a conspiracy or, better still, on the lookout for a few budget economies that can be paid for by the Member States, but since it says so, we shall draw the obvious conclusion; not the Council which, in its great wisdom, will reject the rapporteur's arguments; and not Parliament, the honourable elected defender of the European Union's agriculture interests, great though the temptation may be to transfer a few compulsory agricultural appropriations to other sectors that are more politically productive and so prepare the actors of the future, quite legally, for their integration."
"That leaves us with the deliberate intent and the Machiavellian determination of the rapporteur, who is trying, with a great deal of literary and mathematical subtlety, to prove that some of the EAGGF Guarantee expenditures are not compulsory expenditures, so that innovation is appropriate."
"Taking as his starting point a fact which is nothing particularly unusual in the context of agricultural production and prices, the rapporteur demonstrates that regular overestimates of the order of 10 % take place at the end of each financial year, and that it is therefore not desirable to retain such a large safety margin for the purposes of administration."
"Hence the opening of new budget lines, where the objective is nothing other than to create a logic of non-compulsory expenditure in the EAGGF Guarantee spending block."
"Hence the deletion of the BSE temporary reserve, at a time when the financial consequences are known: a really bad bit of timing."
"And hence, too, the creation of a general reserve, the obvious sign of a first step towards a transition to the status of non-compulsory expenditure."
"All this, ladies and gentlemen, is of dubious objectivity, its purpose being nothing but enabling the European union to establish, at the expense of the Member States, a healthy kitty to be used for purposes other than agriculture."
"We cannot accept this, and that is why we shall be rejecting the rapporteur's suggestions."
"Mr President, the Brinkhorst report stubbornly continues along the line adopted by the majority in the Committee on Budgets: proposing economies or the establishment of reserves in areas where the Treaties give Parliament no jurisdiction and, by contrast, proposing additional expenditures in sectors where Parliament does have jurisdiction."
"Thus, while the Maastricht criteria compel the Member States to pursue rigorous budgetary policies, the European Parliament is heading off in the direction of ever-increasing expenditure."
"Because agricultural expenditure, where 95 % of the appropriations were used up in 1995, is not the only area in which major economies could be achieved."
"If there is a need to seek out and find potential economies, the place to look is among the structural activities, where only 81 % of the appropriations were used; in internal policies, which are generally contrary to the principle of subsidiarity and where only 85 % of appropriations were used; and in external schemes, often delegated without control to NGOs, experts and private firms, where only 82 % of the appropriations were used."
"So, instead of indulging in legal squabbles with the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament would do better to defend the tax payer by suggesting realistic economies in areas where it has jurisdiction - non-compulsory expenditure."
"There are plenty of promising avenues to pursue there: savings on the countless micro-subsidies; savings on the expenditure on expert reports, congresses, expenditure scattered over more than one hundred budget lines; better arithmetic in awarding the structural fund appropriations; reconsideration of the value of certain internal policies which, once again, are contrary to the principle of subsidiarity; and finally, better control of external schemes."
"In other words, our Parliament can fulfil its function as a defender of the tax payer, but only by taking action in areas where it has jurisdiction, and not in areas where its jurisdiction is limited by the Treaties."
"Mr President, Mr Sonneveld should have been speaking now, but unfortunately he is unable to be here and has asked me to give his speech for him."
"So if I appear to know a lot about agriculture the credit is Mr Sonneveld's and not mine."
"Under the interinstitutional agreement July is the time when we must debate the 1997 draft budget, when the institutions responsible must look at compulsory expenditure."
"The judgment of the Court of Justice confirmed that both arms of the budgetary authority must, on this occasion in particular and on the basis of their powers, deliberate and reach agreement on compulsory expenditure."
"This year Parliament has prepared more carefully than ever before for this ad hoc procedure. This is thanks to the determined and laudable work of the rapporteur, Mr Brinkhorst - and I am anxious to say that this evening because he has been the target of a lot of criticism - who undertook to bring about a consensus between the Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Budgets."
"Rapporteur Elles initiated this procedure during the 1996 budget debate."
"This year the procedure has worked fully for the first time."
"The big question is whether the other arm of the budgetary authority will take the same notice of the Court of Justice's judgment."
"Parliament has said what it wants, namely a more up-t-date estimate of compulsory expenditure, to be reached in close cooperation with the Commission."
"On the basis of that a reserve of 556 million ECU has been agreed, available for programmes for the development of agricultural markets and support for rural development."
"It should be borne in mind that it is still difficult to estimate a large proportion of compulsory expenditure."
"And certain savings, on export refunds for example, will certainly not improve the lot of farmers in the European Union."
"Anything but; the cutting of export refunds for cheese will cause cheese prices in the Union to fall and put greater pressure on the dairy industry."
"So diversification remains a permanent imperative."
"It is thus necessary for all the different elements of agriculture policy to be integrated."
"My Group would like to see important instruments of agricultural and rural policy from the other budget categories also regarded under category 1."
"Ultimately European policy on rural development will have to apply to the 15 current Member States and later to the new members."
"That requires a creative approach."
"This is the essence of the position agreed jointly by the Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Budgets."
"I fear that the Council is thinking along totally different lines, namely a sizeable curtailment of the farm budget."
"This would be a singular move which would not help the development of agriculture."
"It would be even more remarkable to see a number of French Members siding with the Council and thus depriving agriculture of even more money than the Commission is proposing."
"If that does not happen spending will fall short of the ceiling for agriculture."
"The European Parliament's Agriculture Committee will then be swift to come up with initiatives for rural development and market developments during the budget negotiations in October."
"Mr President, Parliament seems to be willing to help Member States to pass the EMU test at the beginning of 1998 by accepting cuts in the budget for 1997."
"General rapporteur Brinkhorst has introduced a number of new elements in his coverage of the subject: a more effective ad hoc procedure, early involvement of the committees and the concentration of all agricultural activities in category 1."
"But I do not feel the same enthusiasm for his efforts to make savings by reducing compulsory expenditure and putting part of those savings into the reserve."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the sizeable surpluses there have been in the budget on several occasions suggest that these appropriations need critical scrutiny."
"But it would have been reasonable to expect that we would be told exactly what caused these surpluses."
"A reserve might then be used to absorb effects such as changes in the market situation or exchange rate fluctuations."
"But there is nothing about this."
"More important than this question is the question of whether it is in fact possible to make savings in this way."
"The expenditure in this category is after all compulsory and I find nothing in the reports about inappropriate spending."
"Surpluses are now being given back to the Member States, but the Brinkhorst report wants all appropriations for the reserve spent under heading I. This makes the reserve a fixed element of the budget which may perhaps be used to fund less vital activities."
"So there is no saving here."
"There is a considerable risk that the Council will use this fixed element as an excuse for immediate cuts in the budget."
"Lastly I object to the idea that appropriations in the reserve can only be released after Parliament has been consulted."
"Last year the Court ruled against the European Parliament on the matter of compulsory and noncompulsory expenditure."
"Manifestly Parliament is now seeking compensation for that defeat by arrogating new powers to itself via the budgetary reserve."
"I cannot condone that tactic."
"Mr President, maybe I am wrong but I have the impression that we are discussing this important issue without a representative from the Council."
"Is this true?"
"If so, I think this is lamentable and lament it."
"Mr President, our group supports the Brinkhorst report, as Mr Pronk has already said."
"We consider it to be sensible."
"We know that in agriculture things are not so predictable as in other areas."
"For many years it has emerged that the Commission has always grossly overestimated requirements."
"It is therefore sensible, if we are making another proposal regarding the uncertainties that continue to exist, to set aside an appropriate reserve."
"That is a precautionary measure and at the same time it is a realistic measure, because the figures that are used here have not simply been plucked out of the air."
"I find that Mr Giansily's complaint about the Committee on Agriculture misses the point, because as long as something is put into the reserve, then we have a guarantee that, if expenditure is increased - and this could certainly be a risk in the wake of BSE, and in fact is highly probable - then we shall still have funds available."
"In the case of a general reduction, however, such as the one being considered by the Council, this is no longer possible."
"Therefore this is a sensible procedure, which we go along with, and therefore we support this report."
"Mr President, last year, Mr Wynn, the rapporteur on the budget, tried to convert compulsory expenditure into non-compulsory expenditure."
"I personally was opposed to it. The Council had to appeal to the Court in Luxembourg."
"This year, in practice, we are facing the same situation."
"The tactics have changed, that is all."
"The arguments are different, but the objective is the same."
"I am firmly opposed to this reserve, quite simply because the calculations carried out by the rapporteur in the preparatory documents drawn up are, to a large extent, highly random in nature."
"After all, can he tell me, for example, what the size of next season's wine harvest will be?"
"The wine growers themselves cannot yet answer that question."
"Does he know, for example, that for two years there has been virtually no compulsory distillation because of the drought that occurred in Spain and Italy?"
"Another example: does he know what the world cereal prices are going to be next year?"
"If he does, all the world's traders would be glad to know."
"Does he know, for example, that since December 1995 there has been a tax on cereal exports, which now amounts to ECU 45 per metric ton?"
"These exceptional revenues are the result of very high prices. Forecasts are impossible, therefore."
"All this is unrealistic."
"Our rapporteur should know that the first thing a farmer does, every day, is to see what the weather is like, because agriculture is one of those rare activities that depend on the vagaries of the climate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"Guarantee to EIB for loans"
"The next item is the report (A4-0205/96) by Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects of mutual interest in Latin American and Asian countries with which the Community has concluded cooperation agreements (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay and Venezuela;"
"Bangladesh, Brunei, China, India, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam) (COM(95)0742 - C4-0100/96-96/0015(CNS))."
"Mr President, as you said this report concerns a communication from the Commission and a proposal for a Council decision on the renewal of the Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects of mutual interest in Latin America and Asian countries."
"The current lending programme which was agreed on 15 February 1993 amounted to a maximum of ECU 250m and had a duration of three years and expired in February 1996."
"At various meetings of Heads of State and Government - at Corfu, Essen and Cannes - the European Council expressed its support for a continuation of these programmes."
"The lending in Latin America and Asia has been successful."
"It is an area where there is economic growth, where it has been strong and where it is expected to strengthen."
"In those circumstances, the bankers had no difficulty in reaching the annual ceiling of ECU 250m and could have executed loans to a much higher level than that."
"The demand was sufficiently strong."
"The projects have been successful and it is against that background that we have today the report on the proposal for a renewed loan and a new guarantee arrangement."
"The present Commission proposal calls for a continuation of lending."
"It is under the usual terms and conditions of the first mandate."
"But the loans signed through the Guarantee Fund will grant a guarantee in respect of 100 % of all loans signed but they will remain within a ceiling of ECU 410m over an indicative period of one year, the one year presumed to be beginning from February 1996, the point at which the previous arrangements expired."
"Concerning the amount of ECU 410m, the Committee on Budgets generally welcomes this increase in the loan activities in the Asian and Latin American countries, particularly against the background that I have already described where the demand for loans has already exceeded the available funds and major cooperation agreements have been concluded."
"There are, however, quite clearly a couple of problems."
"The Commission and the Committee on Budgets are equally well apprised of the problems, and in five minutes it would be expecting too much for us describe fully the difficulties the proposals - as they are formulated - present for the Guarantee Fund."
"Suffice it to say that in the explanatory memorandum of my report paragraphs 8 through to 12 adequately describe the difficulties there are in relation to the Guarantee Fund, though some of those difficulties may well be capable of being resolved in the light of the report that has recently become available."
"This report has not taken into account a report that had been requested by the Council and just become available on the basis of a study undertaken by the Commission."
"However, the present position is that there is the major problem about the suggestion in Article 1 of the proposal that the loans granted by the Bank, if they have not attained the overall amount referred to in the one-year period, could automatically be extended by six months."
"We think this is superfluous because there has never been a shortage of demand for the available funds and so we do not want that hypothesis actually contained within the proposal for a decision."
"That is reflected in the amendments which I turn to briefly."
"Just before doing so I would express my thanks to both the Committee on External Economic Relations and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their opinions."
"The REX Committee opinion is very clearly reflected in the amendments - this is invaluable advice."
"There are now six amendments tabled to the report."
"Five are tabled by the committee and reflect the advice of the REX Committee."
"However, I am not commending the sixth amendment to the House and I want to say just a few words about it."
"The amendment expresses a worthy sentiment, and for the sake of clarity I shall read it: ' This guarantee may only be granted subject to respect for the principles and decisions relating to human rights and compliance with the obligations entered into under international law' ."
"But that is both a very subjective and highly political condition and to put it as something that the European Investment Bank should have to form a judgment on is, in our opinion, an obligation being placed on the Bank that is outside its competence."
"It is a political decision, not a banking decision."
"So, although it expresses a worthy sentiment, the recommendation of the rapporteur will be to oppose Amendment No 6."
"With those brief remarks, I commend the report to the House and look forward to the debate."
"Mr President, we support Mr Tomlinson's report."
"We must admit that this is only a temporary solution, and the rapporteur is right to point out that it is questionable, and indeed to be doubted, whether the European Investment Bank will in any case be in a position to make this loan available within the pre-set time-limit."
"He also indicates, in points 12 and 13, that in November 1995 the Council had already asked the EIB - and also the Commission - to set up a study regarding a new guarantee system, and in doing so to take into account considerations concerning the sharing of risks between the banks and the guarantee fund."
"This has not happened."
"It is not available."
"Therefore I should like to say, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that we think that there are two measures worth considering. On the one hand, where it is possible in the cooperating countries, and also where the projects allow, the 100 % guarantee should be reduced to a 75 % guarantee."
"Secondly, as far as payments into the guarantee fund are concerned, these should be based on a risk analysis that is appropriate to the banks concerned."
"With the present automatic payments, all at the same level, there is a risk that the fund will be eroded, and in particular the high credit levels for Russia and the CIS countries make this danger a very real one."
"It would therefore be sensible to switch to a system of graded contributions, determined on the basis of a risk analysis carried out as appropriate to the banks."
"Those are our proposals, and with them in mind we support this report."
"Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on his report and his presentation this evening."
"We are dealing with an important subject here."
"It is good that more cooperation agreements have been concluded with countries in these regions, in the event Latin America and Asia."
"But my Group believes that the Union has to play a far more visible role in projects."
"This will give people in these countries a clearer understanding of the Union's role in carrying out investment projects."
"The Commission and the European Investment Bank must devise a method for achieving this."
"But I have one small word of criticism of this report."
"The report deals with an extension of loans which were originally for the period 1993 to 1996."
"The sum for this three-year period was set at 250 million ECU per year."
"The Commission now tells us that in the first two years a total of 277 million ECU has been spent."
"An excess of 27 million ECU."
"And that is not counting loans for the final year. In effect the Commission is assuming that this excess will offset against loans to be granted for the new period of February 1996 to February 1997."
"That is of course no way to do things."
"The European Parliament approves a given amount for a period of three years."
"After that we have to look again to see how much loan capital is available for a subsequent term."
"One cannot jump the gun, before the decisions have been taken."
"So I think the rapporteur was rather too gentle in his verdict on the sums approved by the EIB as loans."
"I know John Tomlinson always takes that as a compliment."
"I would appreciate an explanation from the Commission and the EIB of how it is possible for loans to be given to a value greater than initially envisaged."
"A further criticism is that the European Parliament was consulted very late in the proceedings."
"The previous loan period expired in February of this year."
"And in February Parliament was asked for its opinion on the new loan period."
"That is cutting it very fine indeed."
"The loan periods have been fixed for three years now."
"So the Commission knows when the time is approaching for a new decision to be taken."
"This late consultation raises the question of whether 410 million worth of loans can now be granted. Or has the Commission already offset these against the previous period?"
"A last point is that the Commission has decided to place all loans to third countries on the same footing as of the beginning of 1997."
"The Commission chose that time because this is when loans to countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean will run out."
"It is a good thing to have just one policy for loans to third countries."
"But the Commission is now proposing to extend its loans to Latin America and Asia by another six months if the 410 million ECU have not been allocated in full."
"The question of course is what exactly does the Commission want?"
"It is quite right that the rapporteur comments on this."
"My compliments on the report."
"But I think the Commission is very late with all these proposals; it puts us in a difficult position and has briefed us too little and too late."
"I urge the Commissioner to improve things."
"It is not just a question of this report."
"I have had a few reports myself."
"All rapporteurs come up against this problem and it would be better if the Commission anticipated rather more and planned ahead."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the inclusion of Mr Tomlinson's report on the agenda for this part-session."
"I can tell Mr Pronk that this report has not come too late: to my knowledge, the decision is still far from having been taken."
"I congratulate Mr Tomlinson on the quality of his report."
"This is an important subject, because the mandate given to the European Investment Bank for operations in Latin America and Asia expired at the end of February."
"That mandate, as you know, allowed for a review at the end of the period, in other words at the end of February 1996, of the annual ceiling of ECU 250 million which is guaranteed by the Community budget."
"In its proposal, presented on 12 January this year, nearly six months ago in other words, the Commission suggests to the Council that the total EIB loans to these regions should be increased to ECU 410 million for an initial period of one year."
"These loans granted by the Bank, on the basis of its usual statutes and criteria, would be one hundred per cent guaranteed by the Community, in accordance with the conclusions of last November's Ecofin Council, and I can assure Mr König that the Commission is sparing no effort in order to obtain from the Council an agreement to revise this hundred per cent guarantee downwards."
"For the present, I must admit that the division within the Council has not allowed us to reach a conclusion on this point, but we will spare no effort to progress in the direction you desire."
"I would like to make two brief comments."
"The first relates to the ceiling on the loans."
"The ceiling of ECU 410 million, proposed for a period of one year, is admittedly a substantial increase over the previous mandate of ECU 250 million over three years."
"But, as was quite rightly emphasized by your rapporteur, Mr Tomlinson, this increase is justified because the activity of the EIB is reinforcing the European Union's policy of cooperation in Latin America and Asia, and also because the activity of the EIB is a response to the invitation issued to the European Investment Bank by the European Council in Madrid to intensify its activities in Latin America, and finally because the activity of the EIB supports European enterprises in their efforts to penetrate these emerging markets, many of which, incidentally, are a long way away."
"My second comment concerns the duration of the mandate."
"The initial period of a year proposed last January by the Commission is exceptional."
"Mandates for such operations, as you know, are generally multi-annual."
"As far as the Commission was concerned, it was necessary to gear the renewal of this mandate to the multi-annual budgets for EIB loans to other third countries, such as the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Mediterranean States."
"Well, this renewal, for these two categories of country, will take place towards the end of this year."
"The Commission's objective is to achieve a fair breakdown of the loan arrangements over the various regions, having regard to the room for manoeuvre available for these loans within the framework of the guarantee fund, which you mentioned just now, Mr Tomlinson, for the Union's external activities."
"I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission has no problem at all in accepting Amendments Nos 1 and 4 of your report."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 5 cause no problem in principle, but no longer seem to me to be of any essential value."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3, relating to the clause to extend this mandate by six months, quite simply because such a clause traditionally exists in the EIB's other mandates, and because the EIB considers this clause necessary to ensure, in particular the flexibility which is essential to the commitment of the loan programmes."
"Mr President, we do not want to become difficult about Amendment No 3, but I merely ask the Commissioner to reflect upon it before we come to the vote tomorrow."
"It is all very well to say that this clause traditionally exists but traditionally we are not in the process of trying to align dates."
"And it seems nonsensical simultaneously to try to align dates and then also provide for the possibility of a six-month extension of the period which will then unalign them."
"I hope that he might reflect on that because Parliament will persist in its vote on Amendment No 3 tomorrow."
"It is rather late in the day, Mr Tomlinson, to embark upon a debate on this interesting subject."
"What I can promise you, because I have myself carefully considered all the loan budgets and all the periods in question, is that there will be no problems, whatever the date on which the Council reaches its decision."
"We shall therefore act so as to ensure that there will be consistency between the three regions concerned by the loan programmes."
"That is why I do not believe that the possibility of a six-month extension should cause you any problem, bearing in mind the objective you are trying to achieve, because we are aiming at that same objective."
"I believe that, as far as the Bank and the other countries are concerned, excluding this clause could possibly have a discriminatory effect which might be unpleasant."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Market organization for sheepmeat and goatmeat"
"The next item is the report (A4-0221/96) by Mr McCartin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 3/95 on the implementation of the intervention measures provided for by the organization of the market in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector (C4-0592/95)."
"Mr President, my report is about counting sheep."
"When I was brought up in the west of Ireland if you could not sleep late at night it was recommended that in your imagination you should count sheep."
"But, at this time of night, our staff and interpreters here will not need any sheep therapy to go to sleep."
"I do not think the Members who are here ever sleep."
"I will be as brief as I can."
"This report arises out of a report by the Court of Auditors on the sheepmeat regime, which was quite critical of the way the regime was policed by the Member States and critical also of the policy itself."
"I just wish to recall that the common organization of the market came into existence in 1980 and was intended to stabilize prices and provide a reasonable standard of living for the people engaged in the production of sheep and goatmeat."
"At the time the Union was only 60 % self-sufficient in sheep and goatmeat; today this figure has risen to 82 %."
"There are about 0.7 million producers in the Union and the cost of the regime is about ECU 1.8 billion, which comes to about ECU 200 per month, per individual producer."
"It is a relatively small amount of money: less than a single payment of social welfare to a single person."
"The UK, Spain, Italy, Greece, France and Ireland - in that order - are the main producers."
"The aid is paid by fixing a guide price, and if the market turns out lower then compensation is paid."
"This compensation is called a premium."
"If sheep are used to produce milk, as well as meat, then only 80 % of the premium is paid."
"The premium works out at between ECU 17 and 25 per annum."
"Since 1991 a special premium has been introduced which gives an advantage to the poorer areas of the Community."
"I just wish to make the following points in support of the policy."
"80 % of the producers live in the less-favoured areas and, therefore, have very limited possibilities for land use which is, by definition, mostly mountainous and always poor land."
"Sheep and goat farming is always carried out by extensive grazing systems and is, therefore, environmentally friendly."
"Given the level of profitability in the business, we can say that without this system of aid the entire production would cease."
"The Commission estimates that between 80 and 90 % of sheep and goat farmers' profit comes through the premium, which means that without this premium there would not be anything left."
"The Court of Auditors, in a special report on this sector completed in the middle of 1995, was critical of the control system by the Member States, and this criticism is accepted in my report."
"Indeed, we find that in spite of efforts by the Commission and the improvements it has made, there are still some improvements that can be made."
"The system can never be made perfect without the assistance of some electronic device which makes it possible in difficult conditions and difficult terrain, to count the sheep and to record them accurately."
"At the moment a system has been researched and is being tried out in Spain and Portugal in the hope that it will introduce a lot more accuracy into the system."
"Another criticism was that, by comparison to the cost of beef, it costs three times as much to subsidize sheepmeat."
"But, of course, the Court of Auditors missed the point that is not a food subsidy: it is an income supplement for farmers and an effort to maintain population in the rural areas."
"The Court of Auditors also felt that the premium was interfering with the market for beef and veal."
"That criticism is not valid."
"If you take away the premium from sheep and goatmeat, then it will not be consumed any more and the slack will be taken up by very intensive systems - poultry and pigs - which are less environmentally friendly and will employ a lot less people than the sheep sector."
"The Court of Auditors said that the numbers and cost have been continuously rising."
"That was true in the 1980s."
"In fact, the numbers have started to reduce and have already gone back 6 % in recent years, which bears out what I say, that it is not a very profitable business; it is not very lucrative."
"The Court of Auditors also makes the point that this should be confined to the hill areas."
"When we remember that the hill areas are getting an extra subsidy - they already have 80 % or more of the entire production - the element that is left for the lowlands is very small."
"In any case, it is not a matter of accounting: it is a political decision and, as such, it is for the politicians - Parliament and the Council - to make decisions on whether this subsidization scheme applies to the lowlands or not."
"In social and environmental terms we get good value out of this policy."
"It does no harm to recall that in the early years when it was first introduced - because Britain was a major producer - it was seen as a policy which would help to redress the imbalance which the United Kingdom always claimed existed in the finances against their particular state."
"So it served a number of purposes: to help the disadvantaged mountain regions, to keep people there, to maintain environmentally friendly farming and to solve that political problem of giving back a little bit of money to Britain for a particular form of production in which they specialized."
"I commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, we are doing very well to be here at just after half past eleven on a Wednesday evening when we could probably be doing other, rather more pleasurable things."
"I should like to thank Mr McCartin for his very erudite presentation."
"However, in his review he is concealing a little - applying legerdemain - with regard to the sheep and goatmeat report."
"Certainly the provisional cost for 1995 was ECU 1.78bn. I know, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, that this is going to increase by another ECU 94m next year."
"Perhaps we could look at the Court of Auditors' criticisms particularly."
"They highlighted that there was a problem in distinguishing between milk and non-milk producing sheep which poses a problem for the Committee on Budgetary Control and also in terms of payment of premiums."
"Secondly, there is a problem with the definition of less-favoured area."
"The Court found that only Scotland and Ireland had clear land registers and this allowed the definition to be checked."
"Therefore there was a problem in counting the size of flocks in other Member States to work out the payments."
"The Court of Auditors quite rightly, in my group's opinion, said that this posed a problem as regards abuse on the part of Member States."
"Thirdly, the Court also found that statistical information forwarded by the Member States was inadequate."
"I have had conversations with Member States which operate a counting regime on the basis of regional, Länder or local accounting methods."
"There were problems here in terms of accumulation and accounting."
"This has to be addressed and I am sure Mr McCartin appreciates that."
"Finally - and Mr McCartin has touched on this - one kilo of sheepmeat costs ECU 1.7 to produce."
"That is three times the cost of beef."
"That seems incredible in terms of the subsidy we offer under the common agricultural policy."
"In terms of the amendments, the Group of the European People's Party has tabled two amendments which are designed to weaken the report."
"Probably the Socialist Group, the Green Group and the Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group will oppose them."
"The first amendment seeks to weaken the criticisms of the cost of the whole project and the second seeks to keep all areas eligible for aid, not just the less-favoured areas."
"We cannot support that."
"But apart from those two criticisms, our side will be supporting the McCartin report."
"But in terms of the common agricultural policy, I find it difficult to be broadly supportive of the use of European taxpayers money for programmes like this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like the section of the Minutes concerning the vote on the calendar for part-sessions in 1997 to be corrected regarding my vote on Amendment No 27."
"I voted against, and so informed President Hänsch yesterday in writing."
"I voted against deleting the Strasbourg sittings for the week of 6 October, like all my fellow citizens and many others."
"An error in transmission ascribed the opposite vote to me."
"Since machines are said to be infallible and humans are said to make mistakes, the mistake would therefore be mine."
"I disclaim all responsibility for the mistake, but I should like to stress that I have no wish to stir up controversy about it in Parliament."
"The vote, apart from this mistake, apart from this single vote, quite clearly proves that Strasbourg should remain the seat of Parliament and should retain its rights."
"Besides, it is only a point of law, as several of my French colleagues reminded us and demonstrated to us before the debate."
"Thank you, Mrs Fouque."
"I have noted that you intend to vote against Amendment No 27 to the calendar of Parliament's part-sessions for 1997."
"Your intention was duly recorded in the Minutes (Minutes of previous day's sitting)."
"However, I have to say to you - as I shall probably have to do to other Members - that the outcome of the vote does not change given that Rule 123(5) states very clearly that 'the President shall decide whether the result announced is valid."
"His decision shall be final' ."
"Mr President, the draft Minutes distributed to us cannot be approved as they stand because they contain an obvious contradiction as regards the roll-call vote on Amendment No 27 concerning the calendar of part-sessions for 1997."
"It has rightly been pointed out that Mrs Fouque wished to vote against, but this is not taken into account in the result of the vote, which, may I remind you, was decided by a single vote."
"This being so, I request the addition to the Minutes of a sentence stating that Amendment No 27 cannot be adopted, failing which we would be forced to reject the Minutes."
"Mr President, what we have just heard is a challenge to us."
"I am ready to admit that the rules should be applied to the letter and I am even in favour of doing so, but is the machine superior to human intentions?"
"In this particular case, a roll-call vote was taken."
"In such cases each Member of Parliament casting a vote is committing him or herself."
"As for the statement just made by Mrs Fouque, there is not the slightest doubt about the way in which she wished to vote."
"She has just made this declaration publicly."
"She herself only discovered a mistake had been made when she looked at the list of voters."
"Thus, her intention is clear and her good faith not in doubt."
"This being so, I believe it should be possible to rectify the vote."
"It seems to me that generally speaking in electoral disputes - even if the case is not exactly the same - in all Member States, when a material error is discovered, the courts reinstate the vote and, sometimes, change the outcome of an election."
"Here, we have not an election but an important vote."
"I believe Parliament would do itself credit if, in view of Mrs Fouque's very clear and unambiguous statements, it rectified the vote."
"Thank you Mr Striby and Mr Pasty, I have taken note of your remarks."
"Mrs Fouque's intention and good faith are obviously beyond doubt. She in fact made the point yesterday, immediately after the vote."
"As regards any mechanical error, I have to state that the technicians have checked Mrs Fouque's voting machine and have established that it was working properly; it is only right that Parliament should be given this information."
"Mr President, I should like to intervene in application of Rule 133 of the Rules of Procedure."
"You have just taken a stand on the subject of disputes."
"But when there is a dispute about the Minutes, it is for Parliament to decide."
"I challenge paragraph 12 in its entirety; in other words, from the end of page 9 to the middle of page 11, the whole of paragraph 12."
"In accordance with Rule 133(3), I request that, since these Minutes are challenged, Parliament should decide on the following change: ' Delete Item 12 in its entirety in application of Rule 133(2) and (3)' ."
"I should like Parliament to decide on this request for an amendment to the Minutes."
"Mr President, you have made reference to the rights of the President of a sitting."
"Such rights, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has said, are exercised under the provisions of Rule 133."
"It is for Parliament to ratify the Minutes."
"As regards our colleague Mrs Fouque, who is handicapped but has always very clearly shown her very positive attitude, I should add that it would seem to me deeply offensive to distort her wishes by making her cast a vote contrary to what she always intended."
"Mr President, I should like to mention the varying rules that seem to apply in this Parliament when accepting or rejecting changes in roll-call votes."
"Yesterday, in connection with a vote, I went to the President's office to ask them to take into account a roll-call vote that I had not been able to cast in time. There was no problem about that."
"It was accepted. Why then, cannot Mrs Fouque's vote be accepted today?"
"Mr President, I believe this Parliament is at grave risk if, to protect the interests of a party - in this case, not a political party, but a Member of the House who has taken a specific position on a certain issue - moves are made to bend one of the fundamental principles of the way in which this Parliament functions."
"Of course, there may sometimes be a need to rectify, note or record in the Minutes the statement of a Member who, claiming to have made an error in voting, fails to find his or her intended vote in the Minutes - especially in the case of a roll-call vote - or, as our colleague has just said, may not have expressed his or her true opinion because of a brief misunderstanding."
"It is nonetheless obvious, as all the precedents of this House make clear, that, when there is a roll-call vote, or electronic confirmation of a vote, and when the difference between one position and another, between a yes and a no, whatever the subject of dispute, is determined by a very small number of votes - whether in the case of a qualified or some other form of majority - the result of the electronic vote must be honoured when it is proven, as you have just stated to be the case, that the machines are working properly."
"In the past, there have been hundreds of cases of Members who have made a mistake in voting, have had it recorded in the Minutes that they have made a mistake, without it changing the result of a vote."
"I should like to remind my colleagues that, in defending today a legitimate position that was obviously not shared by the majority of Members yesterday, they are bending the basic principles governing the functioning of this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I understand very well the importance of the discussion we are having here, but I should now like to close the vote on the Minutes."
"Since there are still three Members who wish to speak, I shall, with your consent, invite those three Members to speak and then make a proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Vecchi has said."
"The House has rules and it has precedents, and some of us who have been here a little longer have been through all this before."
"It is very important that we stick to the rules, as you stated them, taking note of what Mrs Fouque had to say."
"The fact is that the result stands and should be recorded in the Minutes."
"I just wish to say to colleagues who may not like the result: we have been over this ground before, practically every year when the same subject has arisen."
"I stand by your decision, and we should support it."
"Mr President, it would have helped if the leader of the Europe of the Nations Group, Sir James Goldsmith, had actually turned up on time."
"I should like to suggest that in future, when he makes one of his passing visits, we ask the Visitors' Service to show him his seat!"
"Mr President, I have been a Member here ever since we first introduced electronic voting, and during that time there must have been hundreds of mistakes."
"I am very sorry for any Member who makes a mistake on an important vote."
"I myself have made dozens of mistakes of that kind."
"It is unfortunate, but there is no alternative but to stick clearly to the rules laid down."
"That was the result of the vote as it was announced yesterday."
"Of course, Members have every right to indicate what their intention was, but it was the result of the vote that counted, and I do not think we should seek through the Minutes to try to rectify mistakes."
"As Mr McMillan-Scott said, every single time we have this discussion almost every trick in the book is called - every possible way in which we can change the vote."
"We made a decision and we ought, in fact, keep to that decision."
"Mr President, just a word to say that I have noticed that my name did not appear in the Minutes whereas, as the roll-call votes testify, I was in fact present yesterday."
"This is undoubtedly an omission on my part."
"I feel I must repeat what I said earlier about Rule 123, which is very clear and has always been followed, as several Members have pointed out."
"There is a difference between intention and act: there have been frequent occasions when Members have said they made a mistake, but this has never led the House to change the result of a vote."
"However, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy and Mr Gollnisch have put forward a request under Rule 133."
"I accept their request and, since voting is due to start at 11.30 a.m., I shall ask the President in the Chair to put the Minutes to the vote at 11.30 a.m., at the beginning of voting time."
"This is my proposal, which I think can be taken as a decision."
"Mr President, I shall say nothing about what has just been said."
"I shall simply express an opinion about the proposal you have just made."
"You are sovereign, Mr President, but you are sovereign within the limits of the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 133(2), to which I refer you, says that 'at the beginning of each sitting the President shall place before Parliament, for its approval, the minutes of the previous sitting' ."
"A clearer paragraph does not exist and I am sure that you would agree with me about this for you are, I am certain, an honourable man: Parliament must decide at the beginning of the sitting, otherwise the vote would be null and void."
"Thank you, Mr Gollnisch, for your suggestion and for the precise reference to the Rule."
"As you so rightly say, Paragraph 2 states that: ' At the beginning of each sitting the President shall place before Parliament, for its approval, the minutes of the previous sitting' ."
"Paragraph 3 adds that: ' If any objections are raised to the minutes Parliament shall, if necessary, decide whether the changes requested should be considered.'"
"Now, let us be precise: the Minutes are placed before Parliament, for its approval, at the beginning of the sitting, and it is then up to the President to decide, if any objections are raised, whether a vote should take place at voting time."
"There are already precedents in this respect."
"Mr President, what is being objected to here is not the Minutes themselves, though these provide the pretext; the aim is to challenge yesterday's vote in favour of Strasbourg at all costs."
"Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure says that the President shall decide whether the result of the vote announced is valid."
"I would make the point to the honourable Members concerned that I have not heard the President himself challenging the result of the vote."
"So as far as we are concerned this means there is no need to amend the Minutes."
"You approved the vote yesterday."
"We all did and we must stand by that."
"The result is your doing."
"Mr President, for myself, I simply want the Minutes to be clear for people outside."
"When referring to the Minutes, we read 'October I, Amendment No 27, approved by roll-call vote, 544 voting Members, 269 for, 268 against, 7 abstentions' and in brackets it is clearly stated 'Mrs Fouque wished to vote against' ."
"Mrs Fouque is deducted from those who voted for."
"Then we have a Minute saying that the vote was declared valid but that one Member of Parliament has very clearly stated that she made a mistake."
"In that case, I have to say that this throws some discredit on the votes cast in this Parliament."
"That is why I have not asked for the vote to be retaken but for it to be rectified."
"In other words, for the Minutes to be brought into line with what has been stated by a Member of Parliament early enough for it to be recorded in the Minutes."
"The Minutes should be consistent with the intentions of the votes cast."
"What we ask is that the Minutes be made consistent."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pasty; however, in responding to you and other Members, I should like to take up the point made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"We have two separate issues here: the Minutes are one issue and the result of yesterday's vote is another."
"This is the whole point!"
"The outcome of yesterday's vote is no longer an issue, in accordance with Rule 123: it cannot be changed, and that is final."
"We cannot change the Rules simply to suit ourselves."
"As for the Minutes, I repeat what I said earlier: they will be put to the vote at 11.30 a.m., at the beginning of voting time."
"Mr President, yesterday evening we saw on the news pictures of the memorial service for those killed in the accident involving a military aircraft at Eindhoven airport at the beginning of the week."
"This morning we learned with horror that TWA Flight 800 en route from New York to Paris had crashed into the sea off Long Island after an explosion."
"More than 200 people are feared dead."
"May I ask you, Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to convey the condolences of the European Parliament to the victims' families."
"These tragic accidents require all of us to give greater priority to improving aviation safety."
"Thank you, Mr Cornelissen."
"On behalf of Parliament as a whole, the President would like to offer condolences to the families of the victims."
"Mr President, during the May sittings, Parliament adopted, as I assume that everybody remembers, a resolution condemning the violations of human rights in Tunisia."
"This resolution drew particular attention to the case of Mr Khémaïs Chammari, member of parliament, head of the Mouvement des Démocrates Socialistes, who had been arrested and committed to the civil prison in Tunis."
"I have just learnt that Mr Chammari was sentenced yesterday evening to five years imprisonment."
"This is a new violation of human rights, which particularly hits opposition parties, journalists and activists in human rights organizations."
"The need to combat fundamentalism should not be used as a pretext to undermine freedom of opinion and expression."
"Mr President, I propose that you use Parliament's resolution to protest to the Tunisian authorities against the sentencing of the member of parliament, Mr Khémaïs Chammari."
"Mr President, as the originator on behalf of my group, of the resolution on Tunisia to which Mrs Pailler has just referred, I should simply like to say that, in a personal capacity, I associate myself with her request."
"Mr President, I should simply like to appeal to the Rules of Procedure to indicate that, for Amendments Nos 1 to 7, block II, I did not cast a vote against, but a vote for: in other words, I was in favour of them."
"I wish this to be recorded in the Minutes."
"The necessary correction will be made."
"Mr President, I propose, in order to put an end to a debate which threatens to drag on indefinitely, that, notwithstanding the reservations that have been expressed about the Minutes, we immediately pass to a vote on them in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Thank you for your suggestion, Mr Le Pen, which is not the first I have received. However, I have already said how we shall proceed: the vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, you have called on certain Members to speak several times: you may of course call on anybody several times."
"But you are calling on some speakers several times while we are discussing one item on the agenda."
"Exercise your role as chairman properly."
"We come to one item on the agenda, then we pass on to the next."
"I wished to make it clear to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that the request I made referred to Item 12 in its entirety and not just to Amendment No 27 that we have talked about."
"And if I contest the whole of Item 12, it is also because, as I said yesterday at the sitting, even though I asked to speak before the vote on the amendments that I had tabled on behalf of my group, I was not called."
"I wished to speak to withdraw some of the amendments which were then put to the vote."
"This was a basic infringement of the right of every Member of Parliament to speak before the vote on amendments."
"I therefore ask, Mr President, for the vote to be taken on the whole of Item 12 in order to withdraw it and you should put this to the vote immediately because you have opened discussion on the adoption of the agenda and if you alter the agenda you must have the agreement of Parliament."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I have already answered your question and my answer has not changed."
"Mr President, I would ask you to bring this circus to an end now, whereby French Members are deliberately harassing Parliament in its work."
"There is so much we have to do, and we cannot go on listening to people who are just deliberately hindering our work."
"I would ask you to let us proceed with our agenda and stop listening to this nonsense."
"Mr Blak, in some particularly delicate situations, a little patience is required ."
"Cooperation with South Africa"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0214/96) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on development cooperation with South Africa (rapporteur: Mrs Günther)."
". (DE) Mr President, I am grateful now, albeit half an hour late, to be able to introduce this item on the agenda and will not hide my feeling that, with all the interest shown in the preceding debate, it might not have been such a bad thing to cut it short."
"We now come to the Regulation on arrangements for cooperation with South Africa, which forms part of a series of similar regulations under which we place development cooperation on a legal footing."
"This recommendation for second reading is concerned with the regulation of the favourable relations that exist between the European Union and South Africa."
"In line with the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in June 1995, the European Union and the Government of South Africa have agreed that future financing for development projects will be channelled through a special financing facility of the European Union and not through the European Development Fund."
"This gives Parliament other possibilities of involvement in the process."
"The explanatory memorandum to the draft regulation at the time recognized the key role played by the European Parliament over the years in support for South Africa."
"Excuse me, Mr President, but it is extremely difficult to speak when an argument is going on in the background."
"Could you please ask the colleagues concerned to hold their debate outside the Chamber?"
"You are quite right, Mrs Günther."
"Some Members are behaving particularly badly at the moment."
"I invite you all to pay attention or, if you do not wish to listen, to leave the House."
"South Africa has undergone gratifying development in recent years and has largely achieved its re-entry into the family of nations."
"Hence it is also important to remedy the existing deficiencies in our cooperation as quickly and as completely as possible in order to clear the way for a course of sustainable development."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation has endeavoured to bring about a long-term solution which measures up to the significance of this cooperation."
"The earlier draft for the Regulation itself was to a large extent satisfactory."
"A number of changes have been made, however, in order to bring the Regulation more closely into line with actual needs and, more especially, in order take proper account of the situation that has arisen since the free elections in South Africa and under the new government since April 1994."
"It had become apparent early on that priorities different to those of the past needed to be applied, in the use of resources too."
"From this point of view, it is to be welcomed that the common position already contains a number of the amendments proposed by Parliament on first reading."
"That applies in particular to the demand that the measures pursued be geared not only to lasting development, but also to environmentally sound development, and that environmental protection projects also be systematically covered by the Regulation."
"In the development field, we are occasionally confronted with the fact that the resources available are not always used quickly enough."
"Hence, from the point of view of Parliament, it is to be welcomed that the demand for an indicative programme is formulated in a more detailed manner than was the case on first reading."
"A further amendment that, in our view, can be accepted consists in the fact that the involvement of the South African National Development Agency has been broadened to the point where we can now speak of a permanent dialogue."
"A key point, however, which had been demanded by Parliament but does not appear in the common position, is that more powers should be given to the Head of Delegation in South Africa."
"With a budget line of about ECU 130 million a year - and that is not really a huge sum - it makes little sense, in my opinion, to make practically every project subject to approval in Brussels and to leave part of the decision-making to people in the field."
"The Regulation in any case covers everything precisely and in detail, so that it would certainly be possible to ensure proper monitoring here too."
"I strongly urge the Commission to back Amendment No 4, perhaps with a reduced amount in order to show willingness to compromise here."
"This point is not without relevance to the effective implementation of the proposed Regulation."
"The improvement of the financial management of aid programmes must quite simply be taken more seriously."
"The European Parliament has repeatedly pointed out that staffing needs to be increased for the implementation of programmes in South Africa."
"At the same time, it is necessary to streamline decisionmaking procedures."
"The Court of Auditors has also raised this matter and has given a clear indication of the importance of programmes in South Africa."
"I am completely at a loss to understand why the Council decided to reject Amendment No 6 from first reading."
"Again and again we hear that decisions taken at European level are incomprehensible and often impossible to implement for those concerned."
"Through the amendment tabled on first reading we had called for more transparency - in vain, as it turns out."
"In the cumbersome procedure laid down in Article 8 of the common position, decisions for prompt action will certainly not be capable of implementation, and the text has been so radically altered in its new formulation that, in my opinion, the conciliation procedure should be brought into operation if no amendment results from the second reading."
"In this context, I would like to thank the coreporting committees once more for the constructive dialogue."
"Their contributions should, in my opinion, also have been reflected in the common position."
"For the reasons stated, I urge support for the amendments we are now proposing for the second reading."
"Mr President, as Commissioner Pinheiro will be well aware, there are many stories coming from South Africa of bureaucracy, confusion, delays and, indeed, of missed opportunities in our dealings with NGOs in that country."
"We know, in fact - and I spoke to NGOs in South Africa only yesterday - that the first provisional decisions concerning expenditure in the 1996 budgets were only taken this month."
"We know too that the transitional National Development Trust which is responsible for working with NGOs in South Africa only received its first tranche of money on 24 June."
"That means that the money will not get through to NGOs until August."
"South African NGOs are going to the wall."
"They are extremely confused and the EU's proceedings are misunderstood, as you know, Commissioner."
"They are in desperation, forced to take out loans with high interest rates, and that increases their difficulties."
"The lessons for us are clear and the amendments which Mrs Günther has referred to reflect the concerns we have about our work with South African partners."
"Our amendments are aimed, above all, at ensuring that the European Union can be, as it should be, a properly responsive partner."
"Our first proposal is that the European Commission delegates in South Africa be given the power to authorize expenditure on projects up to a maximum ceiling of ECU 500, 000."
"One facet of this is that it would mean that we would have a much more rapid response and it would be a more effective European Union relationship with our NGOs."
"The Development Committee is also extremely concerned with the imposition of a III(a) committee procedure by the Council."
"It is quite clear that this will cause enormous difficulties and the situation will undoubtedly deteriorate even further."
"The limited staff resources available to the Commission in this area will indeed be stretched to breaking point."
"The paper work will mount even as the lines of responsibility and decision-making in the Commission become even more confused."
"I see only one outcome to the Council's determined and obstinate insistence on maintaining its pre-eminence in every single decision."
"The outcome, I think, clearly will be further delay and damage to the European Union's reputation in South Africa."
"For many years the Union has worked to give the poorest people in South Africa the best kind of support."
"The proposal before us today provides us with a much valued opportunity to take this work forward."
"I certainly hope the Commission will play its part in persuading the Council not to undermine the possibilities we have here to make that kind of contribution in South Africa."
"Indeed, as Mrs Günther has said, I call upon the Council to come to conciliation in order to negotiate with Parliament on these matters."
"I can keep it short, Mr President."
"Mrs Günther's report is an excellent one."
"She did a very good job in the first round, receiving very broad support in the Committee on Development and in our Group too, of course."
"Nevertheless we are not happy with the situation as such."
"I refer not to Mrs Günther's splendid report, but to the way in which the European Commission handles aid funds for South Africa."
"The situation in South Africa is good at the moment, but it is certainly not without its dangers and that means that a lot of effort is required to improve prosperity in the country quickly so that potential political risks for the future can be eliminated as far as possible."
"It is thus a serious matter that there are so many delays in the aid projects being managed by NGOs and that European Union red tape is responsible for adding to those delays."
"We really must urge the European Commission to be more flexible and more helpful here and to ensure that projects are moved forward faster."
"My second point is that the approval of small-scale projects is most important."
"The Netherlands has many years' experience of this practice."
"Embassies can approve small-scale projects on their own initiative and it always works very well."
"It also works often when bridging arrangements are needed."
"So we think this provision should be available."
"My third point is that transparency is exceedingly important in all aid projects."
"This is needed not only in South Africa itself, where in general it is very good, but also in the decision-making processes of the European Commission."
"It is these which pose a number of problems, and it is these which Mrs Günther rightly highlights."
"We are with her on this and we call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that these kinds of procedures and these kinds of aid programmes are carried out better and in a more flexible manner."
"Mrs Günther's report, on which I too must compliment her, deals with the setting of the legal basis for development cooperation between the EU and South Africa."
"The problems so clearly outlined by Mrs Kinnock are very real and I thus hope that a large majority of the House will support the amendments so that we can secure a change in the EU's policy and introduce greater flexibility into its workings with the NGOs in the field."
"But one of the most important points to be considered at present in our review of development cooperation overall is the specific status which South Africa should have vis à vis the Lomé Convention."
"In this context we would point to a problem raised a few weeks ago in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely the apparent desire amongst some of the South African negotiators to seek exemption from Article 39 of the Lomé Convention which bans the importing and exporting of toxic waste."
"There have been great problems with this in South Africa in the past, with the British multinational Thor Chemicals in particular playing a dubious role."
"It would be most regrettable if South Africa did not sign up to Article 39 because despite the claims of official spokesmen at the talks she really cannot guarantee to manage toxic waste adequately."
"There is no adequate legislation."
"1000 of the 12000 dumps are illegal and thus not subject to licensing controls."
"I call on Parliament to put pressure on the Commission and the South African Government to end this situation."
"Mr President, in March of this year I was privileged to be in Lesotho and to visit South Africa, Namibia and Botswana as a European Parliamentary representative."
"It was tremendously encouraging to go back after 20 years and see the transformation that had taken place in South Africa."
"It behoves us all to do everything possible to encourage the process of economic regeneration in South Africa so that the democratic gains which have already been made and which have so delighted us are not put at risk."
"That is a fundamental point."
"In a month in which we have seen Nelson Mandela fêted - and rightly so - in London and in Paris there is all the more reason to be pro-South African and do everything we can to support South Africa and the neighbouring countries, which are very much dependent on the prosperity of South Africa."
"I would like to make one particular point in support of Mrs Günther's excellent report."
"It seems to me to make all kinds of sense to delegate the responsibility for small-scale projects to the Commission's representative in South Africa."
"This is the kind of thing, as Mrs Kinnock has rightly said, that will make a tremendous difference."
"Instead of these horrendous delays, waiting half the year to know if your project is going to get the go-ahead, let that be given to our man in Pretoria, Cape Town, or wherever he is, so that he can authorize and they can get on with development."
"I am delighted to see the broad support in the House across the political groups for this."
"I hope the report will be totally supported."
"We thank Mrs Günther and should back all her amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Günther's good report shows up what, to me, is a significant weakness in the implementation of all cooperation projects with third countries, namely the need for an increase in staff resources for the conduct of programmes in South Africa."
"The implication of this, of course, is that many projects which have been put into effect were not carried out efficiently enough."
"The conclusion that an improvement in financial management is needed is to be welcomed."
"I think it right to demand that responsibility for approving commitments and payments in respect of projects be transferred to the Head of Delegation in South Africa, but that alone will not solve the problem."
"It is much more important only to release projects for implementation when human resources are up to proper strength."
"I therefore oppose the proposal of the Commission to create a special South Africa committee, since such a committee can do no more than the Court of Auditors, i.e. to note in retrospect that project resources were not used efficiently enough."
"Mr President, I think that only when we have fewer commissions and, instead, more competent implementation capacity will it be possible to achieve the necessary efficiency."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Günther for the high quality of her report which, of course, we expected."
"The world has been inspired by the courage of the people of South Africa and the decisions that they have taken during the last few years."
"We have been especially inspired by the quality of the political leadership in South Africa which, I have to say, is in contrast with the performance of some politicians in Europe and the behaviour of some Members in the European Parliament this morning who attempted to change their votes: I have often had cause to complain about people abusing the right of one-person-one-vote in this way."
"I say that with some feeling, having spent a lot of time travelling backwards and forwards between Europe and South Africa over the last 25 years and had the privilege of being an observer at the elections."
"The European Union, and Parliament in particular, has a proud record of support for the democratic process."
"It is important that we make the best use of our resources and contacts and do everything to make our work more effective and more efficient."
"The special programme for the victims of apartheid has been the most successful programme of the European Union."
"It was our biggest programme and the biggest overseas programme for South Africa itself."
"It was administered very efficiently by the Commission, particularly in the early days, supporting small projects - including, for example, small projects supporting an independent media."
"Cooperating with our partners, we built up an incredible fund of experience of working with churches, trade unions, and a special trust."
"Many of us are anxious that experience should not be squandered or put on one side, but should be built on."
"But clearly there are areas where we need to be more efficient and more effective."
"The amendments that we are tabling seek to ensure that our Commission team in South Africa, which is very impressive indeed, is given a free hand in a new and very difficult situation."
"Whilst we are celebrating the visit of Nelson Mandela to Europe, which has been an inspiration in so many ways, it is very important that we continue to show solidarity with the people of South Africa."
"Unfortunately, he is returning to South Africa in many ways empty handed, partly because of the lack of progress that has been made in the trade agreement."
"I would like to ask Mr Pinheiro, in particular, to use to the full all his experience and ability and knowledge on the college of Commissioners and in the Council itself."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Günther on the work she has done on this report."
"I share her worries which were also expressed by Mrs Kinnock."
"President Mandela recently visited London, and it was one of the most moving state visits the United Kingdom has seen for decades."
"The humility of this man is an example to the world of how someone who has endured so much suffering over so many years can show so much forgiveness and become such a respected world leader."
"He needs total support."
"South Africa - and its peaceful future - is the key to stability for the whole continent of Africa."
"If we can see a steady transition from the old oppressive regime to a new democracy supported by the European Union, not just in financial terms, but in genuine moves to rebuild a fair, equal and peaceful society as an example to the other African nations, then the European Union will have played its part in that new stability."
"The whole question of the future of Lomé is in the melting pot."
"South Africa's position is being carefully examined."
"But South Africa is already in cooperation with her neighbouring states on a regional basis, and I look forward to a strengthening of those frameworks."
"Careful consideration will have to be given to see how South Africa will fit into any new organization that replaces Lomé if this can be negotiated."
"It is a major step forward that funding will be channelled through a special financing facility and not through the European Development Fund."
"This improves budget control and transparency."
"The whole emphasis of the new government must be to provide basic provisions for the people and this is what they are trying to do under difficult constraints."
"This means a rapid development in housing, health and education if the expectations of the people after the elections are to be fulfilled."
"NGOs will still have a major role to play."
"I support this report but I believe that further discussions should take place."
"Mr President, I also wish to go along with those who have congratulated Mrs Günther on her brilliant work. From my point of view, her work is also an ideal legal basis and not only in order to set up a framework for a harmonious and efficient regulation of the relationship between the European Union and South Africa."
"South Africa is a country where, in recent years, fantastic changes have taken place which deserved our applause and which have been a source of great emotion. But it would be foolish and irresponsible of us to think that what has happened so far in South Africa is already enough to guarantee the future and stability of this great southern African nation."
"What has been done is huge. But what still has to be done is a Herculean task and we are all responsible and are obliged to set up a framework for a pragmatic relationship as well as one which is flexible, rigorous and transparent."
"In order for all of this to take place it is fundamental, in a new type of relationship, that the European Union should, if possible, pay even greater attention to ensure that bureaucracy is not a factor of restriction and impediment and that, with our cooperation, we achieve swift and effective results."
"Nor shall we forget that, after the success of President Mandela's visit to Europe, the situation in South Africa is at this moment in time full of uncertainty and a great number of imbalances."
"We also know that, from a political point of view, President Mandela is preparing for his own succession and consequently it is necessary for us to create all of the objective political conditions and also to orient our relationship in the field of cooperation. Europe must lead the way in terms of the support that the western and developed world must give to a country which has undergone fantastic changes and which has a fundamental role to play, not only in the development of southern Africa, but also in effectively helping this country to play a part in tackling many of the problems which exist in the African continent and which must be eradicated."
"I think that, despite resistance by the Council, the work done by Mrs Günther, together with the sense of responsibility shown by Commissioner Deus Pinheiro (he is a man who has dedicated much of his political life to the subject of South Africa and has done so with a great sense of responsibility), is essential. We must give them all of our backing right now so that Europe can make a positive response, as is required and vital for this great South African nation and for the people of South Africa who are our friends."
"Mr President, for the great majority of European citizens, South Africa is no longer a problem: having got rid of the odious apartheid system, it has irrevocably committed itself to the path of multiracial democracy and economic development under the leadership of an outstanding man, President Nelson Mandela."
"Having myself visited South Africa several weeks ago in order to launch a policy of partnership between French and South African towns, I became aware, however, that the situation was in some respects disturbing and that the future was threatening."
"For although the black population representing 75 % of the total population, now enjoys civil rights, its living conditions have not improved very much and the average income of Whites is eight times that of Blacks."
"I believe we can say, without lapsing into pessimism, that, if the living conditions of the black population do not improve significantly in a reasonable time as regards security, employment, housing, public services and education, we can anticipate some unrest."
"This would be serious, not only for South Africa, but also for the whole of the African continent because many Africans, both peoples and governments, are turning their eyes towards South Africa."
"They expect South Africa to be a model for democracy and also to contribute actively to the economic development and political stability of the African continent."
"This means that what is at stake in South Africa is more than the future of South Africa: the European Union should take full responsibility for giving South Africa every opportunity to accept the challenge of building a new democracy, so that it can respond to the expectations of the African continent."
"What is at stake in South Africa is a good part of the future of the African continent in the years to come!"
"I very much appreciate the work put in by Mrs Günther and, of course, I approve her report."
"Mr President, the instruments the European Union is setting up for cooperation with the new democratic South Africa are of two-fold strategic significance."
"Firstly, because South Africa is an African country that has actually experienced, and is still living, the drama of under-development."
"A considerable proportion of the black population is living in terrible socio-economic conditions, has difficult and sometimes nonexistent access to basic services and is concentrated in suburban areas with very high unemployment and crime rates."
"Secondly, because South Africa is nonetheless the continent's strongest economic unit and is in a position to serve as a driving force for development in neighbouring countries and, more generally, throughout Africa."
"This role is, of course, an important one as regards its positive impact on political stability."
"The European Programme for Reconstruction and Development, like the special programme before it, is, together with the trade agreements currently being negotiated and South Africa's accession to some parts of the Lomé Convention, the basic instrument for cooperation with South Africa."
"The legal basis we are discussing is obviously broad enough to include interventions of various kinds. But two basic requirements must be met during the operational phase."
"The first concerns the need to continue to involve not only the South African Government and authorities but all the possible agents of development, that is, non-governmental organizations, local authorities, grassroots associations and even European non-governmental organizations, because of the important contribution they can make, both on the technical side and in terms of partnership."
"The second is that, in contrast with what has happened in the past, management of the programme must be marked by maximum publicity and transparency, which means that, as our amendments propose, there is a need to reinforce the European Parliament's democratic control of the programme."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mrs Günther for her exceptional work."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Respect for human rights in the European Union in 1994"
"The next item is the report (A4-0223/96) by Mr De Esteban Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on respect for human rights on the European Union in 1994."
"Given the short amount of time left for the debate on respect for human rights I should like, as rapporteur, to hear from Members about how to proceed on this report."
"Do you have any proposal to make?"
"I would prefer first to hear from the political groups."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as I can see, we have twelve minutes left to debate this very important report."
"We could then continue the debate this afternoon, and possibly vote this evening."
"Another variant I have just heard mentioned would be not to have a debate, only a vote."
"It is out of the question that we should only vote on such an important report without previously debating it."
"Now I know that the secretariat has great problems with the agenda."
"We lost half an hour of our time this morning because of a completely pointless debate, and that again encroaches on the quality of the work we should be doing here."
"We really should spare ourselves the kind of rubbish we had to listen to this morning."
"It is an impossible situation when we are put under such pressure of time to discuss a problem that has been under lengthy discussion between the groups in this House, a process extending back over a period of several months, including three committee meetings, and when this problem should now be driven through the House at such breakneck speed."
"I therefore officially request, on behalf of our group, that the debate and vote be deferred to the September part-session in Brussels."
"I know that will give rise to difficulties, but the groups must decide amongst themselves what priority is to be assigned to the human rights report."
"Another topic may simply have to give way."
"There is a proposal for referral to committee."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour?"
"Mrs Roth."
"Mr President, I wish to support the request of the previous speaker from the Socialist Group because I think that the subject of human rights, especially human rights in the European Union, which is covered by Mrs Laura De Esteban Martin's report, is of great importance to this House, also that it has great relevance to our own credibility."
"Having experienced a fair amount of agitation over this issue in the past, this House should not now fail to attribute the required degree of importance to such a report, even if only for the sake of form."
"It would be completely unacceptable if Mrs De Esteban Martin were to start the debate in the quarter of an hour now remaining, followed quickly by a contribution from a PSE spokesman, and the debate were then to be suspended in order to be continued this evening just before the summer recess; we would end up voting on it tomorrow, perhaps with many fewer Members present."
"I do not think that would do any justice at all to this subject: the world looks not only at how the European Parliament deals with human rights in Iran, Turkey and elsewhere, but also at how we handle what happens in our own Union."
"For that reason, I request that this debate be adjourned to the Brussels part-session."
"But I appeal to you, Mr President, when we meet in September, let us not debate this matter at midnight, but after Question Time with the Commission; in other words it should be given a prominent position on the agenda."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Roth."
"Since nobody has spoken against, I put the request for referral to committee to the vote."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)"
"Mr President, if I may take up your time once again, I am glad we have adjourned this report."
"But I appeal to colleagues from all groups to exert their influence on the Bureau in order to ensure that the matter is not simply tacked on to the end of the agenda in Brussels, but that the report can be debated at a prominent stage in the proceedings."
"I consider that to be very important."
"Also, Mr President, I ask that this be recorded in the minutes and that you take the matter up with the Bureau."
"Mr President, I think it would be quite all right to start the debate now."
"Reconstruction aid to former Yugoslavia"
"The next item is the report (A4-0247/96) by Mr Cars, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (COM(96)123-8256/96 - C4-0333/96-96/0096(CNS))."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on which Parliament is now to adopt a position concerns the rules which should govern the disbursement of EU resources for the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia - just that, nothing more and nothing less."
"Our starting point is the Council of Ministers' preliminary decision on the issue."
"This in turn is based on a proposal from the Commission."
"In accordance with the Union's decision-making procedures the Council should, before reaching a final decision on issues such as this, seek the views of Parliament."
"It is surely good for us in Parliament to be reminded of the fact that ultimately it is the Council alone that takes the decisions."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs' proposal contains some valuable ideas, including those on the political conditions for EU aid, on the option of withdrawing aid if the recipients cease to meet the conditions, and on a whole range of issues for which I, as rapporteur, would not be so bold as to take the credit."
"It would almost be true to say that many of the amendments which were approved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs are more the result of the knowledge and the willingness of certain well-known and prominent members of the committee to improve on even the smallest details."
"Please permit me also to express my appreciation of the efforts made by the others who worked on the report with me and by the committee they represent."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, it is one issue and one issue alone which really dominates the present report."
"I know that what I am now saying has the support both of the people who worked on the report with me and of a broad majority of the committee."
"It is a matter of which countries should be given the right and the opportunity to submit tenders and obtain contracts as part of the current aid programme."
"Let me remind you that for the years 1996-1999 this amounts to ECU 400 million, a far from insignificant sum."
"At the suggestion of the Commission the Council of Ministers' preliminary decision was that only companies and organisations in EU Member States and from countries in the former Yugoslavia should have the right to submit tenders."
"Following a proposal made by myself and the others who worked on the report with me the Committee on Foreign Affairs would like to extend this right to include the PHARE countries as well, that is to say those countries of Central and Eastern Europe which have concluded Europe Agreements with the EU and which are now seeking membership."
"There are three strong reasons for this proposal."
"Firstly, tenders could come from PHARE countries which would make it possible to provide more assistance using EU funds for the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia."
"Secondly, companies and economic development in Central and Eastern Europe would receive a boost, and thirdly, some of the funds which the EU is now using for aid to the former Yugoslavia came out of resources which were originally intended for countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I should stress that the Committee on Foreign Affairs attaches very considerable importance to this matter."
"The Committee calls for a conciliation procedure to be opened with the Council of Ministers on its amendments."
"However, the Committee has, at my suggestion, unanimously agreed that if the Council can accept what the Committee and Parliament propose concerning the PHARE countries there would be no further need for the conciliation procedure."
"If, on the other hand, the Council is unable to agree with Parliament on this issue, it would be particularly appropriate for representatives of Parliament immediately to be informed of the Council's reasons and to have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Council."
"All the amendments now being put before the House have already been tabled in committee, debated there and rejected."
"I therefore propose that the House rejects the amendments and approves the proposals made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and myself as rapporteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the way the European Union organizes its reconstruction aid to former Yugoslavia leaves much to be desired."
"We have discussed this problem many times before, and it crops up again in the draft Regulation before us."
"The Regulation seeks to provide the legal basis for rapid and effective aid."
"Not only has it come rather late, when one considers that the money has been available in the budget since the beginning of this year and it has not been possible to spend it!"
"Worse still: this Regulation will make it difficult to provide really prompt and effective aid."
"Anyone who wants to act meaningfully and effectively in aiding former Yugoslavia must seek cooperative and trustworthy partners at local and regional level."
"For example, anyone wishing to help Mayor Radic of Banja Luka to hold out against Karadzic must find a way of supporting him directly."
"That is something the Regulation does not make provision for, and it is a fundamental design fault that it gives precedence to an aid programme directed centrally and organized on a centralized basis."
"The reasons for this can be traced back to the underlying policy."
"The theory is apparently that this is the only way to make the political conditionality of the aid effective."
"I have nothing against this conditionality."
"It is an unavoidable necessity."
"The only thing is that this approach overlooks the fact that the basic prerequisite is missing."
"There are no central political structures and central administrations in operation."
"It is to be hoped that such structures will ultimately be present, as a result of the reconstruction process. But they cannot and must not be made a prerequisite of reconstruction."
"Hence conditionality must be applied in a meaningful way in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular on a local and regional basis."
"For that reason, a high profile on the ground, in terms of the presence of Commission agents, is absolutely indispensable."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control unanimously adopted a proposal to amend the Regulation on those lines."
"Unfortunately, it did not attract majority support in the main reporting committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"My group has therefore reintroduced the amendments in question, and I appeal to you to support them."
"The same applies to our amendment on the annex introduced by the Council, which will turn the Regulation into a complete monster of bureaucracy."
"Instead, the Committee on Budgetary Control recommends that the rules of the Financial Regulation should apply without restriction where invitations to tender are concerned and should also be considered sufficient."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wiersma."
"The debate is suspended and will resume at 3 p.m. We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Votes"
"For reasons of which some of you will be aware, the approval of yesterday's Minutes was postponed."
"I therefore put them to the vote now."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes of the previous sitting)"
"Madam President, given the importance of this subject I should like to make a few specifications about the Spanish version."
"In paragraph 12.4 of the Spanish version there is a sentence missing from the beginning which in Spanish would come out more or less as 'toda actividad de investigación sobre embriones humanos, así como la producción...' ."
"I should also like to draw attention to the translation of Amendment No 21 which was originally drafted in German, for which the translations into Spanish and Italian, at least, are really quite strange and cannot be accepted."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, thank you for your intervention."
"The same perhaps arises for other language versions, particularly for the Swedish version which also requires several corrections."
"It should be made very clear that all the versions will be checked and brought into line with the original version, i.e. to the German version."
"After the vote on Amendment No 32:"
"I should like to say, Madam President, that my machine is not functioning and that I wish to vote for."
"Mrs Poisson, that was only an electronic check and most fortunately has no effect on the vote."
"Having said that, I would be obliged to you if you would let me know immediately when the machines are not working before I declare the vote closed."
"Madam President, I think that Mrs Poisson's remark, if you will allow me to say so, poses a more general technical problem."
"We are seated in a semicircle and no President, given the normal arrangement of the eyes in the human anatomy, can scan the whole of our Assembly."
"This poses an often irritating problem, namely, that requests to speak on points of order, coming mainly from the right of the Assembly, escape the attention of the President."
"In order to overcome this problem, our national parliament, which you know very well Madam President, has provided an official on each side of the President whose function is to observe requests for the floor."
"I believe it would be extremely useful to proceed in this way in this Assembly."
"I do not understand why colleagues are trying to interrupt me."
"There is nothing extraordinary in wishing to defend the rights of the minority."
"Mr Gollnisch, I can tell you that the President takes great care to look carefully in all directions."
"The best proof of this is that I have just called on you to speak."
"Madam President, I am very pleased to propose this oral amendment but have to make it clear that it concerns more particularly Amendment No 11 from the Liberal Group."
"The principle of the oral amendment is that any research on the embryo must be forbidden unless its aim is to help the embryos development."
"And, since I heard just now another oral amendment which must have been submitted to you the words 'and it is forbidden to destroy the embryo' could be added."
"Thus, the oral amendment becomes: ' research on the embryo is forbidden unless it allows the later development of the embryo' , which is logical from the time when only three implanted embryos are authorized."
"And there should also be added: ' destruction of the embryo is forbidden' ."
"Mr Pompidou, let us take one thing at a time."
"You are proposing an oral amendment which in reality applies to all the amendments and to the whole paragraph."
"I think, ladies and gentlemen, that it is preferable for me to ask you if there are any objections to this oral amendment being considered."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"Madam President, as this is a fundamental question which concerns the conscience of each individual, my group has decided that everyone should vote as he thinks fit."
"Very well, Mrs Gebhardt, it is true that this is an important problem and we are all voting according to our consciences."
"Madam President, our main concern through this report and through this vote was, once more, to make it clear to the Commission that we will not accept further cuts in spending on development."
"We see from the supplementary and amending budget that the agreements we reached with the Commission are simply not being applied."
"We have reinstated the budget lines which had been deleted - women and the Third World, environment and the Third World."
"We had agreed with the Commission that further posts should be filled in DG VIII and that the money for these posts, on which we cannot take a decision, should be used by the Commission for DG VIII, so that NGO projects, which at present cannot be implemented because of lack of staff, can go ahead."
"We have to note that these posts have not been created."
"On the contrary, in the next financial year these very posts are to be transferred to DG I. I think that these arrangements must be queried once again in the supplementary and amending budget procedure."
"They conflict with what Parliament has discussed with the Commission."
"This whole process suggests that we are being drawn into something we prevented last year: the Commission is cutting back on funds for development policy in order to promote what I would call a militarized foreign policy."
"Our group does not want that, the Committee on Development and Cooperation does not want that and I personally was opposed to it. I have therefore cast my vote accordingly."
"Brinkhorst report"
"Madam President, I voted against Mr Brinkhorst's report because in reality it seeks yet again to call in question the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"Contrary to what has been said, both by the Committee on Budgets and in this Assembly, the decision of the Court of Justice does not mean that the Council is obliged to come to a decision and to reach agreement with Parliament about this classification."
"By creating a EAGGF reserve of close to ECU 1.4 billion, the rapporteur's real aim this year was in reality to allow the redistribution of unspent appropriations to programmes qualifying for non-compulsory expenditure."
"Now, the wish of the Council of Ministers, which is to cancel these unspent appropriations, should be supported at a time when considerable sacrifices are demanded of Member States - ECU 1 billion refunds for the all 15 Member States, a billion francs for France for example - should be supported, I repeat, in order to play a part in the overall effort to reduce public expenditure."
"Mr Brinkhorst's report has unfortunately the same objectives as Mr Wynn's report last year."
"Its technical objective is simple: rapporteur Brinkhorst wishes to create a reserve from the unused funds of the EAGGF (Guarantee Section)."
"This is a disguised transfer of compulsory expenditure to non-compulsory expenditure, in spite of the opinion of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"Politically, the consequences of creating this reserve are disastrous for agriculture and fisheries."
"In effect, the European Parliament wishes to be the decision-maker for part of the budgetary funds of these two sectors, accounting for more than 50 % of Union expenditure."
"We all know that agriculture now represents no more than 5 % of the electorate in the Union."
"As a result, Members of Parliament will tend to favour interests other than those of agriculture."
"We have to insist here, to all Members present, that agriculture has always been a pillar of Europe."
"Of course, the Common Agricultural Policy is not exempt from criticism."
"Far from it!"
"But would no agricultural policy at all be any better?"
"We do not think so."
"Rather than take away agricultural funds to the advantage of other policies, it is absolutely necessary to use all available Community funds and to use them to best purpose, so that the European Union can continue to be a major world agricultural power and at the same time preserve the unity of its rural communities."
"The balance of our society is at stake."
"Like the rest of my group, I voted against the whole of Mr Brinkhorst's report because it follows the deviant line that part of Parliament is seeking to impose and that we denounce: a deviant line whereby more and more compulsory expenditure is slipped into the category of non-compulsory expenditure and the distribution of powers laid down by the Treaties is surreptitiously changed."
"After all, it is not up to Parliament to replace the Council in deciding the allocation of agricultural and fishery budgets."
"The composition of the European Parliament is such that farmers and fishermen are under-represented in it, whereas the importance of these social categories in terms of direct and indirect employment, economic production, social equilibrium, national and regional development and preservation of the countryside, is absolutely decisive for some of our countries."
"There is thus a great risk that the majority of Members of the European Parliament will give priority to interests other than those of the rural and coastal communities."
"I have a second reason for firmly rejecting the principle of creating a reserve: this is a proposal based on preliminary documents whose data are completely arbitrary: they do not, and cannot, take into account uncertainties in the weather, variations in world currencies and the results of free trade agreements."
"Kittelmann report"
"As we voted against the establishment of a customs union between the EU and Turkey we have, for the sake of consistency, abstained from voting on this report."
"We see no reason to reverse our decision since we can see that political prisoners still exist in Turkey and that the torture of political prisoners continues there."
"The establishment of the customs union has unfortunately not moved Turkey to cease its violations of human rights."
"The EU should impress upon Turkey that it is bound to carry out the pledges it made concerning democracy, human rights, freedom of expression and the release of political prisoners, in response to the requirements set by the EU in connection with the approval of the customs union with Turkey."
"I voted against the customs union in order to have some leverage in negotiations with Turkey on the issue of human rights."
"The conditions imposed on Turkey by the European Parliament when it voted for the customs union on 12 December 1995 must now be met."
"The conditions imposed on Turkey by the EU in connection with the customs union have not been fulfilled. I have therefore voted against the report."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament voted against Mr Kittelmann's report, not because we are against the amendments to the Commission text proposed by the rapporteur, but because we are more than ever opposed to a Customs Union with Turkey."
"Technically the amendments, which the Committee on External Economic Relations also approved in its opinion, are perfectly sensible, if we do not wish to leave the Commission and the Council free to take autocratic decisions on the Joint Committee, but seek to ensure a minimum degree of control by the European Parliament."
"But these proposals for technical improvements, which make sense within the framework stated, do not alter anything of substance in the politically wrong premise of this Customs Union."
"The last time this House voted on the Customs Union - seven months ago, in the middle of December last year - is still fresh in my memory."
"The chorus of voices from almost all political groups, including the Social Democrats, was in favour of the Customs Union, because it was the only way to support the Çiller Government in the elections and to prevent Turkey from sliding into Islamic fundamentalism."
"Today the Islamists there are in the government - and Mrs Çiller has smoothed the path for them into it."
"Even before the passing of power to the Islamists, Turkey was a police state with some of the distinguishing marks of a military dictatorship."
"Now it is becoming a religious dictatorship as well."
"A further factor of oppression has been added, but it is apparently not thought that that will have any consequences."
"I was in Istanbul myself from 1 to 3 June, with a delegation of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the occasion of the HABITAT II Conference."
"We wanted to shield the Human Rights Association, which seeks to highlight the brutal repression of the autonomy movement in Kurdistan, by our presence and support it publicly."
"Even as parliamentarians, we were constantly spied upon and harassed in Istanbul."
"Claudia Roth was questioned by the police for over an hour after she had held a press conference."
"One group worker was detained for over an hour because she had distributed information about our events at the NGO Forum."
"There must be no customs union with a state which does not respect even the most basic rights, such as freedom of opinion, and which wages a dirty war against part of its own population, against a whole region."
"The European Parliament should therefore take no further steps in the wrong direction and wait until democracy and peace have returned to Turkey, before taking any decisions that will give effect to the Customs Union."
"Pelttari report"
"Madam President, its failure to adopt the Pelttari report brings shame on the European Parliament."
"This is a black day for Parliament."
"The fact that the House has failed to address a question of such importance as the draft Bioethics Convention is a disgrace."
"The draft Bioethics Convention, as originally conceived by the steering committee, meant a relativization of human rights."
"It rightly unleashed a wave of revulsion in the Member States."
"It is a sign of moral destitution that we did not take a stand on a convention under which, for example, research on persons incapable of consent would continue to be allowed."
"For this opens the way to the circumvention of human rights."
"There are also no clear provisions in the draft Bioethics Convention to prohibit research on genetic determinism."
"This leaves the door wide open to the breeding of laboratory human beings."
"Also, the draft Bioethics Convention allows scope for disposable embryo research by the back door."
"Of course, it is only to be permitted when adequate safeguards are provided."
"This does not go beyond vague assurances, however, since the draft convention says absolutely nothing about the form these safeguards would take."
"The Pelttari report would have been a chance to send a very clear signal to the parliamentary assembly and to the Council of Europe, saying that this draft convention must be rejected."
"By failing to adopt the report, we have unfortunately thrown away this chance."
"We could have made it clear through our resolution that we intend to oppose the devaluing of human rights, for established human rights must not be called into question."
"The draft Bioethics Convention, on the other hand, does not safeguard human rights; on the contrary, it positively legitimizes their devaluation."
"Hence I think it is a scandal, a sign of moral destitution and a disgrace to the European Parliament that we have failed to adopt this excellent report, which would have sent a clear signal for the rejection of the convention."
"Madam President, it is a great pity that Parliament has not adopted the Pelttari report, which expressed reservations about this draft convention, so very dangerous in its present state."
"There are undoubtedly some excellent principles to be found in this draft convention, but it refers the most important questions to protocols whose ultimate contents are not known to us and which arouse the deepest concern, particularly as regards the consent of incapacitated people."
"Parliament had expressed reservations, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights supported, and it is a great pity that, when we voted, we did not endorse these reservations in order to protect the consent of incapacitated people."
"Similarly, in the case of the protection of embryos, the question is again referred to the protocol."
"So what will the CDBI, the body responsible for drawing up the protocol, do?"
"We do not know."
"I associate myself with what is said in items 3, 4 and 5 of paragraph 12: these should be used as guidelines in drafting the protocol, failing which there would effectively be a real violation of human rights in a matter of the greatest importance."
"In the case of artificial insemination, the Pelttari report emphasizes a very important point: only embryos for implantation should be generated, otherwise it will really be a matter of the freezing, or frozen preservation of human beings, of actual experimentation, even though we know that, for mice themselves on which experiments are carried out, there are after-effects and problems resulting from the freezing."
"As for the genome, here again it is not possible for a few human beings, be they experts or scientists, to have the outrageous power to intervene with the germ line, thereby calling into question the very future of the human species. As regards action on genes concerning organs, we are in total agreement but, for genes involved in the transmission to descendants, it is unacceptable that any human being whatsoever should have the power to act."
"This is exploitation of human by human and is much more serious than economic, social or any other type of exploitation."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that, here, it is really a question of civilization, of basic human values, on which the European Parliament, like the Council of Europe, has a duty to take a stand."
"We should not err by doing nothing."
"Science and our consciences are at one on this issue: the Pelttari report made it possible to honour both."
"As a result, I am expressing great regret and great sorrow on behalf of my group."
"As politicians we have a responsibility to pose the questions and to suggest answers but the implications of human gene technology reach into every corner of people's private lives."
"These are not matters which the European Parliament or the Council of Europe can simply pronounce upon from on high."
"They are matters which require the consent of society."
"The report calls for the widest possible public debate and participation in order to form a consensus."
"This debate should take place before, not after, we produce a statement of what is right and what is wrong."
"The debate has shown that the issues go to the core of the way society chooses to view itself and the conflict which this technology introduces."
"Reproductive rights, abortion, genetic testing, embryo research, gene therapies, genetic privacy, the rights of incapacitated people - all these and more are delicate and sensitive questions."
"We will be offered simplistic solutions to problems that we may not even know we had."
"Genetic determinism - the concept that everything about our physical and mental make-up can be identified by reference to our DNA - is a most dangerous road."
"We will be under pressure to use the technology to 'normalize' humankind by selecting only those characteristics and traits which reflect some 'ideal' notion of humanity."
"We risk creating a 'monoculture of humankind' ."
"It is unacceptable to trade in human embryos or to create embryos for research."
"Research on human beings without their consent must only be carried out for their direct benefit."
"The rejection of this report by Parliament is shameful."
"The use of biology, biotechnology and medicine and research in these fields confronts us human beings with some difficult ethical questions."
"In biotechnology developments are proceeding extremely quickly and it is a field which is so complex and advanced that there is no public debate on the subject - dialogue and debate remain the exclusive preserve of researchers (who often disagree)."
"If we are to have a broad public debate - and this is essential in respect of an issue as crucial for humankind as genetic engineering - more time will be needed - a moratorium, especially as regards applied research in genetic engineering."
"The precautionary principle - concern for future generations - must weigh more heavily than the rapid development of genetic engineering."
"Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industrial areas in Europe."
"It also gives rise to difficult ethical problems."
"What, for example, happens to those human embryos which are 'left over' from artificial fertilization?"
"Is it permissible to use them for research purposes?"
"Or can the genome be changed by any specific gene?"
"How far dare we or should we go in genetic testing?"
"Under the Council of Europe's draft declaration, the parties are supposed to protect the dignity and identity of the human being and guarantee a right of self-determination for all in the areas of biology and medicine."
"However, immediately afterwards, the declaration states confusingly that the welfare of the individual should be paramount alongside the exclusive interests of society and science."
"How can these two be placed side by side in the same sentence?"
"Does this mean that if the results of research are of great importance, greater risks can be taken in carrying it out?"
"The articles of the declaration also take up a position on consent procedure."
"The individual should give his or her free consent to experiments."
"However, there are people who do not have sufficient mental or physical capacity to understand the experiments."
"There is also a problem that it is in any case not healthy always to understand what the doctor is saying."
"The Green Group voted in favour of the report because it is important that we now take up a clear critical position towards this international agreement."
"Nevertheless, Mr Pelttari's report could have taken up a much firmer position."
"For example, the lack of any reference to genome research is dangerous."
"There is a need for agreement and a bioethical guideline to prevent us from creating human beings as uniform, functional monsters, in the same way as we do with animals, such as the bundle of muscle in Belgium vaguely reminiscent of a cow, barely holding up a mass of beef on wobbling legs."
"We need a public debate on bioethics now."
"I am voting for the report, which deals with very important ethical issues surrounding an area of research which is expanding extremely rapidly."
"If the new technology concerned is not to escape from our control it is now high time that a proper, strict framework was established for the conduct of the research involved."
"Research involving embryos in particular is an area where ethics and not technology must determine the limits."
"It is also totally unacceptable that genetic screening should be carried out in order to produce offspring with 'desirable' aptitudes."
"Undoubtedly genetic engineering can help people with serious, at present incurable illnesses, but to modify human beings' genetic make-up for other reasons is completely reprehensible and risks undermining the principle that all people are of equal worth."
"The precautionary principle should obviously be applied in the genetic engineering field."
"Finally, I should like to stress that the debate on bioethics which concerns so many people must be conducted openly and with the involvement of the public at large, so as to ensure that any committee of experts which may be established does not drift away from generally accepted ethical principles."
"There was a time when people were the masters of technology and when the needs of mankind controlled the development of technology and research."
"Today, in 1996, the situation is often reversed."
"Technology and research lead a life of their own - often irrespective of whether any real need has been established."
"Research into genetic engineering is one example of this."
"It is also a cautionary example of a 'development' , the consequences and risks of which we today have no way of knowing."
"Perhaps our children and grandchildren will have every right to curse us in the future."
"In the current situation a moratorium would be the best way of creating the time and space for a broad, public debate, before any further decisions are taken."
"The Pelttari report was an attempt, in the present situation, to curb and gain tighter control over developments and I therefore voted for it."
"It is extremely regrettable that the report did not receive the support of Parliament."
"The subject on which the European Parliament has to vote today is a very delicate one that has, in various ways and at various times, stirred the imagination and, of course, also the conscience of many scientists, artists, philosophers and writers."
"The story of Faust and his pact with the devil, the tale of Frankenstein, the wizard's apprentice, and the film 'Blade Runner' all come to mind as just a few of the more outstanding examples."
"And a passage of the Bible also comes to mind: ' Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth' ."
"Of course, new experimental techniques based on a deeper knowledge of the qualities and weaknesses of our genes and those of other animals open new and enticing horizons for medical research."
"But they also allow the possibility of aberrant developments that are a threat to humanity and the entire earth and are difficult to control."
"For this reason, I welcome any attempt to establish a code of conduct in the field of bioethics."
"And the Greens have, in committee, made a practical contribution to adjusting the sights."
"More specifically, we believe:"
"that the production of human embryos should be absolutely prohibited on all grounds and not just for research purposes; -incapacitated people must be guaranteed protection against all forms of exploitation; -as regards antenatal treatment, women must have the ultimate and sole right to decide; -the intimate genetic make-up of each individual must be rigorously respected.Hopefully, the Bioethics Convention will help ensure that the 'gothic' fantasies I mentioned earlier remain nothing more than powerful literary inventions."
"It is because of our knowledge of history that the establishment of rules for bioethics is still a problem for society at the close of the millennium, and a most passionate problem, because it touches the unconscious roots of life and death and, especially, the view that human beings have of themselves."
"The future path of human gene technology is full of ethical and practical problems."
"In the next few years we will have almost complete technical knowledge of the make-up of the human genome, but we will probably still not have an understanding of the complex interactions of the human mind and body or of the inter-relationship between people and their living environment."
"The debate has shown that the issues go to the core of the way society chooses to view itself and the conflicts which this technology introduces."
"Reproductive rights, abortion, genetic testing, embryo research, gene therapies, genetic privacy, the rights of incapacitated people - all these and more are delicate and sensitive questions."
"We will be offered simplistic solutions to problems that we may not even know we had."
"Genetic determinism - the concept that everything about our physical and mental make-up can be identified by reference to our DNA - is a most dangerous road."
"We will be under pressure to use the technology to 'normalize' humankind by selecting only those characteristics and traits which reflect some ideal notion of humanity."
"We risk creating a 'monoculture of mankind' ."
"It is a feature of our obsession with technical progress that if we have information and new techniques, we must use them."
"It is true that we cannot unlearn knowledge, but in a mature society it would be good to think that we can exercise a high degree of responsible choice over what we do with it."
"Put simply, even if we can do something, should we?"
"As politicians we have a responsibility to pose the questions and to suggest answers but the implications of human gene technology reach into every corner of people's private lives."
"These are not matters which the European Parliament or the Council of Europe can simply pronounce upon from on high."
"They are matters which require the consent of society."
"The report calls for the widest possible public debate and participation in order to form a consensus."
"This debate should take place before, not after, we produce a statement of what is right and what is wrong."
"I believe that we have only just begin to scratch these issues and although this report defines some of the ground, it is a long way from producing an ethical and philosophical framework which will guide us into the next century."
"For all these reasons, it was of paramount importance for the European Parliament to take up a position on this subject - even though I was not unreservedly happy with every point in the report."
"The disappointment at the fact that, once again, we stand without a voice before a subject on which we should have been heard loud and clear is consequently great."
"And I do not understand the reasons why those colleagues, particularly from the ranks of the PSE, who voted against it, have denied this House a critical standpoint on the draft Bioethics Convention of the Council of Europe."
"As a result, the convention has gained validity, and the painstaking detailed work to improve it has suffered a grave setback."
"Despite this, that work will continue."
"I should like to express my vote in favour of the Pelttari report on the draft Bioethics Convention, or rather, on 'human rights, biology and medicine' , and stress the need for further clarifications and significant amendments to the draft text."
"In particular, I should like to stress the need to guarantee the free, conscious and sufficiently informed agreement of any person undergoing medical intervention, especially in the case of biomedical experimentation."
"And more especially, when the intention is to treat an incapacitated person who cannot give that agreement, intervention is acceptable only if it is advantageous to the person directly concerned and only if due agreement is given by that person's legal guardian."
"It is also essential to emphasize that human experiments must never be performed in return for payment, because any commercialization of the human body is inadmissible; and the same should apply to donations of organs and tissue."
"Experiments on embryos should perhaps be banned, and the production of embryos for experiments should certainly be banned."
"The only acceptable experiments are those whose objective is to protect the health of either the unborn child or the mother or both, without prejudice to the woman's right to decide."
"No intervention should have the purpose of eugenic selection or manipulation."
"And finally, no experiment should affect the genetic line, with altered characteristics being passed on to later generations."
"For these reasons, the draft convention will need to be amended."
"This means that the Pelttari report needs to be supported as a way of keeping open the debate on these issues, whose importance for the future of humanity means that we must not make any vague or hasty decisions."
"The discoveries and perspectives laid open by scientific developments and their applications create an urgent social need to protect human rights and dignity."
"This necessity applies particularly to scientific achievements in the field of biotechnology, especially in the field of genetics, which on the one hand offer vast possibilities in the area of health for the prevention and treatment of disease, but which at the same time harbour significant dangers of deviating from the true mission of medicine and science, with incalculable consequences for the future of mankind itself."
"Interventions in the genetic code aiming to develop selected properties for the creation of individuals and populations suitable for particular uses and services can be described as a form of eugenics and create huge issues of deviation from mankind's destiny, with unforeseen results for the future of humanity, since the results of scientific experience so far are not enough to be considered trustworthy in relation to the compatibility of genetically modified organisms with the environment."
"It is of particular concern to us that a subject such as this, with extremely serious consequences and ethical dimensions, is mainly approached from the standpoint of economics and commerce."
"Biotechnological products are used not solely on the basis of scientific criteria, but also to serve the need for movement of the available capital and to make profits."
"Biotechnological development is already taking place in major centres of large economic potential where the participation of specialist scientists determining in the final utilization of discoveries is not always definitive."
"The procedures and legal framework are formulated on the basis of business criteria and are essentially concerned only with the multiplication of economic activities, the creation of a market and the securing of competitive investments."
"We think it is essential that in parallel with biotechnology, branches of research should be developed and supported to assess and study the probable risks associated with biotechnological and genetic discoveries in relation to man and the environment. Detailed studies should be carried out and ethical rules formulated, which govern both research and applications in the field of biotechnology, and regulatory orders should be established within the scope of a legal framework that will protect humanity against unreasoned and improper use of the results of biotechnology and genetic engineering."
"The European Union is a moral entity with heavy responsibilities to its own citizens and the citizens of other countries, both those countries which have applied to join the European Union and other regions of the world, which look towards it."
"Given that the respect of the human being lies at the very heart of the democratic spirit of the West it is unjustifiable that we should continue with a situation whereby the European Union is not a party to the European Convention on Human Rights or the Bioethics Convention."
"Laws and treaties exist to serve people and not the contrary."
"If the Treaty does not allow for accession then the Treaty should be changed and this is the moment to do so."
"What is important is that we should not continue to put on for the world the sad spectacle where the Union is very swift to defend its interests but very slow to defend its principles."
"The vote against by the European Parliament, given that this text is unsatisfactory, should not be confused with our duty to make an active contribution to the regulation of a vital matter for European research in the coming years."
"Many a colleague, particularly from the south of the EU, will find it unenlightened to argue in terms of categories such as respect for creation, the humanum , and the like when discussing this question."
"I on the other hand - after the emergence of the ecological paradigm - consider it to be quite the opposite: a central category of an enlightenment, which also strives for enlightenment about itself and which, in respect of the dangers and risks incurred by it, can no longer rely on a metaphysical belief in future technological problem-solving."
"Rather it is important, here and now, to furnish sufficient proof that illimitable risks can be positively excluded - instead of being somehow concealed within the ill-defined category of the residual risk."
"The core of responsible scientific rationality lies precisely in this conscious and responsible acceptance of the burden of proof - not in taking comfort in some blind faith that future technical advances will be able to solve all problems!"
"Caudron report"
"The dramatic situation in the steelmaking sector, which was in the past one of the cornerstones of the development of Europe's economy, cannot be doubted."
"During the past twenty years over 500, 000 jobs have been lost in the branch, and thousands of enterprises have closed down."
"In my country, just recently, within the scope of a new and broad restructuring, the largest firm in the branch announced the closure of two departments and the redundancy of 250 workers, with the result that those still employed number only 500, compared with 3, 000 before the successive restructurings that have taken place."
"There are also fears that the company may close down entirely."
"What is the attitude of the EU towards this situation?"
"In this sector too, the EU is pursuing a policy of non-support and essentially contributing to the dissolution of the branch, to the benefit of major monopolistic interests in third countries."
"On the other hand, it forbids Member States to adopt a branch policy."
"Within the framework of the policy on State support, it makes approval of such support depend on the adoption of restructuring programmes whose basic aim is to reduce further the productive capacity and to bring about drastic cuts in jobs."
"At the same time, it adopts no measures to deal with the problem of uncontrolled steel imports from third countries that are implementing dumping policies, with the result that situations of unfair competition are created to the cost of Community production."
"Action to deal with existing serious problems, such as the development of productivity and competitiveness, cannot be used as an excuse to do away with any notion of protection for working people, or to justify widespread recourse to part-time working or subcontracting."
"Experience shows that restructuring which does not take into account the rights of working people, can have no substantive results."
"The EU must adopt direct measures to deal with the problem of mass imports of steelmaking products in the branch from countries that implement dumping practices, either by concluding related agreements or by applying the defensive measures recognised in the context of international trade exchanges."
"It must make use of the possibilities existing at an international level to develop exports, mainly to the developing countries."
"It must adopt measures to support investment in the branch, mainly in sectors related to the production of new products, and measures to encourage demand for Community steel products, mainly in sectors such as building and public works."
"The stubborn continuation of practices and choices condemned by experience can only result in an exacerbation of the crisis and in the withering of one of industry's most dynamic branches."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, that a restructuring of the steel industry is necessary, inter alia in order to solve environmental problems and the social dumping and unemployment which accompany industrial decline."
"However, it is my opinion that it is up to each Member State itself to judge and decide whether it wishes to support its steel industry or not."
"Member States must be able to draw the dividing lines as regards social, regional and/or production support."
"Fernández-Albor report"
"Madam President, I was forced to abstain, although in my opinion the basic premise of the report is correct."
"The European Union's power to act in the areas of foreign and security policy must be reinforced, as the sad example of Bosnia shows."
"However, the report suffers from two failings: firstly, it does not admit NATO's position as the cornerstone of Europe's security structure."
"It is rather remarkable that the report on the CSFP does not mention NATO at all."
"It is distant from reality, particularly since I-For and the CJTF are such important parts of the European security structure and since France has returned or is returning to the administrative structures of NATO."
"Secondly, the report does not make sufficiently clear the importance of neutrality as a part of Europe's developing security system."
"Neutrality is not necessarily an ancient dogma carved on stone tablets, but in the current situation it is a positive element in the stability of Europe, particularly northern Europe."
"From this point of view the report also contradicts Mrs Maij-Weggen's report on which we voted when we discussed the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Madam President, we Austrian Social Democrats are very pleased finally to have been able to vote for this report because, after the adoption of amendments, a security policy perspective which in our opinion is dangerous, risky and, more especially, unacceptable to our country no longer represents the opinion of this House."
"We are not in favour of the continuation of the Cold War by other means; we favour a new start in security policy free of preconceptions."
"This new start must not lead us into military blocs bristling with weapons, but only to a new kind of common security system for Europe."
"This text now explicitly recognizes that we can learn from different forms of security policy experience, especially that of the neutral states, and that has enabled us to vote for this report."
"Madam President, the Austrian Social Democrats are convinced that the solution of the security problems Europe undoubtedly has can only be reliably sought in the doubtless difficult creation of a pan-European security system."
"Such a system, in particular, must not regard Russia as an adversary but as a partner, and it must be applicable to Europe in the geographic sense."
"Such a system will be capable of achieving what, in the view of all the experts, simply extending the existing military blocs and tying them in with the common foreign and security policy will certainly not bring about, namely the creation of greater security for Europe."
"A European military bloc extending to the Russian border, on the other hand, will mean less, not more security for this continent."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental question we must ask ourselves is: what kind of Europe have we in mind for the future?"
"Is it a Europe vying for the possession of nuclear weapons, which regards the countries surrounding it as dangerous foes and deals with them accordingly?"
"Is it a Europe that behaves as though the Cold War had never ended and now rejoices in the fact that the line of defence against the 'enemy' has receded a little?"
"Or is it a Union functioning as the strong core of a comprehensive European security system and pursuing an effective common foreign policy which regards neighbouring states, not as hostile powers, but as security policy partners?"
"This is the only security policy concept that we Austrian Social Democrats can consider - not least on the basis of the experience we have had with our nationality policy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria has a good and successful tradition of neutrality."
"We Social Democrats have never regarded neutrality as a strategy of remaining aloof from developments, but as a political duty to act even in difficult conflict situations on the basis of a commitment to peace without loss of independence."
"We also do not view our neutrality as constituting any barrier to active participation and initiative-taking in a common security policy of the Union and to honouring those obligations of solidarity that are incumbent on every Member of this Union."
"We know only too well that the outline conditions of world politics within which our neutrality functions are different to what they were a decade ago."
"But, to us, neutrality does not mean inflexibility, and I think we have demonstrated in our approach to the European conflicts of recent years that neutrality in the new circumstances is also capable of redefinition."
"Madam President, the Austrian Social Democrats are convinced that the security policy experience gained by our country and its people from our neutrality stance has been positive, not only in historical terms."
"This experience still has its value in present-day terms and, by dint of that updated value, is still able to determine our security policy."
"We Austrian Social Democrats concede that other countries, like us, have gained security policy experience of their own, which they also consider positive and on which they intend to draw for future needs."
"But it is just not the case that one security policy concept, namely NATO membership, has since 1989 more or less won the contest and the other, namely neutrality, has lost."
"Europe must learn from both concepts, and I believe it will gain from that."
"Madam President, it is already worrying enough that the Budget Office of the US Congress, in the event that NATO is enlarged to extend as far as the borders of Russia, estimates the additional costs arising up to the year 2010 at $18.9 billion for the USA, $54 billion for the existing NATO members in Europe and $51.8 billion for the new members in Eastern Europe."
"It is even more worrying, however, when the Budget Office then notes that, even with this enormous cost burden of over $124 billion, effective military protection cannot be provided at all for the Baltic States, Romania and the Ukraine and only limited protection for the other Eastern Europe states."
"Such an admission of the non-viability of a security policy concept of this kind must surely encourage us to seek alternative concepts."
"We Austrian Social Democrats in the European Parliament regard this search for a new security policy concept for Europe as one of the main tasks of European politics."
"Madam President, we Austrian Social Democrats want to see the European Parliament make an effective contribution to the search for a comprehensive, forward-looking security policy concept."
"Today's vote was a step in that direction."
"By adopting the amendments of the Social Democratic Group, this House has turned aside from continuing the outworn concept of the Cold War."
"We are happy that reference to a common nuclear deterrent could be removed from the report, that the report reflected not only the historical experience of NATO but also the positive historical experience of neutrality and that no one-sided emphasis was placed on military security."
"We Austrian Social Democrats advocate a modern comprehensive security concept."
"We will participate actively and in a spirit of solidarity to the further development of an effective common foreign and security policy in Europe, but on the basis of a comprehensive security policy."
"We are pleased that our standpoint on the amendment of paragraph 21 was listened to."
"This was crucial if we were to vote for the report as a whole."
"On the other hand, it was a shame that our Amendment No 7 was not sympathetically received."
"The proposal of course explained that security policy, including international relations, economic relations, trade, aid and cooperation with neighbouring countries, comprises much more and is much more important than defence policy."
"A common security policy should be aimed at resolving conflicts rather than fighting them out militarily."
"We should like once again to state that it is a common peace policy with a common system for the prevention of conflicts that we need in Europe."
"Although the European Union may be an economic giant, it is regrettably a political dwarf on the world stage."
"The reason for this contrast is quite simple."
"We have a defective procedure for developing a cohesive and coherent common foreign and security policy."
"This current procedure requires unanimity."
"This means that one Member State can effectively ensure that no common policy is agreed."
"The emphasis is therefore on the brake rather than the engine room."
"The consequence has been that at times of international crisis the EU has been totally impotent."
"Either we had a weak, ineffectual policy or no policy at all."
"And to make matters worse Member States often spoke with different voices."
"I hope that the IGC resolves this matter by agreeing on the introduction of qualified majority voting in the CFSP area to ensure that in fact we do have a policy and are able to implement it."
"Eriksson and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm, Lindholm and Schörling (V), in writing."
"(SV) We have nothing against constructive civil intergovernmental cooperation between EU Member States where this is better able than other forms of foreign policy cooperation to foster peace, democracy and human rights in the rest of the world."
"However, we cannot support the manifestly all-embracing objective of the Fernández-Albor report which is evidently to establish the EU as an interventionist military superpower (and a nuclear one at that) which, using a modern variation on the gunboat diplomacy of the past, is intended to participate in a kind of competition for world domination."
"We also oppose the ambition which is evident from this and from other reports to charge EU institutions with international responsibilities which are already vested in existing international organisations of which all the EU Member States are members, such as the UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The Member States of the EU should instead work constructively within these bodies to make them better able to carry out their responsibilities."
"We consider it obvious that the international peace system should be a comprehensive one, which is true in respect of the UN and OSCE (within its field) but can never be true of the EU."
"An effective peace system for the over 50 states in Europe cannot be based on an EU with 15 Member States or for that matter on an EU enlarged, in accordance with current plans, to at most 27 Members."
"We believe that it is a strength that the Member States of the EU can unanimously adopt common positions and decide on common measures."
"Clear and unanimous action by the EU in favour of peace, reconciliation, conflict management, cooperation and support for sustainable development is a positive thing for Europe and the rest of the world."
"We do not share the view of the majority that 1995 saw far too little progress on the common foreign and security policy."
"That the EU's 15 Member States agreed on 106 declarations, 13 common positions and 10 joint actions should be seen as a positive result of intergovernmental cooperation founded on the unanimous decision-making procedure."
"The European Parliament's decision in connection with the Fernández-Albor report demonstrates a lack of respect for the non-aligned Member States."
"The European Parliament should rather set great store by and respect the Member States' different security policy choices."
"We vehemently oppose turning the EU into a military alliance."
"We believe that in the report the European Parliament is seriously over-interpreting the EU's objective as regards the common foreign and security policy as laid down in Article J.4."
"We consider that the plans to create a military alliance with mutual defence obligations within the framework of EU cooperation are completely the wrong way to go."
"This is all the more evident as a result of France's decision once again to participate fully in NATO cooperation."
"The responsibility for issuing binding military security guarantees in respect of its member countries should rest with NATO in the future too."
"We do not believe that a successful common foreign and security policy requires a common defence policy, let alone a common defence, in order to be successful."
"On the contrary, the common foreign and security policy is strengthened by the different choices made by the Member States as regards security policy."
"Lasting common security can only be established through cooperation between democratic states which is based on trust."
"Common security in Europe can only be established in collaboration with a democratic Russia and with the USA."
"The fora for cooperation where the USA, Russia and the other countries of Europe meet, such as the OSCE and the Partnership for Peace should therefore form the basis for the establishment of common security in our part of the world."
"As the Fernández-Albor report on progress on the common foreign and security policy approaches the subject from a perspective completely different to that we have described we voted against the report as a whole."
"Abduction of children"
"The increasing number of abductions of the underaged is yet another of the many problems faced by children both in the European Union and in other countries. Children are the citizens of our present and future society."
"Society has a long-term responsibility to extend, support and protect the rights of children. The development of activities related to the rights of children and to satisfying their needs must be a political priority."
"The increase of sex tourism, the sale of organs for transplants, the development of pornography via electronic computers, the exchange of pornographic material with underage protagonists and in many cases the trade in children themselves for the purpose of sexual exploitation and brutalization by members of international networks, are issues of daily concern to twentieth century society."
"The freedom of movement and establishment of working people between the Member States of the EU and the continually increasing flow of immigrants from third countries, have led to the birth of more and more children from parents of different nationalities."
"In the event of divorce, existing national family laws are unable to solve issues relating to custody and the protection of children, and to the rights of children to maintain contact with the parent that has not undertaken custody, with the result that we often hear about the abduction of children by their own parents."
"The UNO Convention on the rights of children, in common with the recent Conventions of the Hague and the Convention of the Council of Europe in Luxembourg on the abduction of children, have proved ineffectual."
"Children are the first victims of armed conflict, economic recession and cuts in the economy."
"Activities should concentrate on the prevention of difficult situations instead of trying to deal with the exceptional circumstances and problems that arise every time."
"We must adopt all necessary measures to protect children particularly in former Yugoslavia, to avoid a repetition of the appalling trade in children that happened in Greece during and after the end of the Civil War when an entire network was organised for the abduction of children who were to be sold in America."
"It should be our concern to cover the basic needs of children, to adopt all necessary initiatives at national, Community and international level for the promotion of harmonised policies to safeguard the rights of children, and to make available resources sufficient for the promotion and support of those policies, so that the rights of children will become a reality both in Europe and in the rest of the world."
"The Danish social democrats support the idea of extending the Brussels Convention to include the area of family law."
"We are not in favour of harmonizing the rules of family law, but we should agree on some fundamental matters, for example that cases should be dealt with where the child is living, so that the child is able to be heard."
"Our starting-point should be that the interests of the child are taken into account as far as possible."
"We should also ensure that cooperation agreements are established with third countries in this area."
"I wish to explain my vote for this joint resolution because I think it is absolutely necessary to harmonize legislative procedures Community-wide on such a delicate subject as that of the abduction of children, as a result of the violation of custody in Member States."
"Especially since this is the sector of the population whose rights are most vulnerable and who very often are totally dependent on court decisions which cannot always take account of all the circumstances surrounding a particular case, I insist on the need to give greater scope to this resolution, calling for the revision and extension of the legal instruments at our disposal and making them explicit in this resolution, such that they include extremes such as leaving the conjugal home or even the country of residence because of ill-treatment, harassment or discrimination, directed either against the child or children or the parent, and that special attention is paid to the causes behind each case of abduction so as to guarantee legal aid based on the respect of human rights, women's rights and children's rights."
"The harmonization of these laws and rights must be the basis of all legal provisions for this purpose."
"McCartin report"
"Madam President, I should first like to congratulate Mr McCartin, who has produced an excellent report on a subject which should be close to our hearts, not simply because it concerns 600, 000 producers whose income is still falling, but because there has been great injustice to shepherds who are part of our identity - and I am not thinking simply about Giono, Alphonse Daudet, about transhumance, sheep tracks and causses - and who play a fundamental role in the balance of disadvantaged regions, whether it be in Larzac, la Mancha in Spain or Deux-Sèvres with goat rearing."
"It is very unjust because we are short of sheep."
"The French herd has fallen from 30 million head of sheep to 8 million head."
"In France, we are only 50 % self-sufficient, and in the European Community only 80 %."
"We import 250, 000 tonnes against exports of 5000 tonnes, and we have created an anti-sheep mechanism!"
"When there are more than 63 million head of sheep, there is a stabilizing mechanism, there are penalties, and quotas."
"Mr Debatisse even proposed fixing an electronic chip in the ear of every sheep to monitor them by satellite!"
"The European Community Court of Justice refused to consider that the wool from sheep was an agricultural product, which would at least have produced some additional income."
"So I ask that we do justice to the shepherds, who had managed to make a move towards what was going to be a fundamental part of our identity, and I also ask the European Court of Auditors in its turn to stop thinking that ECU 1 per kilo is too dear."
"For sheep are firebreaks and contribute actively to both organic farming and a balanced environment in the most disadvantaged regions."
"We do not agree with the basic criticism by the Court of Auditors of the alleged explosion in spending."
"On the other hand, we do agree with the criticism that the Member States have failed to meet their obligations, making it almost impossible for the EU to administer the market organization."
"Against this background, we regard a general tightening-up of the market organization as essential to enable intervention measures to be implemented within it."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0890/96 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); -B4-0900/96 by Mr Macartney and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; -B4-0908/96 by Mr Piquet and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on negotiations on the nuclear test ban treaty; -B4-0935/96 by Mrs McKenna and others, on behalf of the Green Group, on the nuclear test ban treaty; -B4-0945/96 by Mr Wiersma and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; -B4-0950/96 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the European People's Party, on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Ladies and gentlemen, I have just made one of my biggest mistakes ever while in the chair."
"As I gave the floor to Mr Bertens you all saw that he was leaving the Chamber. I hope that Mr Macartney will not leave and will use his one and a half minutes to address you."
"Thank you, Mr Macartney."
"You have the floor."
"Mr President, I am delighted to step into the breach."
"I thought that in your generosity you would give me the Liberal Democrats' allocation of time as well, seeing as I had helped to save their bacon."
"However, seriously, I think this is one of the issues on which a very wide spectrum of this House, if not the entire House, can unite."
"Even those of us who are very critical of the nuclear powers within the European Union, the French and the British, can, I think, make common cause on this issue."
"I have many times asked people who support the nuclear deterrent held by the United Kingdom, who they were going to use it against, and the answer is usually 'nobody' , in which case I ask them why they don't just abolish it."
"The same argument applies to the French nuclear deterrent."
"However, the justification is always given that with the nuclear deterrent, with the nuclear weapon, you have a seat at the top table, you can influence events in the wider world, and so I think in the European Union we want in particular to ask the UK and France to use that influence and, with all of us behind them, to say, in particular to the Chinese that they must stop testing nuclear weapons."
"This testing of nuclear weapons is an abomination, it threatens the environment, it threatens the vulnerable communities on the periphery of their own country, and just as we condemned Jacques Chirac when he came to this Chamber in unequivocal terms for what was happening in the French Polynesian testing, we do the same to China."
"Let us have a united front on this and I would be very happy indeed to either propose or second the joint resolution."
"Mr President, I also wish to sign up to this joint resolution since from the beginning it was a serious mistake to make nuclear weapons and they are a danger not only when they are used but also because they affect many generations after."
"It is inconceivable that, after the end of the cold war, we should continue to test nuclear bombs when it is clear that they are a hazard for the whole of mankind."
"It is inconceivable that France should have continued its nuclear tests and that the United Kingdom should continue to take part in US nuclear programmes or that China should still explode atomic bombs."
"That is why it is urgent that, within the timetable set by the General Assembly of the United Nations, there should be ratification of the full test ban on nuclear weapons."
"In a climate as negative as the present one, we must shed a ray of hope for mankind."
"The European Parliament would be making a primordial contribution to that step if, by adopting this resolution, it made it known to the General Assembly of the United Nations so that a new step for mankind can be taken."
"Mr President, these dreadful weapons of destruction have hung over all our heads for a very long time now this century."
"Many of us have been involved in trying to find some way out of the planetary catastrophe that could ensue."
"Therefore, it is really important that we pursue in good faith to bring the negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to fruition."
"It is really important that we send out a signal from this House to ensure that they move speedily, because we are concerned at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to meet the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations."
"This House must send out a clear signal here today that we in the European Parliament, representing the citizens, want them to work in good faith."
"I particularly would like to ask the UK, France and the United States - although we only have the opportunity in this Parliament to directly address the UK and France - to constrain and curb nuclear weapons development."
"We do not need to develop them: we already have these weapons of destruction."
"Why were we testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific last year?"
"We already had all the knowledge necessary."
"It was an outrage, and continues to be an outrage, that we develop these weapons."
"We need to constrain them, not develop them."
"I would ask this House, therefore, to send a clear signal by adopting the resolution and to urge all the Member States to speedily conclude the negotiations, because it is even an outrage that it should be suggested in the negotiations that there could be 'peaceful' nuclear explosions."
"There cannot, and we must stop this exploding of these toxic materials in the atmosphere for the good of the citizens of the world and for the sake of the planet."
"On a point of procedure first, Mr President."
"When we suspended the debate here in order to vote your predecessor in the chair said that we would be continuing the debate on Mr Cars' report, but clearly the weather and time of year do nothing for the way in which Parliament organizes itself."
"And I am looking at your officials."
"I think it is disgraceful to change things without prior agreement."
"Now to the main points of my speech, if you have no objection."
"The first deadline for the test ban treaty has passed and the second one is very close."
"The world is waiting for a treaty of this kind."
"The nuclear states committed themselves to this when the non-proliferation agreement was completed and Chairman Ramaker, a Dutch diplomat, is doing his utmost to push it through."
"At present a new text awaits the negotiators' verdict."
"This will be delivered between 29 July and 12 August."
"The talks are not easy."
"India is only ready to sign if the timetable for total nuclear disarmament is accepted."
"I appreciate that ambition, but I think it would mean the kiss of death to the treaty as things stand at the moment."
"It is, of course, desirable though that stockpiles of nuclear weapons should be reduced."
"And then the continuation of Chinese nuclear testing is of course unacceptable and especially damaging in the current climate."
"What credibility can there be for the CTBT if China is still carrying out nuclear tests during the final phase of negotiations?"
"As we said last month: it is more important to have the treaty come into force than to have everyone on board."
"Political pressure will have to ensure that all other countries sign up to it."
"The Union must set an example and the Council must use all the instruments at its disposal to complete the negotiations, get the treaty signed, ratified and brought into force."
"Mr Bertens, I have taken note of the remarks you made at the beginning but please bear in mind that to err is human and that the agenda is not amended unless a vote in plenary has authorized any changes."
"I fully understand, Mr President."
"To err is indeed human - very human."
"Mr President, a full year ago agreement was reached in New York to extend the NonProliferation Treaty sine die ."
"Following several rounds of talks in which the European Union presented a united front agreement was finally reached on an unconditional extension sine die ."
"Many reluctant states were persuaded by the promise that a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing would soon be forthcoming."
"Talks on that ban are currently in progress in Geneva."
"But the earlier deadline of 28 June as the date for an agreement has regrettably not been met."
"The talks are to resume at the end of the month."
"The new deadline has been set for 12 August so that the treaty can be submitted to the 51st General Assembly of the UN."
"The impasse caused by India's refusal to sign unless the preamble contains provision for a reduction of the nuclear weapons arsenal of the nuclear states is a cause for concern."
"If India does not sign, Pakistan most probably will not either."
"That will mean that a chance has been lost of getting the 'threshold' countries signed up to an international treaty which opposes the development of nuclear weapons."
"Because these countries are not bound by the Non-Proliferation Treaty since they did not sign it."
"The British reaction, that unless India signs the treaty is pointless, is regrettable."
"It has heightened the tensions and offers no solution."
"We urge all the parties concerned to sign the treaty and halt the negative spiral which has begun."
"We urge the Union too to take action."
"Nuclear states which claim that the nuclear test ban treaty is concerned not with nuclear weapons but with nuclear tests are of course right in theory."
"Notwithstanding this there is a direct link between the NonProliferation Treaty and the ban on testing."
"As we have said, nuclear testing is the best way of halting the further spread of nuclear weapons."
"The question is whether one cannot find a formula, for example a reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to Article 6, which everybody could accept, so that the problem of India could be resolved."
"The five official nuclear states which have pushed for signature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty have undertaken to make their intentions on further nuclear disarmament clear and to continue making them clear vis à vis the threshold countries."
"Even if no agreement can is reached on the passage which India wants - and again, I think it should be possible to find a solution - I think the treaty should in any event be signed by the nuclear states and by Great Britain too, so that we do at least have something in the bag, a treaty signed by as many countries as possible and hopefully by some of the threshold nuclear states too."
"In conclusion, this treaty must be signed, ratified and brought into effect as soon as possible."
"The debate on it has gone on for too long."
"Mr President, in a few weeks' time, the international community will have the opportunity to take a major step towards nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament with the signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
"This Treaty will succeed the decision of May 1995 in favour of the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons for which the European Union has been very actively working."
"The Commission regrets India's decision not to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
"At a time when the Commission is encouraging the European Union to strengthen its partnership with India, the signing of this Treaty by India would have been seen by the Commission and by the Member States as an extremely positive sign."
"The Commission wishes to pay tribute to the efforts of the ambassador, Mr Ramaker, who proposed a text on 28 June allowing Member States for the first time to consider the conditions for an agreement."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission hopes that the members of the Conference on Disarmament will reach an agreement before 12 August 1996 allowing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to be signed before the end of the year, and so help to strengthen the conditions for international security and hence the security of the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr de Silguy."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0872/96 by Mr Cars and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the need to arrest indicted war criminals in former Yugoslavia; -B4-0887/96 by Mr Stewart-Clark and others, on behalf of the European People's Party, on the need to arrest war criminals Karadzic and Mladic."
"Mr President, I have here before me a small cutting from a Swedish newspaper."
"It refers to what the French Minister of Defence, Charles Millon, said in Sarajevo on Sunday."
"On behalf of France he calls upon the UN Security Council to give IFOR, the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia, a clear mandate to arrest people accused of war crimes."
"He stresses that France is concerned that people such as Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, despite the fact that both of them stand accused of genocide, among other things, and that the UN's war crimes tribunal in The Hague has issued orders for their arrest."
"It is precisely this, Mr President, that lies behind the resolution we have tabled."
"I am convinced that if we really want peace in the former Yugoslavia and want to get people to understand that they must be reconciled with one another we must also find those who should be held to answer for the crimes committed."
"I believe that it is very, very regrettable that IFOR at present lacks the clear mandate that I hope, after today's debate, Parliament will demand, just as the French Minister of Defence has."
"It is my hope, Mr President, that after this debate Parliament will adopt a clear standpoint to the effect that war criminals, be they in the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere, should not be allowed to remain at liberty."
"Mr President, the International War Crimes Tribunal was set up to bring war criminals to justice."
"From the outset Judge Richard Goldstone made clear that his mission would only be meaningful if the top culprits in Bosnia and elsewhere were brought to justice."
"Accordingly, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were indicted on 24 July last for crimes committed between April 1992 and July 1995, including, and I quote: ' The shelling of civilian gatherings in order to kill, terrorize and demoralize the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civil population; the creation of numerous detention camps, where thousands were held in inhumane conditions; the systematic destruction of Muslim and Catholic places of worship; the appropriation, plunder and destruction of property.'"
"What have we done to bring these men to justice?"
"Nothing!"
"Take Karadzic: Carl Bildt threatens to reimpose sanctions unless Karadzic gives up the presidency of the Republic of Srpska and retires from public life."
"And then what happens?"
"He steps down and becomes Secretary-General!"
"I recall that Stalin held that title."
"Mladic continues to hold military power."
"When he was colonel, he was the person who flattened and raped Vukovar before Milosevic promoted him to general for his valour."
"The man who took 25, 000 inhabitants of Srebrenica, over 50 % of the entire population, and had almost all of the males massacred, whilst the United Nations looked the other way, desecrating the name of safe haven."
"Karadzic and Mladic will only surrender if they are forcefully arrested."
"If this does not happen now, elections in Bosnia in September will be a farce!"
"Democracy and the rule of law will become meaningless."
"Hardliners and moderates alike will judge that looting, aggression, bestiality, ethnic cleansing: all pay."
"We will eventually pay the price."
"Vukovar, Dubrovnik, Srebrenica and the War Crimes Tribunal will be our tombstones."
"IFOR must be enabled to act before it is too late!"
"Mr President, the important thing now in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to establish democracy and the rule of law, because only in that way can the fragile peace be secured."
"The implementation of the terms of the Dayton Agreement and, in particular, the unhindered staging of the free elections planned for 14 September, must make way for an auspicious new beginning for this tortured country and its people."
"An essential element in this new beginning is that the disastrous fragmentation of the population on nationalist lines should be halted."
"It is therefore crucial that the traditional parties, some of which are heavily implicated in the atrocities of the war, should not be the only ones within the national groups to put up candidates."
"Those which represent other forces in the political spectrum that is also present in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be free to put up candidates without hindrance, especially those which stand for a perspective cutting across individual ethnic groups."
"A particularly important point is that by no means the whole of the Serbian population group supports the disastrous and bloody policy of the leadership dominated by Karadzic and Mladic."
"As long as these two are performing key functions and are able to exert pressure on their fellow citizens, the possibility of free and democratic elections will be in doubt."
"This and growing evidence of the involvement of Karadzic and Mladic in the terrible atrocities of the war make it urgently necessary that the international arrest warrants against both be executed as soon as possible, at all events before 14 September."
"Mr President, the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are really an open wound in the EU's conscience."
"When I visited Banja Luka in Bosnia last week, and also Croatia, I observed that the elections to be held on 14 September cannot be implemented unless those indicted of terrible war crimes are brought before the Court of Justice in the Hague."
"The debate has centred on Karadzic and Mladic but I am not so naïve as not to see that there are some 30 people on all sides in this war, as Carl Bildt mentioned, who should be brought before the Hague Court."
"I-For's mandate, and the respect in which it is held, now depend - and this is the EPP Group's opinion - on whether those indicted of war crimes are actually brought before the Court in the Hague."
"In my opinion, it is not possible for a person to act as president of a party if he refuses to come before a court to be tried or to demonstrate his innocence."
"For the rest, I-For's operations are in my opinion a good example of the fact that, although we have not yet got common defence policy guidelines, because some of us are neutral countries - not non-aligned, but neutral - we have all worked together in the I-For troops, our neutral Finland as well as the NATO countries."
"Now we really expect that all those indicted of committing or ordering atrocities during the war, should be brought before the court."
"Thank you, Mr President, I know you understand Finnish."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to recall that three years ago, when the International Tribunal was set up, there were many Members of this Parliament who criticized this initiative or expressed scepticism about the first serious initiative by the international community regarding Yugoslavia."
"Today, thanks to three years of unremitting work, but also thanks to the tenacity of the President of the Tribunal, the public prosecutor, the judges and the investigators, Parliament is in a position to support the request for the arrest of the two main people responsible for organizing the ethnic cleansing policy and, in particular, for the tragedies of Srebrenica and Zepa."
"There is now every possibility that Parliament will be supporting a similar request very soon, this time concerning the 'planner in chief' of the ethnic cleansing policy and the tragedies I have just mentioned who, as we all know, lives in Belgrade."
"So many very good reasons, therefore, to vote with conviction in favour of this resolution."
"Mr President, the Commission is pleased that the European Parliament has included the case of Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic on the agenda for this urgent debate."
"In so doing, Parliament is once again calling attention to the unacceptability of continuing to allow these two persons, still living in the Republika Srpska, to remain free."
"According to the Dayton Accords, they should long ago have been brought before the Tribunal in The Hague."
"The Federal Yugoslav Republic and the Republika Srpska have not fulfilled their obligations in this matter and have thus violated the peace accords."
"The Commission considers that the influence that Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic continue to exercise in the Republika Srpska is a constant threat to the peace process."
"It is unacceptably complicating the return of refugees, the reconstruction of the country and the holding of free and democratic elections."
"The formal transfer of the powers exercised by Mr Karadzic as President of the Republika Srpska will hardly change the situation."
"The recent uncovering of mass graves in and around the town of Srebrenica once more reminds us of the cruelty of the indescribable acts of violence committed at the instigation of Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic."
"Covering more than fifty pages, the indictment of the International War Crimes Tribunal describes, sometimes in horrible detail, how far the deliberate policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing was taken and the part played in it by Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic."
"The international community has a political and moral duty to bring these two accused without delay before the International War Crimes Tribunal."
"Any further delay, which is in any case unjustifiable and intolerable, can only thwart the peace process."
"All the efforts, both military and civilian, made up till now would then have been in vain."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on 20 motions for a resolution on human rights."
"As you know, the Bureau has decided that this debate should be held as follows: each subject will be debated separately but the Commission will answer at the end of the whole debate on all subjects."
"Burma"
"B4-0873/96 by Mr Haarder and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reform party, on the situation in Burma; -B4-0883/96 by Mr Kristoffersen and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the European People's Party, on the circumstances of the death of James Leander Nicols, Consul of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Switzerland, following his detention in a prison in Rangoon; -B4-0895/96 by Mr Pasty and Mr Caligaris, on behalf of the Union for Europe group, on the death in prison of the Danish Consul in Burma; -B4-0899/96 by Mr Vandemeulebroucke and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in Burma; -B4-0919/96 by Mr Vinci and Sornosa Martínez, on behalf of the Confederal group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the political situation in Burma and human rights violations by the SLORC; -B4-0924/96 by Mr Telkämper and others, on behalf of the Green Group, on the situation in Burma; -B4-0944/96 by Mrs Kinnock and others, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, on the political situation and continued human rights abuses in Burma.Cyprus"

"B4-0955/96, by Mr von Habsburg and others, on behalf of the European Parliament People's Party, on the arbitrary arrest of Tomislav Matanovic, a priest in Prijedor, and his parents by agents of the self-styled Republic of Srpska."
"Mr President, the circumstances surrounding the death of consul Nicols in Rangoon are typical of the totally unacceptable way in which the SLORC oppresses and rules Burma."
"The international community must take action to tackle the continuing human rights abuses in that country and the total suppression of any democratic forces."
"250 parliamentarians belonging to the National League for Democracy who are held in detention must be freed."
"A new law making political dissent punishable by a 20-year sentence must be withdrawn and the election result which plainly showed that the now banned NLD was the most popular party must be honoured."
"The Union must send out a very tough and unequivocal signal and must take action."
"Following the worthy decision by Heineken and Carlsberg - commendable decisions prompted by the work of a number of action groups - following the decisions of these two companies a commercial and economic boycott must be imposed on Burma."
"It must be made plain to the countries of ASEAN, which as we know are keen to admit Burma to their number, that they must not fill the gaps vacated by European firms in Burma."
"The Regional Forum of ASEAN is an excellent stage on which to deliver this message."
"It must be made clear that the proposal to admit Burma to ASEAN is altogether unacceptable and inopportune at the moment."
"It is most important that the world community should present a united front here."
"It is through economic sanctions that we can hurt the SLORC given that the SLORC, the regime, itself has major interests in the economy."
"I wish also, on behalf of my Group and on my own account too, to express my support for the persistence and courage of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Despite countless threats against her, her supporters and her party she continues with these weekend meetings which have become famous and which have become an important signal."
"We should respond to that signal!"
"Mr President, the situation in Burma continues to attract the maximum attention on a worldwide scale."
"It is crucial and of major importance that we work hard to secure democracy and human rights in this country which is ruled by a dictatorship."
"In Scandinavia, we are deeply shocked by the death of our consul, James Nicols, in a Burmese prison."
"All the diplomatic efforts to clarify the circumstances of his death have been dismissed by the regime in Rangoon."
"The Burmese ambassador in London has been summoned to Denmark, where he is also accredited, but he has simply not come."
"The body of the Danish consul has not been released to his family."
"A post-mortem examination has been refused, and there has been no explanation as to why he was convicted and imprisoned."
"It is simply claimed that he had too many fax machines in his office in Rangoon."
"What an explanation!"
"In my view and that of the PPE Group, the time has come for the EU to take steps to apply sanctions against the regime in Rangoon."
"Dialogue and requests are leading nowhere."
"Firm action is the only thing that will command respect, so with the PPE Group, I am asking for Denmark's calls for specific measures to be followed, such as the suspension of Burma's trade preferences with the EU."
"Like Mr Bertens, I also wish to appeal to the ASEAN countries to block full membership for Burma."
"I would endorse Commissioner Marín's view that the ASEAN countries should be helping to move Burma in the direction of democracy."
"Otherwise, this could have a direct bearing on the EU's relations with ASEAN."
"I also welcome the fact that all the groups in Parliament have worked closely together to increase the pressure on Burma."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the death on 22 June of James Nicols, Consul of Norway, Denmark and Switzerland, after being held in prison for six weeks, is shattering news of the greatest concern to us."
"The Consul's arbitrary arrest by the Burmese authorities for operating telephones and fax machines at his home without permission, the authorities' refusal to allow him to be attended by a doctor, his delicate state of health and, above all, the serious violations of human rights that are going on in Burma, all call for urgent special investigation by the entire international community."
"The European Union must make every possible effort and officially request the details needed to establish the responsibility of the Burmese authorities, who are continuing to pursue a policy of repression and violation of human rights in the face of all opposition."
"Furthermore, the inhumanity of the SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) in refusing to release the body of James Nicols to his family or allow them to attend his burial, and the arrest of more than 250 members of the National League for Democracy, led by Nobel and Sakharov Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi, are evidence of how serious the situation in Burma is as regards respect for human rights and democracy."
"The European Union must implement strong and urgent economic and political sanctions against Burma, including suspension of the Generalized System of Preferences and concessional finance."
"All economic links based on trade, tourism and investment by European organizations operating in Burma must be broken off."
"Finally, we must make Burma understand clearly that its request for full membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum will be affected by the trade relations that ASEAN is developing with the European Union and the West."
"And, lastly, let us express our full solidarity with James Nicols' family and our hope that they have not suffered in vain."
"Mr President, the military dictatorship in power in Burma is once again becoming notorious for its cruelty, its inhumanity, its despotism."
"The specious grounds for the arrest of Consul Nicols, the conditions of his detention, the treatment inflicted on him which certainly led to his death, the inhumanity of this National Council, which has refused his family the right to attend his burial, must demand from us a vigorous reaction, going beyond simple condemnation."
"This case is added to the long list of oppressive acts that we have unceasingly denounced."
"For democracy has not advanced in Burma, and even though the situation of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Prizewinner, has improved, she herself is continuing to alert world opinion to the increase in violations of human rights in her country."
"Political expression is a criminal offence, forced labour is current practice."
"All these machinations merit sanctions."
"In the first place, questions should be raised about the observer status granted to Burma in the ASEAN Regional Forum."
"It would be desirable for the Commission and the Council to denounce this decision at the next meeting of this Assembly."
"Next, economic sanctions must be applied to Burma."
"Let us decide to break off all relations with that country, whether it is over investment, trade or tourism."
"Let us follow the example of the Carlsberg and Heineken Companies and make the Burmese government face its responsibilities."
"This is the stance my group wishes the Council and the Commission to take."
"Mr President, I should like to address the Commissioner, because what we are calling for in this debate are measures that European Parliament has been calling for unanimously for several months."
"But the Council and Commission have done nothing, absolutely nothing."
"The Council has even refused to make a statement on the sanctions proposed by Denmark after the murder - and that is what it was - of James Nicols."
"We want to see an end to diplomatic shilly-shallying and we are asking for the economic and political isolation of the Rangoon government, as every group in this House has requested today; we also call on the Commission to remove Burma immediately from the list of countries benefiting from the Generalized System of Preferences."
"This would be a political signal of Europe's resolve in respect of Burma."
"If the Commission refuses to move in this direction, it must at least explain its reasons, Mr Commissioner."
"We call upon the Council to take immediate action to urge the ASEAN countries not to accept Burma as a full member, because of the very serious human rights situation."
"Failure to do even that would be a sign of complicity."
"Mr President, I do not see that as a threat."
"Some months ago we discussed Burma, last month we discussed Burma, and now we are doing so again."
"We are disturbed by the death of James Nicols, the Consul for Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden."
"His death is evidence of torture in that country."
"He was prevented from sleeping, he was not given medical care."
"We can no longer tolerate this inhuman behaviour, this inhuman treatment by the SLORC."
"According to information from the IMF, 3.1 % of the gross domestic product of Burma in 1994 was generated by forced labour."
"That is a measure of this tragedy, which we cannot simply stand aside from."
"Perhaps it was our protest, perhaps it was also the commitment of the NGOs that has so far prevented Heineken and Carlsberg from investing there."
"There are other potential investors, such as BMW, who we hope will adopt the same stance."
"We, particularly the Commission and the Council, are also being called upon to react."
"I do not think the Commission should grant any more preferences."
"We must make it clear diplomatically that relations will be suspended if the situation does not change."
"The Council must also make that clear, particularly in the context of relations with the ASEAN states."
"In conclusion, let me say that we must continue to support Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, and I hope that diplomacy will bear fruit in this matter."
"Mr President, you recognize of course, just as the Commission does, that what we are dealing with here is one of the most barbaric regimes in the world; a regime which relies upon child labour, forced labour and slave labour for its very existence."
"In fact Amnesty International very recently published a report which clearly said that people are being held in leg-irons, in chains and beaten into unconsciousness as they work on the railways and roads of that country."
"The SLORC and military junta is clearly a regime that we cannot deal with or indeed make deals with."
"Aung San Suu Kyi has today, in a video in this Parliament, spoken unequivocally about the need for economic sanctions, for a stop to all investments, an end to tourism, and for every possible measure to be taken to isolate that regime."
"The fact that she, as the democratic leader of the opposition in that country, is asking the European Union to do that should surely be a signal to us to take action immediately."
"Nelson Mandela has been visiting Europe recently and it was that kind of economic pressure that brought the apartheid regime in South Africa to its knees."
"These are the kind of practical measures, economic measures, which will bring the political change that Aung San Suu Kyi wishes to see."
"We recognize in the European Union, as the Commission well knows, that in our dealings with third countries we should work for the promotion of democracy and human rights."
"So if that is the case, and if that is our guiding principle, then that has to be an essential element in our dealings with Burma."
"We are, of course, as others have said, very encouraged by the fact that Heineken, Carlsberg, Levi Strauss and to a certain extent Pepsi Cola, have, as a result of citizen's pressure, pulled out of that country."
"That kind of investment needs to be discouraged and from this Parliament we urge European Union citizens also to put pressure on Total, a French company, to take similar measures."
"I would like to ask the Commission what they intend to say in the ASEAN Conference next week in Jakarta, where they will be present."
"I would like to ask the Commission to state very strongly that they abhor that regime."
"I would also ask the Commissioner to tell us when we are going to see that report on forced labour, which we are waiting to see, because it is only on the basis of that report on forced labour that we will see the leverage that we need to withdraw the GSP privileges from Burma."
"Those are two categorical questions where I would like answers from the Commission."
"The legitimate leaders of Burma are asking Europe to introduce economic sanctions against the military junta which has unlawfully taken power in the country."
"We should take heed of this request."
"As in the case of South Africa, sanctions should be implemented if they are supported by the opposition and accepted by the population."
"Today, many national leaders are queuing up to take the credit for the sanctions policy against South Africa, but they were by no means so full of confidence when the sanctions had to be applied."
"Burma gives those leaders a chance to do the right thing once again."
"We received Aung San Suu Kyi's son and husband here in the European Parliament on her behalf, and we admire her for her courage, vision, love of her people and historical awareness."
"We must listen to this woman."
"She is asking us to introduce economic sanctions."
"I cannot see how we could say no to this."
"Let me explain the vile nature of the present regime in Burma."
"It is waging a war against its own people."
"It has introduced forced labour, so there is slavery."
"It has ignored the landslide victory of the democracy movement in 1990."
"It has imprisoned the leaders or placed them under house arrest."
"And it is imprisoning diplomats."
"How can the western world be content to respond to the despicable actions of the Burmese junta with diplomatic censure, when the regime is imprisoning those who represent us?"
"How can we be diplomatic with people who are throwing diplomats in prison?"
"James Nicols was the representative of Denmark and other European countries."
"He was imprisoned because he had too many fax machines; he was subjected to hardships, including long periods of interrogation, and was deprived of sleep."
"He did not receive his medicine, and his burial was kept secret."
"A Burmese newspaper has written of Mr Nicols that he was a petty scoundrel who received his well-deserved fate, because he was a glutton for food and an idler with a taste for luxury."
"Any newspaper which is allowed to publish in Burma is approved by the junta, which is thus turning the knife in the wound it has tried to inflict on us through Mr Nicols' death."
"I am grateful to Carlsberg and Heineken, because they have pulled out, but how can anyone bring themselves to embark on a joint venture in a country where their partner will be the Defence Ministry in a military junta?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to Mrs Kinnock we were able this morning to see a video of a question and answer session with Aung San Suu Kyi."
"I was profoundly impressed by it, to see how someone who has to endure such difficult personal circumstances, such miserable conditions, has the courage, the energy and the strength to fight for democracy."
"I regard myself today simply as a mouthpiece."
"We have a chance here to voice her demands for her."
"In the first instance, and this is a question which I put on her behalf to the Commission, what exactly does the Commission understand by a 'critical dialogue' on trade, foreign investment and tourism, in the light of worldwide calls for Burma to be isolated?"
"I received a fax this morning in which 46 NGOs support this remarkable woman's request, 46 NGOs from Europe and America."
"Let us isolate Burma."
"Let us stop investing there."
"As paragraph 9 of the resolution states, we are of course extremely glad that Heineken and Carlsberg have pulled out."
"But yesterday's papers said that Heineken had not in fact pulled out."
"Spokesmen in Burma dispute it."
"I would like the Commission - and this is my second request - to investigate the truth or otherwise of this rumour."
"Lastly, in line with paragraph 10 of our resolution, I would ask the Commission to ensure that others do not step in to fill the vacancies created."
"It would be very cynical if some investors pulled out, only to have other European firms seize the opportunity and speedily move in there themselves."
"That would be appalling."
"Cyprus"
"Mr President, the Cyprus problem is an issue of human rights for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots."
"The presence of 35, 000 Turkish troops occupying over one-third of the island of Cyprus denies the human rights of Greek Cypriots but also of Turkish Cypriots."
"The situation in the northern part of Cyprus has been made deliberately worse by the illegal settlement of many thousands of mainland Turks, in itself a clear contravention of the Geneva Conventions."
"Progressive forces in the occupied area are recognizing, with the support of the European Commission and this Parliament, that membership of the European Union for Cyprus and the imminent accession talks provide not just the right future for Cyprus but also a window of opportunity to solve the Cyprus problem."
"Increasingly, over the last two years there has been an escalation of terrorist activity often focused on those very progressive forces promoting and discussing the future of a united Cyprus as a member of the European Union."
"Kutlu Adali, a distinguished Turkish Cypriot intellectual, author and respected journalist has paid with his life for openly expressing and defending these views."
"He was murdered on 6 July in occupied Nicosia."
"Nobody has yet been brought to justice for this terrorist act nor the many bombings of offices, houses, cars and political offices in the occupied part of Cyprus."
"We are told that one in five people in occupied Cyprus is a member of the Turkish security forces."
"Yet it seems they cannot catch anybody responsible for these acts."
"The illegal regime and the Turkish security forces must act to find the perpetrators of these acts and the person or persons who murdered Kutlu Adali."
"We all need to remember that the voice of the illegal regime is not the only voice of Turkish Cypriots."
"There are other distinguished and courageous Turkish Cypriots whose voices need to be heard."
"Kutlu Adali was one such."
"Mr President, what is needed in Cyprus today, is peaceful coexistence of the two communities, the Greek and Turkish communities."
"Though the Turkish Cypriot side is unyielding, I must say that there are indeed democratic progressive forces which favour a closer approach between the Greek and Turkish elements."
"Kutlu Adali, who was murdered under mysterious circumstances a few days ago, was one of the moderate Turkish Cypriots and his murder was clearly a political act, bearing in mind his activities and the nature of the Denktash regime."
"Kutlu Adali, a distinguished author and journalist, had in the past repeatedly written articles severely criticising the Denktash regime, and condemning in particular: first, the mass introduction to the occupied part of Cyprus of colonists who constitute a foreign element of Turkish Cypriot society, and secondly, the systematic terrorisation of Denktash's political opponents."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the occupied part of Cyprus a regime of military and police rule has been established which is particularly harsh towards dissidents and the Turkish Cypriots."
"It is characteristic that numbers are declining in Turkish Cypriot society, which from 120, 000 people in 1974, numbers barely 85, 000 today with more and more Turkish Cypriots leaving all the time."
"It is indicative of the violence of the regime that prevails in the occupied areas that among a population of 160, 000, approximately 35, 000 are soldiers or security forces, in other words one in five of the citizens, as the President, Mrs Green told us, is under arms."
"Today, Cyprus is the most highly militarized place in the world, in relation to its size."
"With today's resolution, we of course are saying that this situation must be brought to an end and a process should begin of bringing the two societies closer together, which was also what Kutlu Adali wanted."
"Mr President, more than ever Europe should make amends for what it has done since the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922."
"Indeed, it is important that Cyprus should become a part of Europe as soon as possible to avoid a continuation of the situation of violence which has lasted for 20 years."
"The murder of an intellectual like Kutlu Adali, a writer who was known for his tolerance and seems to have had the confidence of the people on that island and ended up being punished with his death, while the Turkish authorities in Cyprus stood aside, is a form of violence which we witness every day whether it is in Cyprus, Bosnia or anywhere else; it all results from the fall of that other empire, the Soviet empire."
"This is a historic moment when Europe could help to change the situation but fails to do so because it prefers to grant economic benefits to countries which depend on it for economic reasons and continues to turn a blind eye to violence which, in my opinion, is unacceptable."
"We have arms but not only arms in the real sense. We have other arms in our arsenal to prevent war from continuing in this localised and regional form and which respects the Geneva Convention."
"Mr President, in the occupied part of Cyprus political crimes are rampant and on the increase."
"Statistics bear that out."
"There appears to be a pattern."
"Turkish Cypriots who speak out for the preservation of Turkish Cypriot culture are systematically trampled on, both literally and figuratively, by the tens of thousands of Turks imported by Denktash but also, as Mrs Green has said, by Turkish troops and secret servicemen."
"Those who criticize are silenced."
"All efforts undertaken by the international community must be aimed at halting this."
"The entire island of Cyprus deserves stability and peace."
"I urge the international community to put pressure on the so-called Turkish Cypriot Government not to endanger the safety of its critics."
"The tragic killing of Mr Adali is bad enough."
"Let us not forget: this is a country which will soon be represented here by a number of spokesmen."
"So I think it is a good thing we are having this debate on Cyprus in the House and I hope it will not be the last time we do so."
"Madam President, since appeals to respect human dignity have failed, and since strong condemnation of the use of violence against asylum-seekers are being added to the list of similar actions, already, alas, too long, the time has come to change to action."
"Apart from the various types of pressure available to us to remind all those directly or indirectly involved of the misery of the boat people, we must show a solidarity that goes well beyond simple declarations of intent."
"Our condemnations are addressed of course to China, to Hong Kong and to the Vietnamese authorities, who are not doing all they could to provide a decent welcome for these former refugees, but we must also be ready if necessary to share the burden created by the almost insoluble problem of the boat people and to accept into our countries any refugees coming to us as part of a fair distribution of the load."
"I believe that, if we do not wish our declarations on respect for human rights and on the right of refugees to humane treatment to remain hollow words, we owe it to ourselves to move on to a very clear policy of solidarity."
"Madam President, on 10 May there was a mass break-out of Vietnamese refugees from the Whitehead Detention Camp in Hong Kong."
"This highlights a worrying situation."
"There are still 25 000 Vietnamese 'boat people' in Asian camps, 15 000 of them in Hong Kong."
"Nevertheless, 50 000 boat people have returned voluntarily under a UN programme."
"In Hong Kong, however, about 2 000 people were also forcibly deported."
"I criticize that, because we also have Vietnamese people in the Federal Republic of Germany who are due to be deported."
"I do not think that people can be simply expelled in this way."
"The right thing to do is to set up programmes and help them with their repatriation."
"For that reason, we oppose the deportation of these people from Hong Kong."
"On the other hand, we call on the Commission to use its efforts in international fora in order to ensure that funds are made available for new repatriation programmes under which people from Hong Kong and other Asian states or from Europe can settle in Vietnam, if that is what they want."
"No asylum-seekers must be expelled from Hong Kong or from the Federal Republic of Germany, and I think that the Commission should promote a programme for Vietnam, making use of the 17 million budgeted."
"Madam President, the refugees in the detention centres in Hong Kong are being treated like criminals: their custody has been transferred from the Hong Kong housing services to the correctional services; they are being dealt with by staff who are trained to look after prisoners, not families in need of help; they are left in their cells, individually isolated from the world for 23 hours a day."
"In the May riots 2, 000 cans of teargas were fired and, following that, 200 people were moved directly into prisons, including, disgracefully, one five-year-old girl who was kept in isolation for 12 days whilst the prison authorities lied to the parents about her being held."
"What crime are these people guilty of?"
"The crime of fear: fear of returning to Vietnam where each and every one of them would face three to four days of intensive interrogation about any political contacts they may have had within the camps; where they would face harassment; where they would face surveillance and where there are clear reports of arrests and of disappearances."
"Today this Parliament must stand out against these forced repatriations - 600 in the last 4 weeks alone - as there has been a completely arbitrary denial of refugee status since 1988 in Hong Kong: these people are being denied their rights under the Geneva Convention."
"In its answer today the Commission must stop condoning this breach of international human rights and ensure that our European aid goes to supporting the human rights of these people, not trying to sweep them under the carpet."
"Ethiopia"
"Madam President, a few months ago during a hearing on freedom of the media organized by the Committee on Foreign Affairs I met members of the Ethiopian journalists' association who told me to my amazement that there were more journalists imprisoned there than in any other country and that they were maltreated almost weekly."
"Clearly there is much still to be done in this country which was freed just a few years ago from Mengistu's dictatorship."
"It looks as if too many of his mini-despots are still in charge there."
"The secession of Eritrea proceeded remarkably peacefully, but the democratization process has been very much a stop and start affair."
"Mr Woldesmayat, the president of the Teachers' Association who is under arrest, must be freed immediately, if only as a symbol of hope for the other hundreds of political detainees who still languish in the country's jails."
"I hope the Council and the Commission too will press for this."
"Madam President, my Group has been following with interest the political developments in Ethiopia, where the Addis Abbaba government has, over the past few years, taken some significant steps forward as regards democracy and human rights."
"We believe that this process should be supported by the European Union."
"It is, however, precisely for this reason that the news reaching us is so worrying, and especially the news of the arrest of Mr Taye, Chairman of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association."
"He was arrested without charge, which raises the probably well-founded suspicion that he was arrested for political reasons."
"We therefore request, as does the resolution, that he be released and that his case be dealt with with all due guarantees, because a political arrest is completely unacceptable."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also concerned over the situation of Taye Woldesmayat, Chairman of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association, about whom we have been hearing here."
"He was arrested at Addis Ababa Airport without charges."
"I tried to do something for him and received a letter from the Embassy stating that he had been arrested on legitimate grounds."
"Detailed charges were not given but, basically, he is being accused of clandestine activity."
"As he cannot engage a lawyer and has no contact with his family, legitimate conditions for detention under the rule of law do not apply."
"We must make it clear to the Embassy or the Government that we do not approve of that."
"The Ethiopian Teachers' Association is constantly harassed and persecuted."
"We witnessed a similar case back in December 1993, when Mr Abera Yemane Ab was arrested in similar circumstances and legal action was taken against him without any indication of charges."
"We cannot accept this situation."
"We seek to defend human rights."
"For this reason, the Ethiopian Government should explain what these people are charged with, or it should release them."
"Philippines"
"Madam President, many Irish priests have gone to work in the Philippines and have distinguished themselves in their fight for human rights and for bettering the lot of the people there."
"Father Shay Cullen is in a very rich tradition."
"He has been campaigning and gaining worldwide attention for his campaign against the paedophile sex tourism in the Philippines."
"In the past few years he has rescued many children and has set up the orphanage in Olongapo City in the Philippines."
"While protesting peacefully against the erection of a high-tension electricity pylon right beside the orphanage, he was most viciously attacked by the police, arrested, denied medical attention and subsequently had great difficulty in obtaining medical treatment, as no doctor in the city was prepared to help him."
"Clearly Father Shay Cullen's campaign against this vicious tourism, which Parliament has condemned many times, is causing considerable worry to the powerful and corrupt circle in the city in which he is campaigning."
"I believe his own personal safety is at risk and I hope that when Parliament votes on this resolution that the Philippine Government will be made aware of the serious concern we have for Father Cullen's personal safety and for his campaign to protect these very much at-risk children."
"Madam President, I have little to add really to the points my colleague Mrs Banotti has outlined so well."
"Perhaps just this: this is one of the forms of exploitation, child prostitution and child pornography, which are found wherever the difference between rich and poor is extreme."
"We know that despite all our efforts this difference between rich and poor has increased in recent years and as a result so have these abhorrent forms of exploitation."
"Those like Father Shay Cullen who take it upon themselves to do something about it deserve our support."
"I venture to hope that Mrs Banotti's resolution, which will undoubtedly be adopted this afternoon, will ensure that such people are helped rather than penalized for the useful and essential work they do."
"Madam President, I would like to join with my Irish colleague, Mrs Banotti, in expressing our concern for Father Shay Cullen."
"He has been a tireless campaigner against the evils of child prostitution and child pornography in the Philippines."
"In the face of intimidation and threats he has fiercely defended the most basic rights of the most vulnerable in any society, the children."
"Given the value of this work, it is inexplicable that he should have been treated so aggressively by the Philippine authorities."
"Father Cullen was engaged in a peaceful protest when he was violently arrested, kicked and handcuffed by the police."
"Neither Father Cullen nor his colleague were given adequate medical treatment in police custody and both had to be taken for medical treatment at a later stage."
"Most ominously, the lives of Father Cullen, his assistant and legal adviser have been threatened."
"This is utterly unacceptable."
"Instead of harassing Father Cullen, the Filipino authorities should welcome the work that he has been doing in their country."
"The work of Father Shay Cullen is typical of the work carried out by Irish missionaries not only in the Philippines but throughout the world."
"For many years now he has been a powerful advocate of children's rights and an implacable enemy of child abusers."
"He has acted as whistle-blower against those who engage in the vile practice of child abuse and he has been central in bringing such individuals to justice."
"He has railed against the sex tourism so predominant in the Philippines."
"This House should learn a great deal from the work and commitment of Father Shay Cullen."
"There is a pressing need, in my view, for the introduction of international legislation to bring the perpetrators of child sex abuse to justice."
"It is clear that such individuals visit countries like the Philippines to carry out their vile practice."
"Each EU country, with the wholehearted support of this Parliament, should have legislation to ensure that, when child abusers return from their travels, they can have the full rigour of the law applied to them in their country of origin."
"My own party in Ireland has pioneered such legislation."
"I hope that the House lends its full support to this important resolution."
"Algeria"
"Madam President, the Algerian government does not accept critical journalists."
"In the name of the just and necessary fight against terrorism, muzzling the press is unfortunately the order of the day and freedom of speech is being threatened."
"On 4 July, many European journalists could not obtain a visa to take part in a meeting to express solidarity with Algerian journalists."
"On the same day, the cartoonist Chawki Amari was imprisoned, his newspaper 'La Tribune' was banned and his management was placed under legal restrictions."
"Algerian journalists are in an unenviable situation."
"On the one hand, they are under permanent threat of terrorist attacks - 53 of them, may I remind you, have been murdered since 1993 - and on the other hand they are subjected to pressure from the authorities."
"Our group supports their fight for press freedom."
"In our opinion, censorship and control of information can only weaken the battle for democracy and against fundamentalism."
"That is why we are asking the Algerian authorities to release Chawki Amari, to allow republication of 'La Tribune' and to respect freedom of speech and information."
"At the same time, we are pleased at the continuation of the dialogue with democratic forces that is currently in progress, and we hope that this will lead to the settlement of a crisis which has lasted only too long."
"We are also pleased about the opening of negotiations between the European Union and Algeria but, going by previous association agreements that we have voted on in Parliament and that have considerable consequences for the economy and employment in Mediterranean countries, we ask that democratic forces and trade union and professional organizations should be regularly consulted during these negotiations."
"Madam President, I belong to the generation who came to understand what was going on in the colonised parts of the world through the Algerian war and I actively supported the Algerian freedom fighters."
"Many of us had very great hopes that Algeria would lead the way in respect of democracy, freedom and human rights in the Arab world."
"It was not long before we realised that it would not be so easy."
"As late as the 1970s and 1980s I visited Algeria a number of times."
"There was then certainly no democracy but there was nevertheless a certain sense of hope."
"When elections were then called there a few years ago we hoped that they would lead to democratic development."
"As everyone knows, events took a very different turn."
"The arrest of Chawki Amari on 4 July is simply one of the most recent pieces of evidence that the Algerian regime is unable to deal with the problems in a democratic manner."
"As the previous speaker also emphasised, a great many journalists have been killed or arrested or have met with problems for having wished to carry out their democratic, journalistic obligations and report on what is really happening in the country."
"A dialogue is now being conducted which still does not include all the parties in Algeria."
"Of course we are in no way supporters of the Islamic Salvation Front but I find it extremely difficult to understand how the dialogue which President Zérroual resumed yesterday with delegations from four parties can lead to anything if one does not in some way attempt also to include the other forces, even if they are in themselves not approved of."
"We believe that the European Union has a considerable responsibility to support democratic development in Algeria."
"Madam President, at these times the European Parliament's message must be one of solidarity with Algerian journalists and a call for the release of the cartoonist Chawki Amari."
"We should also recognise that in Algeria - especially in Algeria - as in all countries in the world, the national flag arouses feelings of deep respect and pride."
"Our message of solidarity from the European Parliament, firmly in favour of press freedom and calling for this journalist's release, must not in any way be seen as alien but as a point of departure for an attitude of dialogue and joint action as Euro-Mediterranean partners, since we share the same aims of peace and democracy."
"Algeria is going through very difficult times but there are the multilateral talks which are hopeful and the start of negotiations on an association agreement."
"It is precisely the old, obsolete and outmoded code that President Zérroual has proposed to change."
"We must lend political support for the country to go down the road to pluralism and peace."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of expression and freedom of information should always be respected where respect for the rule of law and democracy is demanded."
"We cannot accept direct and indirect censorship measures and information controls affecting the press, which should be able to operate properly, free of controls."
"It is important that such freedom be established in Algeria and in some other States, where freedom of the press is being seriously violated."
"The European Union should support measures and projects to help the Algerian media, which are currently in need of sufficient economic support to enable them to continue supplying the country with the information it needs."
"In any case a political dialogue must be established as soon as possible with all the Algerian authorities and democratic powers, to find a solution to the current crisis and, hence, restore as quickly as possible the civil peace needed for the forthcoming legislative elections."
"Everyone in the country must join forces to launch the peace process that unfortunately has yet to begin."
"Finally, I should like to express my full solidarity with all those who are being deprived of their freedom because of violations of human rights and democracy, but especially because there is no freedom of expression and opinion."
"Madam President, the arrest and imprisonment of the cartoonist Chawki Amari and banning of the publication of his newspaper are only another indication of the predicament the Algerian political authorities find themselves in."
"The attack on the freedom of the press can only, and even then with difficulty, mask the powerlessness of the authorities to overcome attempts at destabilizing their country."
"Moreover, attempts to control information are stupid because they are anachronistic. Anachronistic because nothing can any longer prevent ideas from circulating."
"There are, fortunately, many examples to prove that attempts to deprive public opinion of information, embarrassing or not for the ruling regime, are doomed to fail."
"This at least is one of the positive aspects that can be credited to the worldwide information society."
"The Algerian authorities would thus be well advised to use other means to re-establish the rule of law in Algeria and not to attack the powers of the press, one of the pillars of the new society they are preparing to build."
"Salman Rushdie"
"Madam President, the Council of Ministers is currently holding discussions with Iran on a number of issues, including Salman Rushdie."
"We have no objection to this in itself but some of what has leaked out concerning these discussions gives cause for concern."
"The aim of the Liberal Group's resolution is to make it quite clear to the Council where Parliament stands and we hope that Parliament will support this resolution. This must occur before the discussions between the Council and Iran result in any form of agreement, of whatever kind it may be."
"We in the Liberal Group hope that Parliament, like us, will oppose anything which Iran can interpret as any kind of recognition - silent, implicit or indirect - of Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie."
"No religious leader or movement should be permitted the freedom to urge supporters in some kind of fatwa to commit murder."
"That, Madam President, is outrageous behaviour which must be exposed and combatted to the end by every true democrat."
"Arrest of Father Tomislav Matanovic"
"Madam President, as you know yourself, our group was in Banja Luka exactly a week ago today."
"We saw there what is really going on in this so-called Serbian Republic."
"I can only say that, on the basis of our conversations with the local representatives and spokespeople of Mr Karadzic, I felt as though time had rolled back fifty years. Indeed, the way people talked and the arguments they used reminded me strongly of the most terrible Gauleiter of the Hitler period, quite apart from the Stalinists who were also represented there."
"We really are talking about a gang of brigands, and the chief brigand, Karadzic, really has fomented infamy here."
"One of the worst cases was reported to us by the Bishop of Banja Luka, that of a priest who had been held in detention for nearly a year, since 24 August last year, together with his parents."
"The Serbian authorities maintain that they would have intervened on his behalf but that the local police chief will not authorize his release, although he has not been charged with anything - he has simply been thrown into jail."
"When the Bishop asked for our authorities and representatives to intervene, promises were made to him, but nothing has happened."
"Hence it is high time that we, the European Parliament, took clear action on this situation, which is in direct breach of the Dayton Agreement, and demand that our representative, Mr Bildt, who after all is obligated to us, finally do something to ensure that Father Matanovic and his parents are released, which is their right."
"If we cannot achieve that, it would again be apparent how incapable we are of taking effective action."
"That would be a grave danger to peace."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will take the topics in the order in which Parliament has dealt with them, and I begin with Burma."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concern about the deterioration in the political situation in Burma."
"It deplores the death of Mr Nichols in prison."
"The defamatory remarks recently published in the official Burmese press have particularly offended the Commission, which supports any initiative that might bring the Burmese government to adopt a line of conduct more in keeping with international practice."
"At the same time, it calls the attention of Parliament to the very limited effect any possible economic sanctions could have, given the small volume of trade between the Union and Burma."
"In 1995, this amounted to less than ECU 200 million, 66 for imports, 113 for exports."
"As for the suspension of the Generalized System of Preferences, no decision can be taken on this until the investigation currently being carried out by Mr Marin's services is complete."
"I can assure you that the Commission is conducting this with due speed, due rigour and due vigilance."
"It will be finished in September."
"The Commission supports the proposal from some Member States to use the next meetings with ASEAN, particularly in the Asian Regional Forum, to insist on the need to renew the dialogue between all democratic and ethnic forces in Burma."
"Secondly, Cyprus."
"The Commission is deeply concerned at the escalation of violence observed during the last few months in the Turkish Cypriot community."
"It was shocked by the murder of Mr Adali, an eminent Turkish intellectual and journalist."
"The death of this highly respected person, well known and appreciated for his outspokenness and his defence of the identity of Turkish and Greek Cypriot values, and highly regarded for his attachment to human rights, can only be strongly deplored."
"The Commission will continue its efforts at conciliation in Cyprus by making contact with the Turkish Cypriot community about the prospective accession of Cyprus to the European Union."
"I would remind you that European Union policy on Cyprus was reaffirmed at the last EU-Cyprus Association Council."
"It was reiterated that negotiations on the accession of Cyprus will get under way with a Commission proposal six months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, taking into account the results of that conference."
"On that occasion, the Union also declared itself in favour of a global settlement of the Cyprus question along the lines of United Nations Security Council resolutions and based on the formation of a two zone and two community Cypriot federation."
"Thirdly, the Vietnamese Boat People."
"While of course sharing the concern of the European Parliament, the Commission wishes to direct your attention to the following items of information: in March 1996, the Steering Committee responsible for the global plan of action of the International Conference on Refugees from IndoChina removed the principal remaining obstacles to a humanly acceptable solution to the tragedy of the Vietnamese Boat People (this agreement should now end this tragedy);"
"Malaysia and Singapore closed their camps at the end of May and June 1996 and the same thing will happen in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines; in the case of Hong Kong, the majority of the repatriation operations have been progressing normally;"
"Vietnam has accepted the return of some 70, 000 of its citizens and their situation is being closely monitored by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which has not observed any cases of discrimination."
"Lastly, the European Commission shares Parliament's concern over the destination of Community aid."
"Such aid should be given directly to the Vietnamese returning to the country."
"It may be mainly in the form of support for starting up production enterprises, of grants for specialist training and of help towards micro-projects aimed at improving living standards in the communities into which the former refugees are being reintegrated."
"May I end by adding that, for the majority of non-refugees known as Vietnamese economic migrants, the only viable solution is a return to their country."
"The repatriation operations are progressing smoothly."
"Fourthly, Ethiopia."
"The Commission and the Member States are increasingly concerned by developments in the human rights situation in Ethiopia."
"The Commission Delegation and the Heads of Missions of Member States, in close contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross, are monitoring very closely the situation of certain prisoners, such as Mr Abera Yemane Ab."
"I should stress that the Commission and the Member States are fully aware that for them to act effectively, the human rights situation must be painstakingly assessed and evaluated on the basis of individual cases."
"It has also been decided, in the context of coordination between Member States and the Commission in Addis Ababa, to undertake common action to collect, compare and verify data relating to violations of human rights and, of course, to speak to the government about this."
"Fifthly, the Philippines."
"The Commission is engaged in open dialogue with the government of the Philippines and other governments in the region about human rights."
"As regards the particular case of Father Shay Cullen, the Commission is in a position to state that he was actually arrested on 13 June last but was quickly released."
"The Commission, which has had the opportunity to take part in some of the activities of Father Shay Cullen's Preda Foundation against child prostitution, nevertheless immediately asked that an enquiry be quickly carried out on the spot."
"The Commission will of course keep Parliament fully informed of the results of this enquiry and the conclusions to be drawn from it."
"Sixth point, Algeria."
"Sadly, Algeria is in the throes of a crisis which is putting the political normalization of the country to the test."
"Several sectors of Algerian society are suffering from this, particularly the press."
"Since the signature of the Barcelona Declaration in November 1995, the Algerian government has already committed itself multilaterally, and I quote: ' to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to guarantee the effective and legitimate exercise of these rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech' ."
"The Algerian government has also shown that it is keen to negotiate an association agreement with the European Union, in which respect for human rights and democratic principles will form an essential element."
"Internally, the Algerian government has published a memorandum announcing a national conference, a referendum on revision of the constitution and parliamentary and local elections."
"The Commission is actively encouraging the Algerian government to implement its multilateral commitments and national measures that could lead to the political normalization of the country."
"In addition, the Commission will soon be in a position to announce the first projects for financial aid to the press, adopted as part of the media-democracy programme created on the initiative of the European Parliament in 1996."
"Point 7: the fatwa against Salman Rushdie."
"The Commission shares the profound concern of the European Parliament over the adoption and continuation of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie."
"The pronouncement of a death sentence on a citizen of a Member State of the European Union for having written a book is totally unacceptable and contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the declaration of the G7 Summit at its meeting in Lyons last June, calling on the Iranian government to abandon the path of terrorism and to stop supporting the death threats hanging over the head of Salman Rushdie."
"I should also remind you that the General Affairs Council of 22 April 1996 decided to make the dialogue with Iran more critical."
"For the Commission, the continuation of a critical dialogue with Iran is an effective instrument for producing a change in Iran's behaviour sooner or later."
"The eighth and last point is the arbitrary arrest of Tomislav Matanovic."
"The Commission is as concerned as the European Parliament by the arbitrary detention since 24 August 1995 of Father Tomislav Matanovic and his parents at Prijedor in the 'Republika Srpska' ."
"The Commission has enquired about this case."
"It has raised the matter several times with the NGOs in Sarajevo and will be discussing the case with the competent Bosnian authorities, particularly with the mediators installed under the Dayton Accord. I can assure you that the Commission will also urge Mr Carl Bildt to intervene with the official institutions in the 'Republika Srpska' with a view to obtaining the immediate release of Tomislav Matanovic and his parents."
"Madam President, may I be allowed to ask one or two supplementaries?"
"In doing so I must express keen disappointment with the Commission statement about Burma, which I find less than satisfactory."
"First of all I understood Mr Marin to say last month that he was opposed to the generalized system of preferences."
"There was no 'if' or 'but' about it and so I am surprised that the matter has been referred to a special committee."
"Secondly, it may be that the trade is small but investment is not and I do not think the Commissioner said anything about Carlsberg or Heineken or forthcoming investment which I think is very important."
"Thirdly, it was my understanding that there was to be a report shortly about forced labour."
"When is that report going to be made available, if it is indeed being prepared?"
"As regards the generalized system of preferences, I would remind you that there are Community procedures that the Commission must comply with, that these procedures begin with investigations, that these investigations are taking place, that they are confidential and that they then lead, depending on the situation, to proposals and decisions of the Commission about maintaining the generalized system of preferences."
"I repeat that the Commission is currently carrying out these investigations."
"As they are confidential, I cannot of course reveal their contents."
"What I can say is that these investigations are being carried out speedily since they have to be completed by September and that the Commission will draw from them all the necessary conclusions."
"I can assure you that the Commission will take into account the essential elements concerning human rights and democracy, in accordance with the powers vested in it for the application of these regulations."
"Madam President, I put questions which have not been answered."
"I think I am entitled to an answer to the two other questions concerning investment and the report on forced labour."
"If the Commissioner is not able to reply at this moment would he be good enough at least to give me a reply in writing?"
"Mr Moorhouse, I take good note of your request."
"I cannot answer you today, but we shall reply to you very shortly and directly."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0877/96 by Mr Haarder and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reformist Party, on Taiwan's role in international organizations; -B4-0881/96 by Mrs Laurila and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on Taiwan's role in international organizations; -B4-0904/96 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance in the European Parliament, on Taiwan's role in international organizations; -B4-0926/96 by Mr Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on Taiwan's role in international organizations."
"Madam President, the Liberal Group is a cosignatory of the joint resolution on Taiwan and this is not the first time that Parliament has been called on to stress the positive role played by Taiwan in the development of the Far East and its contribution to aid for developing countries."
"This is not the first time, either, that we have to highlight the progress of democracy enabling the Chinese population to have a democratic Chinese state, which is a very happy state of affairs."
"The aim of this proposal is to go further."
"Chancelleries are petrified by any relationship with Taiwan."
"The European Union has the advantage of more flexible formulae."
"Complaints are sometimes heard that Information Offices are not true ambassadors."
"Let us turn a handicap to advantage: the opening of a Commission Information Office in Taiwan would make it possible to develop and strengthen fruitful relationships and to do so without too much trouble."
"Madam President, at last we have got round to discussing freely those recommendations which the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted unanimously, with the exception of two members, as long ago as April."
"Now we are discussing the matter as an urgent topic because, if Parliament adopts these recommendations, they will have to be brought to the attention of the UN General Assembly when it reconvenes in the autumn."
"I do not intend to take you all through the long history, which has led to there being a People's Republic of China and a Republic of China, referred to hereinafter as Continental China and Taiwan so that there will at least be no confusion in interpreting, as sometimes happens."
"We all remember that since 1971 Continental China has been the only official Chinese Member State in the UN."
"However, a lot has happened since 1971."
"First of all, in the 1980s there was the remarkable economic development which led to democratization, and also in the 1980s there was a rapprochement between Continental China and Taiwan and an improvement in relations between them."
"Then the Taiwanese began to go on quite frequent visits to Continental China, Taiwanese investments in Continental China became possible, etc. The situation suddenly changed in the 1990s, when relations cooled noticeably, partly because Taiwan's democratic development had speeded up considerably and Taiwan was beginning to be regarded as a fully democratic society along the West European model."
"The fact that Taiwan had repealed the laws from the period of martial law as early as the 1980s, did not help this cooling off in the 1990s."
"The lowest point in relations was reached this year in March, when Taiwan approached its fully democratic, free and direct presidential elections reflecting the people's choice."
"Before this Taiwan had already held democratic elections to a representative institution in 1991 and again in 1995."
"President Li was re-elected Taiwan's President in the general elections in March this year."
"In his discussions since the election he has stressed his desire to hold a dialogue with Continental China on cooperation and the relaxing of relationships."
"Taiwan's international importance both in Asia and here in Europe is so great, and Taiwan's contribution is so important now in terms of development cooperation, environmental activities and other areas, that Taiwan can in my opinion no longer be left outside the international organizations under the auspices of the UN."
"I have myself drawn up a report on the subject in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which was adopted here, as I mentioned, in April this year with only two members opposing it, but which owing to the opposition of the Socialist Group and for technical reasons it has not been possible to debate in this house."
"Now, to my surprise, I see that the Socialist Group is again opposing the adoption of these urgent motions for resolutions irrespective of the fact that all the Socialist Group members in the Foreign Affairs Committee supported the provisions of my report, which are just the same as the ones which we are adopting today in our vote."
"For example, I have not started from the assumption that Taiwan should be proposed as a full member of the UN, because I see that this is not realistic, but my recommendations assume that Taiwan should be able to take part in the activities of the organizations under the auspices of the UN, as well as in the organizations loosely associated with the UN."
"All the European Union Member States have their own information offices in Taipei, and I have therefore proposed that the European Union could also open an information office there."
"These are the main recommendations which are being put forward in this proposal."
"A population of 21 million can no longer be sidelined, as if they had never existed."
"In my opinion we in Europe should feel a sense of responsibility because we have demanded democracy from Taiwan, and Taiwan has gone a long way down that road."
"This democracy should be rewarded."
"Finally, Madam President, I would refer to the fact that there are two particularly bad translation errors in the Finnish translation: paragraph 1(b) and (d) have become quite comical."
"The Finnish translation should say 'in the activities of bodies answerable to the UN General Assembly' and in point (d) 'the Council urges the Commission to adopt measures'."
"The Finnish language translation is quite inappropriate, even though the original language of these recommendations was Finnish, and I do not know how this entirely inappropriate Finnish wording ended up here."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, by voting for this resolution today Parliament will show that it is appalled by realpolitik ."
"By voting for this resolution, Parliament will affirm, admittedly with moderation but with a great sense of responsibility, that the exclusion of Taiwan from the international community is unacceptable."
"Yes, such exclusion is an example of the hypocrisy of the whole Western world and we must put an end to it as quickly as possible!"
"Today Taiwan is an unquestionable democratic reality, whereas we are very far from being able to say the same about a neighbouring country, which day by day steps up its policy of repression but still has a privileged relationship with a Europe incapable of reconciling its essential commercial aspirations with the will to affirm respect for human rights and the promotion of democracy all over the world."
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance will vote with conviction for a text which has had, as our colleague Mrs Laurila has reminded us, to surmount many obstacles before being put to the vote in this Parliament."
"Madam President, the Green Group in the European Parliament has joined in tabling this joint motion for a resolution, since we support the legitimate desire of Taiwan to be admitted to the international community of nations."
"Taiwan has made significant progress over the past year towards democratization."
"We want to give active encouragement to this process so that further advances will be possible, particularly in respect of human rights, employee rights, equality of opportunity for women and environmental protection."
"We think that democratic advances will be boosted by Taiwan's participation in international fora."
"No country in the region is threatened by Taiwan."
"The Taiwanese Government has for some time taken a serious interest in achieving détente in its relations with the People's Republic of China."
"This gave us all the more reason for concern over China's sabre-rattling at the time of the elections in Taiwan."
"Next year the currently British colony of Hong Kong will be given back to China."
"The handover may prove to be a test-case to determine whether the People's Republic is willing to respect established social and political structures or whether China can only impose its authority by coercion and repression."
"The EU should exert its influence on the People's Republic of China in order to promote the process of détente in the region."
"This state has long since ceased to meet the criteria for the label 'Red' China as, in economic policy terms, the Peking Government has for years been pursuing a muscular form of industrialization reminiscent of the early days of capitalism."
"The European Commission has over the past two years been systematically promoting economic relations with China."
"It should now develop its cooperative links with Taiwan."
"A first concrete step would be to open a European Union information office in Taipei."
"This step, which would be a very important gesture in signalling the European Union's interest in the development of Taiwan, should be taken as soon as possible."
"I hope soon to get an answer from the Commission which will give the lie to the slogan which has become current: MEPs ask questions, Commission gives no answers."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the nationalists were forced to flee the Chinese mainland and seek refuge in former Formosa, now Taiwan, an enormous amount has been achieved on that island through hard work and intelligence and with the support of overseas Chinese elsewhere in the world."
"Taiwan, with only 21 million inhabitants, is an economic power to be reckoned with in the world economy."
"Despite the widening political differences between China and Taiwan, Taiwan is one of the leading investors on the mainland."
"The Chinese Government's recent aggressive sabre-rattling just before the elections did not inhibit progress towards democracy in Taiwan."
"Anything but!"
"This aggressive action did, however, lead to a build-up of arms in the region, according to reliable sources."
"Immediately after the elections Taiwan made a gesture of peace to resume the interrupted negotiations with Beijing, but never received an answer."
"So today's resolution is on the one hand a tribute to democratic Taiwan, clearing the way for its membership of international organizations."
"It is also a call to encourage Taiwan to cooperate with the mainland."
"I fully endorse this resolution."
"And I voted for it in the Foreign Affairs Committee, as Mrs Laurila said."
"But a sizeable proportion of my Group is not in favour of points B and D concerning an EU information office in Taipei and the consideration of possible membership of UN agencies."
"My Group will request a split vote on these points."
"Madam President, I heartily concur with what the previous speakers have said, particularly the remarks of Mrs Laurila, for whose report I also voted in the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"I would like to add something, however."
"It is somewhat rare today that such matters have to be dealt with in a topical and urgent debate."
"It had been the long-standing custom of the European Parliament to draw up reports on the political situation in particular regions through its committees, especially the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"In those committees, we were able to examine and discuss situations in all their aspects."
"Suddenly, that is becoming increasingly difficult and, in this case, quite impossible."
"So we have to use any opportunity we can get to put out an opinion of the European Parliament."
"What is the actual reason for this opposition of the Social Democratic Group?"
"They are otherwise always so keen on autonomy, self-determination, democracy and human rights."
"Why are they giving way to pressure from a country, which has incidentally put severe pressure on the rapporteur because of this report on Taiwan?"
"Are they so eager to show deference to China?"
"I really do not know."
"Why should the European Union not support a country which has great economic significance in the region, which is on the road to democracy, which in other words is also a factor of democracy, in a way which after all does not alter the political situation?"
"Why do we seek to prevent a nation from realizing the capabilities and possibilities it possesses in the great network of international organizations?"
"It is really incomprehensible, for we have had links with that country going back many years."
"We should above all remember who is exerting pressure here."
"Again and again, we find that human rights and concepts of democracy are at stake, and we should really not set a bad example here."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the problem with Taiwan as regards international law?"
"It is that of the recognition of a government."
"After a terrible war, both parties claimed to represent the whole of China."
"The authorities in Taipei did not lack arguments on this point: they were set up by the last legal government; the Communists had seized power by force; the Taiwan parliament resulted from the last free Chinese elections, imperfect as they were."
"Today, forty-eight years after seizure of power by the Communists, the terms of the problem are different."
"It must be accepted that we can no longer be content to choose between the two Chinese authorities."
"Even States which maintain diplomatic relations solely with Beijing have to take account of this large island with a population of 20 million ruled by a genuine, effective, stable and peaceful power."
"Establishing international relations with Taiwan is in the interests of the international community and it is also in the interests of the whole of China, until continental China and the billion human beings living there are finally liberated from the bloody, totalitarian Marxist-Leninist dictatorship, which not long ago had, we should remember, so many ardent defenders even in this Chamber - and not only on the benches of the left, alas!"
"Is it necessary to remind you, Mr Nordmann, that Mr Giscard d'Estaing once really believed that Mao Tse Tung could be described as 'a beacon of world thought' ?"
"So, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what satisfaction it is today to see the joint resolution catch up, after several decades, with the solutions proposed by the European Right to the problem of Taiwan!"
"Madam President, I am glad to be able to restate a number of arguments."
"In my view Taiwan is a sovereign state."
"Taiwan is a democracy."
"Taiwan upholds human rights."
"Taiwan is an important partner in the world economy and a significant trading partner of the European Union and most of the Member States."
"But Taiwan plays no official part on the world stage."
"21 million people are deprived of a voice in the United Nations."
"21 million people are unable to benefit from the information, expertise and experience of the World Health Organization."
"The people of Taiwan cannot benefit from UNESCO."
"Taiwan's children cannot benefit form the services of UNICEF."
"Taiwan respects the terms agreed for international trade."
"Taiwan is not a member of the World Trade Organization."
"Her membership of the World Trade Organization is in our interest too."
"So Taiwan should be made a member forthwith, and so should China."
"Membership of UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Trade Organization must not be withheld from the people of Taiwan."
"Nor must membership of the United Nations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has taken careful note of Parliament's call to open an information office in Taiwan."
"Today, and for the time being, the Commission has no intention of opening such an office."
"However, the question could be re-examined in the event of Taiwan acceding to the World Trade Organization, since that would bring a new element into the trade relations between that country and the European Union."
"The question of opening an office once Taiwan becomes a member of the World Trade Organization could be re-examined, provided of course that there are sufficient budgetary resources."
"Any possible office of this type would not be a delegation with diplomatic status, but an office responsible for defending the interests of the Union."
"I would remind you in any case that the European Union's interests in Taiwan are mainly of a commercial nature, so that the work of the office in question would inevitably be centred on commercial matters, but could of course also be extended to areas such as information and culture as many European universities have links with Taiwan universities."
"Eventually, the office would be very similar to those that some Member States and a few third countries have already opened in Taiwan."
"The decision to open such an office would therefore be in accordance with the policy long pursued by the Union in that part of the world."
"Consequently - and I emphasize this point - it would contribute nothing to a possible recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state."
"First, I should like to say to Mr Gollnisch that if we had both to take part in a debate on our relationships with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, it should not be limited to the latter's judgement of Mao Tse Tung."
"But I have asked to speak in order to put a supplementary question to the Commissioner, who linked the opening of a Commission Information Office in Taiwan to that country's accession to the World Trade Organization."
"Is this a necessary or a sufficient condition?"
"I have not so much a question for the Commissioner, Madam President, more a comment in reply to Mrs Lenz."
"We had absolutely no wish for urgency on the subject of Taiwan."
"Nor did our Group put down a motion for a resolution."
"Really we wanted things to proceed in the usual manner via the Committee on Foreign Affairs and your colleague's report."
"I now have the impression that we are being reproached for our coolness on this resolution which does not really concern a matter of urgency."
"But to make things perfectly clear: we voted against urgency for Taiwan on Wednesday evening and we would far rather see the subject dealt with in the normal manner via a normal report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Just to clarify matters, Madam President."
"Very briefly, Madam President."
"On this point at least, we are in agreement with Mr Nordmann."
"I do not understand the Commissioner's reply very well."
"Why wait for the green light from the World Trade Organization?"
"Does that mean, to put it bluntly, that we await the permission of the Americans?"
"While on its side the World Trade Organization is itself perhaps waiting for the European Union to take the initiative?"
"If that is so, it could be a very long wait and since the Commissioner has told us very clearly that there is no question of diplomatic recognition, I do not really see why we are so afraid of the prospect of opening up trade representation."
"Madam President, may I ask the Commissioner if the European Commission will be closing its delegations in all countries which are not members of the World Trade Organization?"
"Madam President, I should like to state very briefly that we should not be hypocritical and two-faced in this house but should discuss matters openly."
"We may disagree, but we must speak openly."
"We all know that the Socialist Group prevented the Foreign Affairs Committee from approving the report coming for debate."
"And that is what we are talking about today - not about the fact that the Socialist Group wished at all costs to prevent the subject of Taiwan being discussed as an urgent question."
"In any case, I refer to the procedure which has been in force in the Bureau."
"In my opinion we all benefit from the fact that we speak openly and call things by their real names."
"If we oppose something we must oppose it openly instead of saying that we have never opposed anything but its being debated as an urgency."
"We would have liked this to have become a normal report adopted by the Foreign Affairs Committee in the normal way."
"The Socialist Group has prevented this."
"Madam President, necessary or sufficient condition? I repeat what I said very clearly: an essential condition for the re-examination of the question."
"Do not worry, Mr Gollnisch, we are not waiting for the green light from the WTO, but the European Union has very precise powers as far as trade is concerned and hence it seems obvious that the day when Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization will have an effect on trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan."
"That is why, given the powers of the European Union, the WTO is taken into account; it is, of course, certainly not because we have to ask for authorization from the World Trade Organization, an authorization that in any case it would have great difficulty in giving us."
"To answer another question that was raised, it is not a matter today of closing delegations."
"We are now engaged in a process relating to the World Trade Organization which dates back to the Marrakesh agreements two years ago."
"Under the terms of these agreements, we are now negotiating the entry into the World Trade Organization of a number of countries, which requires several conditions to be met, and we see in the enlargement of the World Trade Organization a strengthening of the 'multilateralization' of trade which is a good thing for the European Union which has every interest in preserving an open and multilateral trading system."
"I therefore think that the question on the agenda today is more that of the enlargement and opening up of the WTO to non-Member States rather than that of its closure."
"Madam President, I have to say again that to argue in terms of the WTO, Commissioner, is not actually an answer."
"I could understand the social principles of the ILO being quoted."
"But the WTO is not exactly the personification of democracy."
"So this answer did not convince me at all."
"The European Union should pursue an independent policy; bringing the WTO into the discussion is really ridiculous."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0981/96 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reformist Party, on the escalation of the fighting in Chechnya; -B4-0901/96 by Mrs Lalumière, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the resumption of the fighting in Chechnya; -B4-0920/96 by Mr Puerta, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Chechnya; -B4-0925/96 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the attacks of the Russian military on Chechnya; -B4-0948/96 by Mrs Hoff and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Chechnya; -B4-0951/96 by Mr von Habsburg and Mrs Oomen-Ruiten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on developments in Chechnya."
"Madam President, the tragic events in Chechnya mean quite simply that Yeltsin is rather less trustworthy than he purported to be at the time of the elections."
"Many Chechen citizens have already been killed."
"Many, many more have fled, and this is not only a slap in the face for the Chechen negotiators and the people of Russia but also a flagrant breach of the agreement which currently exists between the Union and Russia."
"A clear signal from our Union is thus called for, and I would remind the House that it is this same Russia which has just been admitted to the Council of Europe amid great fanfares and trumpeting."
"The intention in admitting Russia to the Council of Europe was to exert rather more influence on the situation on the ground."
"So we must make quite sure we convey our grave displeasure to Yeltsin, the duly elected President."
"It should also be a signal to General Lebed, whom we cannot exactly be sure of either."
"His main election pledge was to end the war in Chechnya but now, after the bombing, he has pledged full support for Yeltsin's policy."
"Does that inspire confidence?"
"I think not."
"Madam President, what has happened in Chechnya is precisely what was very easy to foresee."
"Without even waiting for the official announcement of the result of the presidential elections, Mr Yeltsin went back on his statement that he wanted a peaceful solution to the Chechen problem and immediately ordered a new military offensive that has already caused hundreds of deaths over the past few days."
"In just a few short hours, all President Yeltsin's electoral promises went out of the window."
"We even begin to wonder how much real power President Yeltsin has in ruling Russia."
"Mr Bertens' reference to General Lebed seems pertinent."
"My Group feels that the unilateral resumption, by the Russian army, of the military offensive in Chechnya is incompatible with the spirit and letter of the agreement currently in force between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"We cannot sit back and watch the elimination of an entire population and the destabilization of an entire area, the Caucasus, which, because of the Chechen conflict, is again at risk of exploding with all its problems."
"We therefore call on the Commission to use its legislative powers to propose suspension of the agreement between the European Union and Russia."
"I think this is the only way of exerting pressure, especially as the United States and the entire international community have already roundly condemned the resumption of hostilities in Chechnya."
"My Group also demands that all possible steps be taken to ensure that President Yeltsin withdraws Russian troops from Chechnya, in accordance with his own decree of 25 June 1996 and with the two cease-fire agreements signed by him before the elections, just a few weeks ago."
"Madam President, my colleague is quite right."
"For a year and a half - with very few interruptions - Russian troops have been bombarding Chechen settlements."
"Thousands of civilians have fled, without recognition and without rights."
"Human rights violations in the filtration camps are hardly even mentioned."
"And western governments look on, pat Yeltsin on the back and praise his democratic reform process!"
"I cannot help thinking of the Council statement after the elections."
"What a democracy!"
"And what mendacity!"
"Instead of the expected peace talks, Yeltsin again deploys heavy artillery against the civilian population one day after the elections."
"In so doing, he destroys the confidence of all the voters in his country."
"There is not much hope left for a democratic development."
"Yet the agreement we have concluded with Russia sets democratic development and respect for human rights as preconditions."
"I remind the Commission that that was the basis for the interim agreement; you said that we could exert greater influence through the interim agreement."
"But, as I see things, absolutely nothing is happening."
"At this point, I would like to ask the Commission: will it propose to the Council that the interim agreement be suspended?"
"Will it ensure that a conciliation committee, as provided for under the interim agreement, is brought into operation?"
"Has the Commission formulated a basis for concrete steps to be taken against the Russian Government?"
"Or does the Commission accept these attacks on the civilian population in the northern Caucasus?"
"Will it continue to look on?"
"I would like a very concrete answer to these questions for, in this Parliament, it is our job to support democratic forces Russia, and they are growing ever weaker."
"We hope that we can support the soldiers' mothers, the peace groups, because they are the hope for that country."
"Madam President, it is unfortunately not the first time the European Parliament has had to consider the war in Chechnya in a topical and urgent debate."
"After the start of negotiations and President Yeltsin's promises during the election campaign, we had every hope that this bloody and tragic conflict would be ended by a political solution and that actual peace negotiations would begin."
"That is what both the Russian and the Chechen people want."
"Sadly, however, that hope was short-lived."
"One increasingly gets the impression that the lofty promises were merely part of a coldly calculated election strategy."
"That kind of thing is cynical and shows contempt for humanity."
"The European Parliament cannot and will not remain silent in the face of such conduct."
"Of course, we know here that there are plenty of groups on the Chechen side whose readiness for violence is not slow to manifest itself."
"But that does not excuse the behaviour of Russian soldiers who turn their guns on Chechen villages and destroy them and whose main victims are, once again, the civilian population."
"The European Union supported President Yeltsin politically and materially during the election campaign."
"That was a pledge of confidence in advance, which must now be justified politically."
"Our message to the Russian President and to Russian politicians is quite clear: Russia cannot be admitted to the Council of Europe and demand the expansion and deepening of relations and cooperation with the European Union and, at the same time, fail to end the bloody war in Chechnya and the continuing violations of human rights, despite all protests, appeals and warnings."
"This is also a call to the new Russian Government."
"The great majority of Members of the European Parliament are interested in good and intensive cooperation with Russia."
"We are doing good preparatory work on this in the Delegation for Relations with Russia, but we cannot continue to do so regardless of the circumstances."
"Cooperation is a two-way street, and shutting our eyes or looking away from the bloody events in Chechnya cannot be allowed to become a principle of our policy."
"There will be no military solution to this conflict. I therefore call on everyone concerned, on behalf of the Socialist Group, finally to work seriously for a political solution that justifies the term peace negotiations."
"Madam President, the Chechen drama furnishes yet another clear demonstration of what the words and promises of Russia, particularly the present Russian regime, are worth."
"We should not forget what Yeltsin proclaimed in his June decree, namely that he would withdraw the troops."
"General Lebed said up to election day that he was in favour of ending the Chechen war and after the election - bearing out what I said earlier - that he favoured a military solution."
"In a word: we have again been completely misled in the matter of this Chechen war, at least those who took the declarations seriously."
"I was not one of them, because I know a little history and hence am well aware that you cannot base anything on such words, and that advance benefits of any kind only bring about one result: they merely encourage certain personalities to continue their gangsterism."
"Finally, Madam President, there is something else we must realize: Russia today, in the age of decolonization worldwide, is the last great colonial empire on earth."
"The French were in West Africa when the first Russian crossed the Urals in order to conquer Asian territory."
"And what is happening in Chechnya is only the start of decolonization in Russia."
"Hence, in order to save our credibility, we must really stand up for the selfdetermination of nations - that applies to the Chechens too - and we must put serious pressure on Russia to keep the promises it has made."
"If they break their word again, we must not reward those responsible by maintaining financial aid, which will only encourage them to carry on as before."
"Chechnya is a historic challenge for us."
"Whether we are up to it, only our future will tell."
"Commissioner, I am afraid that we are repeating ourselves, but well, in this case I think it is not excessive."
"Those of us with little faith in Mr Yeltsin's democratic spirit felt, back in May, that the signing of agreements was no more than an unsubtle political manoeuvre."
"Unfortunately we were right because no sooner were the election results known than the bombings started and, as others have said, hundreds of civilians were killed and hundreds and thousands of civilians were forced to take flight."
"It seems to us that, once and for all - and not only in the case of Chechnya but also Turkey and many other countries - the European Union must use the means of pressure at its disposal in its agreements, thanks to the democratic and human rights protection clauses, to avoid such massacres."
"The European Union, including the European Parliament, must be told that this pressure is absolutely necessary if we want to bring an end to killings in Chechnya and if we want to end the violations of human rights in so many countries."
"We in the European Parliament are aware of what is happening all the time to human rights in many other countries."
"All we can ask, Commissioner, is that pressure be exerted to stop killings."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your debate with much interest and I have taken careful note of what speakers said."
"For the most part, I share your anxiety and I can assure you that the Commission is seriously concerned by recent developments in the situation in Chechnya."
"The Commission regrets that the two parties have not fulfilled the undertakings they gave in the cease-fire agreements of 21 May 1996 and 10 June 1996."
"The Commission is particularly worried about the difficulties experienced by the OSCE assistance group in Grozny, commissioned to mediate between the two sides."
"The Commission is also concerned about the working conditions of the humanitarian aid organizations."
"The European Union is by far the largest provider of humanitarian aid to Chechnya."
"The aid teams do not have free and completely secure access to all Chechen regions."
"The Commission is monitoring the situation in close collaboration with Member States and strongly reiterates its disquiet over the new outburst of violence in Chechnya."
"The Commission calls on Russia to honour the commitments it has made, particularly at the time of its accession to the Council of Europe."
"It is convinced that the only way to settle the issues in dispute between the parties is through negotiation and, in this respect, no efforts should be spared to achieve this objective."
"Madam President, I have just one request, namely that the Commissioner answer my questions."
"I am not going to repeat the words of the statement I made on behalf of the Commission, but I have taken careful note of Mrs Schroedter's statement which I will pass on to the responsible Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now take the vote."
"Reconstruction aid to former Yugoslavia (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0247/96) by Mr Cars, on the proposal for a Council Regulation relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Mr President, Mr Cars' report is most important in that it opens up new and improved perspectives for the whole of former Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular."
"The report properly details what needs to be done and on what conditions measures need to be tackled."
"I am especially pleased that a number of additions were made during the deliberations in committee which certainly deserve the support of my Group, the Christian Democrats."
"A notable omission for us is the position of Vojvodina which is not actually mentioned in the report."
"We discussed this in committee too and the Christian Democrats' amendment is worded in such a way that I think it will meet with the House's approval."
"The fact is that the cultural and political rights of the national minority in Vojvodina must be respected, and this must be one of the criteria for granting aid in the territory of the Republic of Serbia proper, for example, or the rump Yugoslavia."
"So reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina is tied to all manner of political considerations and conditions."
"That is not just a political idée fixe , or an excuse for steering people in a certain direction."
"Travelling round, in the Banja Luka area, for example, where there is no devastation, you see that the only things which need rebuilding are mosques and catholic churches."
"It only makes sense to rebuild these if the refugees who fled are coming back."
"There is thus a total overlap, between political considerations and the practical necessities."
"So it is most important that we make sure to help where help is needed and not where there is little actual damage."
"And the same goes for the East and West sectors of Mostar."
"There is no point putting money into West Mostar where hardly anything has been destroyed; East Mostar, however, has been flattened, so it makes sense to concentrate on rebuilding East Mostar."
"And to focus on activities which impel people to work together across ethnic lines."
"In the Neretva valley there are also many villages which have simply been devastated; here too, reconstruction must be directly conditional on the return of refugees."
"The Cars report raises an important question concerning the overseeing of policy."
"It is particularly regrettable that the Council has favoured Article 12 as a means of clipping the Commission's wings completely."
"This is something against which every parliamentarian should really protest vigorously."
"I think it is most important to get Article 12 changed, as Parliament wants."
"We are not going to have our supervisory powers taken away by a bunch of cowering despots whose only concern is to interpose extra red tape between the Commission and the job to be done."
"I think this is a most important point and I hope the Commission and by extension the Council will act on our requests to change this article so that Parliament's powers of scrutiny remain undiminished."
"Mr President, following the many political pronouncements on the form which aid to former Yugoslavia should take it is now time to discuss the regulation on the basis of which that aid may be given."
"It is high time the decisions were implemented."
"The six months' delay caused by the Council and Commission is most regrettable."
"Rapporteur Cars rightly castigates the Council for unnecessarily complicating the procedures by introducing a regulatory committee, and Mr Oostlander is also right in the points he makes."
"I compliment Mr Cars, who should have been sitting next to me but is, as we know, already busy elsewhere, on his alertness and his fresh ideas."
"I think it is important that this regulation too should include the conditionality to which we have already given so much attention in this House."
"No chance must be missed of ensuring that the parties punctiliously carry out the Dayton Agreement."
"I warmly endorse the rapporteur's idea of allowing PHARE countries to submit bids within the limits of available funds."
"Given that some of the money for Yugoslavia comes from PHARE it is a good idea to allow the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to tender for contracts in former Yugoslavia."
"It will be good for all of us."
"Finally I urge the Union institutions to get this regulation brought into effect as soon as possible."
"The building and sowing season is starting in Bosnia and it is most important, moreover, that the people of former Yugoslavia should see visible signs of progress in advance of September's elections."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reconstruction aid for former Yugoslavia has to satisfy two criteria: it must be possible to deploy it quickly and efficiently."
"Unhappily the sad reality is that this is not the case."
"As a number of honourable Members have said, the money has been available since January but so far nothing can be paid out."
"That is an utter disgrace."
"To our mind the regulation as it currently stands focuses too much on a centrally managed aid programme, when the central structures in former Yugoslavia are still not functioning at all."
"Like Parliament's Committee on Budgets, we are very much in favour of having this aid deployed regionally and locally, naturally with the necessary guarantees of conditionality."
"The Green Group in Parliament has thus retabled the amendments of the Committee on Budgets in the hope that they will be supported by the plenary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course the Commission proposal is rather late in coming."
"Something is not right with the bureaucracy in Brussels."
"I fear that this delay will continue in the field."
"With these aid measures, the reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia could be ready for take-off if the conditions demanded by Parliament were really enforced."
"One of the preconditions is of course that the refugees can return."
"Another is that freedom of movement in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be restored - something that should have happened by the end of March, but did not."
"When the former Foreign Minister of Bosnia and current UN Ambassador can only travel to Banja Luka after three years under the protection of European parliamentarians, how can an ordinary mortal move around freely in that country?"
"How do our EU authorities in the field act in the event of violations?"
"I wonder whether indeed they do support projects the benefits of which only go, if at all, to part of the population or end up completely in the pockets of war profiteers."
"And, if we take our principles and conditions seriously, we must be able, wherever there are ruined houses, to force the local authorities into allowing the owners to return and then to help these people financially in the rebuilding work."
"In order to secure such an accommodating attitude on the part of the local authorities, supplementary economic or training projects could be financed on a local basis."
"In this way, our taxes could be very well spent and achieve optimum benefit."
"Such aid in the field would enhance the possibilities of repatriation for refugees currently living in our countries, which would in turn ease the financial burden on our communities."
"The approach which seems to be adopted only too often by the High Representative, namely to give even-handedly to everyone and rather to turn a blind eye to gross violations of the Dayton Agreement, is the wrong one in my opinion and does not hold out much hope of really achieving our current aims."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Regulation under consideration today and submitted for the opinion of Parliament, is an important contribution to the efforts towards reconstruction undertaken as part of the peace process."
"To consolidate the peace, the effects of war have to be obliterated."
"Reconstruction, which also has reconciliation as its aim, is therefore essential."
"Last January, the reconstruction effort was started with the programme of essential aid, financed from PHARE appropriations."
"In 1996, about ECU 125 million will be allocated to this effort."
"Community programmes involve all the priority sectors: housing, employment, transport, energy, water supplies, telecommunications and health care."
"High priority is being given to the return of refugees."
"The adoption of the Regulation now before you should provide the Union with the additional resources necessary for these activities."
"On the initiative of Parliament, three budget headings have been created, allocating a total of ECU 92 million."
"In view of the urgent nature of the reconstruction effort, a first instalment of ECU 27 million can already be committed."
"In the meantime, plans have been worked out for the remaining amount."
"The budget heading 'aid to refugees' provided with ECU 30 million will be allocated as soon as possible, in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Member States."
"As for the proposed amendments, I should like to make the following brief comments."
"First, the Commission shares the wish of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to bring the consultation process to a conclusion as quickly as possible so as to ensure speedy distribution of aid for reconstruction."
"In this connection, the Commission is wholly in favour of Amendment No 17 which allows invitations to tender and markets to be extended to countries benefiting from the PHARE programme, as is already the case for the TACIS programme."
"The Commission is also in favour of the amendments on: the duration of application of the Regulation, Amendment No 6; the transparency of its implementation, Amendment No 7; the conditions for the granting of aid, Amendment No 10, which also corresponds to the initial Commission proposal."
"The Commission is also in a position to accept the principle of inserting a special suspension clause for cases where the conditions for the granting of aid are infringed, Amendment No 11."
"However, it is of the opinion that the proposed procedure is cumbersome and probably has little applicability."
"Wishing to reserve the full role of Parliament in this area, the Commission intends to make a statement to the Council about the rapid briefing of your Assembly using a procedure identical to that agreed for financial cooperation with Turkey."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot accept a new budgetary formula - that is Amendment No 9 - it prefers to retain the traditional standard formula of the trialogue; neither can it accept a general relief from taxes and customs duties: Amendment No 16, which would pose other problems."
"The additional comment relating to elements of control and evaluation - Amendment No 20 - seems to us no longer necessary."
"Lastly, and I shall end with this, the Commission notes the points made concerning the political process in the former Yugoslavia."
"This is the subject of Amendments Nos 1 to 5, 8, 12 and 13."
"The Commission is of the opinion however that these points are already sufficiently taken into account in the Regulation proper and in the many statements by the Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow, at 9 a.m."
"Petitions in 1995/1996"
"The next item is the report (A4-0191/96) by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions in the parliamentary year 1995-1996."
"Mr President, I am presenting to this Assembly the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament for the period 14 March 1995 to 11 March 1996."
"This report sets out the work carried out not by the committee as a whole - that would not be accurate - but an active core, with the task of monitoring with rigour and out of a sense of service, I would say, presided over with authority and with rigour by Mr Newman."
"Mr President, the Committee on Petitions is one of the European Union's bodies that brings us closest to European citizens."
"At this moment in time, as we are examining the Union Treaties at the IGC, where one of the main concerns is the notion of European citizenship, the practice of the right to petition is one of the clearest expressions of the condition of European citizenship."
"This we were able to ascertain through our work, given the number of citizens who approach the European Parliament to voice their complaints, concerns and denouncements."
"Although this number is modest, I wish to point out that we have examined 1169 petitions over the last year, of which just over 600 were declared admissible; however, if you bear in mind that many of these petitions are signed by large numbers of citizens - in the case of collective petitions - we see that more than 700, 000 citizens expressed their confidence in the European Parliament to voice their complaints and to ask it to act as go-between."
"Therefore, this is an important question which the European Parliament is obliged to act upon with justice and speed."
"Here is the first question: at least the Committee on Petitions - through its chair, Mr Newman - should turn to other committees or delegations in the European Parliament and inform them of the content of these petitions and seek their support, information and opinion."
"From this point of view, I must emphasise the need for all committees and delegations to realise the importance of the concerns raised by the Committee on Petitions because this is really a way of responding to the confidence that our citizens have shown in us."
"These petitions are a way of gauging what concerns European citizens in respect of European legislation."
"But not only that."
"It also enables us to see where there are vacuums in European legislation, by looking at those petitions that cannot be answered because we lack the legal base; we should perhaps then think of the need to create European legislation to respond to those petitions."
"Mr President, the problem is more important when we cooperate with the Commission."
"Indeed, we greatly depend on the Commission so that our committee can respond to this cooperation."
"This is carried out more slowly and with more difficulties because the Member States' governments fail to cooperate and the Commission, Commissioner, is too soft on them."
"It usually refuses to take proceedings for failure to respect European Directives."
"Mr President, I think it is important for the Commission to be aware of the importance of the work carried out in the Committee on Petitions, which is now being backed up thanks to the cooperation of the European Ombudsman."
"Finally, Mr President, there have been five amendments to the report."
"These amendments have been tabled by highly qualified members of the Committee on Petitions."
"I must say that I regret that they were not tabled within the Committee itself, which would have enabled us to discuss them and improve the text."
"In any case, Mr President, I wish to conclude by saying that I agree with No 1, with an amendment to the wording, by an oral amendment which I shall table when the vote takes place."
"But I agree with all the others, especially No 4, tabled by Mr Santini, which is important if we are to get information across to the citizens."
"But I cannot accept the last, No 5, also tabled by Mr Santini, because I think its interpretation would restrict the principle of the right..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Petitions is the body in Parliament that maintains direct contact with the citizens of the Union."
"But, for many petitioners, it is incomprehensible that it should take so long for their submissions to be considered or for a solution to be found."
"This results from three basic problems, which we raise year after year and to which no satisfactory solution has been found to date."
"Firstly, the number of petitions, which has been rising for years, is making it increasingly difficult for the committee secretariat to cope with the work."
"Secondly, once a petition has been declared admissible, the Commission is asked for information."
"It increasingly often makes direct contact with the petitioner, thus shortening the circuitous route via the national representations."
"However, when it turns out that Member States are clearly in breach of Community law, the Commission hesitates for far too long before initiating proceedings for the violation of Treaty provisions."
"Thirdly, the Council rarely observes the terms of the interinstitutional agreement, which require prompt information to be supplied."
"Stalling tactics are used to withhold and delay information."
"When the Committee attempts to speed things up through an own-initiative procedure, i.e. by inspection of documents, the correspondence with the Council is declared to be confidential and document inspection is refused."
"To that extent, the wording of paragraph 7 of the resolution is much too mild; we parliamentarians have direct experience of the exasperation felt at bureaucratic case-handling and delays."
"I hope that in the future we shall find a way of ensuring the more efficient handling of petitions by the Commission and the Council."
"Even so, anyone who has read the report will have noted that, in many cases, it was possible to help petitioners in securing their rights."
"These petitions which reach a favourable outcome give us members of the Committee on Petitions the courage to persevere in applying all our energies to defending the interests of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, during the 1995-1996 parliamentary year the European Parliament received 1169 petitions."
"At the end of that parliamentary year the Committee on Petitions has 823 petitions still outstanding."
"The outcome of those petitions is detailed in the remarkable report by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, who has produced a very readable account."
"It seems our citizens have quite a few problems with the functioning of the single market."
"It seems that our fellow-citizens complain about the poor functioning of freedom of movement for individuals, for example in the exercise of the right of residence, for example in the equivalence of qualifications."
"It seems that our citizens submit a lot of petitions on environmental protection, more specifically non-compliance with the directive on environmental impact assessment."
"Some petitions bear many signatures."
"One petition from my own region of Limburg obtained 37 000 signatures in connection with the difficulties of discrimination between frontier workers from Belgian Limburg working in Dutch Limburg."
"The Maastricht Treaty introduced the notion of European citizenship."
"One of the most concrete rights for European citizens is the right to petition the European Parliament, and/or the European ombudsman."
"I should like to make three points in relation to this, Mr President."
"Firstly, what is the use of conferring a right if the person enjoying that right does not know he has it?"
"In other words, what use is the right to petition the European Parliament if Parliament does not publicize that right?"
"For this reason Europe's citizens need to be informed more thoroughly and more extensively about Article 138d of the Treaty."
"But information and communication are not enough of course if they merely state the existence of the right to petition as such."
"It must also be made clear in what cases petitions may be submitted and on what conditions."
"I think there is a pressing need for Parliament's offices in the Member States to be involved in the provision of this information."
"Secondly, there is no point announcing and publicizing a right if the exercise of that right is hampered by a lack of resources, both material and immaterial. In other words, petitions must be dealt with within a reasonable period of time, and it is here that we encounter problems."
"It is not just a question of infrastructure and logistics, though these too need to be improved; we should like to see the facilities for the secretariat expanded in terms of both staff and other necessary infrastructure."
"And we want the citizen submitting a petition to have that petition dealt with in the best way possible."
"So let us take a good look at the present situation."
"We still have 500 petitions under consideration which are more than a year old."
"So we have a whole year's worth of backlog to make up and that means we need to increase not only our staff but also the rhythm of our meetings."
"So I think we have to agree on a more efficient pattern of meetings, so that we do not overlap with Parliament's other committees, and we could do that on Thursday afternoons and Friday mornings, because there are no other committee meetings then. In other words we have to take the citizen seriously, we have to take his petitions seriously and we as Parliament must undertake to clear as much of the existing backlog as possible quickly and take the measures needed to make this possible."
"One again my thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report and I commend our amendments to the House."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I personally and the Green Group approve Mr Gutiérrez Díaz' report."
"The work of the Committee on Petitions, which has until now provided one of the most important links between citizens and the European Parliament, constitutes, together with the appointment of the European Ombudsman, a major element in the right of Union citizenship established by the Treaties."
"The petitions reaching the Committee give us an insight into citizens' problems; for example, they have in the past often brought us face to face with important problems, concerning in particular the environment and freedom of movement."
"I fully support the proposals in the report and would stress especially the following points: closer interaction between the Committee on Petitions and the other committees, with a follow-up including legislation, on major issues raised in petitions; the need for a good collaborative relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman; greater commitment by the Commission and Council to follow-up problems raised by the Committee on Petitions and the content of petitions submitted to it; criticism of delays and inadequate collaboration with the Member States named in petitions; finally, the need to deal with petitions speedily and effectively."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the parliamentary year 1995-1996 was marked by the long procedure involved in electing the European Ombudsman."
"A few weeks ago, Mr Söderman also presented his first activity report and it has been possible to see a real willingness to cooperate between the European Ombudsman, a new body set up under the Maastricht Treaty, and our Committee on Petitions, which can pride itself on its long experience."
"Such experience enables us to evaluate and appreciate the task of the European Ombudsman, and it is in the light of this that the rapporteur mentions the longer times taken to deal with petitions."
"Even if such delays can be attributed partly to the length of the procedure for electing the Ombudsman, we should nevertheless be very vigilant to prevent the right of citizens to petition from being undermined by procedural obstacles."
"May I therefore make a suggestion about the organization of our work."
"As the European Ombudsman works from Strasbourg, the official seat of this body, we could well envisage holding meetings of our Committee in Strasbourg in order, firstly, to shorten the delays gradually and, secondly, to mark symbolically the close cooperation between the European Parliament and the Ombudsman in Strasbourg, their common seat."
"The rapporteur rightly emphasizes - and I am still talking about organization - the effectiveness of the collaboration with the European Commission, which unfailingly expedites the complaints transmitted to it."
"It is regrettable that, in the case of Member States, this cooperation is somewhat grudging, particularly when the complainant alleges infringement of Community law by the Member State in question."
"However, I do not support the rapporteur's wish that the Commission should proceed further against recalcitrant Member States before the Court of Justice by invoking Article 169 of the Treaty."
"This is because it is important for our citizens to avoid long and complex stages of litigation, when very often a favourable outcome can be achieved by negotiation."
"The Ombudsman should play a major role here."
"Turning to the basis of the petitions recorded and dealt with, we see that a large number of complaints citing serious breaches of Community environmental legislation have been filed this year."
"You know that my group is very concerned about the full preservation of national sovereignties and a very strict respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"Nevertheless, in environmental matters, it is important for the European Union to exercise wider powers in a field which, by definition, is not confined within national boundaries."
"Recent events, like mad cow disease or the disastrous situation of the nuclear submarine bases at Murmansk, clearly illustrate the need for strong restraining action at European level."
"As the Member for Alsace, I am also very alive to the problems facing those who have to cross frontiers to work."
"Many of these workers suffer discrimination, particularly those working in Switzerland."
"I shall continue to keep a close watch on such difficulties and I hope that eventually this type of obstacle will be overcome through bilateral agreements."
"In conclusion, I hope that the appointment of the Ombudsman will provide even more effective protection for citizen's rights."
"It is in this way that public opinion in our countries will appreciate the real nature of European construction which, I have to say, too often appears ponderous and remote."
"Mr President, as chair of the Committee on Petitions I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, on our latest annual report."
"Mr Gutiérrez Díaz is a very active and senior Member of Parliament in a range of areas, including the Committee on Petitions."
"He has put forward this report backed by a great deal of experience and knowledge of our work, of the issues raised by petitioners and of how we try to assist them."
"The quality of the report reflects his experience and involvement."
"It is widely recognized that the European Union is too remote from ordinary citizens and that is why our Committee on Petitions tries to break down the barriers by giving all citizens and residents the right to put their views on any matter or their complaints on any grievance which falls within the competence of the European Union."
"I do not want to repeat things which have already been said by the rapporteur and other speakers in the debate."
"Quite clearly the kind of issues we deal with concern agriculture, social affairs of various kinds and customs issues."
"There are a large number of environmental petitions usually alleging contravention of European Community environmental legislation."
"There are petitions concerning taxation matters, freedom of movement and recognition of diplomas, access to education, access to work, conditions of work, residence permits, transfer of social rights, border controls for all the people who are trying or have tried to exercise their rights of free movement, their rights within the European Union."
"So we try to assist the petitioners."
"But we have some problems which we should try to resolve."
"I have tried to give a lead in helping to resolve them with the support of committee members over the past period."
"The committee is much more open than it used to be."
"It is the exception rather than the rule that we deal with petitions in private now."
"Most of our work is open to the public."
"It is very important that Parliament's external services, in particular Parliament's external offices take seriously the provision of information, informing citizens and residents of the Member States of their right to petition."
"Not enough is done there and it is important."
"In the recent past a number of Members of Parliament who are not on the committee have realized the role and importance of the Committee on Petitions: when their constituents have put forward petitions they have come along to support them and have appreciated the opportunity to do that."
"My last point is that our main problem is with the Member States."
"The Ombudsman deals with allegations of maladministration in European Community institutions and bodies."
"Our petitions usually deal with the fact that Member States do not implement European Community rules, regulations and laws properly to the detriment of citizens and residents."
"We do not get cooperation from the Member States."
"We do not get representatives of the Council or from the Permanent Representatives attending committee meetings."
"We have problems with the Commission but our principal problems getting assistance to citizens derive from the Member States and that is one of the reasons for the delays."
"One of the reasons why petitions sometimes stay open for two or three years is because we are batting them back and forwards to the Member States either via the Commission or directly, trying to get a response, trying to get assistance and support for the petitioner."
"The best way citizens can get support and we can get help in our work in assisting citizens is if the Member States take the right to petition the European Parliament - which they have agreed to in an Interinstitutional agreement and in the Maastricht Treaty - more seriously."
"Mr President, after all, it was a trick to check whether this whole idea of petitions works."
"I had been excluded from the debate, I made a petition and now, here I am, speaking to the House."
"It is a good sign for this report, which opens the door to a new phase of activity."
"Firstly, I, too, would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, an ever-present and enthusiastic member of this Committee, which some people, perhaps wrongly, consider to be, perhaps not in the 'second division' , but at least rather less interesting than some of the other committees."
"Personally, I have had occasion to get genuinely excited about some cases."
"You feel you are doing something useful: sometimes, you deal with a petition, discuss the issue and reach a concrete solution."
"I believe that if any European citizen, or indeed any Member of this House, could see this Committee at work, they would adopt a new philosophy and feel truly a part of European democratic life."
"After all, the right to petition is a reassuring guarantee for citizens, almost a form of insurance against the abuses that can undermine democracy."
"In a context of freedom, security, peace and progress, I would say that the European Union has found the right formula for making its citizens feel included, alongside and within European Institutions."
"It is a formula that, amongst other things, makes it possible to iron out any defects in Community justice."
"And yet, having said this, I wonder how many citizens are aware of this wonderful opportunity."
"Article 138 of the Treaty states that: ' Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having his registered office in a Member State, shall have the right to address, individually or in association with other citizens or persons, a petition to the European Parliament on a matter which comes within the Community's fields of activity...' , etc, etc."
"Now, I wonder: how many people have access to the Treaties and how many people are familiar with them?"
"Which suggests there is here a need to make citizens more aware, in a more practical and concrete way, of these instruments and, particularly, of the ways and means of gaining access to them."
"But citizens also need to be clear about the role of this Committee."
"Very well, it is a pettifogging Committee, but we must not give citizens excessive expectations or illusions."
"We must also clearly indicate the limits within which this Committee can and must work."
"This means it is important for there to be a link with the European Ombudsman, a symbiosis, that helps to create this guaranteed area of safety for citizens."
"This would imply less dispersal of resources and would also reduce the number of petitions that are so often met with a phrase that must be displeasing to a European citizen: rejected."
"That one word alone can give rise to a moment's disaffection."
"So, my compliments to the rapporteur and Mr Newman and everyone who believes in this institution, which I believe is about to go up in our citizen's estimation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's annual appraisal of petitions addressed to it by European citizens provides an appropriate moment to reflect on the relationship existing between these citizens and the European Union."
"When addressing a petition to the European Parliament, a citizen of the Union complains of the faulty application of Community legislation but by so doing, he also expresses his confidence that the European Parliament, together with the other institutions, will redress the injustice he believes he has suffered."
"Dealing with petitions thoroughly and doing everything possible to satisfy citizens' complaints without delay: this is what is essential if we do not want the confidence of our citizens to be disappointed and if we wish the exercise of citizens' rights in Europe to have meaning in their eyes."
"At a time when a debate is taking place in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference on ways of bringing the citizens of the European institutions closer to each other, such a direct relationship between the citizen and Parliament must be preserved and encouraged."
"The excellent report by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz shows once again that citizens address a very large number of petitions to Parliament and I associate myself here with the many congratulations offered to the rapporteur and to his work."
"These petitions are concerned with such sensitive areas for our citizens as social security, the environment, taxation, freedom of movement for persons, recognition of diplomas and degrees, to quote only a few of the principal ones, but a few that undoubtedly concern the citizen most deeply."
"To guarantee full respect for Community legislation in these areas and to strengthen this legislation for the benefit of the citizen: these are tasks that the Commission considers to be essential."
"The Commission is pleased that Mr Gutiérrez Díaz's report instances progress in cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the European Commission."
"The inclusion of the right to petition in the Treaty was, for the European Commission, an additional encouragement to reply as quickly and pertinently as possible to requests from the European Parliament relating to petitions."
"Mr President, a few words now, if I may, on monitoring the application of Community law and on the information given by the European Commission to the Committee on Petitions."
"I will start with the infringement procedures since this question was raised several times during the preceding debate and since the question is, of course, also raised in Mr Gutiérrez Díaz's report."
"In expressing its opinion on the annual reports of the Commission relating to the application of Community law, Parliament has recognized the progress made in this area as well, but it has expressed wishes, of which the Commission has taken careful note, particularly as regards speeding up the infringement procedures: I can tell you that the Commission will be very willing to agree to make additional efforts to shorten the time taken for the transmission of these communications to the Committee on Petitions."
"Among the criticisms habitually directed at the Commission are the length of the infringement procedures and, I would say, what is considered to be the over-cautious approach of the European Commission in this area."
"I should point out, however, that in this area the European Commission has a discretionary power as regards infringements and that it does its best to act consistently in the exercise of its discretionary powers."
"The Commission is also endeavouring to improve its procedures in order to make its actions consistent and effective."
"As for the length of these procedures, mentioned several times by Members of Parliament, I can only repeat on behalf of the Commission that, as guardian of the Treaties, it does everything it can to ensure respect for the application of Community law, solely in accordance with the criteria of objectivity and of law."
"The time taken by infringement procedures reflects both the complexity of the matters dealt with, the thoroughness of the examination the Commission is required to carry out of the arguments put forward by the Member States and the constant care to achieve, if possible, the correct application of Community legislation without necessarily going before the Court of Justice."
"Parliament receives detailed information on the actions of the Commission in this area through the Commission's annual report on the application of Community law. It also draws up a very interesting and very instructive report every year on the subject of Community law."
"As regards briefing of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to emphasize that the Commission has always given it complete and detailed information."
"In particular, it reports contacts made with national authorities."
"However, that does not mean that the Commission has the right to transmit confidential documents emanating from Member States, particularly in the context of preliminary legal procedures relating to the application of Community law."
"I can assure you that the Committee on Petitions will continue to receive from the European Commission all the information necessary for the effective treatment of citizens' petitions."
"Mr President, there is something missing from the conduct of this sitting and it is for that reason that I asked to speak."
"We have looked at an excellent report, and you have heard an excellent account from the rapporteur and from the chairman of the Committee on Petitions too."
"You have also heard an excellent account from the Commissioner."
"But the person we have not heard from is the one responsible for the great hold-ups in the work of the Committee on Petitions, namely the President of the Bureau of Parliament who is also responsible for the Secretariat-General."
"All the questions asked so far about improvements to the situation have either not been answered or have not been answered properly."
"I would have appreciated it if the Bureau of Parliament had replied at this sitting to all the substantive arguments put forward here concerning the organization of Parliament itself, organization of the secretariat, the registering of petitions."
"There is not much that is right about this House and there is no point meeting again next year, debating another excellent report and then concluding that once again nothing has changed."
"That is what I wanted to say, Mr President, and I hope you will pass it on to the Bureau."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow, at 9 a.m."
"Scientific and technical cooperation with Israel"
"The next item is the report (A4-0250/96) by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding the Agreement for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel (COM(96)0205 - C4-0311/96-96/0134(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has been asked for its opinion on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding an Agreement for scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy on Tuesday approved the Agreement by a large majority, and I expect - or at least I recommend - that Parliament will approve it tomorrow in plenary sitting."
"The Agreement raises the long-standing and successful cooperation between Israeli scientists and research establishments and those of the European Community to a new level."
"Israel can participate in programmes of the Fourth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, except in the fields of nuclear safety and nuclear fusion."
"Scientists and research establishments in the European Union are free to participate in Israeli research activities."
"Israel's financial contribution corresponds to the contributions of the Member States of the European Union in proportion to their respective gross domestic products."
"Hence, for the first time, a non-European country is participating extensively in the Community's framework programme for research in a relationship based on balance and reciprocality."
"The Agreement is in the interests of European research policy; I would like to stress that here."
"In the Community and worldwide, we are witnessing the increasing internationalization, indeed globalization, of the research process."
"This development is within the logic of the differentiation and increasing specialization of research itself and its growing financing needs."
"At the same time, however, we are unfortunately witnessing a decline in national efforts to promote scientific activity."
"For that reason, we must, today more than ever, seek synergy effects through improved international research cooperation."
"Israel has outstanding competence in a number of research areas."
"I expect new developments to be generated by increased cooperation in the fields such as information technology, for example data compression and image processing, and in medical research, for example immunology, epidemiology and cardiovascular diseases, to mention only a few."
"I also expect new impetus in the field of biotechnology, for example in neurobiology and biological water treatment, and in the development of technology for systems to harness renewable energies."
"The research cooperation Agreement follows the Mediterranean Agreement recently concluded with Israel, which regulated economic and cultural cooperation and placed regular political dialogue on an institutional footing."
"Through both Agreements, the European Union seeks to contribute to the development of the Mediterranean region and to stabilize the peace process in the Middle East."
"Our political message is: we seek to deepen relations and to promote continuity in political action by means of binding agreements and treaties."
"And that is also what we expect from our partners, indeed in every area."
"I should like to add a few comments addressed to the Commission."
"Firstly, in future negotiations, the Commission should adhere to the existing arrangements under the Luns-Westerterp procedure and keep us continuously informed on the status of the negotiations - that did not happen in this case."
"Secondly, Israel should be involved in the assessment of the Fourth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and in the discussion on the direction of the Fifth Framework Programme."
"Thirdly, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy wishes to have regular contacts with the members of the Knesset's Economic Affairs Committee, whose remit covers research policy."
"Fourthly, in order to promote peace and reconciliation in Israel, Israeli and Palestinian research establishments should be especially encouraged to respond jointly to invitations to tender."
"Fifthly, I hope to see a broad information campaign on the new possibilities for cooperation in our countries."
"The negotiation of measures to be covered by the Agreement took a long time; we now hope that it will be made operational in practice as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the excellent report by our colleague Mr Stockman on scientific and technical cooperation between the European Union and Israel explains clearly what this agreement is and why it is therefore necessary to vote for it without reservations and without uncertainties."
"This is a good agreement which has been reached through lengthy negotiations between the Union and Israel and which will be advantageous both for Israelis and for Europeans, since everybody will benefit from their separate and joint efforts."
"It is an important partnership agreement, cofinanced by Europe and Israel as part of the fourth research framework programme."
"This is also the first time that a non-European country will be able to take part in Community research."
"In return, Europe will have access to Israel's research and research programme."
"As chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I am happy with this and I approve of it."
"As a French socialist, I shall unhesitatingly vote for it."
"As a representative of the Party of European Socialists, I bring the support of my group."
"Should we, for all that, ignore the questions of some of our colleagues about the peace process after the recent Israeli elections?"
"Certainly not!"
"Their concern, and ours, is justified when we read the programme of the new Prime Minister, when we look at the composition of his government and when we hear some of the statements being made."
"Having said that, it is clearly not for Europe to judge the results of a democratic election in a democratic country."
"Nor does anything today entitle anybody to prejudge the results of discussions which are only beginning between the new government and its neighbours."
"Lastly, and most importantly, is not the best way of helping the peace process to increase the European presence in the Middle East, its partnership with the Israelis, with the Palestinians and with their Arab neighbours?"
"Our scientific cooperation agreement fits perfectly into this process."
"We must therefore implement it quickly, give it full scope, and form a partnership between the European Parliament and the Knesset through Parliament's Delegation for relations with Israel in order to monitor it."
"We must look for ways of encouraging the Palestinians to participate in these efforts and their results."
"Peace has undoubtedly been declared but, above all, peace is alive!"
"And for the survival of peace, all possible partnerships must be developed between us."
"Is not the agreement on the search for better living conditions today particularly symbolic?"
"I think it is, and above all I think we must do everything we can to support it: I repeat my congratulations to Mr Stockman and I urge all my colleagues to approve the agreement of 25 March tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by quoting Professor Markel, the newly elected President of the Max Planck Society, who wrote about the shifting borders of Europe in the following terms: how important it is that, precisely as representatives of science and research, we avoid as far as possible speaking of Europe in terms of clearly defined geographic areas; we need no further argument for this than to single out the example of Israel today which - whatever else it may be - is also European."
"In this context, I heartily welcome, on behalf of my group, the Agreement now to be concluded with Israel."
"Through it, we shall receive new impetus for our research and benefit from the outstanding competence of Israeli researchers."
"The Weizman Institute, an excellent academic institution which has maintained an office in Brussels for years, bears witness to the European direction of research in Israel."
"Israel is the first country that will not pick and choose its topics."
"With the exception of programmes on fusion and nuclear safety, it works in all the fields covered by the Fourth Framework Programme."
"Israel will be able to participate straight away in invitations to tender for specific programmes."
"There is one Israeli demand which the EU cannot accommodate - and my group supports this view."
"As a nonmember country, it cannot claim voting rights in the programme committees."
"Israel will be able to put forward experts for project assessment and selection and to present its concerns and preferred areas of research in a joint committee, the EC-Israel Research Committee."
"As we are now embarking on the preparatory work for the Fifth Framework Programme, Israel will be able from the outset, on a consultative basis, to exert its influence on the direction of programmes and to assist in shaping cooperation agreements for the future."
"In parallel with the cooperation process, the parliamentary level, especially the two committees concerned in the Knesset and in the European Parliament, should establish regular working contacts."
"Arrangements for the protection of intellectual property have been included in the Agreement."
"Whether they will always be satisfactory to both parties, experience in practice will show."
"As we are constantly refining our own legislation in this field - witness the hotly debated Directive on the patenting of genetically modified organisms - this point, i.e. protection of intellectual property, may need to be renegotiated for the next agreement."
"The Water Task Force which has been set up will certainly be of great interest to Israel."
"Proper water management in the Mediterranean region, especially in the Middle East, contributes to peace among the nations of the area."
"Israel's experience in this field, amongst other things with desalination plants, will help us effectively to solve one of the greatest problems of the next century, i.e. the efficient supply of water to the population, and hence contribute to the wellbeing and peace of peoples throughout the region."
"I should like to conclude these remarks on the Agreement with a word of thanks to the rapporteur for his good and agreeable cooperation and by quoting Professor Markel for a second time: there really is such a thing as a world scientific community, and it can span a cohesive network of intellectual and inter-personal relations which holds fast even where national differences, ideological divergence, hostilities between nations and competitive clashes over economic interests mercilessly separate most human beings."
"I hope this research Agreement will bring not only economic benefits, but also advances for the peace and wellbeing of peoples."
"Mr President, Commissioner, under the agreement we are examining, a non-European country - Israel - will for the first time be extensively associated with the Community framework programme for research and technological development."
"The agreement grants Israel privileged status, because it will be the only non-European country to have direct access to a highly strategic Union programme, without even being part of the European Economic Area."
"This agreement will therefore allow Israeli laboratories to participate on an equal footing with European laboratories in competitive bidding for European Union research funding."
"The excellence and competence of Israeli laboratories are known, as is the quality of technicians and researchers in Israel, a country that has already attracted investment and the establishment of high-technology installations by private multinational companies."
"In granting Israel such a, shall we say, exceptional position, the European Union has taken account of the advanced state of research in Israel but also, and particularly, of the political importance of this association in the context of the Middle East peace process."
"The peace process is obviously a cornerstone of all the Union's effort to collaborate in the development of countries bordering on the southern Mediterranean, an effort to which the Union, and this Parliament in particular, have given their full support."
"It seems to me that this agreement should therefore be seen by Israel and by its recently elected government as another important dividend of the peace process and as further encouragement from the European Union to pursue the path it has bravely taken towards developing good relations with neighbouring countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in science and technology is the key to greater innovation."
"Israel has highly sophisticated scientific research and is technologically very advanced so can be profitable to the European Union."
"Of course a reciprocal interest is needed if cooperation is to be successful."
"Clearly there is such an interest between Israel and the Union."
"Technology cooperation with Israel may provide a stimulus to industry and the small business sector and may open up new markets in the emerging information society and multimedia."
"This may create more jobs."
"So the Liberal Group welcomes this cooperation."
"But I have a number of questions to the Commissioner."
"Firstly concerning the financial memorandum."
"The largest single cost item is business travel by officials and European experts."
"This makes quite a hole in the budget for the specific programmes which make up the fourth, and shortly the fifth, framework programme."
"Parliament regularly points to the high costs of administering the programmes."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner why it is that these officials and experts have to fly business class, when even Dutch government officials and scientists regularly fly economy class."
"I myself flew economy class to the United States two weeks ago and I can tell you that it is just as quick and just as safe as business class."
"My second question: has account been taken in the budget of the cost of translating all the forms, brochures and project presentations into Hebrew?"
"This is not a European language and will be expensive."
"And lastly I should like to challenge the procedure followed."
"The cooperation agreement was concluded by the Commission and representatives of Israel."
"During those negotiations Parliament was neither consulted nor informed even though this cooperation significantly affects the fourth framework programme."
"Decisions concerning the fourth framework programme are taken jointly with Parliament using the co-decision procedure."
"Why was Parliament not involved and not even informed, despite the existence of agreements in accordance with the procedure devised by my distinguished compatriots Mr Luns and Mr Westerterp?"
"Mr President, the issue of an agreement between the EU and Israel on research is not an entirely simple one."
"Nevertheless, the important parts which are very positive have been singled out."
"It is also good that EU research should not be geared solely to EU Member States and that the EU should open its eyes to the fact that a world exists outside the Union - this is tremendously important."
"It is also good that the conclusions mention how important it is that this should be seen as support for the peace process."
"On the other hand, I am concerned about some of the content of the agreement."
"Even though the programme on fusion and nuclear safety is excluded from the agreement one must be aware that Israel undoubtedly has nuclear arms, despite its denials."
"It is therefore important to ensure that no resources go to nuclear research 'on the quiet' ."
"In this connection I would also like to mention that it will soon be ten years since the researcher Mordechai Vanunu was imprisoned after having spoken out about Israel's nuclear research programme."
"It would now be appropriate for Israel to release Vanunu as soon as possible."
"We have our doubts about a number of the research sections of the fourth framework programme."
"These include biotechnology and research into space travel."
"This research appears harmless but may quite well be developed and used in areas which are far from being in our interests."
"We no more want such research to be carried out as a result of agreements with countries outside the EU than we want it to be carried out within the EU."
"We do not intend to vote against the agreement but to abstain."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of EU research cooperation."
"I believe that those who favour a fortress Europe policy, limiting cooperation to within the Union, are making a mistake."
"We need to use the best researchers wherever they are in the world, let alone in Israel."
"Therefore I am very much in favour of the well-prepared report by my colleague, Mr Stockmann, where the Israeli Government is putting ECU 100 million, a third of its total research budget, into the programme."
"It is actually paying to join in this programme."
"However, in respect of this report I have two concerns."
"One, which Mr Stockmann has raised, is the failure of the Commission to adequately consult and follow the Luns Westerterp procedure."
"I raised this issue in committee yesterday and was told that I would get a reply from the Commission in writing."
"I presume the Commission has not been struck dumb and that I might actually manage to get one this afternoon."
"Secondly, flowing from this lack of clarity in terms of consultation, there are problems in a couple of areas."
"Firstly, in view of the secretive nature of the Israeli nuclear weapons programme as revealed 10 years ago by Mordechai Vanunu, I have reservations on Israeli participation in the nuclear sectors of research."
"The report says that nuclear safety and fusion power are excluded."
"But that does not cover all the areas of nuclear research, as I understand it, that are done in the European Commission."
"I am very much in favour of the peace process."
"It is going through a rocky period at the moment."
"I am happy, of course, that we have research in other than non-nuclear areas in Israel proper, but it would, in my opinion, be inappropriate for EU money to be allocated to research centres in the occupied West Bank or as part of an Israeli research programme without agreement from the Palestinians."
"It would be as inappropriate as for EU money to be given to Turkey, which would be spent in Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"These points that I have raised give me pause for thought."
"I hope I can be reassured on these issues by the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement represents a great opportunity both for Israel and for the European Union."
"I would single out two areas in particular: Israel has a world lead in the field of computer security and anti-virus technology."
"Israel also points the way in the production of educational software."
"Several multinational software houses maintain research and development establishments in Israel."
"As a member of both the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I have a strong interest in the link between research and education, training and continuing education."
"The particularly favourable position of Israel as regards educational software, which I have referred to, represents an ideal field of cooperation for the European Union."
"This sector, which is so important to training and continuing education in the future, more than any other offers a suitable field for combining the aspects of research and education in a very concrete way."
"The Task Force on Multimedia and Educational Software, set up by the European Commission, has already taken on a supporting role in relation to possible projects in this field."
"Representatives of both the Government and companies in Israel are already taking part in meetings of the Telematics Committee of the European Commission."
"Israel is also participating in the preparations for joint projects."
"The Task Force is further planning to initiate joint workshops during the current year."
"The second field is biotechnology."
"In this field too, which is of outstanding importance to Europe, Israel has made great advances."
"Europe can only benefit from cooperating in this area with Israel, which is particularly active in fields such as seed production and environmental biology."
"I particularly welcome the intention of the rapporteur to bring about regular contacts between the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy of the European Parliament and the Economic Affairs Committee of the Knesset, whose area of concern covers research."
"This would provide the means for efficient monitoring of the cooperation and for the evaluation of results with the aid of the European Parliament's Science and Technology Option Assessment (STOA)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first thank you, and particularly Mr Stockman, for Parliament's hard work on the subject and for backing the Commission proposal."
"For the European Union the conclusion of such a scientific and technical cooperation agreement is an important step on the road to increased cooperation with Israel."
"In this connection, I should first like to emphasize three particularly important points."
"Firstly, this agreement is of benefit to both parties."
"As your rapporteur has explained, it will enable European researchers and engineers to strengthen their capabilities and to develop synergies with first-class teams in many areas."
"Alongside the opening of the fourth outline research and development programme, it offers the Israelis access to a volume, a potential and results of extremely important research."
"Secondly, this agreement represents, as Mr Stockman very rightly also stressed, the first association of a nonEuropean country with research activities in the Union."
"As such, it marks all the importance the Union attaches to strengthening its reciprocal ties with Israel, particularly in the field of science and technology."
"And to reassure some speakers, I shall add that this agreement relates to non-nuclear research, Mr Holm, and to non-nuclear research only."
"The agreement will have considerable industrial and economic spin-offs."
"Thirdly, this agreement falls within the framework of the European Union's new policy towards Mediterranean countries."
"Allow me to reply to a number of very intelligent questions raised quite rightly by several speakers."
"Firstly, as regards the information to be provided about the progress of the negotiations, I am told that the services of the Commission had already been able to brief the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy about the progress of the negotiations with Israel."
"Nevertheless, I can make the commitment to you that the Commission will not fail in future to keep Parliament as well informed as possible about the conclusions of future negotiations."
"Secondly, concerning the encouragement of Israeli and Palestinian researchers to cooperate in order to participate in invitations to tender, I can say that the Palestinians and the Israelis can already participate jointly in the international programme for scientific and technological cooperation."
"This is activity 2 in the fourth Community outline programme and four large areas are therefore open to such cooperation: renewable natural resources, agriculture and the agri-industry, medicine and health, and advanced technologies such as information technology, biotechnology, materials and energy."
"The third question concerned the participation of Israel in an evaluation of the fourth outline programme, which will be carried out by independent experts."
"As provided for in the agreement, the Commission will be able to call on Israeli experts as on experts from Member States of the European Union."
"The scientific and technological cooperation agreement with Israel will have been in force for only a short time when the preparation for the fifth outline programme begins."
"It is therefore likely that, at that time, we shall still only have a few results from the cooperation."
"Nevertheless, the available results will certainly be taken into consideration, together with those from other cooperation frameworks, for example, activity 2 of the fourth outline research programme."
"The fourth question was about relations between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Knesset."
"It is not within the province of the Commission's representative to express an opinion on this point."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can assure you with regard to travelling and management expenses, that the rules to be applied are those normally applicable to Commission officials in all their activities and that there will be no departures from this nor any special treatment."
"I can also reassure you by saying that the costs of translation into Hebrew will be an Israeli responsibility."
"Concerning the sixth question, the problem of the Occupied Territories: the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and the Golan Heights are not considered to be part of the territory of Israel."
"This is the official position of the European Commission and the European Union."
"It is also that of the Israeli government."
"As a result, the scientific and technological cooperation agreement does not apply to these territories."
"I think I have replied to all the question raised."
"May I say, in conclusion, that, beyond science and technology, the strengthening of cooperation between the Union, Israel and the other non-member Mediterranean countries helps to improve good neighbourly relations between those states."
"Such an agreement therefore represents a further step on the path to peace in that part of the world."
"Like your rapporteur, I also want to see scientific and technical relationships being developed between the Mediterranean countries themselves."
"Only cooperation like this will enable peace efforts to be given lasting and concrete expression."
"Mr President, I asked a series of questions of the Commissioner. He went some way towards reassuring me."
"I was not entirely happy with all of his answers, but can I congratulate him at least for doing something that is unusual for some Commissioners - actually trying to deal with the questions rather than read out a prepared speech."
"Thank you very much, Mr Ford."
"That was not really a point of order but I think that at this time of day - and as we are virtually en famille - we can interpret the Rules loosely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, exactly the same thing has happened to me today as happened yesterday when it came to the minutes."
"For the second time in succession I have not had a chance to speak."
"I wanted to say something about yesterday's minutes. Yesterday, Mr Blak said that we should put an end to the circus."
"Even yesterday I wanted to object to the word ""circus' ."
"The item ""Approval of the Minutes' was on the agenda, and we had come to that item in the plenary session."
"This is a parliamentary right, not a circus!"
"I wanted to reject this formally, and I would therefore ask that this should be done in future, whenever the approval of the minutes is on the agenda."
"Mr President, on a point of order, before we discuss nominations for the Temporary Committee of Inquiry."
"At the Florence Summit an agreement was reached between the Commission and the United Kingdom Government on trying to break the impasse created by the United Kingdom Government and its decision of non-cooperation."
"As part of that agreement the United Kingdom Government agreed to implement measures to deal with the BSE crisis in the United Kingdom on 1 August."
"It now appears that this will not be the case and the earliest possible time it estimates it will be able to do so is October of this year."
"If this is the case, does that therefore mean that the whole agreement reached at Florence has been breached and, therefore, no longer applies?"
"If so, does that mean that the Commission will not provide the additional funding to deal with the problem throughout the European Union?"
"And if that is the case, should your office not write to the Commission and the United Kingdom Government for clarification on the point to help the industry and the farmers who are likely to be affected by the persistent inability of the British Government to deal with this matter?"
"Mr Thomas, you are not raising a point of order but have made a political statement."
"Votes"
"Mr President, I do not want to talk about the content, but about BSE."
"The current debate is about the fact that gelatine is not safe."
"And we should like you to tell us..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, there must be a mistake in the information you have been given."
"I am against the wording of this amendment and I have personally told Mr Santini."
"I understand the value he gives to the amendment but, in the explanatory statement - at the bottom of page 9 - the limits are well explained and I think it would be excessive to introduce it into the text, by a procedure that we think is too farreaching, without its being discussed beforehand in the committee."
"Mr President, after an exchange of views with the rapporteur, I should like to withdraw this amendment, which was perhaps badly worded and has become even less clear in translation."
"Since, on the other hand, the report is extremely coherent and straightforward, I withdraw the amendment to avoid confusion."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I have given my agreement to Mr Cars' excellent report, although I have serious problems with the Council regulation, because I am bound to say that reconstruction in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is absurd, since nothing has been destroyed there, and large groups of refugees have come only out of Kosovo."
"Therefore I believe that there is absolutely no point in giving aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, unless it is made conditional upon the autonomy of Kosovo."
"This must not merely be attached to the aid in the form of a vague hope: it must be a condition of that aid."
"That concludes voting time. ."
"Support system for producers of certain arable crops"
"The next item is the report (A4-0236/96) by Mr Gillis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation derogating from Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops as regards the set-aside requirement for the 1997/98 marketing year (COM(96)0285 - C4-0351/96-96/0162(CNS))."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I propose that Parliament gives its approval to reduce the amount of land that must be set-aside in the cereals sector to 5 % from the current level of 10 %."
"Members will be aware that production of cereals in Europe - indeed throughout the main cereal-producing areas of the world - has fallen in recent years, mainly due to adverse weather: severe drought in the southern hemisphere, for example."
"In these circumstances maintaining a 10 % set-aside requirement would be wrong."
"Prices for cereals are at historically high levels on the world market and this is causing some hardship in poorer countries dependent on imports."
"It is worth looking at the possibility of eliminating the set-aside requirement altogether for future years."
"But, at the moment, the most prudent course of action is to set the level of set-aside for the next marketing year at 5 %."
"I wish to thank the Commission for coming forward with its proposal this year in good time."
"In a similar report last year we had requested an early proposal from the Commission and I welcome the fact that Commissioner Fischler was able to respond to our wishes in this regard."
"I turn briefly to a specific problem we have in Ireland with the administration of the set-aside regulation."
"The application of Article 9 of the set-aside Regulation 1765/92 in our country has resulted in an unforeseen and damaging reduction in the cereal area."
"From a very small national base area we have lost production on 50, 000 hectares - 125, 000 acres, to speak in Irish terms - in other words, a 19 % reduction."
"The reason for this is quite simple: 50 % of cereals in Ireland are grown on rented land and many owners of rented land withdraw the land from the rental market and use it for other purposes."
"For example, rotation to grassland, to forestry, to animal production and, indeed, for other forms of development, making it impossible for traditional cereal growers to find alternative eligible land."
"Hence the amendment I have tabled in the report."
"I want to point out at this stage that this amendment was defeated in the Agriculture Committee."
"The reason I am discussing this now is that I feel it was as a result of a misunderstanding and I just wanted to be sure that that misunderstanding was cleared up before we vote on this report."
"I want to make it quite clear - and it is important that the House should realize this - that I am not seeking to increase the cereal area above the agreed national and regional base areas already decided in Regulation 1765/92, I merely want to ensure that those farmers growing cereals on rented land be allowed to continue in business within that agreed base area."
"I am sure you will agree that, because of the very necessary employment involved and considering the dire shortage in the European Union and, indeed, in the world at large of stocks of grain, this proposed set-aside reduction to 5 % is very desirable."
"This also is a very desirable amendment to that proposal."
"I would ask the House to accept this proposal and, indeed, to accept that amendment as well."
"Mr President, may I take the Gillis report on set-aside as an opportunity, to point something out to you, ladies and gentlemen, to the Commission, and above all to the Council. In 1993, the Council and the Commission increased the base area in the new Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany, in the long term by 180, 000 hectares and temporarily by 150, 000 hectares."
"This had been preceded by a spectacular abortive development in the processing industry, and enormous areas of arable, fodder and potato land became grandes cultures ."
"In spite of this 1993 decision, by the time the 1994 harvest came round, even the increased base area had already been clearly exceeded again."
"In 1996 it is likely to be exceeded again."
"This process will worsen if, as planned, from 1997 onwards this temporary 150, 000 ha of base area has to be given back in four stages."
"Since today there are already about 160, 000 ha missing in the territory of the new Länder, this missing base area would be increased to over 300, 000 ha, and that would be approximately equivalent to an 8 % risk of sanctions."
"That is intolerable."
"This kind of excess cannot be observed in any other Member State of the European Union, but then no other Member State was experiencing such a fundamental restructuring process at the time when the base areas were defined."
"For that reason it was only possible to make forecasts about developments in agriculture in the new Länder."
"Now it has been shown that some of these forecasts do not correspond to what has actually happened."
"In view of this situation, any dismantling of the base area temporarily allocated cannot be justified at the present time, especially when this would lead to considerable displeasure and lack of understanding among the farmers affected by it."
"Therefore, against the background of the debate about a further lowering of the set-aside rate to 5 % from now on, I should once again like to draw attention to the amendment that I proposed at the time of the Gillis report, at the November 1995 part-session, in which I asked for the suspension of the dismantling of the base-area allocated to the new Länder at a level of 150, 000 ha, for a specific period of two years."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gillis, who has done everything in his power to write this report in a few days."
"That has enabled the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to respond favourably to the Council's request for urgency."
"However, Commissioner, we know that we always have a number of deadlines: for the budget, the price package, the set-aside rate, etc."
"We needed at least two months to do this work with the required care, even at maximum speed."
"We should therefore thank our colleague, Mr Gillis, who has managed to produce the report in the shortest possible time."
"May I also thank you in advance, Commissioner, since I know that you will convey our request to your services."
"As regards the actual subject, the Commission proposes fixing the compulsory set-aside rate at 5 %."
"This is of course the minimum rate for farmers, who can always voluntarily set aside up to 30 %."
"So, Commissioner, I urge you to reduce this rate to 0 %."
"Farmers wishing to set aside 30 % can always do so voluntarily."
"Why this proposal?"
"Firstly, the situation as regards European grain stocks and the world market: the particularly adverse weather conditions for two years in southern regions have reduced European production; the economic difficulties in Russia and the very substantial increase in Chinese consumption have put pressure on the world market and therefore on world prices; in Europe, you have been forced to introduce export taxes from December 1995; the dramatic fall in beef consumption as a result of the BSE problem has increased demand for poultry meat and pigmeat, whose production consumes large quantities of cereals; and, lastly, the compulsory set-aside rate of 0 % would also result in a small reduction in Community expenditure and would thus make possible a small increase in the compensation to beef producers."
"Commissioner, the zero rate should not be rejected for administrative reasons when our budget has to be slanted towards stockbreeders without penalizing European producers of arable crops and consequently the whole of farm and food production."
"To my colleagues who are concerned about biomass fuels, I would like to say that there will be enough voluntary set-aside to cover all our current requirements!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not agree with this report and with the direction proposed by the Commission."
"Cereal stocks in the EU have been reduced."
"That was the aim of the Commission's policy, or at least that is what it said at the time."
"Now we have reduced the cereal stocks."
"Prices on the world market have recovered, because the EU, amongst others, is not acting so aggressively in the market, and also because there is greater demand."
"Now the area of cereal-growing land in the EU is to be expanded."
"Production will increase by 8.5 million tonnes."
"That means that the surplus situation will once again worsen."
"As the Commission says, 38 million tonnes are to be taken into storage and will be available for export, but not at the prices that can be obtained on the world market, but at prices more redolent of the old familiar dumping system."
"It is also clear that this reduction from 10 % to 5 % - as calculated by the Committee on Budgets - will cost 17 million in the first year, 50 million in 1996/97 and a further 30 million in 1997/98. In other words, tax-payers' money will be used to bring cereals onto the world market, cereals which are not necessary and which do not need to be grown."
"If, in spite of all this, we agree to the report anyway, it is because we have succeeded in inserting an amendment to the effect that pulses, i.e. fodder, can be grown on set-aside land, and that this fodder can also be used by farmers to feed their own livestock."
"The bigger groups have made it clear that they will approve the report."
"That makes it possible for us to approve this resolution and this report because, within the framework of the 30 % voluntary set-aside rate, fodder can still be grown."
"We now hope that the Commission will take this on board, and that in future we shall be able to grow fodder on this land."
"After all, fodder is in short supply in the EU, and it should be grown in a way that makes crop rotation more ecologically acceptable, by increasing the soil's nitrogen content by growing pulses and clover/grass leys, thereby reducing the use of chemical fertilizers."
"In this case, we shall approve the resolution with a somewhat guilty conscience, and afterwards we shall ask the Commission, before the vote, whether it is prepared to accept our resolution."
"I hope that it will do so!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the set-aside principle established by Regulation in 1992, was designed as a flexible instrument for regulating the markets."
"Entirely logically, it recommends a possible revision of the set-aside rate in line with trends in market production and grain stocks."
"The Commission proposal submitted to us today, with a set-aside rate of 5 %, comes into the picture because of very low stocks and world prices which are still holding up."
"Although the proposal is along the right lines, it does not go far enough."
"This system, even if it is effective in limiting over-production, is still absurd in the eyes of most consumers and farmers and we, the elected Members representing them, should take account of the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens."
"In concrete terms, set-aside is creating untilled land all over the European Union and the socio-psychological impact of this is becoming a total disaster for farmers, who wish neither to be paid for doing nothing nor to contemplate their land lying fallow."
"From this point of view, the CAP is looked upon as wrong-headed and is criticised unfairly in the light of the advances it has made possible."
"The fact that the volume of production has been so successfully controlled does not mean that it can no longer run into problems and therefore be modified."
"Furthermore, this system acts as a brake on policies for protecting the rural environment and on policies for improving the quality of produce since, globally, with set-aside, environmental pollution increases proportionally to increases in the output from the fields still under cultivation."
"In addition, the system is still adding to the difficulties of small farmers and is thus contributing to the drift from the land, particularly in southern Europe."
"All this is not really directed towards reform of the CAP for, although it recommends an increase in the competitiveness of European agriculture at world level and the adjustment of the potential production to market demands, it does not really ensure protection of the environment and the development of underprivileged rural areas."
"We must therefore resolutely direct our efforts towards plans for the lasting development of farms centred around the maintenance of the agricultural workforce, a vital element of the rural world and of regional development."
"This means farmers' families living on profitable farms in a well populated and active rural environment."
"It means a very limited and more flexible set-aside of cultivated land in order to adapt to market conditions, to restore the balance between export capacity and farmers' incomes, and not to interfere with the emergence of new agricultural products which are not being over-produced."
"It means a policy of quotas based mainly on limiting yields per hectare to improve the quality of the produce and on limiting the total available aid per agricultural worker so that concentration of agricultural land and intensive production are no longer encouraged."
"It means sensible environmental measures, encouraged by new and sufficiently incentivising Community aid which, in practice, have the effect of protecting the rural landscape, the soils and the farmed land."
"It means, lastly, human thought for the relationship between the farmer, his work and his environment."
"You will understand, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that it is in order to show our disapproval of the present set-aside system that, on behalf of my Group of the European Radical Alliance, I have tabled an amendment to 0 %, which would abolish the compulsory set-aside of 5 % of arable land and replace it by a flexible system for producing biomass for fuel and crops intended solely for animal feed, related more closely to environmental constraints."
"This new system, replacing the unproductive system of set-aside, would give European agriculture the durable quality it still lacks, namely: the ability to produce at a lower cost so as to increase long-term productive capacity."
"We can therefore no longer support such a conservative system, that is blocking all progress towards a really durable agriculture."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like at this point to thank Mr Gillis, our rapporteur, for the speed with which he has written his report so that we can accept the urgency required by the Council, and can do so after having adopted his report in committee."
"Like many of my colleagues, Commissioner, I should like you to ask your services to take due account of the time required by Parliament to do its work under the best conditions."
"I venture to indicate this to you, because the proposal for a regulation that we are now examining is an annual event since it aims to adapt the set-aside rate to the level of our grain stocks and to the trends in consumption."
"Our group has tabled an amendment proposing a zero compulsory set-aside rate for land."
"Before explaining the reasons for this amendment, may I say that this zero rate does not call into question the principle of a voluntary set-aside that may go up to 30 %."
"The justification for our amendment is simple."
"First, world stocks of cereals are very low with only 42 days of world consumption remaining and, in Europe, with Mediterranean countries having experienced two years of exceptional drought, production is very low."
"You have even been forced, Commissioner, to introduce an export tax on European cereals as from the end of last year."
"This reveals the limitations of the very principle of set-aside for, at the same time as we are forcing all farmers to set aside part of their productive land, we are destabilizing the basic principle of secure world supplies of food."
"We can understand a principle of voluntary set-aside in order to compensate for agronomic differentials of arable land in Europe, but the principle of compulsory set-aside should be abandoned."
"All economists, including American ones, anticipate a very significant increase in Chinese cereal imports while, looking more at the state of their economies, the difficulties of Russia and Ukraine mean that these countries are far from being able to achieve their potential levels of production."
"My last point concerns consumption trends: with the fall in beef consumption as a result of the BSE problem consumption is being transferred to pigmeat and poultry meat."
"These two types of produce, may I remind you, consume great quantities of cereals."
"Finally, Mr President, may I finish by saying to you that the European Union should have a policy which respects the rural fabric, a balancing element indispensable to our European society, and which at the same times preserves the predominant position of European agriculture in the world."
"Mr President, in politics, we have to learn to wait... for years, we have been asking here for a zero rate and everybody thought we had eaten too much British-made animal feed!"
"The outcome has shown that we were right."
"We are therefore happy to have nearly two million hectares extra and to have nearly eight million tonnes of additional production, hoping that it is not too late: will the market share lost to the Middle East or North Africa be recovered?"
"What is important now is to learn lessons from this so that we do not make the same mistakes again."
"First lesson: the stubbornness of the Commission."
"It does not want to take into account the explosion in world prices, the speculation on the Chicago stock exchange, or the pension funds playing around with cereals."
"It does not want to know about the collapse of stocks."
"It does not want to take into account climatic factors. After all, everybody knows that there was an El Niño effect in the Pacific which caused both droughts and torrential rain and which, over North America and even over South America, brought about large variations in production."
"Second lesson: the statistical error of the Commission."
"It was mistaken about structural factors (Mr des Places spoke about these): the Chinese population figures, the rise in the Chinese standard of living, the climatic factor that I have already mentioned, the political factor in the collapse of the USSR, all of which mean that cereal consumption can only increase in the long term."
"And anybody who has made mistakes will make more!"
"Have you not made the same mistakes over wine production?"
"This time there is no possibility of correcting them, because when vines are uprooted they are uprooted!"
"The third and last lesson is the philosophical one of your reactions: when confronting a problem, your reaction is still the restricted outlook, Malthusianism, quotas, reduction in working hours and with Mr Rocard, set-aside."
"Basically, as the market expands at world level, you contract mentally."
"Your anthropology has a little of LeviStrauss in it: for him, it was the raw and the cooked, for you it is the open and shut!"
"Mr President, first of all let me say that we very much welcome the fact that this report has come forward at this time of the year - in previous years we have been scrabbling around on Friday mornings in October or November to try and set a set-aside rate."
"That is to be welcomed and it will enable our farmers to plan."
"I would like to thank Mr Gillis for his report."
"He always makes it seem amazingly simple."
"We appreciate that very much and thank him for his work."
"Set-aside is not a popular tool of agricultural policy."
"One of the problems with it is that it is actually visible."
"But where you have a system of quotas and where you have a system of subsidies, you need to be able to put a brake on production."
"So we have a brake on production called set-aside."
"Personally I would prefer to see a nought percent set-aside."
"I will take the advice of the Commission on this occasion, but I hope that we get it right."
"I certainly would be very concerned if, later next year, we had a very serious grain shortage."
"I would like to speak on one point in Mr Gillis' report: his amendment concerning the Irish situation."
"We have discussed this quite thoroughly in the Socialist Group and our understanding is that the Irish Government and any other Member State government already has the power under existing legislation to make the changes that Mr Gillis wants."
"Perhaps the Commission would be able to enlighten us at the end of this debate because it would help guide the way in which we would vote."
"Can I make one point about the Greens' amendment?"
"We think this is a good amendment because it gets right to the point."
"A friend of mine who is a psychiatrist made the remark that it must be very frustrating for farmers who are denied now, particularly if they are in the pig and poultry area, the opportunity to grow their own food, additional food which they desperately need now that they are unable to have access to bone-meal which has traditionally been part of poultry and pig diets for many years."
"In my view, this amendment from the Greens goes some way to meeting that."
"I would ask that we vote for this now."
"I hope that we make progress and I look forward, like everybody else in this Parliament, to the day when set-aside will be a thing of the past."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament and the Council have decided on a uniform set-aside rate of 10 % for the 1995/96 crop year."
"This rate also applies from now on to long-term fallow."
"Now there is some discussion about cutting this rate to 5 %, because world cereal stocks have gone down and the prices of maize and wheat have risen, and I think that we need cereals."
"At the same time, I welcome the fact that the proposal has been made earlier than on previous occasions, because farmers need this information in order to draw up their crop plans, which they have to do very soon."
"For this reason, it is particularly important to have the information in July, so than they can plan in good time."
"Set-aside has proved its worth as a means of doing away with market surpluses and restoring market equilibrium."
"I too am not in favour of high set-aside rates, but I am in favour - and I am addressing our French colleagues here - of our using this land to grow renewable raw materials."
"In Germany we now grow almost 5 % of renewable raw materials."
"Nature offers us a wide range of substances that can be used for many different purposes: carbohydrates, oils, fats, proteins, fibres, dyestuffs, and certain ingredients needed by industry."
"I also foresee good opportunities for biodegradable and recyclable materials for packaging and for internal parts of vehicles, and in agriculture for the combustion of solid biomass for heating and power generation."
"But we should also not forget the use of set-aside land to grow clover/grass leys, with the proviso that the farmer would be obliged to use these to feed his own livestock."
"Finally, the positive environmental aspects of renewable raw materials, such as carbon-dioxide neutrality and biodegradability, should be counted as advantages."
"I am therefore not in favour of set-aside in itself, but I am in favour of farmers producing raw materials that industry will be able to use in future, because we shall very soon have enough cereals again, and I can tell you that with absolute certainty!"
"Mr President, like my colleague, Mr Hallam, I should to thank Mr Gillis for his report and welcome the fact that we are making this decision on the level of set-aside for certain crops well in advance."
"One of the great complaints from our farmers has been that in the past they have not been given sufficient time to make sensible decisions."
"I also welcome the amendment to allow increased production of crops for animal feed so that we can get away from the unnatural practice of feeding ruminant animals on animal remains."
"I think it is right to reduce set-aside from 10 % to 5 % in certain areas, and hope this will be extended soon to other producers of crops which are subject to growing world shortages."
"This should include financial encouragement to use both land already in use and the additional land in an environmentally friendly way with reduced inputs and encouragement for woodlands where appropriate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gillis, for his report and the speed and efficiency with which he completed his work."
"I would also like to thank the European Parliament for giving priority to this Commission proposal."
"Since Parliament is expressing its opinion, the Council will be in a position to publish the regulations."
"Thanks to this, farmers will be better able to plan their work, since they will be fully aware of their obligations, so far as temporary set-aside of land for the year 1997-1998 is concerned."
"It is still too early to estimate the harvest of cereals for 1996, either at Community or at world-wide level."
"At any rate, the Commission considers that the state of the market, which is characterised by an unprecedented low level of stocks, enables it to submit from now its proposal for an appreciable reduction of the compulsory quota, in parallel avoiding the risk of accumulating stocks to the level they had reached before the reform."
"The Commission considers that if the quota is set at 5 % for the 1997 harvest, this will achieve a balance between on the one hand the forecast level of production, and on the other hand the possibilities for disposing of cereals."
"Besides, the Commission considers that in parallel this will make it possible to build up stocks again to an acceptable level."
"If we went any further, or if we set the quota at zero, the risk of building up stocks too far would become excessive, and in this I refer to Amendments Nos 2 and 5."
"In addition, to set the proportion of temporary setaside provisionally at zero would have severe consequences for the long-term viability of the existing situation relating to agricultural products not intended as food products and related directly to compulsory temporary setaside."
"That situation could not be put right by any system of special support, because it would conflict with our international obligations."
"As for Amendment No 1, which aims to suspend the implementation of exceptional temporary set-aside, the Commission can accept the idea of refraining temporarily from that kind of temporary set-aside as a means to control production."
"As for the request to make the application of Article 9 of Regulation 1765/92 optional in relation to the selection of land, the Commission regrets that it cannot agree."
"Indeed, if we were to accept Amendment No 3, we would call into question one of the basic aspects of the 1992 reform."
"As for Amendment No 4, which envisages permitting the production of protein-containing products for selfconsumption in areas subject to temporary set-aside, the Commission again cannot agree. And this, because it would call into question the very purpose of temporary set-aside for arable land, an aim based mainly on the adaptation of supply and demand for arable crops."
"Mr President, before the vote on the legislative resolution I should like to ask the Commission once again whether it is prepared to accept Amendment No 4, after this House, by a large majority and with the agreement of almost every group, has accepted Amendment No 4."
"For me, the grounds that you have just read out - but perhaps I am asking too much of you, because it is not your field - are not valid, because fodder is being grown on this land anyway, particularly since we are talking about the cultivation of renewable raw materials where the subsequent products can be used as animal feed."
"Therefore the Commission's arguments do not hold water."
"And therefore I should like to ask you once again, before we vote, whether you will now accept this amendment."
"It seems to me, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that the Commissioner has already expressed his opinion; however, I invite him to speak again."
"Mr President, what I can assure the honourable Member is that in future, the Commission will give careful consideration to the issue he mentioned and which Parliament has just adopted."
"However, what we cannot do at this time is to adopt that amendment."
"And this, because as I said earlier, it would call into doubt the very purpose of temporary set-aside for arable land, an aim based mainly on the adaptation of supply and demand for arable crops."
"For that reason, the Commission cannot accept this amendment now."
"However, we take note of Parliament's wish and I can of course promise that my colleague Mr Fischler and the appropriate services of the Commission will examine the matter presently, with all the goodwill for which the Commission is noted in its cooperation with Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my pleasure in knowing that at least we have now approved Amendment No 4 in Parliament, to the effect that the ecologically acceptable cultivation of fodder, which is essentially what is intended, is now possible on set-aside land."
"I should like to explain, however, why our group did not refer the amendment back to committee after the Commission did not accept it."
"We are of the opinion that Parliament has always tried to give farmers information about the set-aside rate in good time for sowing."
"This time it has succeeded."
"Therefore we do not want to cause a delay now, although we are of the opinion that it is necessary for this amendment, introduced by us, to be adopted."
"I now have confidence in the Commissioner's word, that he will ask his colleagues to examine it."
"When the next round of amendments is due, which will be soon, we shall propose our amendment again, and then, if you say that you will not accept it, it will be time for the gloves to come off."
"We are confident that the Commission will accept this amendment."
"Therefore we have let it go this time, quite apart from the fact that it is also doubtful whether we would have obtained a majority for our amendment."
"Unit of account and conversion rates"
"The next item is the report (A4-0192/96) by Mr Jacob, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (COM(96)0040 - C4-0155/96-96/0037(CNS))."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief since there are, I believe, only two amendments to this report."
"I should simply like to recall, as a preamble, that since the GATT agreements, as all Members are aware, Community preference has been widely flouted and has fallen very much behind through the abolition of variable duties, converted into fixed duties."
"The only two elements of Community preference that really remain are the policy of standardization, with its well-known imperfections (particularly the UN standards which are increasingly in evidence rather than Community standards), and the monetary lever."
"We are keen on this monetary lever and I am personally keen on keeping the agricultural conversion rate."
"We have in fact two conversion rates, which involve administrative difficulties for the Commission. I understand this very well since it is true that for certain products one conversion rate will be used rather than another, depending on the way they are classified."
"The agricultural conversion rate, being greater by 5 %, provides better protection for the market and the Commission's proposal, which I largely support, is to use a single rate."
"In simple terms, what I should like personally is for the agricultural conversion rate to be used rather than the other one, because it protects the market better."
"I confess to being surprised that the Commission has chosen to use the normal customs rate as the single rate since it provides less protection for our market, when we know very well that currency fluctuations produce very great instability in the market."
"Look at what is happening in the USA with the dollar."
"Between one dollar to 5 francs and one dollar to 10 francs, we can clearly see how far the penetration of our market by our competitors can go."
"Thus, the first of the two tabled amendments has the unanimous support of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the executive Commission since it aims to use a single rate."
"The second amendment, for which there was no majority in the Committee on Agriculture, aims to use the agricultural conversion rate as the single conversion rate rather than the customs rate."
"Mr President, what we are discussing here is one of the subjects I believe our citizens use as a yardstick to measure our ability to adapt and apply purely economic rules to the practicalities of everyday life."
"I would, therefore, like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Jacob, on the skill with which he has managed the intricacies of this debate; but, since he is not listening to me, I shall congratulate him personally, in private."
"So far, we have been told that, in accordance with a temporary rule that was in force until 30 June of this year, two rates have applied: a monthly customs rate, on the basis of which annual rates have been applied, and the annual rates themselves, which certainly do not reflect the constant exchange-rate fluctuations."
"Now, instead, we are going to apply agricultural rates to a whole range of imports that can, by and large, be linked to the instruments based on Article 43 of the Treaty, that is, to the common agricultural policy."
"Since they do not work well together, these two conversion rates have given rise to much uncertainty as regards their application, which has led the Commission to draft a proposal to amend the basic agri-monetary regulation to eliminate the disadvantages of this dual conversion system, and so give taxpayers something they can understand, and to do away with both economic inconsistencies and complicated legislative procedures."
"The proposed new system provides for application of the monthly customs rate to all imports of agricultural products."
"The Commission itself thinks that the application of its proposals would mean a very small reduction in Community preferences."
"Many Council delegations do not approve of a reduction in Community preferences and have called for consideration of the possibility of universal application of the green rate."
"This could lead to both political and legal problems, because universal application of the agricultural rate to all imports of agricultural products could, in turn, involve the risk that the Union's trading partners would demand new negotiations on account of border protection."
"Which means the debate would start all over again."
"Mr President, the report we are dealing with on the proposal for a regulation on the unit of account and conversion rates applicable in the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy simplifies a situation that had introduced serious complications."
"Not that complicated situations are infrequent in the context of regulations concerning the CAP and, therefore, any simplification is to be welcomed, but I shall explain later on in what this simplification consists."
"The current situation produces economic incoherences and generates administrative complexity that leads to errors and creates situations that are not always legally very clear."
"From that point of view the Commission's proposal presents certain advantages through the simplification that it introduces."
"First of all, it would facilitate a situation that would be legally surer and the risks of dispute would be reduced."
"Furthermore, monetary fluctuations would also be reduced and experience shows that those fluctuations, with the system of monthly customs rates, are only significant for those Member States which are not in the EMS."
"Moreover, administrative complexity will be reduced and that will facilitate the management of small and medium-sized undertakings."
"As a consequence the system will be more transparent."
"A combination of legal uncertainty and complexity had led to many mistakes and, therefore, increased economic costs."
"However, the Commission proposal presents a problem which comes from confusing farming conversion rates with the monthly customs rate and, since the latter tends to be lower than the farming conversion rate, the Commission proposal will bring about a reduction in frontier protection and, thereby, Community preference."
"However, two questions have to be borne in mind: on one hand, that the system proposed has a general scope for all farm products."
"However, there are farm imports which are insignificant for the European Union and therefore the most important ones are concentrated in a restricted group of crops, which poses problems for that group of products."
"However, it would be naive to think that this proposal can worsen still further the already deteriorated European Community preference."
"The real problem lies in the signing of preferential agreements with third countries by the European Union."
"The reality is that most farm products, those where imports are considerable, enjoy a preferential share that puts heavy limits on this factor."
"Community preference is being deteriorated and I should like to recall that this is a basic principle of the CAP."
"Yet the problem does not lie only in conversion rates but also in the signing of preferential agreements."
"The genuine problem, from this point of view, is that farming is bearing a considerable share of the cost of the European Union's foreign policy, and this situation is all the more serious in the case of fruit and vegetables, products from the region of Murcia - from where I come; these crops are most affected by the conclusion of preferential agreements and this has knock-on effects, which are worse in the case of Mediterranean farming areas."
"In the Commission proposal there are some scandalous aspects."
"It is scandalous that the Commission, in its proposal to reform the COM on fruit and vegetables, should have proposed a market management financed in part by the farmers themselves, when imports definitely are to blame for the hold-ups occurring in those markets."
"That is why I think that this type of problem must be borne in mind."
"The simplification of farming regulations is desirable when it is a genuine simplification and here, Mr President, this is a simplification."
"That is not the case of the ideas communicated by the Commission for the simplification of the CAP, translated in practice into the dismantling, re-nationalization and experimentation with policies of dubious effectiveness and that have never yet been tried out."
"Mr President, we should now be trying to defend Community preference or prevent the disappearance of the CAP."
"In this particular case, I think that changing the conversion rates will simplify matters and offer transparency while the negative effects will be very small."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are dealing with today is particularly difficult because it is technical and that is why it was entrusted to a distinguished rapporteur in the person of Mr Jacob."
"I have much sympathy for his arguments and more particularly for those relating to administrative simplification: the coexistence of two conversion rates, in this case the customs rate and the agricultural conversion rate, poses problems for importing companies in its application."
"This is the sense of Amendment No 1 which our group has tabled and which I hope will be adopted by Parliament, since it has the advantage of completing the wording of the second recital in the Proposal for a Regulation."
"But, Commissioner, why choose to abolish the ACR in favour of the customs rate?"
"On this point, I do not understand you."
"After all, the difference between the rates is 5 %: why, therefore, choose the rate most unfavourable to European Union agriculture?"
"Once again, we are choosing the solution which reduces the advantage of Community preference."
"The Commission is the only organization worldwide which systematically favours imports from non-member countries."
"Amendment No 2 proposed by our group seeks to alter the choice of the rate."
"We say 'yes' to the agricultural conversion rate and 'no' to the customs rate."
"To put it plainly, we wish to favour the principle of preference."
"Many of my colleagues here present are members of the Committee on Agriculture."
"They very often talk about Community preference, but I believe that when it comes to voting they put the Commission before the interests of farmers."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, my group asks you to adopt our Amendment No 2 in order to show our farmers at least this once that the European Parliament wishes to protect them."
"May I remind you that agriculture and the rural world as a whole are a vital balancing element in our European society."
"Mr President, here, we are of course all in favour of administrative simplification for all economic operators, but administrative simplification should not be used as an alibi for deliberately weakening the principle of Community preference still further."
"In the present system, there are two rates for calculating import duties on agricultural products: the customs rate and the agricultural conversion rate."
"It seems to me logical to want a single rate, but why choose the customs rate which, by its very structure, is significantly different from the agricultural conversion rate?"
"I shall therefore support the two amendments which have been tabled, since they seek the same administrative simplification as the Commission's proposal, but still preserve the principle of Community preference and equity between Member States."
"Finally, Mr President, may I say that the Commission's proposal is a serious precedent harmful to the European agri-monetary arrangements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and the rapporteur Mr Jacob on their support for the Commission's proposal."
"In the exceptionally complicated sector of agricultural finance, it is seldom possible to simplify matters without affecting important interests."
"This is certainly true of the present situation, which proposes a significant administrative simplification and eliminates an erroneous economic practice."
"This concerns the use of a single conversion rate for the conversion to national currencies of all expenses relating to the import of agricultural products, which are expressed in ECU."
"In that way, the present dual system, in which expenditure is converted on the basis of one or other of the conversion rates, will be abolished."
"Though this would lead on average to a very slight reduction of certain duties in terms of the national currency, the cost of the measure would be insignificant in relation to the fluctuations caused by the markets, which influence own resources of agricultural origin."
"From the standpoint of Community preference, this measure has no practical consequences, granted that its minimal effect cannot influence decisions on whether or not to bring in imports."
"Finally, the solution proposed by the Commission involves no difficulties either at legal or international level."
"So we now have an opportunity which must not be missed, for an administrative simplification that business men are waiting for and which does not affect Community interests."
"Besides, we must not forget that this simplification will avoid many errors and much litigation."
"There is always the question why agricultural conversion coefficients are not used more generally in place of customs duties."
"Such a solution, however, would bring no advantage for the Union, since the use of one or another conversion coefficient does not influence Community preference; on the contrary, it could be regarded as provocative by our trading partners and create unnecessary difficulties with third countries."
"Mr President, I am sorry to say that the amendments tabled cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"The first, because it eliminates the motive for which it was proposed, without in any case affecting the present proposal, and the second because it restores the present system and so deprives the Commission's proposal of any effect."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Supplementary premium to sheep producers in Ireland and UK"
"The next item is the report (A4-0209/96) by Mr Gillis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation fixing a supplementary premium payable to sheep producers in non less-favoured areas of Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland (COM(96)0152 - C4-0315/96-96/0102(CNS))."
"Mr President, I would like to say a word of thanks to everybody for the report on setaside, I think we dealt with it very speedily."
"This being Friday morning and everybody wishing to start the long journey home I would hope that we could dispense with this one quite quickly as well, it is a very short report."
"In the spring of 1995, there was a complete collapse of the sheep market in Ireland."
"Prices collapsed totally; producers suffered a severe price drop, especially for their early lambs."
"These producers are a very necessary part of sheepmeat marketing, as their lambs are produced and brought to market out of the main season, thus producing a continuous supply of quality product all the year round."
"This eliminates seasonality, it eliminates the need for storage and in fact it is based on a natural form of production."
"These lambs are usually born out of season during November, December and January and for this reason they are very costly to produce."
"They require cereal feeding and they require housing."
"The proposal before you seeks to provide a supplementary premium of ECU 6.5 per ewe in the lowlands."
"That is in the non-disadvantaged area."
"Mr President, I think when you were introducing you said in the less-favoured areas, it is actually in the non-less-favoured areas and it applies for one year only, that is for the 1995 spring."
"It will affect approximately 10, 000 sheep farmers in both southern and northern Ireland and will alleviate some of the losses incurred in 1995."
"It is hoped that this measure will encourage farmers to continue with this type of lamb production and it should encourage them to continue supplying a valuable market on an all-year-round basis."
"This is something we have being trying to stimulate right across Europe for a very long time, to remove the seasonality."
"It is very important that Parliament gives its approval as quickly as possible, so that that money can be paid to these farmers without delay to encourage them to continue within this production."
"Otherwise they will slip back to a cheaper form of production and we will lose those valuable markets."
"Mr President, I want to express my appreciation of the way the Commission brought this proposal forward."
"It is an exceptional measure for Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"Farmers and sheep farmers in Ireland have always made the point that the sheepmeat regime does not create common conditions throughout the European Union."
"We fix the guide price and then base compensation on the average market price."
"But the Community is a big place and Ireland is an island and far away from its main markets."
"Therefore, the price in Ireland can often be very different from that in the rest of the European Union."
"That is what happened in this case."
"Sometimes the sheepmeat regime is severely criticized because of the cost per kilo of meat produced."
"But to look at it that way is to misunderstand the policy."
"There are 70, 000 sheepmeat producers in the European Union and 80 % of them live in disadvantaged areas."
"It means that in those areas there is very little else that they can do."
"Their only alternative would be calves from suckling cowherds."
"If you look at the stocking rate you will find that if you replace the four or five ewes with one cow - which is the equivalent stocking rate - it will be more expensive to stock this land with cows and you will be producing a product of which there is a one-and-ahalf million tonne surplus."
"So, the sheepmeat policy is a very good one."
"It supports difficult areas both in the south and north of the Community."
"At the same time, it contributes to a reduction in the amount of beef produced."
"I congratulate the Commission on its flexibility in coming forward with this."
"It does not add to production in any way and it is a relatively small amount of money."
"It shows that big as the European Union is, we have institutions that are capable of dealing with the problems which arise from day-to-day."
"That gives confidence to people, particularly in the peripheral areas."
"Mr President, I should like to join with my other Irish colleagues in acknowledging the Commission response in helping to alleviate what was a very serious problem for Irish early lamb producers."
"If we are to maximize the full potential of Europe's agricultural resources, we must add value to the greatest possible extent to the indigenous resources of rural areas."
"Nowhere has this opportunity been more ignored than in the processing of wool."
"There are almost 100 million sheep in the Europe and yet we do not have a sustainable EU wool sector."
"Ireland is the fifth largest producer of sheepmeat and wool."
"Yet we export all that wool unprocessed."
"Why should we in Europe hand over this opportunity and this potential to New Zealand and Australia."
"The wool sector report, which was recently approved by Parliament, puts forward reasonable and achievable proposals for a structured and cost effective programme to develop the EU wool sector and Parliament must bring pressure to bear on the Commission to bring forward its proposals at an early date for the establishment of that sustainable wool sector within the European Community."
"Mr President, the green fields of Ireland made a great impression on this Finnish Member when I visited Cork and its surrounding countryside a little while ago."
"I understood how important agriculture and sheepmeat production are to the Irish and to Irish agriculture."
"I also agree with the rapporteur, Mr Gillis and the Agriculture Committee fully that a disaster which affected sheep-rearers as a result of a sudden drop in prices should be compensated responsibly."
"In any case the continuation of traditional production is in the balance, and it is at any rate hard for me to imagine Ireland without an important sheepmeat sector."
"The situation in Ireland and Mr Gillis's report demand a comparison of sheepmeat production in the various peripheral regions of the European Union and in particular the Union's less favoured regions."
"It is rather difficult to understand the Council's line on sheepmeat production."
"While it justifiably considers additional support to sheepmeat production in Ireland, its policy seems to lead to a collapse in sheepmeat production and clearly to its abandonment in Finland."
"Finland has not hitherto been self-sufficient in sheepmeat, but now in addition to the collapse in profitability, wool is now only being accepted if it is given away."
"It is clear that if sheep-rearing is to continue in Finland urgent special measures are needed."
"Unfortunately, sheep rearing is only one example of the unfair approach of the common agricultural policy to the most northerly regions of the Union, north of Stockholm and Helsinki."
"In southern Finland there is a danger that farmers in what have traditionally been among the EU's most purely agricultural areas will have to give up production because it has become unprofitable."
"Normal support for production is unfair in northern regions because the harvest level is always lower there."
"Mr President, I therefore look to the Agriculture Committee to treat the Member States logically, since there are particularly serious difficulties affecting their agriculture, as has now happened in Ireland and similarly also in Finland."
"How is it possible that the committee has not noticed that Finnish farm incomes fell last year, in the first year of EU membership, by over 25 % on average, on some farms as much as 40 % and in wheat, egg and pigment production even more than that?"
"In spring 1994 the European Parliament ratified the accession treaty between the European Union and the Finnish Republic."
"In Article 141 of that Treaty it is laid down that compensatory support may be paid to agriculture in southern Finland in accordance with its special conditions where serious difficulties are noted."
"Should not the European Parliament, since it ratified the membership treaty, ensure that the letter and the spirit of the treaty are not trampled under foot?"
"I look to the Agriculture Committee to support the Finnish smallholders as energetically as it is now supporting the Irish sheep rearers."
"Mr President, Mr Gillis, when it is a question of the farmers of Europe receiving support, then you have me on your side, even if, as in the present case, they are Irish sheep farmers."
"However, I do not think that this type of support is the right way of going about it."
"We shall therefore abstain from voting on the regulation."
"What you are proposing is not forward-looking."
"We have just been told that by our Finnish colleague."
"When there are subsidies on one side, and when the market prices collapse, then that means that there is a chance for these sheep farmers to continue to exist, after a fashion, even when market prices are low, while other farmers, who do not receive support, then get into serious difficulties."
"In addition, you have not proposed any system of staggering, such as the one that applies to less-favoured areas."
"This means that if you pay a premium per sheep, then that premium will most probably not go to the farmer, because the dealers will include the premium in their calculations and will put even more pressure on prices, which again will result in difficulties for Finnish farmers and sheep farmers."
"A further point concerns the assertion that the value of sheepmeat will be enhanced."
"The value of sheepmeat will not be enhanced by EU premiums, by public money."
"All that this can do is to make up for a loss."
"The value of sheepmeat is enhanced by its having a value in the market, by Irish sheepmeat's having a reputation in Europe."
"Consumers are prepared to pay for that."
"We are going in the wrong direction if we think that we would be able to stabilize the market this way, by pumping public money into it."
"This is the wrong direction, and it has nothing to do with quality."
"Nevertheless, I do not begrudge the Irish sheep farmers the money that is now being paid to them by the EU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and the rapporteur Mr Gillis, as well as the Committee on Budgets and the rapporteur Mr Gallagher for their cooperation."
"The issue we are debating today relates to the unfortunate situation of the sheepmeat market throughout Ireland during the critical period at the end of Spring, 1995."
"The production of sheepmeat in Ireland is seasonal."
"Its productivity at the end of Spring depends on good market prices, given that the cost of animal feed tends to be very high at that time of year."
"In the spring of 1995 a combination of factors, including a much greater availability than usual in Northern Europe, led to low market prices all over Ireland."
"Although the Commission reacted by activating a number of support measures for the formation of private stores, the markets recovered very slowly."
"In fact, the Council expressed its concern about sheepmeat prices in Ireland, in the context of the bundle of measures concerning 1995 prices."
"Later, in December 1995, it announced that it was ready to decide on a Commission proposal to grant supplementary premiums, which would be strictly limited to the marketing period 1995, in full awareness of the economic consequences for the producers involved in Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"The present proposal is a response to the Council's concern and its readiness for action."
"It proposes a supplementary premium of 6.5 ECU per female animal, payable only for the marketing period 1995 to producers in non-disadvantaged areas of Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"The cost of this one-off supplementary support will be less than 10 million ECU and is allowed for in the budget for 1996."
"Now, as for the comment by Mr Olli Rehn, I would like to say concerning the problems faced by Finnish animal breeders, that the Commission is aware of the situation and has already begun making appropriate efforts in that direction in Finland."
"The European Commission is watching the situation closely and can cooperate with the Finnish authorities in any eventuality."
"We have chosen to abstain in the vote on this report."
"It seems absurd now to spend ECU 9.5 million because sheep farmers suffered a fall in prices in spring 1995."
"There are many industries which suffer falling prices and whose operational costs are higher at certain times of the year."
"Purely as a matter of principle the EU cannot start financing all sectors which suffer these problems."
"It therefore seems absurd to us to support this report."
"Protocol to Agreement with Andorra"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0241/96) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol to the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Principality of Andorra following the accession of the Republic of Austria, the republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union (COM(95)0745 - C4-0383/96-96/0009(CNS))."
"Mr President, Mr Galeote has worked intensively on this report and on this agreement."
"All the more reason, then, why he regrets not being able to present his report in person here today."
"However, it is for me a pleasure and an honour to be able to deputize for him, and for two reasons. The first reason is that I come from a Member State from which Andorra is probably a long way distant."
"But we ought to recognize that we in the European Union are a community in which Spain borders onto the Czech Republic, and in which Bavaria also borders on Andorra."
"And I believe that this community, in which we are not only regionally oriented, but also able to see problems as a whole, is important for the future."
"Secondly - and I believe that this is important too - Andorra is a state which has special connections and relationships with the European Union."
"Both of its Princes are citizens of the European Union, and one of them is even the President of a Member State of the European Union."
"Of the 64, 000 inhabitants of Andorra, only 13, 000 are Andorrans; the others are citizens of EU countries, namely France, Spain and Portugal."
"Not for that reason alone, but also because of all the historical and economic links between the European Union and Andorra, we should accord great importance to this country, even though it is such a small one."
"This country has succeeded, in a poor, barren region, which has not been blessed by nature, in achieving an amazing level of prosperity."
"The per capita GDP is $ 15, 000, which means that the people, by their hard work and inventiveness, in a difficult situation in which one might think they could only exist by living on charity, have actually created something out of their predicament, and have developed this country in an amazing way."
"I believe that this means that we should speak with more respect than we have done hitherto about the small countries of Europe."
"If Europe is structured in the way we want it to be, then it should not be centralist, but rather the regions and ethnic groups should be protected as communities with rights, and the small countries must be given their place as well."
"So often, on the subject of Slovenia, I hear people say that it is not really ready for accession because it is small - and yet its capital city alone has more inhabitants than one of our Member States, a state which I also rate very highly."
"And it is said that Malta is too small to be represented in the European institutions. If these things were true, then of course the same thing would apply to the really small countries of Europe."
"But I believe that they are very important, not only because of their historical and cultural role, but because they are a symbol of liberty, because they are manageable areas in a Europe that so often tends towards a mania for the huge and spectacular."
"And I am of the opinion, precisely because I represent a very large Member State, that we should attach a new importance to the small, manageable state within Europe."
"For this reason, I welcome the fact that this adjustment, which is essentially a technical one, and which is necessitated by enlargement, offers us an opportunity, for once in a while, to sing the praises of the small country in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I am pleased to be able to announce the vote in favour by my group, the Liberal Group, to the Protocol to the agreement with Andorra since the latest enlargement of the European Union."
"It is very important to bear in mind the reality of Andorra in the European framework and its relations with the European Union."
"Andorra is a political, social and economic entity that has undergone a very interesting evolution in recent years, since conversion into a sovereign State in 1993, when the country gave itself a democratic constitution and joined the United Nations and the Council of Europe, as well as other international organisations."
"The present government, led by Mr Marc Forné, of the Partit Liberal Andorrà, is concluding an important process of international and European planning, as well as the modernisation of the Andorran economy according to the strictest rules of western European economies - as such it is not possible to apply the term 'tax haven' as the explanatory statement of this report does."
"On the contrary, one of the most important efforts of the Andorran government has been to ensure a proper functioning of its institutions and the machinery of the Andorran State, fully in keeping, as I have already said, with the States and economies of the European Union."
"This is an activity also being carried out by other operators in the economic and social fields such as, for example, the Banca Andorrana, which now has a code of conduct similar if not practically identical to that governing the Association of Banks of the European Union."
"The European Union must cooperate intensively with the Andorran State so as to implement the agreement reached at the Madrid Summit in December 1995 to set up a cooperation agreement enabling, inter alia, the achievement of joint projects with the European Union in the field of transfrontier cooperation, in the areas of special rural, touristic and economic interest, such as the highlands of the Pyrenees - where it is in the European Union's special interest to develop communications and improve rural areas and inter-regional cooperation, as pointed out by Mr Posselt; we must promote progress in highland areas, progress that would be consolidated with the help of the Andorran State."
"To sum up, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should support a very interesting process in a State which goes back to the Middle Ages, which until 1993 was a co-principality run by the French President and the Bishop of la Seu d'Urgell and which, in a short time, converted itself into a modern and democratic State, within the geographical framework of the European Union - after all its borders are those of the European Union."
"Obviously this process means that we should support this protocol and call on the Council and the Commission to conclude that cooperation agreement which was already agreed upon at the Madrid Summit last year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to thank Mr Posselt and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm for their speeches and to agree with them that our debate today gives us the opportunity to stress the importance of cooperation with Andorra."
"I also agree with the comments by Mr Posselt concerning respect for small Member States, as a basic ingredient of European political philosophy."
"Mr President, the subject of the protocol you submitted to Parliament for its approval is a simple one: to adapt the agreement signed in 1990 with the Principality of Andorra as necessary to take into account the accessions of Austria, Sweden and Finland to the European Union."
"The Act of Accession by those three countries to the European Union envisaged that certain agreements concluded by the European Union with third countries should be subject - if necessary - to adaptation measures that would take enlargement into account."
"The agreement with Andorra was one of those agreements."
"That agreement is of essentially commercial nature and establishes customs union with Andorra for industrial products."
"The Commission has examined the orders of the agreement to determine which of them required adaptation and it concluded that the orders of the agreement with Andorra could essentially be implemented as they stood for the three new Member States as well."
"Consequently, customs union with the Principality is extended to the three new Member States immediately after their accession."
"It is only necessary to make certain adaptations of minor importance to the agreement with Andorra, mainly ones of a linguistic nature, and to a transitional order which in any case no longer applies, so far as Austria is concerned."
"That is precisely the subject of the protocol submitted to you."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr Hallam, you have the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I do not often speak on the subject of Andorra."
"It is not something that gets me terribly wound up!"
"But I would like to point out that I voted here on a Friday morning."
"I want to put it on record that on Wednesday, 332 Members of this House voted against scrapping Friday mornings."
"I would like to know where those 332 Members are this morning?"
"Mr Hallam, I imagine they must be holidaying in Andorra - it is a wonderful place to spend a weekend."
"Mrs Lulling, you have the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I should like to return to what Mr Hallam has just said."
"I believe the Treaty provides for 12 plenary sessions in Strasbourg."
"We have already voted, within one vote, against the twelfth sitting in Strasbourg, which is contrary to the Treaty."
"Those who wish to scrap the Friday sitting do not really know what they are doing."
"For why all this upheaval, all this travelling to come and sit here for only four days, when we have ample work for five days?"
"We have a lot of work, more and more work, otherwise the part sessions in Brussels would not be justified."
"I should like to protest."
"It is wrong to attack those who are always here on Friday, like Mr Posselt and others and myself."
"If others do not come, that is their problem, but it is not a reason for scrapping the Friday sittings in Strasbourg."
"We should instead have fewer sittings in Brussels and work on Fridays."
"Moreover, other people have to work on Fridays, and not to want to work on Fridays sets a very poor example to everybody."
"There are eighteen million unemployed in the Community who would very much like to work on Fridays."
"In my opinion, speeches like Mr Hallam's are a disgrace and I wish to protest about it."
"Mrs Lulling, I did not cut you off out of parliamentary courtesy and the respect in which I hold you."
"But this is not a point of order and this is not the time to open that debate."
"It is up to the President to tell Mr Hallam whether he had the right to speak or not and he had one minute to speak and did so as he saw fit."
"However, Mrs Lulling, we are not going to open that debate on this issue especially now that the holidays are upon us."
"I voted for Fridays because otherwise I would be without a job."
"I must thank all those who voted for Fridays."
"The vote was held according to the rules and so we are not going to re-open that debate."
"Mr McCartin, you have the floor on a point of order but if you are going to speak on this subject I shall stop you at once."
"Mr President, you would be perfectly right."
"I do not take advantage in that way to make a point of order which is not relevant."
"I just wanted to reply respectfully to our colleague who drew attention to the small attendance."
"Is that in order?"
"I wanted to defend this Parliament..."
"Mr McCartin, we have discussed this subject until we are blue in the face. I cannot accept any more speakers on that subject."
"Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I asked to speak before Mr Hallam asked."
"I wanted to say something that you could certainly not object to."
"I am delighted that the Friday meetings were not scrapped, because the best part about the plenary session is its Friday Presidency."
"I just wanted to thank you for that, and to wish you a pleasant holiday."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. But bearing in mind what you have decided this week, I would rather not accept any gift of any kind."
"Mr Papoutsis, you have the floor."
"Mr President, I am not going to make a political speech, but simply wanted to say, since you will shortly be announcing the end of the present sitting, before the summer holidays, that on behalf of the European Commission I wish you personally, Mr President, and all the Members here today as well as those who have been here all week, happy holidays, and may you all have a good rest and recover your strength."
"I wish the same to the interpreters who have helped us so much throughout these six months."
"I hope that in September we will return keener and stronger than ever so that we can intensify our efforts to build the Europe we want."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the agenda has been completed."
"May I first of all wish the Commissioner, President Santer and the Commission and their colleagues a well-earned holiday."
"I wish you all the same and must tell the interpreters and translators that we think highly of their work and hope that they, too, will enjoy their holidays. May I recommend that they speak very little and only in intimacy and in a whisper."
"Over the holidays I recommend that all the ushers forget the word 'President' and that all our colleagues forget about the rules and live freely."
"Ladies and gentlemen who accompany me on Fridays, I hope that you will have double rest on the Fridays over the vacation."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.05 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Friday, 19 July 1996."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sad duty to inform you that our colleague Ken Stewart died this Monday 2 September."
"Mr Stewart was a Member of the European Parliament for Merseyside West from 1984."
"He was a member of the Socialist Group and of the Committees on Transport and Petitions."
"He served in the British Army during the last war and was decorated for his services."
"After the war he was a long-serving member of Liverpool City Council and devoted himself to tackling the problems of housing in that city."
"He was always on the side of the underprivileged."
"He fought for social justice and his experience during the war made him an ardent supporter of peace."
"On your behalf I have sent a message of condolence to his widow."
"I invite you to join me in observing one minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Statement by the President on child murders"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a day of mourning."
"Indescribable crimes against children have been discovered in this country."
"We mourn together with the people of this country and beyond, who are overwhelmed by shock and shame, and we remember the countless children who have been abducted and sexually abused and forced into prostitution by criminals here and elsewhere."
"On a day such as this the European Parliament cannot remain silent, which is why I propose that we amend the agenda."
"We will begin as scheduled with a statement by the Commission on urgent political matters, namely on the European Union's reactions to the Helms-Burton law on trade restrictions."
"Then I suggest, after consulting the groups, that the Commission should make a statement on or after 4 p.m. on child abuse, followed by a brief debate."
"Finally, I suggest that we postpone the report by Mr von Wogau on consumer taxes, scheduled for this evening, to a later part-session."
"The remainder of the agenda will not be affected."
"Since you obviously all agree, that is how we will proceed."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"I wish to condemn the murder in cold blood of two young, unarmed, Greek Cypriots and the wounding of dozens of others as a result of the indiscriminate shooting engaged in by the Turkish army of occupation in the buffer zone in Cyprus between 11 and 14 August. In registering this condemnation I believe that I speak for the Greek Members of this House and for other Members generally."
"Those killings were a deliberate response by the occupation force to peaceful demonstrations."
"Not only does Turkey's conduct violate every legal precept; it also constitutes a violation of the customs union agreement to which it and we are signatories."
"I believe, therefore, that the European Parliament must address the matter, condemn the actions in question and take such measures as are appropriate."
"We will not start up a discussion on this!"
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The Conference of Presidents has proposed a number of changes."
"Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did in fact reject the request for urgent procedure made yesterday by the Council because that request reached us yesterday morning and it would have been necessary to reach a decision on the entire reform of the 'beef and veal' CMO and its financing in 24 or 48 hours."
"On the other hand, and this is why we rejected the request for urgent procedure, I believe it is now a matter for the Council to reformulate a request, if necessary, for the plenary in Strasbourg and to divide that request into three parts."
"We will be able to reconsider it at that time."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on urgent political matters of major importance concerning action taken on the Helms-Burton law."
"I call Sir Leon Brittan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have this opportunity to address Parliament with regard to the action taken on the Helms-Burton legislation on Cuba."
"I might also mention en passant the situation with regard to the legislation on Iran and Libya, the so-called D'Amato legislation."
"The United States Congress, as Parliament knows, has introduced legislation aimed at obliging third countries to follow American policy in respect of those countries."
"Most particularly it seeks to do that by imposing sanctions on individuals and companies who contravene the US law."
"It is fair to say that initially the administration was opposed to this legislation but in the end, as a result in particular, as far as Cuba was concerned, of events involving the shooting down of planes by the Cuban Government, President Clinton signed both laws."
"From the outset, both during the period when that legislation was going through the United States Congress and since then, the European Union has expressed strong and determined opposition to this legislation, as have countries as close to the United States as Canada and Mexico and, indeed, the Organization of American States."
"We have made many demarches, we have lobbied Congress directly as has the European Parliament and the European business community."
"The reason why we have taken such strong exception is that we believe that both the Helms-Burton law and the D'Amato law are contrary to international law, misguided in principle and counterproductive in practice."
"We share American concerns about the countries targeted by this legislation but we think it is profoundly wrong that, instead of attacking those countries, the United States legislature should have attacked America's allies and closest friends and have allied America's allies and closest friends against the United States and reinforced the position of hardliners in countries such as Cuba, Iran and Libya."
"Nonetheless, the laws have come into effect."
"It is true to say that as far as the Helms-Burton legislation is concerned, as a result partly of our strong expression of feeling and opposition, the President of the United States suspended the coming into effect of part of the legislation, Title 3, in the sense that, for a period of six months, he suspended the ability of private individuals to bring legal suits although liability that would have accrued remains accruing even if it cannot be actually taken to court."
"As I have said, we expressed our deep concern, but we came to the conclusion that the time must come not just to express concern but to protect European Union interests."
"The Commission put forward specific ideas for doing so to the General Affairs Council in July and I am happy to say that the General Affairs Council showed a very strong degree of support and unanimity in adopting a statement reaffirming its concern to promote democratic reform in Cuba but recalling its deep concern at the Helms-Burton legislation."
"It identified a range of measures which the European Union could deploy in response: resort to the WTO panel - we have already begun the process of consultation; changes in the procedures governing entry by United States citizens to the European Union; the introduction, above all, of legislation to neutralize the extra-territorial affects of the United States' legislation and the establishment of a watch list containing the names of companies and individuals who took action against European Union entities on the basis of this legislation."
"The Commission reacted urgently to that decision of the Council and has already tabled a proposal for Community anti-boycott legislation which would have the effect of nullifying action based on that legislation as far as European law is concerned but also providing for compensation being obtainable in European courts if compensation was obtained in American courts against European companies."
"So, for example, under this legislation, if a European company was sued in the United States then it would be possible for that company to obtain compensation in any European Union country against the company that had succeeded in the United States."
"To take one example, if the company was a German company but there were no assets in Germany of the American company, it could take action in Spain, France or any other European Union country."
"The Commission has also worked on that and the Council is now studying the proposal and is also looking at the visa question."
"The Commission will shortly publish a notice in the Official Journal inviting people to give information necessary to establish the watch list."
"The D'Amato legislation, on the other hand, raises slightly different questions."
"It was signed in August."
"We have protested and will continue to protest vigorously against it."
"It will be possible to extend the anti-boycott legislation to the provisions of the D'Amato legislation as well as the Helms-Burton legislation."
"The House will be aware that yesterday President Clinton's special envoy Mr Stuart Eizenstat, formerly Ambassador to the European Union, met members of the REX Committee."
"He also had a meeting with me and with my colleagues Mr Marín and Mrs Bonino today."
"His main message was that the United States wants to work together with or in parallel with the European Union to try to improve prospects for democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba."
"He said the more an international framework of cooperation can be created, the easier it would be for President Clinton to repeat his July decision, which only has effect for six months, to suspend the right to file cases under Title 3 of Helms-Burton."
"He also made a number of suggestions for concrete measures to be taken by governments, NGOs and the private sector."
"I expressed our desire for democracy to come to Cuba but I pointed out that the introduction and enactment of legislation of the Helms-Burton kind was the worst possible basis on which to construct a truly cooperative approach to this problem between the United States and Europe."
"I reiterated our objections to the legislation and stressed our determination to defend European Union interests with vigour, determination and urgency."
"I said I would reflect on what Mr Eizenstat said, would consult with colleagues, Member States and the European Parliament and will consider together what, if any, should be the European Union response to that particular initiative."
"Unilateral action is always regrettable but it is particularly regrettable that a country with whom we have such close relations as the United States should have gone down that road."
"It is all the more regrettable to me who devoted a considerable part of last year to achieving the new trans-Atlantic initiative and the action plan designed to reinforce relations with the United States."
"That taught me and everybody else who was working on it that our relations with the United States are wide and comprehensive and however great our resentment may be about Helms-Burton and however strong our determination must be to take all steps to protect European interests, it is important also to look at the relationship as a whole."
"The initiatives that led to this legislation originated in the Congress and, looking beyond the present problems, it underlines the importance of this House, the European Parliament, maintaining close contact with the American Congress in order to avert such action in the future."
"We must continue to draw them into debate and impart an understanding of why such legislation is unacceptable and repugnant to Europeans and therefore absolutely counterproductive to the promotion of our common objectives of democratic reform in Cuba and of combatting terrorism emanating from Iran and Libya."
"Meanwhile we stand absolutely determined to protect European interests and to do everything we can to counteract this legislation and to lead ultimately to its repeal."
"Mr President, I think we all agree that we have to adopt a twin-track policy towards this latest piece of American legislation."
"Firstly, we must maintain and reiterate our firm position because what the Americans have decided on and propose to enforce is unacceptable to us."
"Secondly, we must avoid escalation."
"We need a trade war with the United States like a hole in the head."
"So my first question is this: how best to reconcile these two objectives?"
"Can it be done, and by what means, methods and/or procedures?"
"My second question: has the Commission consulted the other countries affected, particularly Canada and Mexico?"
"Is it possible to pursue a closely coordinated approach to this matter, giving prime concern to democracy and observance of the rules of international trade?"
"I agree with the approach commended by Mr De Clercq."
"It is right that we have to be firm but it is also right that the situation should not escalate."
"How can we combine that?"
"The answer is to take those measures which directly defend the interests of European companies as affected by this legislation but not to extend the action to areas which have nothing whatsoever to do with this legislation."
"That is the way in which we can combine the two principles Mr De Clercq referred to."
"We have consulted Canada and Mexico."
"We are, in a sense, working with them."
"They, of course, have one further avenue and that is the NAFTA provisions and they are pursuing their complaints through the NAFTA machinery as well."
"We are in close touch with them."
"I agree with Mr Donnelly that it is necessary to stand up to this, not only to protect the interests attacked directly but also to deter further action."
"We have in the course of this legislation made repeated representations to Congressional leaders in a variety of forms through demarches, letters and in other ways."
"I am very happy to ensure that Congressional leaders receive a copy of the statement I have made today."
"Mr President, my compliments to the Commissioner for the way in which he is safeguarding European interests over this."
"I have the following question for him."
"Has the Commission made provision for any problems to be reported to a central location so that they can be recorded and if possible resolved?"
"Thank you for your kind words."
"As far as relations with European companies are concerned, we are always in close touch with UNICE which is the body which is perhaps best able to coordinate and analyse the extent of the problem."
"We have also of course had direct contact from a number of companies that either had been affected or fear that they will be affected."
"I should like to consider whether there is any further step that we can take which will ensure a comprehensive view of the nature of the problem."
"That is something which should in the first instance be discussed with UNICE but I am extremely grateful to Mr Pex for his constructive suggestion."
"Mr President, it is wonderful to be noticed by you, thank you very much!"
"Commissioner, the current policy of the USA is, as you noted, destabilizing political and economic transatlantic relations generally, and this is all the more regrettable, as you pointed out, in view of the new hopes we had in the context of the transatlantic agenda."
"I strongly regret that and I would emphasize that extra-territorial actions should be condemned in general."
"Otherwise the credibility of international law and international organizations and institutions as a whole - here I need only mention the UN and of course the WTO - will be put at risk."
"We cannot afford that."
"It leads to international political and economic destabilization."
"Commissioner, when will Parliament officially be consulted on a Community regulation?"
"I know you have put a proposal before the Council, and the question belongs with the Council."
"When will the Council consult us?"
"Second question: are you considering taking the matter to The Hague?"
"I entirely agree that, quite apart from the damage to European economic interests, it is the principle of extra-territoriality that is most objectionable."
"I believe that the history of modern civilization implies a move to resolve disputes of all kinds, but in particular commercial disputes, by recourse to international bodies such as the WTO and not by taking the law into your own hands."
"That is absolutely crucial."
"I entirely agree with Mrs Mann as far as that is concerned."
"We have identified the WTO as the principle forum to which complaint should be made."
"It is also right to say that in OECD discussions on the investment proposal the point has indirectly been raised and we will consider all other fora."
"I mentioned the fact that Canada and Mexico are using the NAFTA forum."
"I am not sure myself whether The Hague court is the most rapid and effective way of dealing with the situation but we are open to all suggestions."
"Mr President, as a member of Parliament's delegation to look at Cuba's problems, I visited the island at the end of June."
"I should now like to say a word in favour of its people by clearing away an old misconception: that everyone who is in favour of Cuba is necessarily pro-Castro; that those who criticize it are against the system; and now that those who are against the Helms-Barton legislation must of necessity be against the United States."
"The real subject of this diatribe must be the people, which is paying, more or less for everybody, the price of a situation which, to put it mildly, is unacceptable."
"In Cuba, Mr President, there is starvation today."
"This is not the time for the old lamentation about the poor Cuban, but this is the spirit in which, in my opinion, the European Parliament should intervene, including from the economic angle: we should indeed defend European enterprises seeking to stimulate activity on the island, but first and foremost so as to help the people of Cuba to recover from a situation of which they are partly the cause but above all the victims."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner: what do you propose to do to protect firms which are held to ransom by the United States on their own territory?"
"I entirely agree with Mr Santini."
"We of course have to protect our own interests but also we have to ask ourselves what will help the Cuban people."
"We are as enthusiastic as anyone in the United States or anywhere else about democracy and human rights returning to Cuba."
"We spend a considerable amount of European money on humanitarian relief in Cuba."
"We do not differ with the United States about the ends."
"We differ about the means."
"That is a message which should go to the Cuban people as well as to everybody else."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people of Cuba are suffering now, as the people of South Africa did in the past, from intolerable boycott measures."
"But the same applies to the people of Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of new-born babies and children are dying under appalling conditions."
"Is it not time to terminate our agreement with the United States? That country is sentencing the people of Iraq to death, in the long run, and is now interfering not with a violation of international law, as in the past, but with an internal arrangement which is of no concern to the international community."
"That does not happen to be my opinion nor is it a consensus in the European Union or in the European Commission but no decisions have been taken relating to that question in recent days at European level."
"I too was in Washington recently and took part in the rather heated discussion which members of the delegation had with members of the United States Congress."
"It was apparent that the Helms-Burton Act causes a great deal of anxiety among certain members of Congress."
"My question to the Commission is: first, what does he think the possibilities would be of a successful challenge to certain aspects of Helms-Burton in the United States Supreme Court, especially that part of the Act which punishes spouses and children by executive action, by withdrawal of visas, residents' facilities and so on - the biblical principle that the sins of the parents will be visited on the children?"
"I would not on the basis of a rapidly receding and distant year spent at the Yale Law School give an instant personal view on American constitutional law."
"All I will say is that there are people who are better qualified than I who take the view that Mr Cassidy has given voice to and take the view that quite apart from the provisions he has referred to being objectionable in principle they are of doubtful constitutionality."
"There are certainly voices in Congress, which wish to introduce amendments to the legislation to remove those objectionable features."
"I fear many others would still remain."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the USA supposedly regards Cuba as a threat to its national security and therefore does not regard the WTO as competent."
"Does the Commission agree that this kind of link-up exists and share the view of the US Government, and will the Commission call for a WTO panel procedure prior to the American elections?"
"For that is most important in this connection and interestingly enough the Commission did indeed submit a proposal four weeks ago which was designed to protect European companies from the Helms-Burton law."
"But why only now?"
"Why did the Commission not do so four years ago at the time of the Toricelli law?"
"Surely there are interesting parallels!"
"What is the Commission's view of a country that first ratifies treaties and then tries to bypass them with the help of national legislation when it suddenly decides they no longer suit it?"
"How does the Commission view that?"
"Thank you again for calling me."
"It always works when a beautiful woman on my right raises her hand."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, you really can read me like a book!"
"It is not for me to consider why we did not introduce legislation about some other law four years ago but I do not think anybody can reproach the Commission for lack of urgency in putting forward a legislative proposal to the Council of Ministers immediately before the summer break."
"I was asked earlier on when it would come to Parliament and I apologize for not answering that specifically."
"It will come to Parliament as soon as the Council of Ministers has reached the appropriate point in its deliberations."
"But we were a great deal more rapid in producing that legislation than most people expected."
"Commissioner, two months ago a seminar was held in Sitges, convened by IRELA, an institution known to this House, and the Washington Centre for International Studies, and all the experts there, including the Americans, considered, as you do, that this law is contrary to international law and to international trade, and hence to the sovereignty of nations."
"There are countries which have taken rather mild measures and others which have acted more energetically."
"It would be advisable for the European Union to take steps which are vigorous enough to ensure that the United States does not bank on its and our friendship to infringe something which is a sacred principle: the sovereignty of nations and peoples and their freedom to trade with whomsoever they wish."
"If this does not happen, if there is no vigorous response from the European Union, the United States will believe that in future it can take whatever decision it likes as regards other countries."
"Commissioner, how far would the European Union be prepared to go, within the bounds of friendship, to avert the pernicious effects of this law?"
"The actions of individual countries in taking measures to deal with this problem are commendable but the real lesson for the European Union, not only in this matter but in all others, is that our unity is our strength and therefore the real vigour and strength of reaction and the effect both in dealing with this measure and deterring comparable measures will be in direct proportion to our unity and rapidity of response."
"Therefore I hope that a call will come from this Chamber to the Council of Ministers to respond urgently and rapidly to the preparations the Commission has made for rapid and effective action to defend ourselves."
"Let us be strong."
"The best way of being strong is by being united."
"In your introductory statement you yourself pointed out that Helms-Burton is merely the tip of the iceberg, that the United States is also drafting legislation on a number of other states which, geographically at least, are closer to Europe."
"However important it may be to keep the effects of the Helms-Burton legislation on the European economy or on Europe and the world in general within bounds, in my view it is just as important, not to say urgent, to ensure that the Americans - regardless of their concerns in this matter and the understanding we have for these concerns - do not start including other countries and other economic areas in their legislation too."
"What is the Commission doing in this regard?"
"I very much agree with that."
"We cannot deal with legislation which has not been enacted."
"We have on the statute book so far the Helms-Burton legislation and the D'Amato legislation."
"That gives us quite a lot to deal with and we are dealing with it rapidly and I hope vigorously - certainly as long as the Commission has anything to do with it."
"But I actually believe that taking this action is in the best interests not only of the European Union but of the United States as well."
"There are many people in the United States who realize that what has been done was done in haste and things done in haste are very rarely wise."
"They also realize that it damages the American leadership role in the world."
"I believe the world will be a better place if Europe and the United States can work together and anything that damages that cooperation is not only against the interests of Europe but also against the interests of the United States."
"Therefore, standing up to the United States, discouraging such future legislation, is something which will help us in the long term to work together better."
"I do not expect it to be seen exactly like that in Washington today but I believe it to be the truth."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement and congratulate him on the measures which he has taken."
"I believe he will know that Parliament has gone on record against the Helms-Burton legislation on a number of occasions, once in a report which I introduced here."
"We have made it very clear at the same time that we believe in progress in democracy in Cuba."
"This, however, is the worst possible means of seeking to achieve that."
"Does the Commissioner agree that it is important that we should put all possible pressure on at the present time because after the American presidential election this may be looked at in quite a different light?"
"In those circumstances, will the Commissioner consider what other actions can be taken through the World Trade Organization, through GATT and in other respects which some of my colleagues have mentioned this afternoon?"
"The pressure put on now is absolutely vital for the final result we wish to achieve."
"I entirely agree with Mr Newens."
"We are proceeding through a process of consultation, which is a necessary preliminary to going to a panel, so the Commission has already gone ahead as far as the WTO is concerned."
"But I am not just being ordinarily and customarily polite in saying that the role of this Parliament is important."
"This legislation comes from Congress even though the Administration has to take the responsibility for not vetoing it."
"That means that when the next Congress is elected it will be vitally important for all of us, but obviously most particularly for members of other legislatures, to establish early contact with the members of that Congress."
"Whatever the outcome, there will be lots of new members and one of the problems in the past has been a lack of knowledge and sometimes a lack of interest in European affairs by the recent, rather radical Congress."
"I hope, therefore, when the new Congress is elected, that we can all in our different ways make a real effort to explain the true path of cooperation between Europe and the United States and the pitfalls that must be avoided."
"I am sure they will tell us the pitfalls that we also should avoid and we should be ready to listen to them as well as tell them what we think should be done and should be avoided."
"Mr President, we readily endorse the Commission's opposition to the American measures and I am grateful to Sir Leon Brittan for his statement."
"But I think there is a clear distinction to be drawn."
"Cuba is primarily an American problem, but Libya and Iran really represent the same problem to both the US and the Union."
"Indications that these two countries are sponsors of international terrorism are increasingly clear."
"They are also hampering the peace process in the Middle East."
"It is thus deplorable that the US and the Union should be ranged against one another in the fight against international terrorism, especially in view of the speed at which Iran is building up her arsenal of weapons."
"My question is what justification is there for continuing the dialogue with Iran and Libya unchanged and what is there to stop us from pursuing a coordinated policy towards these two countries jointly with the USA?"
"To be quite honest I do not think it is practical to talk about a single, simple approach to terrorism."
"In a previous capacity I had to consider issues relating to terrorism and I can assure you that its international complexity is considerable."
"So I do not think it is fair to castigate either the United States or anybody else for not coming up with a magical policy which will solve the problem."
"If one is being brutally honest, the truth of the matter is that the American policy of sanctions and confrontation has not stopped terrorism."
"Nor has the European policy of dialogue stopped terrorism."
"We should be honest about that."
"Mr President, I still have a lot to learn."
"But you must tell me how sixteen eyes looking out from different corners, some of them short and some them long-sighted, can always take the right decision!"
"Mr President, I also want to thank the Commission warmly for the practical position it adopted and for demonstrating its ability to act."
"Since Parliament took a very detailed decision on Helms-Burton very early on, and also on Iran/Iraq, the content of which basically is still entirely consistent with the situation there, I believe it has fulfilled its obligation and that it will continue to do so."
"I would be interested to know what legal differences you see between the D'Amato legislation and the Helms-Burton legislation because my impression is that there are differences of view on this within the Commission too, at least from what emerged in the Committee on External Economic Relations this week, with which I do not agree."
"Both laws are contrary to international law and Mr Eizenstat referred to political reasons that cannot be recognized by the WTO."
"What is your position on this?"
"We do not accept any kind of exclusion of the WTO."
"It is unacceptable to say that here is something the WTO cannot even consider."
"Whether we go to a panel is something that has yet to be decided because we are still in the process of consultation."
"But that is quite unacceptable and not a position we could go along with at all."
"As far as the differences between Helms-Burton and D'Amato are concerned, the major differences are firstly that Title 3 at least of Helms-Burton, although it has been suspended for six months, in principle allows private action to be taken by individual Americans and individual American companies."
"That is not the case with the D'Amato legislation."
"The other main difference is that whereas the President has a discretion to suspend or partially suspend the operation of Title 3 of Helms-Burton for six months at a time, in the D'Amato legislation he has a much greater discretion as to how to apply it, whether to apply it and the extent to which it should be applied."
"Therefore the scope for protest of a reasoned kind is much greater and, as the legislation has only just come into existence, that is the appropriate course to follow."
"So there are significant legal, practical and economic differences between the two pieces of legislation."
"I should like to congratulate Sir Leon and the Commission on their firm stand on this question."
"It seems to me that the US concern about democracy in Cuba is rather like their concern about peace in Iraq where they are delivering peace by Cruise missile."
"Having visited Cuba and the US a number of times, I have to say that in many ways Cuba is a more democratic society than the USA where both major parties are owned by corporate America."
"Perhaps we could best bring it home to the US by suggesting that it thinks about a blockade policy towards Saudi Arabia and other client states of the US where no democracy and human rights exist and very little concern is expressed by the Americans about them."
"Some of the points the honourable Member has made would carry greater force if he did not say something which is manifestly untrue about democracy in Cuba."
"There is none."
"It is as simple as that."
"Commissioner, we are all agreed on a rejection of the Helms-Burton law because of its extra-territorial effects, and of course not all of us - far from it - share the extraordinary views we have just heard about Cuban democracy."
"But the question I should like to put to the Commissioner is this: since the Helms-Burton law applies only to cases involving property formerly owned by American subjects which was confiscated by the Castro government without payment of compensation, and is now passing out of the Cuban government's control to be handed over to a foreign entrepreneur who likewise receives it without paying compensation to its rightful owners, can the Commission tell me whether or not any specific cases have so far arisen of European Union companies or individuals being referred to US courts because they come within the scope of the prohibitions contained in this law, or are we still confronting a theoretical situation in which no actual cases have occurred?"
"Under Title 3 - the one which has been suspended as far as action is concerned - obviously there has been no legal action by individual companies because the President has suspended that."
"But under Title 4, which is the provision which requires the United States Government to exclude individuals from entering the country if they are targeted under this legislation, and you have heard from Mr Cassidy that applies to families of individuals, individual companies have received letters from the United States Administration indicating in some cases that they are suspect, in some cases a little bit more than that."
"I am sure that Parliament will tell Sir Leon Brittan that it very much values the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America."
"He is also aware that the European Parliament has been concerned for a very long period of time, even before-Helms-Burton, about the isolation of Cuba."
"In the area, for example, of development cooperation, we do not have any formal relationships with Cuba, unlike the whole of the rest of the Caribbean and Central and South America, so there are very great problems."
"I wonder to what extent the Commissioner feels it is possible to use this particular issue to make progress rapidly to formalize relationships with Cuba."
"This would be in the mutual interests of Cuba and the European Union."
"This is the direction in which we were moving and indeed the Council favoured the entry into negotiations with Cuba."
"But then my colleague Mr Marín visited Cuba, had meetings with opposition leaders and very shortly after that the vast majority of those leaders were arrested."
"The Council therefore decided that it was not opportune to continue negotiations at this particular moment."
"I share that view."
"That concludes Question Time."
"We thank Sir Leon Brittan for his statements."
"Child abuse"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on child abuse."
"I call Sir Leon Brittan."
"Mr President, the recent tragic events here in Belgium of which we were brutally reminded yesterday and today as more victims of violence and paedophilia have been uncovered has put the spotlight on the whole question of the horrific sexual exploitation of children."
"I speak on behalf of all my colleagues at the Commission when I join Parliament in expressing our deep sense of shock and sorrow about this summer's events, feelings shared by all civilized people throughout the European Union and beyond."
"I therefore welcome the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague Mrs Gradin, to make a statement to you today."
"This tragedy, reinforcing as it does the timeliness of the first World Congress on the Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm at the end of August, challenges us all to assume our responsibilities and respond as quickly and effectively as we can."
"The World Congress was organized by the Swedish Government, the United Nations Fund for Children, UNICEF and the organization End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism."
"Representatives from 130 governments participated in the conference as well as non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations."
"The Commission was represented by my colleague Mrs Gradin."
"The Commission will of course study carefully the conclusions and the action plan which were decided upon at the conference."
"It is already apparent that there is a need for a clear and wide-ranging approach based upon international cooperation and active collaboration between governments and NGOs."
"As part of this effort and with a view to identifying specific initiatives at the level of the European Union, the Commission is now working on a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on trafficking in women, including young women, for sexual exploitation."
"This follows the results of a conference in June organized by Mrs Gradin on trafficking in women."
"The approach will cover issues such as migration, judicial and police cooperation and social aspects and most recommendations will be applicable more broadly to the fight against trafficking in children of both sexes."
"In addition, the Commission is currently preparing a proposal for special measures against so-called child sex tourism."
"Thirdly, the Commission is looking into the problem of child pornography and the use of networks such as Internet between paedophiles and will propose actions aimed at the offensive use of information networks."
"This is a difficult area especially in an international context since it touches upon national constitutional issues related to the free circulation of information."
"The freedom to express one's ideas and opinion is a fundamental human right and must remain so."
"But that freedom must not be allowed to be grossly abused and we must seek to find ways to prevent child pornographers from pursuing their ends without interfering with the normal expression of ideas and opinion."
"Finally, it is clear that an improvement in police and judicial cooperation is required and the Commission welcomes the rapid response of the Irish presidency with the announcement yesterday of a proposal to extend the mandate of the Europol drugs unit to trafficking in human beings."
"The Commission hopes that the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and the Interior on 27 September will provide an opportunity for a productive debate on this and other proposals such as those announced by Belgium and also the Commission's contribution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of European Socialists I should like to express our feelings, our sympathy, and offer our condolences to the suffering families of the young victims of the atrocities we have been discussing today."
"Leatitia and Sabine were fortunately rescued in time, but Julie, Mélissa, An and Eefje are dead."
"And, let me remind you, we still know nothing of the fate of Gevrij, aged 6, Ilse, aged 19, Élisabeth, aged 12 - whose father, as you will remember, appeared in this House and showed us her paintings, in an unforgettable expression of grief - Nathalie, aged 9, Lubna, aged 9, Sylvie, aged 19, Ken, aged 8, and Yann, aged 12."
"And we know that Catherine, Kim and Carola are dead, though we do not as yet know the circumstances."
"As well as offering my condolences, I would like to pay tribute to the attitude of the parents. They have been able to master and stifle their feelings and reject the temptations to excess offered by the microphones."
"They have given us, in Belgium, a lesson in responsibility, in civic duty, and in moral courage. They are an example to us today."
"These events are abnormal."
"But they are not unique and they are not specific to Belgium."
"Basically, they raise the problem of protection, and more simply of respect for children, respect for their dignity and, I would add, respect for women, too."
"They compel us to think about the image of those children, in an environment created by the media, created out of violence and unhealthy fascination."
"It is all too often the case during paedophilia trials, and even during rape trials, that we see people refusing to comprehend the seriousness of the charges."
"Sometimes such events are even referred to as inevitable."
"There are even cases where the victims' consent is emphasized."
"I believe that our thoughts on this subject should range further, much further, afield."
"We are not just dealing with a few deviant monsters."
"The trade in paedophilia, the trafficking in children, is an organized business with national, European and international channels, networks, finance."
"To meet a perverse demand, materials are produced, marketed, distributed and consumed: whether they be thousands or millions of cassettes, live performances or, more brutally and more terribly still, the children themselves, both here and in the third world."
"Behind all these networks lies, first and foremost, profit: the quest for profit, the greed for profit."
"Profit for the procurers, for the pornographers, for the travel agents who organize and market sex tourism, even to the extent of making it almost commonplace."
"Profit for the banks, which administer the accounts and launder the money."
"These networks develop as legislation permits and demand requires."
"Belgium or Thailand today, France, the United Kingdom or Central America tomorrow."
"As you have seen, Belgian society is in turmoil."
"Are our children protected?"
"What are these institutions which are failing to live up to expectations?"
"All of us together, Belgians and Europeans, need to answer these questions."
"The Commissioner has already said as much."
"Europol, as we have already said in the European Parliament, must have a mandate to hunt down those who traffic in children, in under-age children and women."
"Our legislation needs to be fundamentally revised to prohibit sex tourism."
"Ultimately, we must break down the borders, not the borders of pornography, which makes a mockery of everything, but our own borders, the borders of our mentalities and of our laws."
"This will be the only fitting memorial for all the victims who are in our thoughts today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people in my country are appalled by the past few days' reporting of children and young girls being abducted, abused and murdered."
"For days now we have watched in horror as these macabre events have unfolded."
"It gets harder and harder to understand how all this can be possible."
"As we begin this debate I must convey the sympathy of the EPP Group to the parents and families of the murdered girls."
"We share their anguish and admire the courage and dignity with which they are enduring this difficult time."
"On behalf of the EPP Group I wish to make four points."
"Firstly, as Mrs Dury points out, these events in Belgium are not peculiar to Belgium alone."
"We all know that there are networks throughout Europe and worldwide for the abduction of children, child prostitution and the use of children in pornographic videos."
"It amounts to trafficking in children, prostitution and serious international crime."
"We need to answer a number of questions."
"For example, how long are we going to go on tolerating the blatant publicity for sex tourism to Asia?"
"How long are we going to close our eyes to the flourishing two-way trade in women and children which exists with Central and Eastern Europe and with countries like Thailand, the Philippines and others in Asia?"
"How long are we going to allow countries to refuse to cooperate, like Tunisia and Morocco, and then there is the case of the abducted girl Milena Bianco from Bassano del Grappa, but there are dozens, hundreds of other instances."
"Secondly, what initiatives are to be taken to intensify judicial and police cooperation?"
"We need to discuss ratification of the Europol Convention by the Member State parliaments."
"How long will this take?"
"One year, two years or maybe more."
"We need to discuss the urgent necessity of completing the talks on the European information system convention and of getting that convention ratified in the Member States at the same time as the Europol Convention, otherwise we shall not have the necessary instruments."
"This Europol Convention, and the European information system, are the instruments which are needed in order to set up a centre in which all necessary information can be concentrated."
"Are all the politicians, national and European, who are currently voicing their outrage, able to act quickly, in the Member States too?"
"Of course one has to put one's own house in order."
"Crimes must be punished."
"Regrettably the populace is forced to recognize, once more today, that criminal networks are able to operate freely and are sometimes even aided by persons from inside the machinery of justice."
"Thirdly, in addition to intensifying cooperation between official bodies the EPP Group, and we put this proposition to Parliament, is keen to help the action groups, Marc and Corinne and the families concerned."
"Fourthly, the Intergovernmental Conference is busy preparing amendments to the Maastricht Treaty."
"Will European governments draw the political consequences of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and last week's Stockholm Declaration and amend the Union Treaty so that children's rights are incorporated into the new Treaty?"
"The EPP Group also looks to the European Commission for a rapid proposal to have the Stockholm Declaration translated in the very near future into policy proposals for the European Union."
"Only then will there be any chance of restoring the faith of the people of Belgium and other Member States which has been so deeply shaken."
"What is at stake here is the honour of our society, the respect due to children and the future which they represent."
"Mr President, recent events have tragically highlighted the serious problem of child prostitution."
"We are all, ladies and gentlemen, guilty of indifference and laziness, because it took the tragedy of the Dutroux case to bring this debate onto our Parliament's agenda, although we know that every year sees a great many children surrendered to the sex market, in Europe and in the rest of the world."
"Today, declarations and discussion groups are enough. We must act, by drawing up a European plan to combat paedophilia."
"Our group would like to propose this plan, taking action through the courts, in the names of the murdered children. With this aim in mind, we propose that the Intergovernmental Conference should finalize a legal basis which will allow a Community policy to be pursued with regard to the traffic in human beings."
"Let the Member States take steps to harmonize their national legislation on child protection. Let them apply their legislation and seal any loopholes in it."
"Let any sexual abuse of children be regarded by the law as a crime against humanity. Let the possession of pornographic material intended for children be criminalized."
"We also call for Europol's mandate to be extended to include the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children."
"Finally, we call for the creation of a European observatory to study the legislation and the way it is applied."
"And we want to see a policy of prevention, involving a strategy to increase awareness among the general public, and especially among children."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a child is something essential in a different way from a Euro or an ECU."
"Let us take specific action to protect the future of the Europe we are building for our children."
"Mr President, I too would like to express my sincerest sympathy for the parents of the young Belgian victims and their exemplary dignity in the face of the tragedy they are currently experiencing."
"For a long time, paedophilia has aroused very little public interest, and the law of silence - with a view to suppressing the scandal - was always the order of the day."
"Now, the Dutroux case has demonstrated that there are limits to the powers of the national police forces and national courts, and it is in this climate of psychosis and fear that we have to react urgently."
"If child prostitution has become so widespread it is because society tried to pretend it didn't exist and, when it did become aware of it, it refused to believe it."
"It has taken an indescribable tragedy, directly affecting our children and played out in full view in one of our Member States, for children finally to occupy the central place that they deserve within our society."
"We are living in a world where culture, commerce and technology move across borders too rapidly to be accurately monitored."
"So it is not surprising that criminal activity is following this same process of internationalization."
"As yet, we have no really effective weapons to combat it."
"Strengthening the third pillar of the Treaty could provide us with the means to combat these international networks of organized criminals."
"Nothing short of judicial co-operation on criminal matters and police co-operation with a view to preventing and combatting serious forms of international crime can be regarded by the Member States of the Union as being in the common interest."
"Did not the IGC include, in the recommendations it adopted last January, giving Europol the power to combat the traffic in human beings?"
"Europol must be able to take active steps to hunt down the criminal networks through the use of specialized information and experience on organized crime, and specifically organized crime as it affects children."
"Thus, the creation of a specific international database on paedophiles and other previously convicted sex offenders could be used to deal with sex tourism and to prevent reoffending."
"Within the framework of the structured dialogue, co-operation and co-ordination in the fields of law enforcement and internal affairs with third countries applying for EU membership must be a priority, but also - and above all - a clear requirement."
"Let us hope, Mr President, that the evil which is now causing such pain to Belgium and revulsion to us all proves to be the long-awaited trigger mechanism that enables us, at last, to say: never again."
"I should add, Mr President, that I would have appreciated it if this House had observed a minute's silence in memory of the victims."
"Mr President, we would like it not to be true."
"We would like to keep quiet about it."
"We would like to see it as, and perhaps we would prefer it to be, just the work of a few isolated madmen."
"The death penalty, associated with the fantasy that this kind of criminal can be eliminated, is no solution."
"Murder is a clear fact."
"What leads to it is complex, and asks us questions at every level of society."
"Let us leave it to the judges, to the psychiatrists, to determine what criminal responsibility is and to ask questions of the world which, whether we like it or not, produces these crimes and these criminals."
"Although the Belgian writer Paul Vandrommes wrote in yesterday's Le Monde that 'the Dutroux case shows that there is no longer any such thing as an organic Belgian society, that no one still believes in justice or in judges, that the State no longer exists' , we should be careful not to stigmatize one country and its population - we should see these murders as a tragic and awful warning of something that could happen in any of our countries."
"We are aware that the Internet enables the paedophile networks to recruit, and to operate with efficiency and with impunity."
"The Internet knows no frontiers."
"There are those, even in this House, who welcome that fact, preaching the gospel of an imaginary and supposedly self-regulating freedom of communication."
"Will we be hearing from them today?"
"This case brings to mind figures which represent an indictment of the ultra-liberal approach, where anything can be bought and where the greatest good is consensus: where there is money, rules cease to exist."
"More than a million children throughout the world, especially in the third world, are victims of the sex trade."
"As far as Europe is concerned, 18 % of sex tourists are German, 12 % British, 6 % French."
"How can we be surprised at the ineffectiveness of international agreements when the Stockholm Conference, despite the importance of its discussions, has refused to take into consideration, in its conclusions, reasons associated with poverty, with North-South relations and with structural adjustment policies?"
"In order at least to enable the existing laws to be applied as best they can, then, we call for the EU to be able to prosecute its nationals who commit sexual offences abroad, for it to take positive steps to narrow the gap between North and South, and for it to give serious thought to ways of penalizing a country which fails to apply the laws designed to protect its children."
"Mr President, our fellow citizens, and more particularly those in my own country of Belgium, have been living through an absolutely traumatic situation since the revelation of the appalling experiences endured by young children and young girls for months on end before their eventual murder, not to mention those cases of which we are still unaware."
"Quite apart from the very deep emotion felt by any human being with any sensitivity at all, it must be said that those same European citizens have difficulty in accepting that such appalling practices and acts can be committed."
"And they are even less willing to admit that this situation is not just the work of a few perverted psychopaths, individuals who are probably exceptional, but is attributable to an organized criminal group whose comings and goings have at no time been monitored - or, of course, impeded - either within the national territory of Belgium or elsewhere."
"Everyone, including all those who have spoken here, has rightly emphasized the courage and dignity of the parents of the young victims, and I endorse what has been said."
"But all this will be no more than a polite formality unless politicians at all levels, both European and national, make up their minds to act."
"First and foremost, the first step is to acknowledge the errors and mistakes of the past."
"All speakers have recognized the lack of a proactive approach to the campaign against the sexual exploitation of children."
"We must remember that, and we must denounce it."
"The lack of resources allocated to the operations of justice in several Member States, especially my own, is clearly intolerable."
"A legal system which has no resources cannot operate effectively."
"Secondly, then, apart from acknowledging our mistakes, we need suggestions."
"I believe it is premature to come up with ready made formulas and answers at this stage."
"But what we can do is enter into a solemn commitment to do everything we can to try to eradicate this sick phenomenon, and especially the exploitation of sexual perversions and sexual misery by criminal networks throughout the world, and in particular in the third world."
"What must be done at national level?"
"I think it is clear that in legal matters, in criminal matters, in social matters and in educational matters the Member States must allocate the resources that are essential for effective action."
"At European level, which is what concerns us here of course, it is essential that action be taken to confront internationally organized crime."
"And I believe that there are a number of specific points that can be highlighted even at this stage with regard to the disappearance of children."
"The need for international co-operation is obvious."
"Mutual information is what is required."
"There must be a specific follow-up to the work done by the Stockholm Congress."
"Finally, and this will be my last point, I believe we should also question the scale of values which is currently prevalent in Europe."
"The quality of a society is measured in terms of the human worth of its members and the importance accorded to human beings in its priority political choices."
"When money, consumerism, the conquest of new markets and the value of the currency in the political arena are dominant values, we should not be surprised at the development of serious social diseases such as those we are discussing today."
"Europe must radically re-examine itself, and give the highest priority to the wellbeing of its citizens, especially the most disadvantaged and the weakest."
"And the weakest include children."
"My fear is that anything we may do to increase penalties and improve the organization of police work, however justified such steps may be, will ultimately prove ineffectual unless we see this kind of change in the system of values."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Radical Alliance I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the parents and families of the girls murdered in my country."
"The things which happened truly defy description."
"The appalling facts came to light just as the world conference was being held in Stockholm on the rights of the child and the sexual exploitation of children."
"On the very eve of the 21st century it seems that anything is possible and that there is a market for everything including children."
"That is the law of supply and demand taken to an obscene extreme."
"We know about the exploitation of children in Asian countries, but in fact we have done very little about it."
"We have, furthermore, put commercial concerns above children's rights."
"We also know about child prostitution, in our own big cities too."
"Ultimately we have done nothing about this either, even though Article K of the Maastricht Treaty now specifically empowers us to."
"If we really want to demonstrate our sympathy we should look for social responses which Europe itself can provide, for example the creation of a register of missing children, more police cooperation across borders and the pooling of experience of policy on prisons and sentencing."
"Children's rights must be placed on our statute books and enforced against third countries too."
"Extraterritorial penalties must be introduced for sexual crimes committed outside our borders."
"The Commission has announced initiatives."
"Not everything needs to be done today, but please let us not wait too long."
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group too is profoundly shocked and moved by the suffering inflicted on innocent children and young women and girls."
"We sympathize deeply with the victims and their families."
"The pictures on television bring us so inescapably face to face with evil and the consequences of evil that none of us can duck our responsibility."
"How could things have got to that point?"
"Politicians and administrators were to a certain degree tolerant and to a very large degree negligent."
"We as Members of the European Parliament now have a duty to change that attitude and do everything it takes to create a safe living environment for our children."
"To do that we need a reassessment of ethical standards."
"People must think again about where the uninhibited gratification of their own needs can lead."
"Restrictions on advertising and the display of pornographic images are doubtless the minimum which is needed."
"A network of international crime has grown up and spread around pornography, including child pornography, prostitution and sex tourism to Asia, and it baulks at nothing."
"I hope that the media revelation of this filth will create a general feeling of revulsion amongst us which endures."
"Let us hope it leads to good international agreements on punishment and extradition."
"The Stockholm conference, by virtue of its content and the publicity it received, gave hope to all those who work to protect our children and grandchildren in Europe."
"This new development came too late for the victims of murder and violence we are mourning today."
"But their sacrifice should not be in vain; let us take up the fight against sexual abuse and killings using all the legal weapons available to us as politicians."
"Mr President, the whole of Europe has, albeit belatedly, realized how widespread the criminal phenomenon of paedophilia is."
"At this point - and not only moved by the emotion felt by us all, but rationally - the European Union must exercise its power to stimulate, urge and spur on in order to induce the Member States to find a single legislative language to prevent and repress this shameful phenomenon which hits the weakest part of society: children."
"We believe that this call by the European Union should be included in the annual report on human rights."
"Now is not the time for debate, Mr President, but for grieving."
"It is a time not for grand speeches but for reflection."
"First of all our thoughts are with the families concerned: the Russo and Lejeune families in Grâce-Hollogne, the Marchal and Lambrecks families in Hasselt and all those families who still have no news of their missing children."
"But we also want to express our respect for the dignity and communal spirit shown by all the families affected."
"People's faith in the rule of law and political power has been dealt a sharp blow."
"People do not understand why the judiciary and the authorities are so powerless in this fight against brutal violence and deeds of the utmost baseness."
"So it is fitting that we should pause to reflect, with suitable humility."
"Not least we in Europe are the focus of attention."
"Because we have here not only the perpetrators of these repellent acts but also a society which is manifestly sick."
"There are children in the third world and here who prostitute themselves in order to eat."
"There are organizations which get rich in all manner of ways from immoral activities."
"We have a society which is so bad at directing its mind and its efforts towards real action to protect the most elementary rights of children and other weak groups in the world."
"We could today talk about Europol which is still not up and running; it has been talked about often enough before."
"We could say that the IGC ought to safeguard the rights of the child."
"We could talk about the lack of legislation to control a medium like the Internet which is used for the most degrading purposes."
"We could talk about the lack of cooperation by the forces of justice in the various Member States."
"But let us not engage in an unprepared and party-political debate."
"Let us today show respect for all the victims here in Belgium and elsewhere too, past and present, in the determination that we shall tomorrow find the strength and resolve to tackle these problems calmly and if possible banish them from the face of the earth."
"Mr President, although it is right to start from the Marcinelle drama in looking at the acts of violence, especially those of a sexual nature, committed against children all over the world, it must nevertheless be recognized that what has happened in Belgium has such unusually serious aspects that it points to a deepseated disease of our society whose roots must be brought to light."
"First aspect: the incredible acts of violence committed at Marcinelle were not the fruit of a sudden bout of madness or horrible passion but the result of a prolonged, lucid premeditation on the part of many people acting together."
"Second aspect: there appears to be a shameful interrelationship between deviant sexuality and money, with a traffic in children and child pornography even at international level."
"Third aspect: these events have occurred in a Europe which considers itself to be highly civilized and is constantly proclaiming human rights and the rights of children."
"The facts therefore call for serious soul-searching: this has already started in Stockholm, with the attention paid to tourism for the purpose of sexual exploitation, but it is necessary to go further."
"I agree with all the proposals put forward and believe that others will come from the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is always committed, together with Parliament, to defending the rights of children, as has already been done with the Charter of Children's Rights and as, we hope, will soon be done with the completion of the two reports on the condition of children in Europe and on international adoption."
"I believe, however, that the Marcinelle episode, which gives us a sinister glimpse of child pornography, also requires us to be consistent and consider pornography in general."
"I do not think that it is enough to combat child pornography: it is necessary to combat pornography in general, also in order to protect children, and, as has in fact been emphasized, the responsibility for this lies with all adults, in the hedonistic climate which now prevails, where pleasure and money are the ultimate criteria of value and behaviour."
"We must ask ourselves what effect such a climate has, firstly on fragile or diseased minds and, secondly, on criminal minds."
"We must therefore ask ourselves if there is not a need for action to restore a healthy environment, requiring, over and above the necessary legal punitive and preventive measures, watchfulness and ethical commitment on the part of all of us."
"Mr President, the basic reason for Parliament's meeting this afternoon is unquestionably to give our closest support to the members of the families of the victims who have suffered right here in Belgium."
"Another fundamental reason for today's discussion is that the Stockholm Conference ended yesterday."
"Many points have been noted concerning the decisions reached during the five conference days in Stockholm, but I would like to emphasize an aspect which has perhaps not been high-lighted; the special character of the Stockholm Conference lies above all in the live testimony of children who have been exploited, who have suffered sexual abuse and violence, in having listened to their spoken evidence, which certainly greatly helped the work of the conference."
"I would like this to serve as an example for the work which this Community institution will carry forward and for all the activities which our Parliament may propose from this point of view."
"Turning to matters more closely connected with the Community institutions, I would like to emphasize again that the Intergovernmental Conference must during the coming months definitely consider the possibility of including in the revised Treaty a chapter containing provisions concerning minors such as those guaranteed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children."
"There must be the prospect of setting up an ad hoc Community fund for monitoring in practice the most outstanding cases of violence against minors."
"The Commission and the Member States must also, as an urgent necessity, take coordinated action to combat the means which paedophiles have at their disposal, with special reference to sexual exploitation through the Internet and through the other resources of technology and telematics."
"There is therefore an absolute need for coordinated action by the Member States and all non-governmental organizations, also working together with organizations such as UNICEF, UNESCO AND UNDP: all together, but only all together, we shall surely be able to cure these grave social and cultural disorders which afflict Europe and the whole world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragic events that we have lived through, we, as Belgians, must clearly and resolutely determine where the responsibilities lie and learn our lessons for the future, and we shall make sure we do so."
"As Members of the European Parliament, of course, we have work to do."
"As has already been said, one particular task is to bring pressure to bear on the Member States to equip themselves with the legislative, material and human resources they need to take effective action against the scourge of paedophilia, and especially to prosecute, in their countries of origin, those European nationals who indulge in acts of paedophilia abroad."
"But in addition, and above all, we have a duty to develop the necessary instruments at European level."
"It should not be too difficult to reach an overall agreement on this."
"For example, we must encourage the co-ordination of existing bodies, such as Europol, and increase their means of action, and we must support those initiatives - often in the form of charities - which help to trace missing children in numerous countries."
"I am also glad to hear the PPE say that it agrees with the proposal for a 'Marc and Corine' non-profit-making organization, which we presented and supported."
"We must also, as Mrs Todini said, incorporate into the Treaty on Union a new article dealing with children's rights and the determination of the European Union to help the Member States combat paedophilia, perfect mechanisms to enable paedophiles to be driven out of the new communication networks, and ensure that negotiations on the accession of new members include requirements designed to ensure that they do not tolerate paedophile acts and paedophile networks."
"Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are united in our speeches and declarations of intent by the recent nature of these events."
"Tomorrow, however, all these promises will have to be given specific form."
"We must never let the fading memory of these events deflect us from our duty, which is to help ensure recognition of the dignity of all children and the safeguarding of their physical and moral safety."
"By doing that, Europe will show that it is more than just an economic and monetary machine, and that it is capable of finding a solution to the problems of society that concern 350 million Europeans."
"Mr President, we are all disturbed when we see these dramatic examples of sexual abuse of minors."
"The emotion and revulsion which recent events and disclosures have aroused have alerted public opinion to an exceptional degree."
"For it is not only acts of direct abuse of children which have been revealed, but toleration of and participation in them by bodies financed by the public to watch over the safety and wellbeing of all."
"My request to my colleagues is that we make use of the door opened by recent events to go fully into the subject of abuse of children, and that we employ all our available resources to bring all such occurrences and the interests they serve clearly and unconditionally to light."
"We cannot forget that much of the abuse takes place within the home, that more girls than boys are subjected to violence, and that in some cases such violence is committed on a large scale in the name of tradition."
"We must give very serious consideration to ways of preventing these crimes."
"If we were merely to increase the penalties, we should in some measure be continuing to disregard the natural rights of boys and girls who are victims of abuse."
"The networks of abduction and prostitution are part of a system serving economic, social and cultural interests."
"Bringing these to light would be a first step towards dismantling them, and it is our duty to do so."
"Mr President, looking beyond the tragedy which has put Belgium in mourning and which concerns us all, we must also consider the growth of this exploitation of children for sexual purposes, with all the crimes, murders, kidnappings and prostitution that follow from it."
"These things must provide food for thought, and prompt us to react."
"First, it would be appropriate to incorporate into the Treaty on Union a genuine charter of children's rights and then ensure compliance with that charter, not just in Europe but elsewhere, too, especially through the agency of Europol."
"Because, as we know, globalization is having perverse effects on the growth of the traffic in children."
"It has allowed the setting-up of nothing less than organized networks of sex tourism in Asia, in South America, and on our own doorsteps, especially in Eastern Europe."
"As for the Internet, we know that it provides an ideal cover for the propagation and encouragement of paedophilia."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, just as it was our duty to have this debate today, so it is also our duty to go ahead with positive action to protect our children and give them back their childhood."
"Mr President, I share the views put forward by other Members, and their feelings too, but there are a few points I would like to add. First, a thought on the information society: is it not absolutely essential that we, as elected politicians, should consult with those responsible for the media on the way in which news stories are covered?"
"I cannot deal with this at length in the time available, but just as it is natural that the events we are discussing should arouse indignation and strong emotions, so we need to consider the possible traumatic effect over the last two weeks on those, including children, who have been watching, seeing and listening to all the media and the way in which these stories are covered."
"It is right that these events should be taken seriously, that the necessary measures should be taken, but I believe that for adults who are disturbed, or who perhaps have disturbed tendencies but will never put them into practice, the type of information provided on stories like these may be such as to give rise subsequently, by chain reaction, to the kind of behaviour we have been seeing."
"Then there is pornography: it is a fact that in the case of Marc Dutroux, and in the case of all those who commit acts of this kind, we always find pornographic material."
"Protection of minors means more than just preventing children from seeing pornographic videos."
"Does it not also mean, more fundamentally, that adults should not have the opportunity of being perverted, over the course of time, by being allowed to view such products? No, pornography really is not a human right."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that Parliament is unanimous in its revulsion at the dreadful deeds which have been done in this country."
"But our grief and our deep sympathy with the families of the children who were abducted and murdered must not obscure the need to ask whether there is equal unanimity within this House and outside it on the need to tackle the real reasons which lay behind these paedophile crimes and made them possible and to destroy the causes of them root and branch."
"I thus put a number of questions to you: are we prepared to stop the crazy permissiveness in our society whereby every possible form of sexual perversion is presented as normal."
"Or is there anyone here who claims not to know that paedophile propaganda is freely available in many of our Member States?"
"Are we prepared to take measures against firms, including big companies such as Benetton or Mexx, which use shocking images often of naked children for the most vulgar purposes of commercial gain?"
"Are we prepared to end that other form of crazy permissiveness whereby the most horrendous criminals are always presented as some kind of victims of society who are automatically entitled to a second and even a third chance?"
"Or are we at last going to say loud and clear that sex killers and child rapists, for example, should never ever be given a second chance."
"Is there anyone who claims not to know that this monstrous killer Dutroux was released from prison in 1992 under an amnesty granted by Belgian minister Whatelet when Dutroux had served less than half of an earlier sentence for child abduction and rape?"
"Is Parliament not aware that this Whatelet has since, in a political appointment, been elevated to the lordly status of a judge at the Court of Justice and is now washing his hands à la Pontius Pilate?"
"No, I have no faith at all in the crocodile tears now being shed by so many supposedly responsible politicians."
"Though I assume their revulsion and disgust today is genuine."
"But if they do not have the courage to take the measures necessary to protect the weakest in our society adequately, I shall regard them as jointly responsible for what has happened and what may yet, I fear, happen again."
"A few months ago the death penalty was abolished in this country."
"A proposal by my party that sentences at least for the worst types of crime should not qualify for remission was dismissed by the other parties as inhumane."
"So even a Dutroux might be free again within a foreseeable time."
"I urge the supposedly responsible politicians who are shedding crocodile tears today to have a good think about this, this evening, before they go to bed."
"Mr President, the events which we are discussing today are just the tip of the iceberg."
"They are not confined merely to Belgium but exist throughout the European Union and much of the developing world."
"We should brace ourselves within the European Union for more revelations of collusion between the police and politicians."
"As the tragedy of abduction and murders of innocent young children continues to unfold here in Belgium and elsewhere, there is no-one who cannot be other than deeply moved, disturbed and angry at what has been happening."
"There is a great danger that the European Union institutions will respond in a piecemeal manner to these appalling issues of violence towards children."
"There is a need for the European institutions to act coherently and to give the 120 million children living in the European Union the protection they deserve and have a right to expect, which is full recognition of children as citizens of the European Union and nothing less."
"Last July, before the present tragedy came to light I urged Parliament in Strasbourg to hold a full and open discussion on violence against children in the autumn."
"I am glad that we will now have a further opportunity to deal with this in the September plenary session, on the basis of a UPE Group oral question."
"I repeat my specific request to the Irish presidency in July to prioritize the inclusion of a chapter in the Treaty containing provisions relating to the human rights of minors so that they would be entitled in the same way as any other citizen to enjoy fully the fundamental rights, freedoms and protection recognised by the Community, barring those restrictions, of course, laid down by the law specifically for children."
"Anyone or any Government who objects to this now will have some serious questions to answer to the European citizen."
"The rights of children as European citizens must be fully safeguarded."
"In July I called for a crusade for children; now more than ever such a crusade is imperative."
"I also referred to the misuse of technology, such as the Internet by paedophiles."
"An European Union initiative is urgently required in this respect."
"The Irish President-in-Office, Gay Mitchell, in response to my suggestion, said that proposals coming from Parliament to this effect would be welcomed by the presidency."
"I urge the Commission to be equally positive and to let us know today if they will support an IGC inclusion of children in treaties and an European Union initiative on Internet, to prevent the dissemination of paedophile information."
"Mr President, today we are talking about child abuse against the background of a particularly tragic and odious event so horrible that it is beyond the power of words to condemn."
"I concur with what has been said by my colleagues, but I want to say quite clearly that it would be hypocritical to confine ourselves to moral condemnation: hypocritical and too late."
"The Stockholm Conference has provided chilling and terrible data."
"To quote just one example: every year, all over the world, one million children under the age of twelve are led into prostitution."
"It seems incredible: one million children under twelve years of age!"
"Faced with these figures we cannot confine ourselves to talking about moral questions or pornographic cassettes."
"I agree with all the proposals, including those made by the Commissioner - concerning the Internet, pornography, etc. but we know, all of us in Europe know, that this is not enough."
"We must also discuss and take action on the major economic interests on which this exploitation of children is based."
"Not only that: also of the connivance of institutions and even governments of the countries which accommodate so-called 'sex tourism' ."
"I believe that Europe must equip itself to act immediately from both angles: to attack those who practice, who develop, ' sex tourism' , which is a matter of policing and police cooperation, but also - and Europe can do it - to attack strongly the economies of the countries which thrive on the exploitation of children, and, I repeat, of children below the age of twelve."
"It is beyond belief!"
"The debate is closed."
"Public services"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on public services."
"I call Mr Van Miert."
"Mr Van Miert, we very much hope you have not lost any of your punch!"
"First of all, Mr President, I welcome what the Commissioner has said."
"I think it is what we wanted to hear."
"I should like to ask him when this communication will be forthcoming."
"Because there are a whole lot of expectations at the moment and we shall then be able to have a proper debate on them."
"Secondly, and the previous speaker rather lost sight of this, we are of course concerned not only with the system."
"We are concerned not only with government, but with the consumer as well."
"That is an important point which we should bear in mind here."
"Thirdly, our view of the subject is becoming less and less clear-cut."
"We have a number of government monopolies which work badly."
"In recent years we have seen a number of privatizations succeeding very well, but a number of others leading to private monopolies, and that again is not good for the consumer."
"So things are somewhat ambivalent."
"Our Group agreed to a Treaty amendment, precisely in order to make a rather more positive point on the question of public services. The Commissioner ended with something similar."
"The current wording of the Treaty is fairly negative."
"Each country is given the right to take its own decisions, but we have a single European market and so it is not really possible any longer for each country to reach decisions in isolation without that having repercussions, so perhaps the wording of the revised Treaty or the communication which the Commissioner has announced might provide something rather more positive than we have at present."
"Not that we want to depart radically from the system but a rather more positive wording may perhaps be better especially in view of what the Commissioner said in conclusion."
"Lastly, there is one thing which is of major importance, precisely because the market is becoming more and more 'single' in the area of public services too, and that is the social dialogue."
"It is difficult to tackle the area of public services properly when there are so many different employers, but that is the only way of reconciling the different interests which are sometimes so much at variance with one another."
"It is an important point and I should like to ask the Commissioner if he proposes to take account of it in his communication."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what I am going to say may seem harsh, but keeping a debate like this on the agenda seems to me to be eccentric, not to say irresponsible."
"After all, how can we hold a serious discussion with the Commission on a subject regarding which it has still not sent us a communication which was initially scheduled for June 1996?"
"The Commission's delay, deplorable though it is, is not a disaster in itself."
"All that was necessary was to schedule this debate for a later time."
"By accepting this debate under these conditions, and on a subject so crucial for our fellow citizens, this House is making itself ridiculous."
"Consequently, since we cannot debate the Commission's ambitions and have no basic data on them, I will settle for recalling a few principles to which my group adheres."
"They are three in number."
"The first is to preserve solidarity among our citizens."
"That solidarity is based on five major planks: equality of individuals, the security of individuals, aid for the most underprivileged, social cohesion and regional development."
"The values of equality and solidarity may sometimes seem to be jeopardized by technological change and the primacy too often given to competition within an ultra-liberal system."
"It is up to us to regulate that system."
"This brings us to the second principle of the proper administration of the public services."
"Let us accept the idea of competition for public enterprises associated with the competitive sector."
"It is essential for some public sector activities, in order to prevent hardening of the arteries affecting whole sections of the economy, and in order to strengthen their competitiveness."
"But let us not go too far along these lines; let us organize the competition on a transparent basis."
"The third principle comprises guaranteeing the States freedom of choice."
"The keystone - I almost said the safety valve - of European intent in the field of public services, is a consistent application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"To make my point, let me take the example of France, where the very essence of the republican pact, the symbol of its own existence, lies in its public service structures."
"Without ruling out the changes necessary to adapt to modern realities, it will be impossible for the French Republic to sacrifice its own public services, services desired by its citizens."
"I am not talking about imposing French values on other states but about allowing those states which wish to do so, by virtue of subsidiarity, to preserve their social models while nevertheless respecting Community law."
"Although I regard it as essential to continue adapting and modernizing the public service, it is important to confirm its existence in Community law. The revision of the Treaty must give us the opportunity to do that."
"It should provide an opportunity for an amendment to Article 90, to ensure that the Commission, when it comes to competition in the public sector, exercises only a supervisory power which rules out the possibility of taking unilateral decisions."
"Mr President, with the Commissioner's permission I shall speak in my own language."
"It will of course be nice to have the Commission's communication, but I am not exactly happy at the way in which the Commissioner is showing his political colours here."
"Rarely have I heard a more blatant misuse of Article 222, because ultimately, and the Commissioner knows it, Article 90 takes precedence over Article 222 and more importantly still, Article 90 makes explicit reference to Articles 85 and 86 for which this Commissioner has responsibility."
"And what does the Commission do?"
"It constantly flouts its own principles."
"Parliament is not altogether without blame either, of course."
"Indeed, Mr Fayot rightly points to the disgraceful way in which the Commission's proposals on postal services were buried here."
"Really, this is a good example of how political determination and a state monopoly can block a true public service."
"We have seen that where services are privatized, for example in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, it is possible to make the post office profitable too and to provide the whole population with a good service."
"In short, what is the left side of the House ultimately after?"
"Power for the trade unions and the ability to play politics with jobs at the taxpayer's expense?"
"That is not what the universal service or the public service are about."
"Who is to say, Commissioner, that social benefits cannot be provided just as well by private insurance?"
"In general it appears that health cover provided by private insurers gives a better service than the state system."
"Look at the United Kingdom's National Health Service."
"A total disaster!"
"I thus look forward eagerly to the Commission's communication and I should like to start this debate afresh with a number of questions."
"Which services does the Commission deem essential?"
"To what extent should government resources be made available to private concession holders, for universal service, and the most important question, Mr President, which services really are essential to the citizen?"
"Mr President, the Commission statement on public services had raised a certain expectation."
"But why did we still have a statement when there was no document ready - even if it will soon be ready?"
"Why we still have a debate, without a document and without a basic text?"
"All that remains for us to debate are the general drift of a guideline."
"But we all know what that is already."
"We must state out our disagreement and highlight the importance of this subject, one that can not be discussed too often, even in these general lines, although we should take care not to over-discuss it and therefore to remove its value."
"In our opinion, any declaration of principle should assert the concept of public service and the fact that it is always relevant, even in the etymological sense."
"At the same time we should avoid this discussion appearing to be a smoke-screen, hiding the fact that market forces are destroying public services and doing away with 'public service' as an operative concept."
"We are going through a period of history, albeit a fleeting one, like them all, in which commercialisation is being taken to an absurd extreme, leaving no room for activities which cannot be boiled down to an evaluation according to economic or competitiveness criteria, in which many activities are considered unviable even though many of them are vital and can only be provided as a public service."
"In the so-called 'European Construction' we think that the concept of public service should be dealt with, not just as statements of principles, by means of their careful assessment of developments, in wariness of changes to names such as 'universal service' , and, in particular, by moderating practices and trends which see privatisation as a panacea for economic ills, as if all social ills were done away with by a properly working economy, and forgetting the fact that the purpose of the economy should be the rational organisation or use of resources in order to meet satisfy social needs."
"Given that we are in that historical period, in its statement, with or without a document, the Commission should have said what it intends to do to contribute to ways of making technical innovation, such as the information super highways, compatible with operations and a vital concept such as that of public service."
"Mr President, I would like to remind Members of this House that we actually asked for this statement."
"It is not the Commission who is insisting on it."
"We asked for it because we believe that we are able to think for ourselves about what we want from public services within the European Union."
"We are hoping, thereby, to have an influence on what comes out of the Commission."
"So as some Members here seem to be confused about that, I thought it was important to stress that we asked for the statement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, indeed our understanding of democracy is that this House should consider matters and then put them to the Commission in the expectation that the Commission will indeed listen very carefully and draw the appropriate conclusions."
"That is of course a problem, against the background of the debate on the postal services and the resolutions we had drafted on them, to which we received no very clear response in the Commission's further deliberations."
"But I hope things will improve this time."
"We must realise that in view of the forthcoming, very far-reaching changes in our economy and our societies the production of public goods really must be established as an independent task and that we must counteract what I might call the neo-liberal frenzy to turn everything that can promote private wealth into goods."
"This must not just be an exceptional clause or a residual category, as it currently is in the Treaty."
"In that respect, the European Treaty really does need to be amended."
"The charter for the European public services really must be taken seriously in it."
"But this question also deserves serious consideration in the chapter on employment."
"A universal service would indeed not suffice."
"A universal service is what one might call a residual category, which may be sensible in some areas that are in a sense situated between the private economy and the public sector, but is not so in the key areas of the public services where the issue really is the production of public goods and where we do indeed need to renovate."
"Of course we cannot continue with the kind of centralized state monopolies that exist in some areas and which do in fact belong to the past."
"But nor do we want to replace them with worldwide or transnational private monopolies or prepare the market for such private monopolies."
"As even Mr Bangemann has said on occasion, that is indeed the real danger in some central areas."
"So we must make it clear that our Parliament has definite ideas about the real tasks of the public services - I have described this in the abstract and cannot go into details here."
"Specific targets must be set here."
"The responsibility for these tasks should lie with operators and regulators of all possible kinds, with the necessary degree of democracy and variety."
"People must realise that the public services have to carry out a whole range of official or governmental tasks, including those relating to the third sector of the social economy, that they have to look seriously at the major tasks of our time - environmental reform, feminization and popular attitudes - and make real progress in these areas."
"Then the public services can become an important factor in the construction of a meaningful Europe that is also accepted by all the Member States."
"Mr President, for a long time, despite the Commissioner's optimistic suggestions, very little has been said about public services in the Community."
"Today, something is being said, and above all more and more should be said."
"But we must not approach this question from a purely technical, legalistic standpoint."
"Admittedly, there are many questions about the activities which need to be set up in the public service sector when the market is incapable of supplying the appropriate services."
"There are also many questions about the way in which the public services should be organized - with or without a monopoly, for example - and about the rules which should be applied to them, the user system to be applied, the personnel regulations, etc."
"But leaving aside these technical or legal questions, a political choice arises - a choice of the way in which we conceive society and the role of the European Union."
"Following the logic of the Treaty of Rome, reinforced by the dominant ideas of the last fifteen years, competition, the market and economic liberalism were the key words of Community policy."
"We are not against the market, or against competition."
"They can open the way to dynamism and competitive spirit, ultimately resulting in lower prices and better quality products and services."
"What we are against is a Europe which would have only a single aim: a single market based on competition alone."
"Europe must have other objectives too."
"The crisis of confidence which is eroding the unity of Europe and jeopardizing the future of the Union has much to do with the impression people have of dealing with an inhuman machine concerned only with economic and financial profitability, and abandoning people to their fate."
"We need to construct a Europe which is in the common interest, and which is concerned with eliminating inequality - not only inequality between individuals but also inequality between the various parts of a territory."
"The public services may provide one way of eliminating these inequalities, because they have the specific purpose of supplying a service to everyone under conditions of maximum accessibility, whereas the market is interested primarily in what is profitable."
"Some will point out that, in many countries, the public services have functioned badly or been badly administered."
"In those cases, obviously, reforms are needed."
"Furthermore, there are also cases where the course of events shows that there is no longer any reason to make a public service out of what has become a commonplace and everyday activity."
"In these cases, privatization is the better option."
"But that still leaves a great many cases - especially though not exclusively in the vast arena of social services - where the initiative and supervision of the public authority are essential."
"Total privatization, then, a complete break with the State and the local authorities, is not a step forward but a step back."
"There are recent examples, some of them tragic, to prove as much."
"The European Union needs to understand this, Commissioner, and to devise - on the occasion of the IGC, for example - a European concept of public service which is not reduced to this very minimalist notion of a universal service of which we hear so much nowadays."
"The Union, and especially the Community, must have a policy based both on competition and on the public interest."
"The Union, too, must itself have public services which are genuinely European."
"We shall have occasion to talk of this again, Commissioner, on the basis of the work to be done under your supervision."
"Mr President, the Commission's statement on public services, to which we have just been listening, is anything but reassuring."
"Admittedly, we have noted the fact that, recently, the idea of public service has finally been recognized both by case law and in some of the practices of the Community institutions."
"However, these positive changes have to be seen in the context of a broader trend which still gives much cause for concern."
"The fact is that if the Community institutions, until very recently, had no doctrine of public service, the reason was that it was very generally and spontaneously felt that this area, in a spirit of healthy subsidiarity, was a matter for the Member States."
"Today, however, we are seeing constant pressure by the Commission, based on the rules of competition contained in the Treaty, to usurp the prerogative of the Member States by defining what the limit of the public service sector should be, in other words what its nature should be and what the instruments should be that can be used by the nation states for the benefit of their citizens."
"Worse still, an attempt is being made to provide standardized definitions, on the pretext of creating fair competition, whereas the fact is, of course, that national situations and national intentions differ greatly from this point."
"There are at least two reasons why we cannot accept this approach as it stands."
"First, while it is true that the Treaty makes very little mention of the public services, such mention being largely confined to Article 92(2), where services of a general economic interest are mentioned in passing as an exception to the rules of competition, the reason is that it was quite naturally felt at the time that such activities were not a matter for the powers of the Community."
"As far as I know, no subsequent treaty ratified by the nations of Europe has reversed this position."
"In any case, and this is my second reason, that position is entirely justified since the national public services are the instruments available to the Member States to enable them to apply the policies democratically decided upon by their populations."
"To abolish the freedom of nations to define their public services would help to diminish the States, and eventually even to cause their disappearance, a policy so crazy that I doubt whether anyone here would support it."
"In these circumstances, although we do not intend to challenge the idea of European consultation on these matters, we would like the Intergovernmental Conference to state very clearly that each sovereign nation is free to define the limits of its public service, exactly as the Treaty envisages, and that each is free to define the limits of public ownership of undertakings."
"For us, the issue is not to try to remove these sectors from any form of competition, because in any case, as things stand, the States themselves are subject to global competition and can no longer do anything they like."
"There are also many of us, myself included, who think that it is in the public interest that private sector methods should always be preferred when possible, and that the public services should always incorporate such methods as far as possible."
"But what we want most of all here, and what we are going to emphasize in this debate, is the enduring preservation of the conditions of sovereignty of the nations of Europe."
"That means, of course, that unanimity must be required within the Council whenever the question of competition affects the public service."
"At the same time, the power to regulate competition should be removed from the Commission and handed over to a separate agency, in order to separate technique from policy and ensure that those powers cannot be used in the future, in an underhand manner, for the purposes of constructing a superstate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are here to take part in a dialogue between Parliament and the Commission, and so I am going to start by telling you the points on which we agree with you - points on which, although it would be an exaggeration to speak of two minds with but a single thought, we can at least speak of two minds with fairly similar thoughts."
"Like you, we naturally believe that general interest services are necessary in order to promote the so-called European social model."
"Like you, too, we believe that the debate on the form of organization and legal nature of those public services is an obsolete debate."
"After all, our national cultures and histories contain roots that grow into particular forms of legal natures of public services, and that is as it should be."
"Thirdly, we agree with you when you say that, like all European undertakings, the public services have to face up to technological change and the requirements for completing the single market."
"And finally, we share your belief in modern, efficient, dynamic public services which will be the key elements in the European economic development of tomorrow."
"Having heard you speak, however, I believe that you are to some extent the incarnation of the principle whereby the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"To put it another way, the Commission's left hand is all too often unaware of what its right hand is doing, as we can see from the way in which you approach telecommunications, but also, and especially, the way in which you approach the risks that threaten the postal service and other public services."
"So why is there this discrepancy between the Commission's undoubted intentions and its actions?"
"Since we cannot reasonably accuse you, of all people, of political schizophrenia, there must be a number of objective reasons for this situation."
"What are they?"
"First, listening carefully to what you have to say, I note that we are not in complete agreement on the scope of application of the public service."
"First, of course, there is the concept of universal service."
"Other Members have already said how restrictive we find that concept."
"But there is also the fact that the public service is more than just a service for the consumer or a selection of approaches to regional planning - it is also an essential factor in environmental protection, an essential factor in economic and social cohesion, an essential factor in employment policy."
"That factor is absent from your statement, and I assume that it will be equally absent - though you still have time to correct it - from the Commission's communication."
"Secondly, we are aware of the fact that making a distinction today between the market economy on the one hand and the public service economy on the other is to make an illusory distinction."
"More and more sectors which, traditionally, were the preserve of the public service are now subjected, rightly or wrongly, like it or not, to the constraints of the market economy."
"Hence, it is necessary for us, much more necessary than it was twenty or twenty-five years ago, to make a distinction within these economic activities between something which can be regulated by competition in the interests of the citizen and something which needs to be protected from the upheavals and excesses of competition."
"And that distinction is one the Commission is not making."
"The Commission believes that everything, if possible, should be regulated by competition. You credit competition with virtues it does not have, and indeed never did have, but by doing so you are reducing activities which are pure matters of public interest to extremely marginal ones, as witness your interpretation of universal service in, for example, the telecommunications sector."
"This is clearly an aberration, where you are becoming involved in a way of thinking which credits competition with regulatory virtues that it does not in fact have."
"On the other hand, you have also defended the conviction that modernization and organization could only be achieved by way of competition, as if only undertakings in the competitive sector were capable of modernizing, of being at the leading edge of technology."
"That is indeed the case with a number of undertakings, but we can quote just as many examples where undertakings in the monopolistic public sector achieve extremely high levels of technological and economic performance."
"To summarize our viewpoint, then, you are clearly underestimating the scope of application of the public interest, seriously underestimating the social cost of regulation through competition, and at the same time clearly overvaluing the role of this competition as a factor in modernization and progress."
"Our view is that the Treaty provides an insufficient defence to this."
"So the Treaty will have to be amended, as others have said and more will say in due course."
"As to finance, your proposals on this are entirely inadequate."
"If we go no further than what is authorized by the Commission at present, we are leading public service straight down the road to privatization, contrary to the intentions of those who compiled the Treaty of Rome in 1957."
"Finally, as far as competition is concerned, we say that although you, Commissioner, are indeed the guardian of competition and of the Treaty, you must also realize that in addition to the Treaty you are the guardian of something else, something more precious - the European social model desired by the authors of the Treaty of Rome. It is from that role, as guardian of the social model, that you derive your legitimation."
"Never forget that."
"Mr President, public services exist for the public."
"As long as you agree with that, we shall agree with you."
"But they cannot be, as they often are, the exclusive preserve of a self-elected technocracy, a syndicate of civil servants or, worse still, the coalition of political parties."
"Ask all the users of the Belgium telephone system to compare their situation with that of consumers in countries where more has been done to break the monopoly of the telephone service, and you will see what differences exist in terms of service and price, and how repairs are taken into consideration."
"Then let everyone make a choice, and we shall see which of the two is right."
"As far as I am concerned, personally, I entirely support Mr Van Miert's argument, and I am delighted by it."
"No one can deny Mr Van Miert's socialist and social convictions, and that is why I am in complete agreement with him."
"I would also call the attention of all our socialist friends to what was said by Mr Berthu, because Mr Berthu said exactly the same thing as you on certain points."
"The Commission must be deprived of the powers it has in this area."
"But in order to do something quite different: to give the States the power to do, once again, whatever they want, to the detriment of the citizen and the benefit of the national technocracy."
"That is Mr Berthu's argument."
"So what I say is, handle with care."
"And, Mr Van Miert, I would call your attention to this: you said the Commission was very receptive to discussions regarding amendments to the Treaty on this subject."
"Remember that."
"Everything I have heard so far, both from the German Federal Government, which considers itself highly federalistic, and from other governments is aimed at depriving the Commission of the powers it holds."
"And I would hope at least to find, in this Parliament, a majority willing to support the Commission on that point."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate today on public services."
"I want to begin by placing emphasis on the question of employment policy, in particular to focus on traded public services - as distinct from the public service in general - and the way in which in employment policy terms they are critical to the creation of sustainable jobs in the Union."
"Those working in public enterprises are the concern of many colleagues here."
"But those working in general and the capacity of those out of work to get a sustainable job are in part tied up with this question because telecoms, energy, transport, and post are all essential cost structures within the private sector, for which the traded public service sector is critically important in efficiency terms."
"If we truly believe in job creation, and I know in this House there is a great commitment to that as a policy objective, public service protectionism, as distinct from a public service ethic, must play no part in our policy package."
"On competition policy, the Liberal Group believes the public service providers must continue to be subject to competition policy through Article 90."
"This article should not be changed or watered down into a Trojan horse to halt or hold back the process of the completion of the internal market."
"This will remain so whether public service providers are in the public or private sector."
"From the point of view of consumers, the Liberal Group believes, subject to the observations I have already made, that consumers should be assured of quality and accessibility of public services and we respect and commend the principle of universality."
"When we come to growth, job creation and sustainable jobs, then cost efficiency, high quality and accessible traded public services are at the core of that enterprise."
"Anything less would be damaging to the public interest and no less damaging to the ultimate sustainability of a proper public service capacity within the Union."
"Mr President, I very much welcome Mr van Miert's remarks and his positive, vigorous approach to the subject of public services in the Union."
"His remarks, in my opinion, have given us a flavour of what we may expect in the forthcoming Commission paper."
"All of us here today have said so far that we recognize that public services, like many other European economic sectors, are undergoing and will continue to undergo, structural change as the European economy integrates and as technological change continues to advance."
"In addition, we have to confess that we have all also seen demands for change in the public service brought about by failures and dysfunctions in that sector, for a variety of reasons. With a situation that is so variable, with great plurality and differences in services across the Union, I find it very difficult to understand why the Commission is seeking one simple solution to the current problems of public service."
"The solution it proposes, namely liberalization and privatization of services and the introduction of market mechanisms into those sectors, is one of which there has been some experience in some countries in this Union already. I have to tell you, on the basis of that experience, that I would not guarantee that it would produce better, more efficient or cheaper public services."
"All too often it has produced no services, it has produced a worse service or it has produced a paid-for service that is no longer a public service, no longer comprehensive or affordable and often privately-owned and usually profit-motivated."
"We have to recognise that there are public services within the Union that are of general interest and cannot simply be subject to liberalization and privatization but instead must be made available as public services for the public good."
"This can only be achieved if we accept and recognise this fact by making a change in the Treaty on which the functioning of this Union is based."
"There are a variety of ways in which it can be done, either changing articles, like Article 90 or Article 3, or by new additions."
"However it is done it must be a concrete expression of our belief that public services have an important role to play in a dynamic, wealth-creating European economy that creates jobs and facilitates the efficient operation of the economy but also underpins social justice and creates solidarity."
"If these are the objectives of the Commission communication when presented to this House, it will be welcomed, if not we must take up serious arguments against the Commission."
"Mr President, the fact that we are holding a special plenary debate today on the question of the public service shows that things have moved on."
"In 1958, the problem would not have been seen in the same light."
"Today, the rigorous and successful application of the principles of free competition enshrined in the Treaty of Rome compels us to consider the question of balance between the laws of competition and those of public service."
"Clearly, openness and liberalization are not the only, or always the best, stimulus for the interests of the consumers, who are citizens first and foremost."
"Everyone concedes that public service is an integral part of the European social model, a constituent element of the economic and social cohesion of Europe."
"Well, if we agree on that, we must also agree on including the public service in the Tables of the Law of the European Union."
"Last year, in our resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference, this Parliament called for the Treaty of Rome to be amended to incorporate the public service."
"A Commission communication is all very well, but it has no binding force."
"Well, the IGC is the ideal opportunity to obtain a more balanced deal on three points."
"The public service must be incorporated into the actual text of the Treaty of Rome."
"The relevant proposals for amending Article 90, in particular, are on the table."
"This incorporation must go hand in hand with a public service charter defining the organizational and financial arrangements and enabling the public service to become a tool of the European Union's industrial policy, competitiveness and regional planning."
"These first two points are inextricably linked, as far as I am concerned, because the public service charter must be based on the legal force of the Treaty."
"Finally, a public service observatory must be able to be set up, to ensure the adaptability of the public service and to ensure that, over and above mere user committees or consumer committees, the citizens participate in the public service market."
"This is a test case."
"Alongside the Commission's communication, today, the process of opening up, sector by sector, is too often reflected by massive job losses, increasing the scepticism of Europe's citizens regarding a wonderful collective adventure which is already too frequently perceived as being the root of all evil."
"Let us be on our guard against transforming Europe into a machine for destroying jobs, and let us be sure to take the opportunity offered by the Intergovernmental Conference to prove that Europe is uniting for the benefit of its citizens and in the public interest."
"I should like to say, Commissioner, that we are delighted at the idea that you might be in favour of European public services. So are we."
"But we are also convinced that the Commission is wrong to reject, in particular, the European Parliament's amendments regarding the postal sector."
"Our conviction is that you should propose an amendment to the Treaty of Rome in order to incorporate the public service."
"Mr President, I too welcome the opportunity to have this debate with the Commissioner."
"I want to ask one question, at the beginning: will public service broadcasting be included in your communication, Commissioner?"
"In this age of increasing unemployment and social confusion, public services, as many in my Group have said, constitute a basic common structure binding society together."
"This is all the more the case for public service broadcasting which is so crucial to our democracy."
"It is basically essential for the preservation of our political freedoms that citizens receive the full range of information, debate and expression that allows them democratic participation in our society."
"I would maintain that only independent public service broadcasters can fulfil this role."
"Broadcasting, like other public services, is however a hybrid; the market has a role but the market can also be, and is, flawed."
"Governments at a national and European level cannot abdicate their responsibility for ensuring that all citizens receive independent, impartial news and information, as well as the full range of programmes, from distance learning to high-calibre drama, that our democracy demands."
"Yet, Commissioner van Miert is confronted at this very moment with a whole range of legal complaints against the very nature of public service broadcasting."
"What does he have at his disposal to make a judgment?"
"Competition rules pure and simple."
"It is not good enough that rulings about broadcasting should be based exclusively on exceptions to competition rules and internal market policy."
"We need a new basis and, as many have said, that means changes to the Treaties, be it Article 2, Article 90 or indeed any of the articles on citizens' rights."
"This would allow positive policy proposals on public service."
"For example, in the domain which I have mentioned why not a proposal for a European BBC - please excuse momentarily the chauvinism."
"Citizens need to know that Europe is not a simple free market."
"Citizens want and deserve a commitment to public service, enshrined clearly in Europe's constitution."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to all speakers, although I had the feeling that I have only one unconditional supporter, Mr Herman, and I must say a special word of thanks to him, because I was beginning to feel rather lonely."
"Having said that, I can confirm, since some of you again asked the question, that in normal circumstances the Commission will adopt its communication next week, but of course the debate will continue."
"I assume that Parliament will produce a report, that there will be discussions in committee, etc. so the process will go on."
"The Commission, for its part, regards this document as a contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference, and will consider the time at which its nature should be determined."
"I, personally, have quite often talked in terms of a charter."
"I do not know whether the Commission will adopt that idea."
"Again, we may discuss other alternatives."
"We shall see in due course what form this type of communication will take."
"To ensure that there is also no misunderstanding, Mr Herman, regarding the amendments to the Treaty, I recalled the Commission's position regarding Article 90, and the open-mindedness of the Commissioners, who are holding discussions - the final outcome of which I cannot at present predetermine - with a view to determining how much reason there is to amend particular articles."
"That debate is continuing."
"I am cautious, as you will have seen, but you are right to feel that I am indicating a spirit of open-mindedness in this respect."
"Next, I would like to clarify the situation between us."
"We are talking about the powers of the European Union and of the Commission, not about social security."
"But it must also be said that, in a communication of this kind, we are not acting at that level."
"And, Mr Wijsenbeek, you may have your ideas on this, and I have mine, and I am telling you mine because I am talking outside the framework of the Commission communication."
"I am against the privatization of social security, clearly, because it is the very heart of solidarity within a society."
"I am entitled to hold this opinion, but that is not what we are discussing here."
"We are discussing public services and universal services - call them what you like - within the framework of Community competencies."
"And we should stick to that."
"Then there is Article 222."
"Some speakers have referred to that article, especially Mr Wijsenbeek."
"The Commission has to remain neutral on this."
"That, Carole, explains why the Commission cannot become involved in the internal deliberations of the Member States to determine whether a public or private channel should be retained."
"Here again, my personal position is that I hope the BBC in the United Kingdom will remain as it is."
"I am a devoted supporter of the BBC and the quality it offers."
"But the Commission cannot intervene in the United Kingdom's internal policy on this, or impose any solution, one way or the other."
"On the other hand - and we have proved it, because too often, as I said before, your Parliament does not know what we have done - take the case of the broadcasting rights to major events."
"The Commission, on the basis of Article 90 - please note - found that a form of cooperation existed which, in reality, was a cartel set up among public broadcasting channels, together with one private channel, TF1, which had combined to purchase the rights."
"We felt, taking the concept of public interest as our basis, that we could accept that."
"Thereupon, other channels lodged complaints and the Court, unfortunately, held that we were wrong."
"We shall be taking further action here, because I believe we should stand by that policy, making corrections to a number of things, but there are still good reasons for maintaining that policy."
"Well, you can see that the Commission, specifically, is indeed incorporating these ideas in its policy."
"And it would be unfair, would it not, to make accusations against the Commission regarding this."
"We will have many opportunities to discuss this again, because there are many problems."
"I receive dozens of complaints in this area, private channels against public channels, regarding State aid, etc. There is no end to it!"
"So we shall often be returning to the subject."
"As regards the universal service, ladies and gentlemen, here again a distinction has to be made."
"I could give you at least ten examples of public service monopolies which nevertheless do not provide a universal service."
"It was necessary to wait for months to have a telephone installed, as Mr Herman said."
"Is that a universal service?"
"No, our idea of universal service is to provide people with a rapid response and good quality at affordable prices, something that was not always guaranteed by the public institutions."
"Let us recognize that fact."
"That is the reality of the situation."
"So let us make a distinction."
"Many of you have also drawn attention to another point."
"Today, the consumer has a say in things."
"He no longer accepts a situation where a ruling class - which is often what it amounts to - makes decisions for him and he has no say in it."
"That is the real situation."
"Things have changed, and the Commission is trying to incorporate that change into its policy."
"The idea is to provide the public with a maximum of service, and if competition enables us to do that, then I am in favour of it."
"Because today, at last, you can opt to have a portable telephone, whereas in the past you could not."
"And did people have access to that technology?"
"No, because they were unable to pay for it."
"That was the way things were."
"Competition does in fact ensure that far more people get a better service at more affordable prices."
"But I am not in favour of competition at all costs, because one can have too much of a good thing."
"I could give you examples."
"Even so, demonizing competition, as some of you are doing, is really no way to serve the public."
"(Applause) There are many areas in which a little more competition would be in the public interest."
"Let me give you another example, since somebody referred to transport."
"In twenty years, freight transport, the carriage of goods, has lost half of its market share, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it doesn't work very well."
"Are you going to retain that system?"
"Or are you going to change it so as to try to move more goods by rail than by road?"
"Please, have the courage to face up to this debate, not just to retain structures as they are but also to change things, trying to institute a genuine transport policy on this."
"These are the questions which arise."
"It is important to remember that."
"In conclusion, I can say that I do share some of your concerns."
"There is one thing worse than a public monopoly, and that is a private monopoly."
"But, here again, you should recognize that the Commission does attack that, by avoiding the creation of dominant situations through its merger policy. That applies in your country too, Mr Wijsenbeek, because when the private channels pool their resources to try to dominate the market, we step in."
"Is that such a bad policy on the part of the Commission?"
"Let us at least be honest with each other."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Annual report on the structural funds 1994"
"The next item is the report (A4-0211/96) by Mr Teverson, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Sixth Annual Report on the Structural Funds 1994 (COM(95)0583 - C4-0009/96)."
"Mr President, the structural funds report is specifically about 1994 but it is the first year of a six-year programme up to the year 1999 and it is an Ecu 141bn programme over that time, accounting for some 30 % of the European Union's budget."
"For that reason, I have produced more a strategic report than one that just looks at 1994 in isolation, given that 1994 is now ancient history as far as many people here are concerned."
"I want to make it clear that although this report is critical of a number of things, it is not specifically critical of the European Commission."
"In fact, there are many good points that come out in this report: the fact that there is relatively little fraud in structural funding; that the new single programming document has worked successfully; and that there are a large number of successful programmes that have rolled-out in the regions of the Union."
"The bad characters are more the Member States themselves, and the European institutions together have caused a number of strategic problems in this area."
"Perhaps I could go through those and then come on to some of the solutions that I would put forward before the Commissioner here in this Chamber."
"Going back to 1992-1993 and the setting up of these funds, they were characterized particularly by secrecy; the usual secrecy of the Council of Ministers, the fudging of the budget process, and that included this body the European Parliament."
"But generally Parliament was excluded from the whole process of setting up regional funding."
"When we are talking about a large proportion of European expenditure that is entirely unacceptable."
"Secondly, when trying to find what the structural funds were trying to achieve I was unable to find targets anywhere for this expenditure."
"As a result, it is almost impossible to assess their success or their value."
"I see this as a major flaw in the whole programme."
"Thirdly, complexity."
"As an MEP advising my own constituents I find it sometimes very difficult to give them details about particular European funds they should go for."
"We have many directorate-generals involved, three different funds, six different objectives and a number of programmes that go from Community initiatives to Article 7 and Article 10 through to the main structural funding itself."
"It is not understandable and if we tried to invent something that was specifically supposed to be complex and difficult to understand for our citizens, then we would have something here."
"That is unacceptable."
"One of the other things that particularly struck me was that although this is a European programme, and accounts for such a large proportion of the budget, there is very little of it that is actually trans-national."
"It is actually 15 different national programmes."
"Apart from perhaps Article 10 and 7 areas, and to a small degree the Community initiatives, we lack and we miss the many synergistic benefits that are available from trans-national cooperation and building up the regions of Europe."
"Structural funding does not allow that."
"It will never be a fully European programme, it will always largely be nationally oriented but we take this too far."
"I am depressed by the fact that in terms of tracking payments there is some jubilation in the report that perhaps 75 % of the budgeted payments actually went through during the year."
"Well 75 % is not very good in terms of performance but the worst thing to me is that this only measures payments from the European Union to Member States, it does not measure when those payments were actually received by the end-user where employment is created and regional development takes place."
"There are no statistics for that whatsoever, so our key measure for how these funds are being used and how quickly they have been applied is not available to us anywhere in this report nor in any information that the Commission has."
"Moving on to the environment: once again, we have in the Court of Auditors Report examples where structural funding money is used to undo environmental damage that has been created by previous structural programmes."
"That is still a disgrace to me and is something that needs to be put right very quickly."
"I know that action has taken place but that needs to be even better."
"We move on to what I would call best practice."
"We have a wealth of experience of structural funding and of the regions doing good work in terms of development and yet we seem not to make the most of spreading the experience of best practice between the different regions."
"The Commission says that it is doing this and I accept that but it does not give it one mention in this report and that speaks volumes in terms of its real priority."
"Lastly, in terms of problems."
"I would criticise our own institution, the European Parliament."
"When we are talking about such a large proportion of our total expenditure, then we need to give far more scrutiny to our consideration of this area than we do at the moment."
"We should go out and see what is working and what is not and should bring witnesses forward and have hearings, we should actually treat this far more seriously and comprehensively than we do at the moment."
"I will finish by saying that we have solutions available to us: simplification, sweeping away bureaucracy at national level, tracking expenditure but most importantly preparing for next time."
"The structural funds are a valuable and essential programme, on the whole they are working well but they do not yet have the full confidence of the public."
"We need fundamental changes for the future and we need to take those first steps now."
"Mr President, we should like to emphasise, as we did in the explanatory memorandum to the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs, that the year to which the report refers was the first of the new programming period following revision of the Structural Fund regulation."
"We called for greater interest to be shown and more thoroughness to be applied to the analysis of ways in which the resources transferred were actually applied and, at the same time, a certain amount of leeway to be given for aspects concerning the transition, which was perhaps too sudden."
"Therefore, we must, first of all, take advantage of that year and learn certain lessons from it in order to improve the new system in operation until 1999."
"We were surprised therefore to note that no such thought was given to this idea."
"It is really quite unacceptable that the way in which the system worked in its first year of application is being used as a pretext for judging not the system and its execution but the whole philosophy lying behind the Structural Funds and the role they play in pursuit of the objective of economic and social cohesion."
"We must congratulate the rapporteur on adopting our proposals and those of the Committee on Social Affairs and we should like once again to submit our request to the Commission so that, in future, a better assessment might be carried out of the repercussions of structural intervention on employment, in particular in respect of stable employment and women's jobs."
"We also repeat, more forcefully, our demand for more indications as to the impact of the criteria of economic and monetary union, in particular with reference to the additionality requirements, and we also point out that there should be attempts at establishing links of conditionality between implementation of regional policies and respect for those criteria, which we consider to be both significant and inappropriate."
"We should like once again to assert, in defence of the objective of economic and social cohesion, what, in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, was highlighted and integrated into the report, as concerns the difficulties concerning the absorption of budgetary financial appropriations in the hope that, in keeping with that position, that committee will not propose guidelines and positions which concentrate on unsatisfactory execution rates and ignore the difficulties experienced in 1994, now recognised, and which have not been exceeded since."
"Mr President, last year when I spoke in this debate, I said that annual reports provide an opportunity not to look backwards, to assign blame and criticize, but to look forward and learn from the difficulties that we have had in programme implementation."
"In short, we should not be revisiting the same old problems when we have this debate."
"Unfortunately, that seems to be too often the case."
"The key problem that I want to highlight today in connection with the Teverson report, in the light of the budgetary debate in 1997 and Council's decision on 25th July to cut structural fund payments in some areas, is the perceived problem of under-utilization of structural funds."
"We urgently have to take this issue on but what I fear is happening is an attempt by some Member States to renege on agreements that they made in Edinburgh and fail to meet the targets they agreed."
"That is something that we have to take up because it could result in a long-term discrediting of regional policy."
"I would like to commend the Commissioner for her decisive action in putting a proposal to the Venice informal Council to improve the efficiency of structural funds."
"I would like to commend the Commission on its SCM 2000 programme and of course, in the context of the Teverson Report I would like to thank Mr Teverson for taking on board my own Group's amendments in committee to this report."
"There are, of course, areas where I believe we can improve performance: better training for administrators through exchanges; streamlining administrative processes; strengthening the role of regions and local authorities; combatting the irregularities in fraud by establishing clear audit trails; better access to information."
"But some of his proposals would require a bureaucracy in Brussels ten times the size of the current Commission."
"It is simply not realistic to ask the Commission to monitor every individual payment to final beneficiaries."
"Member States must take their own commitments in these areas seriously."
"I fear that the proposals will come to nothing without a change of mind by several Member States, my own of course included."
"They now seem to specialize in putting new obstacles in the way and of course the latest one is meeting the EMU convergence criteria."
"We cannot stress enough that closing the gap between poor and rich Member States - achieving cohesion - means Member States must take the responsibility seriously."
"I am very unhappy that the non-take-up of funding has been a dominant theme in the media and is discrediting the good work that we do in structural funds."
"I believe that the Member States are now moving towards self-imposed nonutilization of funding and slowing-down our processes, which will lead to problems in the longer term."
"When Member States signed up to the Edinburgh Agreement, they knew the commitments they were entering into; they knew they had to meet the convergence criteria and it is simply not good enough now to make a linkage which is not in the interests of our regional policy programmes."
"I therefore say, on behalf of my Group, that we reject the attempt by the French Government to link structural fund spending to EMU criteria."
"We cannot change the rules half-way through the programmes and we must denounce the hypocrisy of the Council of Ministers of paying lip-service to launch actions on unemployment and then reneging on their commitments to tackle unemployment through structural funds."
"The real threat to implementation comes from the Member States themselves."
"We need more accountability, we need more transparency, we need more devolution but we above all need more commitment."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States, so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur."
"We must not get to a situation where Member States are able to draw false conclusions, undermining our spending programmes where we know that they are vital to citizens' opportunities."
"I therefore would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work, to support her in making the case for a strong regional policy and for keeping the focus on our goal of economic and social cohesion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the subject area covered by this report is particularly interesting because 1994 was the first year of the new programme planning period after the review of the structural funds regulation."
"At that time, this review was intended to make programme planning simpler and less time consuming."
"But some of the facts that emerge from the 1994 reports tell a different story and now that we are approaching mid-term in the planning period we should take the Sixth Annual Report as an opportunity to include strategic aspects in the next planning period, for after all - leaving aside agriculture - we are looking at the largest item of European Union expenditure."
"So the annual assessments of the structural funding programmes represent a major task for Parliament and in particular for the Committee on Regional Policy."
"The Commission report is very comprehensive."
"It contains good ideas on how to link up the structural funds with other EU areas, activities and policies."
"Yet my group very largely agrees with the rapporteur that in future the procedures need to be simplified at administrative and political level."
"After all, we MEPs see day after day and in the field how the complexity of the funds and their complicated administration creates incomprehension and uncertainty among Union citizens and other potential beneficiaries in the assisted regions."
"One example is that the responsibility for the three existing funds, whose objectives are not always clearly demarcated one from the other, is in fact shared among different directorates-general within the Commission and a large number of national and regional bodies."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur that this stock-taking in the first year after the review shows that the formulation and evaluation of the programmes and the financial proposals remain just as complicated and not sufficiently transparent."
"Secondly: there is a need to improve the situation of all potential beneficiaries of the funds, not least in the disadvantaged regions and peripheral regions, who often receive information slowly or belatedly."
"Thirdly: the aim must be to make these programmes more comprehensible and simplify the language, for otherwise we will always have to provide assistants to explain the content of these programmes to those who want to apply for them."
"Fourthly: a further outcome of the Sixth Annual Report should be that the Commission changes the criteria and methods of implementing the structural funds, with particular reference to the administration of the resources, in order to simplify the financial transfers."
"I am thinking in particular here of the need also to establish more flexible criteria for fixing the level of Community co-financing."
"Like the rapporteur, we regret the lack of participation of Parliament in determining the Financial Perspective - for the period 1994-1999 - for the structural funds and emphasize the need for it to be genuinely involved in the forthcoming decisions on the next programme period for the years 2000-2006."
"Let us therefore draw overall conclusions from the annual assessments of the structural funding programmes; then reports of this kind will no longer just take stock but also serve as good pointers for future action!"
"Mr President, we are assessing the application of one third of the European Union budget, that concerning the Structural Funds, which in our opinion are justified because they are helping to bring about application of the principle of economic and social cohesion."
"That principle of economic and social cohesion which - in my opinion and I believe everyone's - is essential for consolidating the European Union itself."
"Obviously, I should like to emphasise that economic and social cohesion cannot only be seen in terms of approximation or convergence between the Member States but also between the regions of Europe, because it also involves a fight to rectify regional imbalances."
"I should like to compliment Mr Teverson on his excellent assessment of the Commission report and for having gone further than a pure and simple commentary of that report. I wish to refer to three aspects:"
"First of all, our need to go further in the follow-up procedures of both the Commission and the European Parliament in relation to the impact and the results of the European Union's policies, in particular through the Structural Funds."
"We need information - quality information but also timely information."
"Remember that in the documents we are going to discuss in a few minutes, concerning the Structural Funds, for example in Portugal, the figures at our disposal in the document date back to 1991 and do not cover all Portuguese regions."
"On the other hand, this follow-up should enable us to find ways of putting that right, and actually acting upon the findings of our assessment of the application of the Structural Funds, in particular by having a secure working basis for reformulating them for a new period of economic and social cohesion beginning in 1999."
"I should like to conclude by emphasising the need to articulate policies in the European Union, policies on the environment, transport, the building of infrastructures, and the need for more articulation of the policies which help to rectify imbalances which are on one hand, the responsibility of the European Union and, on the other hand, the responsibility of the Member States which also must bear those responsibilities."
"Mr President, our Group feels, as Mr Teverson has said in his magnificent report, that the structural funds are the main instrument for reducing inequalities between the various countries of the European Union and strengthening economic and social cohesion."
"Hence all the programmes need to be simplified so that citizens of the Union can understand the benefits of solidarity among its component nations."
"However, we believe that the projects in which women participate have been and still are inadequate, and this must be a requirement in the remaining programmes and in future ventures."
"Equality between men and women is a commitment acquired by the European Union in Beijing at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and in the Fourth Action Programme on equal opportunities, which means that Member States, the Commission and this Parliament have a duty to include it in the structural funds."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that the gap between poor and rich regions is continuing to widen and in view of the fact that the drastic cuts inspired by monetary union are destabilizing the entire system of economic and social cohesion, it is urgently necessary to make every effort to use the structural funds effectively!"
"The new structural funds regulation certain suggests means of giving impetus to sustained development in the disadvantaged regions."
"But although that is one criterion of the regulation, the Commission did not examine, either in the programmes or in their implementation, whether the sustained development that the structural funds are to promote in these regions also takes account of the need to protect natural resources."
"Other rules were not referred to either in the report, such as respect for the principle of equal opportunities."
"For example, the Member States did not have to prove that they involved their environmental partners in the planning and implementing stages in good time."
"Here the Commission must assume more responsibility: it must make checks and, in particular, it must intervene."
"Parliament cannot accept the fact that the SMEs still have such a hard time obtaining the funding."
"What is the use of wonderful strategies to assist SMEs at European level if, as in the case of Germany, the Member States make access more difficult for them by cutting the European resources for such assistance?"
"Why is the Commission allowing the rules of the new structural funds regulation to be so crassly disregarded?"
"What is it doing to stop this?"
"Mr President, good work has been done by the rapporteur Mr Teverson and by the committee as a whole, and it seems to me that the report contains very useful suggestions and criticisms."
"In our discussions, however, we have gone further - rightly - than analyzing 1994."
"To think in more general terms: we started from the fact that - not only in 1994 - the use made of structural funds is not satisfactory."
"We know that there are differences between States, between regions, between objectives, that the situations are not all the same, but overall it is not satisfactory."
"The States, the regions, the nations still have particular responsibilities known to us, about which some fundamental points have been made: among other things it is the States themselves - and Mrs McCarthy is right here - that go on to propose cutting down the budget of the structural funds."
"The matter is therefore extremely serious."
"In the discussion of the Teverson report we have also dealt with two questions which I want to recall here: firstly, the mechanism of the Structural Funds is now too complex, too difficult, too cumbersome, and must be simplified."
"We must set ourselves this aim: we must start at once and try to change the programming and management of these funds wherever possible immediately, and must also follow the lines already taken, on 3 and 4 May, in the Council of Ministers on these questions, precisely with a view to the simplification and transparency of the procedures."
"Secondly, we must begin to think about the regulations to be revised and reshaped for 1999 in order to make them more productive and better suited to the new phase of the European Union."
"It will in any case be obligatory, but all the more justifiable if they are added to."
"The Commissioner, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, has already said some interesting things on this point on a number of public occasions."
"Perhaps we should now begin to translate them into documents and to do some precise thinking among ourselves."
"We must however say one thing clearly: there are too many funds, too many bodies dealing with them, too many Directorates-General; there is too much complexity and therefore a danger of overlapping of objectives and instruments."
"This is a question which we can no longer avoid; we shall not be able to settle it before 1999, of course, but we must start dealing with it now, including the role of the European Parliament in the regulation of the structural funds and also in the financial prospects, which is a fundamental aspect."
"I believe that these are the questions which we must start to discuss."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: strengthening economic and social cohesion is one of the basic principles of the Maastricht Treaty."
"The Treaty specifies in particular that the Community should seek to eliminate differences in the level of development of different regions."
"The relevant provisions seek to ensure that people can live and earn a living even in the remotest regions of the Union."
"The Union's regional and structural policies can provide substantial support to help overcome regional differences in development, as regional policy appropriations already comprise a third of the Union's budget."
"The proportion of national regional policy accounted for by EU programmes of Community initiatives could be further increased, for example by linking the implementation of the Interreg 2 programme and local cooperation and by improving the exploitation of other programmes in urban and rural policy."
"It would be perfectly possible to improve the interaction between the various programmes, for example within the framework of the Urban and Leader programmes."
"From the point of view of Finland, following its recent accession, the growing significance of the Baltic region is important."
"In practice this means that the EU's Baltic policy should support regions' spontaneous interaction."
"Together with the Baltic peripheral areas, greater use should be made of the scope afforded by the Interreg 2C programmes and links between Phare and Tacis aid and Finland."
"For example, by designating areas of NorthWestern Russia close to the Finnish border Tacis target areas and by allocating funds for the actual implementation of projects rather than just for planning and consultancy, it would be possible to promote the development of SMEs in border regions better than at present."
"I believe that the proposal put forward in the Committee of the Regions that the Commission should draw up a separate programme of principles and activities for the Union's northern regions deserves every support."
"I hope that these points of view can and will be taken into account when the principles of regional policy are reviewed, at the latest in 1999."
"As you know, twelve European states are currently seeking accession to the Union, and when they join this will hugely increase expenditure."
"Although enlargement is of course the Union's response to the new challenges facing Europe, it is quite possible that the EU's regional and agricultural policies will have to be reformed before enlargement."
"For this reason and above all in order to avoid a crisis both in the applicant countries and in the present Member States, enlargement and the decisions associated with it must be very carefully planned."
"Mr President, the report on the Sixth Annual Report on the Structural Funds in 1994 rightly criticizes the structural funds' weaknesses and confirms our view that the structural funds need to be tightened up and that the funding needs to be reduced for the time being."
"The lack of transparency of the organizational structure, the inadequate cross-frontier dimension of the structural programmes, the lack of information on the flow of money to the Member States and the poor cooperation between national authorities are an obstacle to concentrated and therefore efficient administration and to the optimization of the monitoring systems, which therefore opens the doors very wide to abuse and fraud."
"The Court of Auditors is indeed complaining that the countries concerned did not listen to its proposals for improvement."
"But the fact that the structural funds are co-financed by the individual Member States is also an anachronism, given the need to observe the EMU convergence criteria on the one hand and the additional resources needed to co-finance the structural programmes in the national states on the other."
"In their present form the structural funds will in the end create no or only a few new jobs."
"At most, existing jobs will be redistributed."
"We will certainly have to consider this."
"Mr President, Commissioner: unemployment is the biggest problem throughout the EU."
"In nearly every Member State unemployment and particularly the growth of long-term unemployment has assumed unacceptable proportions."
"The whole EU budget amounts to only about 2 % of the Member States' combined Gross Domestic Product."
"The appropriations for the Structural Funds represent about a third of the final annual budget."
"It is easy, therefore, to calculate that the funding available to solve structural problems and hence unemployment is very limited."
"For this reason too, therefore, attention increasingly needs to be devoted to how this funding is used and how effective the programmes adopted are, so that unemployment can be reduced and particularly new jobs can be created."
"It is important to analyse past structural policy programmes, but - as has already been pointed out here - it is equally important that we should be able to learn from them and create new and better programmes."
"Regional programmes are implemented in accordance with the subsidiarity principle."
"However, all of us - Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, the Commission and the Council too - should ensure that European regional policy achieves certain objectives."
"Projects carried out with European funding should not only promote employment but, above all, assist social progress and promote development."
"Projects should meet the needs of citizens and of society in the future."
"Thus for example those issues which the Commissioner referred to earlier, concerning, inter alia, the new jobs provided by culture, the media, education and the information society, should increasingly be included in new programmes so as to create genuine new jobs in the European region."
"Mr President, I believe that the Teverson report, assisted by the amendments proposed by many of us in the Committee on Regional Policy, is a good document and that it sets out the European Parliament's position on the implementation of the structural funds in 1994 in a clear manner."
"Nevertheless, there are four or five points in connection with the report that I regard as particularly important and that I feel that I ought to mention."
"It has come more quickly than did previous reports and I acknowledge the improvement. I mention the point simply in the hope of stimulating earlier submission of reports in future years, because now, in 1996, we are talking about things which took place two years ago in 1994."
"Secondly, I think that more emphasis needs to be placed on the trans-European element in the implementation of the structural funds via support for cooperative actions between regions and Member States as a means to bringing the regions and, indeed, the citizens of Europe into closer involvement."
"In addition, given our concern about assessment of the structural fund actions, I think that a clear, easily applicable and consistent methodology for ex-ante, ongoing and ex-post assessment of the actions must be devised."
"I know that it is not easy, or something that can be achieved by tomorrow morning. Speaking for myself, I simply want us to be able to conduct our deliberations on a more reliable basis."
"I believe, also, that the on-the-spot checks carried out by the Commission to verify that projects are being correctly executed should be extended and made more stringent in order to ensure swifter and better realization of projects that are funded through the Community budget."
"Lastly, from my own standpoint, I should like to stress the importance of looking for ways of promoting greater private sector involvement in structural fund actions. As you can easily understand, the greatly increased resources that would thus be made available would bring a very substantial improvement in the results of the implementation."
"Mr President, I begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur but the Commission itself."
"The report produced takes careful note of the recommendations made last year by my esteemed colleague Mrs Frutos Gama and the resolution passed by the European Parliament."
"Therefore, what remains of concern to us is not in the main the contents or analysis within the report but what it says and does not say about the performance of the structural funds programmes themselves."
"What the report does say is that there are significant and damaging delays in payments to localities and regions and that some governments deliberately ignore the principle of additionality and use structural fund moneys to pay the wages of their own civil servants."
"This is a familiar story to those of us from the UK and one which should redouble our determination to ensure that the moneys reach quickly those on the ground for whom they are intended."
"What the report does say is that money is allocated for Community initiatives and innovative measures, some of which are outside the main objective areas and that it was not spent or only beginning to be spent during the year in question."
"The Commissioner knows that I was pleased to act as the rapporteur on the latter programmes known collectively as Article 10."
"What the report does not say is that the delay in these programmes specifically harms localities and regions which are suffering real economic problems, for example in industrial sectors or in new and different ways, but who are not eligible for other forms of European assistance."
"This delay in payment must not be used as an excuse to attack the budget for these important measures or be allowed to discourage those new to European programmes from fully benefiting."
"In the quite proper debate on concentration, these points must not be lost."
"Finally, what the report does say is that consultation has taken place with the social partners."
"What it does not record is the deep concern we have expressed about misuse of structural fund moneys to benefit privatized services including Anglia Water in my own constituency in Essex in the UK."
"The Commissioner is asked to maintain her enquiries in this respect and I would be grateful if she could address this point in particular in her reply."
"Mr President, I should also like to join in the congratulations offered by my colleagues to the rapporteur, who has certainly done an excellent job, with which we agree; hence it is unnecessary to repeat many of the questions which are already included in the report, which we also endorse."
"I can understand that, for the Commission as well, it must be rather wearing to hear the same questions from Member after Member."
"But I believe that this should show the Commission that, from one end to the other of the full parliamentary arc, we are all more or less agreed on the criticisms, assessments and also on the proposals."
"I also believe that it is most important to bear in mind the general approach of all our interventions."
"In general they are not directed against the Commission's work, but often against the actual system we have and the inadequacy of the means available to both Commission and Parliament."
"And this too should be very clear."
"Parliament and Commission have been working in these areas for many years in a very coordinated and positive manner."
"Having said this, it must be added that annual the reports are not sufficient for our Parliamentary work and our responsibility for monitoring and checking these funds. And it has to be remembered that these funds are very large."
"After agricultural investment this is the biggest item in the Community budget."
"And the only thing we do every year is to approve a budget heading and then receive reports two or three years late."
"I do not believe that this Parliament can work with this kind of report."
"Although it must be acknowledged that the reports have gradually improved, I believe that we must move beyond the accounting stage and make a start on assessments, which for our purposes are essential and which we have been demanding year after year."
"A possible example is the assessment which needs to be made of additionality, one of the essential requirements of structural fund organization, which in the Commission's own report is very disappointing."
"For any one of us it is disappointing to be working on a 1994 report which contains on page 174 a section stating that no suitable assessment of additionality can be given because the data will not all be available until late 1995."
"But we are discussing these matters towards the end of 1996."
"This is not helpful either to the Commission or ourselves when it comes to making a positive evaluation."
"I think we also need to have access to the monitoring reports."
"I have seen some."
"I sincerely believe that they are unsatisfactory both to the Commission and to this Parliament."
"They are simply administrative reports, which say hardly anything and are disappointing."
"I think we can and must require these monitoring reports to have substance."
"Mr President, there are other matters on which I should have liked to dwell, particularly in connection with the European Social Fund, to which some of my colleagues have already referred, but we are very concerned about monitoring the European Social Fund and will have to exert combined pressure to arrive at a much more positive and detailed evaluation."
"Mr President, the Teverson report refers to the year 1994."
"At that time Austria was not yet a Member State of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, or perhaps because of that, the Teverson report is important for us too, for it does not just take the weaknesses that have been uncovered as grounds for criticizing past performance, it also calls for things to be improved."
"Over these first two years in which we have not only been a Member State of the European Union but have also been cooperating in European regional policy, we in Austria have also noted these weaknesses, and from that point of view we can also identify some aspects of this report as relevant to us."
"There are two particular points I want to take up. In my view, paragraph 9 rightly criticizes the fact that the structures of European regional assistance are far too complicated."
"Both the administrative procedures and the general structures are so complex that in the end no-one can pretend to be truly well-informed on the subject."
"To put it more simply: many people do not understand how the individual funds and the administrative units and the whole thing still works with national co-financing."
"Paragraph 17 notes that noone, not even the Commission, knows where and how EU funding is actually used, because there is obviously a serious lack of information here."
"Both these criticisms also apply to the first experience we in Austria have gained in the field of regional assistance, and from that point of view we too will have to learn from our mistakes."
"In particular, as a country that is after all one of the net contributors in the Union and which therefore certainly has a duty to justify the use of these monies, we must not make the mistakes that have been shown up here, for that could only overturn the feelings of sympathy for the European Union, and it could overturn us, especially a few weeks before the European elections in our country."
"There are a few things we can be proud of in regional policy."
"We do not need to hide our light under a bushel."
"The Commissioner herself came to our country twice and was able to ascertain that."
"A delegation from the Committee on Regional Policy also came to Austria, to Styria, and found that we are in fact doing very sensible things with the money, both our own and the money from Europe."
"The important point here is to make this apparent to our citizens too."
"There is a principle which I believe should be followed in politics in general and also and above all in politics during election times: do good and tell about it!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank Mr Teverson, the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, and the draftsmen of the opinions of the other committees for presenting Parliament with a very comprehensive motion for a resolution on the Sixth Annual Report from the Commission on the Structural Funds in 1994."
"I understand your criticism about our tardiness, but I also regret the fact that we were not able to discuss what happened in 1994 until September 1996 in Parliament."
"Here I really think in future we could coordinate our working procedures rather better to ensure that comments can be taken into account very quickly."
"The Teverson report shows that the European Parliament is very interested in cohesion policy and strongly supports it."
"The European Parliament rightly calls for structural policy resources not just to be used effectively but for the people also to be given comprehensive information on this assistance."
"The motion for a resolution and the opinions of the committees raise some important questions of principle in relation to structural policy, which go beyond the brief and the time-span of a single annual report."
"So there are important ideas to be considered in our future work, even if we will certainly not manage today fully to clarify all the ramifications between European and national regional policy and the effects of monetary union on cohesion."
"I regard the motion for a resolution as part of a continuous dialogue between Parliament and the Commission, which we will have to deepen in coming months, particularly on the occasion of the mid-term review of structural policy in the cohesion report."
"The motion for a resolution rightly refers to the Member States and their responsibility in these cases."
"I consider it important for the European Parliament to support the Commission in its attempt to agree on solutions with the Member States that will further improve financial control and the implementation of the budget, ensure systematic evaluation and further strengthen the partnership principle in the implementation of structural policy."
"Let me go into a few other questions in more detail."
"The rapporteur regretted that Parliament was not sufficiently involved in the setting up of the structural funds for the period 1994-1999 and called for greater participation in future."
"You know that I have supported this demand from the outset and meanwhile, in its opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission has also called for the co-decision procedure with Parliament be extended to include the structural funds because I believe that is a clear and direct solution that will avoid the need in future for desperate attempts to obtain information or to draft reports after the event."
"The rapporteur calls for the aims of structural policy to be specified and quantified more clearly."
"I do not agree with the basic criticism expressed in the report, that the goals are not at all clear, for first of all there are of course objectives 1 to 6, which do indeed overlap slightly, but which certainly clarify the aims, and secondly the programmes do set out targets which are evaluated ex ante by independent experts before the Commission approves them."
"Here too, of course, we find that one speaker says that he would like to know exactly, while another has called for more flexibility;"
"I believe we have to find a sensible middle road between clear basic aims, but also the possibility of flexible reactions to particular regional features, for what we are trying to do is not to sit round a green table in Brussels and plan a programme, either in the Commission or in Parliament, but to ensure that the regions also have opportunities to participate in planning and to make changes during the programmes."
"Nevertheless I think it is important for the Commission to continue trying to concentrate the structural measures on priority objectives such as combatting unemployment, within the framework of the current structural fund regulations."
"In response to my proposal the Commission has set out guidelines for drawing up the new objective 2 programmes after detailed discussion in Parliament's Committee on Regional policy and I think you will find these in the report in question."
"For the rest, this has also meant that we will be able to speed up the procedure for deciding on objective 2 programmes by also making it possible to continue current programmes in agreement with the Member States."
"We have also made progress on quantifying the structural policy objectives."
"But I do agree with you that this is not yet sufficient, and that applies in particular to the number of jobs that have been created, to their permanence, to the measures to ensure equal opportunities and to environmental effects."
"I think we will have to be more specific here in future annual reports."
"But we have improved the evaluation methods, in consultation with experts."
"I believe that there has been a growing understanding in the Member States of the need for evaluation and I hope that this will also lead to an improvement in future programme proposals."
"The motion for a resolution also refers to the importance of trans-national measures, and I agree with that."
"On the basis of the structural policy aims set out in Edinburgh we have made use of existing possibilities here, for instance in the allocation of the reserve for Community initiatives, in agreement with Parliament, and we have not just stocked up INTERREG but also created new possibilities of inter-regional cooperation with INTERREG C. Article 10, pilot measures, has also been geared more closely to trans-national projects, urban networks, trans-national exchanges of experiences and best practices."
"I admit that if we do useful things we should also talk about them more, as I have just been told."
"But let me also say one thing: the fact that structural policy is regional by nature is certainly justified when it is a question of helping disadvantaged regions to catch up on the Community average."
"Because of the delays in payments in 1994 that were mentioned, I urged both the Commission departments and the Member States to decide and implement structural measures more rapidly."
"Nevertheless, the marked improvement in the execution of the 1995 budget and the greater speed of payments to be expected in 1996 still give no reason to sound the all-clear."
"The competent national and regional authorities must also become aware of the risk that delays in carrying out the programmes may lead to an accumulation of payments that have to be made at the end of the planning period."
"At the same time, the necessary financial absorption must not affect the quality of the programmes."
"That is why we have to find a way of reconciling the need for solidarity with the structurally weak regions of the Union with the European tax-payer's right for his tax monies to be used in the most economical and effective manner possible, and I would also ask you to take note - and here I thank Mrs McCarthy for her support - that we in Brussels cannot build up some kind of super-bureaucracy but that in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the Member States must assume their proper responsibilities."
"We should not try to build up an even bigger bureaucracy here but make the Member States take on more of their responsibility via our efforts in relation to SCM 2000."
"On environmental policy, I would ask Parliament to take note when it comes to take its decision that the Commission has reacted to the calls for an environmentally compatible structural policy."
"In the letter of understanding that the Commission forwarded to Parliament, and in its communication on cohesion policy and the environment, the Commission has listed a great many measures in relation to which, as the latest discussions with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection have shown, we have definitely made some progress, although this can only be recorded in future reports."
"In conclusion, let me assure you that the Commission will take your resolution on board, with the aim of making the 1995 annual report even more informative."
"Let me announce at this point that it will include a separate chapter on environmental policy and I hope that it will not take until the start of the new programme period in 2000 for us to have achieved some improvements but that we can also do so now within the realm of the possible and that you will be able to ascertain this from future reports."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Structural measures in Greece, Portugal and Spain"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0240/96 by Mr Klironomos, on the Commission Decision (C4-0036/96) on the establishment of the Community support framework for Community structural assistance for the Greek regions concerned by Objective 1, which is the whole country; -A4-0087/96 by Mr Chichester on development issues and Objective 1 structural measures in Portugal (C40035/96); -A4-0163/96 by Mrs Sierra González on development problems/structural measures under Objectives 1, 2 and 5b in Spain (1994-1999) (C4-0053/96 - C-0054/96)."
"Mr President, the establishment of the Community support framework for Community structural assistance for the whole of Greece as an Objective 1 area will be an important tool for Greece in its efforts towards economic and social development and will provide it with support on the road to economic and monetary union and help it to assume the role that it can and must play throughout the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean basin."
"The strategy of the regional development plan submitted to the Commission by the Greek Government, which the Commission adopted on 13 July 1994, dovetails with the main objectives of the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment and centres on five main areas of development: the modernization of basic infrastructures, improvement of the quality of life by means of integrated action in the sectors of urban development, health and social assistance and the environment, the development of human resources, strengthening of the competitiveness of the economic fabric and the reduction of regional disparities and inaccessibility of island areas by means of 13 regional programmes."
"For the period 1994-1999 there is provision for the allocation to Greece of ECU 13, 980, 000, 000 by way of CSF funding."
"This does not include resources from the Cohesion Fund or funding provided through other Community initiatives."
"Not only the Greek authorities but also the Commission are optimistic that the second CSF will make a major contribution to the overall economy of Greece."
"It is estimated that Community resources will, on annual average, constitute 4.2 % of gross domestic product, that GDP will increase by 0.9 % annually and that, with regard to employment, without the CSF framework the number of jobs at the end of the period under consideration would be around 100, 000 less."
"I think that I should mention certain main features of the Greek economy in order to convey an understanding of the wider strategy of the regional development plan."
"The country's basic infrastructures are regarded as inadequate and have huge shortcomings in all sectors."
"Agriculture, representing 20-22 % of GDP, is the major sector in the economy."
"The industrial and processing sectors are very slowly increasing their contribution to the national economy while the services sector, of which the main focus is tourism, has developed significantly in recent years."
"However, tourism, together with the Greek economy as a whole, is confronted with extremely serious infrastructural problems particularly in the transport and telecommunications sectors."
"The Greek economy is restricted in size and the low output in the main economic sectors, in particular industry and agriculture, the inadequacy of infrastructures and facilities and the low level of vocational training of the working populace are also factors holding back the development of the country."
"Despite this, the Greek economy has a number of valuable assets, such as considerable natural resources which can be developed, favourable climatic and environmental conditions, a rich cultural heritage, a strategic geographical position and a large number of dynamic entrepreneurs who are well placed to take advantage of the country's strategic position."
"The need to implement the CSF has revealed the extent of the inability of the Greek public administration to plan, administer and realize the major public projects included in the programme, and has forced the Greek Government to create and activate a new institutional framework for planning and tendering and for the execution of the major projects, and, at the same time, obliged it to put in place the necessary mechanisms, such as a unit for organizing the management of the second CSF, a joint guidance committee and a Greek investments centre, to facilitate the task of implementing these major works. The public administration shortcomings and the decisions that the Greek Government has had to take have delayed commencement of the realization of the major projects and have resulted, consequently, in an unsatisfactory rate of take-up and utilization of the Community resources."
"Generally speaking, the picture with regard to implementation is mixed. In certain sectors the picture is unfavourable, with the take-up rate of funding being extremely low or non-existent, while in other sectors it is encouraging: for example, the progress made with major infrastructural projects in the transport and energy sectors and with regard to the environment, research and technology."
"On the other hand, the situation is unfavourable in the fields of industry, health, public administration, teaching and employment."
"It is, therefore, imperative to implement the programmes more rapidly in order to achieve a faster rate of growth in GDP in so far it is influenced by the CSF."
"Failure to do so will mean that the objectives of economic and social cohesion and genuine convergence will disappear into the distance."
"Persistent delay in implementing the second CSF will prove very costly, not in terms of lost Community resources but because the anticipated benefits from the completion of the CSF programmes will take a long time to appear."
"A factor that ought not to be ignored is that the efforts of the Greek Government to achieve the goals of the CSF and the economic sacrifices of the Greek people as a result of the implementation the very painful programme aimed at achieving economic convergence, which are consonant objectives, are being made against a background of conditions more adverse than in any other Member State of the European Union, given that Greece is the only Member State whose territorial integrity is under threat and is forced, as a consequence, to spend a much greater percentage of its - already low - GDP on defence than any other country of the Union."
"The overall scale of the Community funding allocation for the programme is considered to be, and indeed is, very substantial, but even so it is insufficient to meet the great needs of Greece in terms of basic infrastructure projects."
"And if account is taken of the fact that the biggest portion of Greek national resources goes towards covering the enormous public debt, and that only a small percentage is available for public investment, the importance of utilizing the available money as productively and effectively as possible becomes very clear."
"Mr President, perhaps I should start by pointing out that I am rapporteur but from a country other than the one which is the subject of this report."
"I wonder whether this could or should be a precedent."
"The first point I should like to make is to draw attention to the very real progress made in Portugal to reduce the gap between her domestic product per capita and the EU average during the life of the previous Community support framework in 1989-1993."
"Secondly, I would point to the current programme involving a very substantial transfer of funds from the EU budget to Portugal - an amount including loans from the EIB of almost ECU 24bn. This is serious money in anyone's language."
"Yet preliminary results suggest that there has been a slow start to the programme and a lower drawdown of funds in the early years."
"This phenomenon seems common to all structural fund programmes, certainly going on our experience in my constituency in Devon with Objective 5b."
"I suggest that this is partly due to the Commission calling the programme 1994-1999, when usually the first year is taken up in negotiating the details of the framework and applications can only be made after the document has been agreed."
"This can lead to confusion and disappointment among those not familiar with the system."
"Another problem in the Portuguese programme has been that of monitoring and evaluation."
"It is essential that proper control is exercised over the expenditure of European funds by Member States to ensure that it goes on the correct objective and that value for money is achieved."
"This report, paragraph 3, calls on the authorities in Portugal, as well as the Commission, to take note of the comments of the Court of Auditors in this regard in their special report."
"This report also makes several references to education, in particular paragraphs 7 and 9, and it is noteworthy that Priority 1 of the framework programme is developing human resources and promoting employment, with the emphasis on education and training."
"My concern here is that the targets set for improvement are ambitious, such as to increase the proportion of young people in higher education from 19 % to 34 %, 35 % to 40 % within the time-frame of the programme."
"This is difficult to achieve and it would be a pity to raise expectations for them only to be disappointed."
"Likewise, in priority 3, which is for improving the quality of life and social cohesion, there are some very ambitious goals in the field of water supply and waste treatment."
"They include increasing the proportion of connections to the public water supply from 77 % in 1990 to 95 % in 1999."
"They include those served by urban waste treatment systems to increase from 43 % to 98 %, quite a jump; those served by sewage treatment systems throughout the country to increase from 21 % to 90 %, an enormous jump."
"These are worthy ambitions, they are essential actions for public health and quality of life, yet they seem almost hopelessly ambitious within the time-scale set."
"I have one other observation to make."
"Portugal is very dependent on imported energy."
"This report calls for a fundamental review of energy supply by the Portuguese Government."
"The Socialist Group in the Regional Committee rejected my suggestion that this review should include consideration of nuclear energy as an option."
"I hope that Portugal, particularly with its new Government, will be less blinkered than the Socialists and at least give consideration to this prospect."
"I believe there are no amendments, Mr President, and I have great pleasure in commending this report to the House."
"Mr President, I have the following comments to make on the development problems examined regarding the advisability and effectiveness of the proposed structural measures in Spain for the period 1994-1999."
"Firstly, the Community support frameworks for Objectives 1 and 2 and the single programming documents for Objective 5b) for this period in Spain basically represent continuity with the previous programming stage as far as the strategies adopted are concerned, since the problems existing in the previous period are, to a large extent, still there."
"Secondly, it has to be pointed out that the most pressing problem is undoubtedly the high unemployment rate in Objective 1 regions, which cover a large part of north-western, central and southern Spain and the Canary Islands."
"In the Islands unemployment stands at an explosive 25 % of the economically active population, which in my view is indicative not only of major imbalances in the system of production but also of the educational and vocational training policies followed until now."
"As a partial solution to this serious problem, particular attention has been paid within the new Community support framework for Objective 1 to improving and adjusting the production system, and to human resources, with greater emphasis on vocational training, although still below the level of the integrated measures of the ERDF and the European Social Fund."
"Thirdly, it has to be said that in general terms Spain is still marked by great disparities which have not been substantially reduced since the first programming period of 1989-1993, and that measures such as those scheduled in the current period continue to be needed."
"As regards the persistence of these disparities and the current need for such measures, I regret that a complete balance sheet of the results of the first Community support frameworks was not available when the programme for the present period was drawn up, since a more informed appraisal of the advisability and effectiveness of the measures would then have been possible."
"Nevertheless, examination of the measures shows that the structural funds have served to promote social and economic cohesion, although greater coordination with other Community financial instruments would have been desirable, and the preparation of forecasts taking account of the contributions of the EIB and Cohesion Fund to the Community support framework for Objective 1 would have been particularly useful."
"Fourthly, as regards the prospects of success of the current measures, we must bear in mind that in the period 1994-1999 the structural funds will be used in a context of budgetary austerity in Spain, marked by the plan for convergence towards the single currency, and the adjustment policies are bound to affect the results of the planned structural fund measures in one way or another."
"Moreover the poor level of integration between the various funds, indicative of excessive compartmentalization of the various Spanish government departments, and in my view inadequate cooperation between the latter and Directorates-General V and XVI lessen the chances of achieving optimum results from these measures."
"Turning now to different matters, I should like to make a few final comments on programming and monitoring of its implementation."
"There needs to be greater participation in programming by local authorities, which have encountered difficulties in gaining access to information, and no account has been taken, in terms of resource management, of the extent of the powers of the autonomous regions."
"Their presence on the monitoring committees should be strengthened, which has not been the case during programming."
"Greater environmental vigilance would also be desirable, particularly where investments are made in road infrastructures."
"Finally I should like to add that although Spain is, in absolute terms, the largest recipient of aid, this does not make it the main beneficiary of the structural policies."
"If we look at the indicator of structural funds received per capita, and note the contributions of the various countries to the Union budget between 1989 and 1993, whereas Spain's contribution represented 1.09 % of its gross domestic product, those of countries such as Germany, France, Denmark, Italy and the United Kingdom are below this figure."
"Any analysis of the effectiveness of the structural funds in Spain must certainly take these statistics into account."
"Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Klironomos for his report and also to pay tribute to the Commissioner and to her staff for the assistance they gave to me in the drafting of the opinion for the Social Affairs Committee on the CSF for Greece in the Objective 1 area."
"In particular, I should like to focus on the social dimension of the benefit of the CSF to peripheral and outlying regions within the European Union."
"In Greece with its proliferation of island communities within the Greek Archipelago and given also the mountainous nature of much of the country, there is a geographical disadvantage that can be overcome and assisted by the Community support framework."
"It has been highlighted in every country where Community support has been available is that when the money is spent efficiently and when it is done in consultation with local partnerships and with local authorities, the benefits are enormous not only in economic but also in social terms."
"It is particularly important that we in Parliament recognize that there are not only economic benefits of cohesion within the European Union by bringing areas that are underdeveloped closer to, or even above, the European average, but also social benefits in showing each and every citizen that everyone has a right to access the benefits and the magnificence of the European Union."
"In particular, I should like to emphasize the Social Fund aspect and access to education, ongoing training and vocational training in particular."
"We have seen frightening figures on the number of young people who have been denied access to education simply because of their geographical location or the economic imperatives in the Member States in which they live."
"It is essential that we as a Community work together to bring more funds to those most marginalized groups."
"I would ask for this Parliament to give whatever support is necessary to the Commissioner."
"She has a vision of how the European Union ideal is best encompassed by the cohesion and structural funds."
"If she can bring that about we should give her our total support."
"Mr President, Mr Chichester, I must congratulate you on your report and your attempt at understanding the Portuguese economy, and the way in which you have tracked down the structural weaknesses in the Portuguese economy and the flaws in its productive capacities, but I should also like to make one remark. The structure of the Portuguese economy is not quite as old-fashioned as your report makes out."
"Portugal no longer has 20 % of its population working in agriculture, but that figure has gone down to 9-10 %."
"As for education in Portugal, albeit still a major national problem, the situation is not quite as bad as the picture you have painted in your report."
"Compulsory schooling in Portugal now lasts nine years, and higher education has an extraordinary attendance in the country; the main problem now facing us is to give the bountiful supply of higher education higher quality standards."
"I should also like to say that Portugal has gone through three fundamental stages in the use of Community funds."
"The first stage was a successful one which coincided with the first Community support framework."
"Portugal converged, unemployment was reabsorbed and there was a period of convergence."
"But in terms of economic development this is deceptive."
"There was a second stage, beginning in 1993, when Portugal showed weakness in its economic growth compared with the European average, despite the second Community support framework which was both very ambitious and optimistic."
"Whereas between 1985 and 1994 Portugal made up 3 points in terms of convergence, in just three years, 1993, 1994 and 1995 it lost 2.7 points."
"1996 saw the beginning of a third stage."
"Another stage of hope in which Portugal seems to have got back on to the road of convergence with the rest of the European Community."
"Although economic growth in Portugal this year is only moderate it is bound to be higher than the Community average."
"At the same time we have been able to balance the state budget and bring down inflation without any spectacular increase in employment, although unemployment is a dramatic phenomenon."
"This means that, in applying the second Community support framework, there are great hopes that Portugal can once again begin to converge with the rest of Europe and that social justice in the country and within the Community can be increased."
"Mr President, there is one thing that unites the rapporteur and me and one thing that separates us. The thing that unites us is our origin."
"We are both from Crete. The thing that separates us is our political affiliation."
"And, indeed, I have to say that Mr Klironomos has produced a text that I would not have produced."
"I would have approached the job from a different standpoint. Even so, he has done a good job basically and has not let party political considerations blinker him - I said that in the committee and I say it again here."
"As far as the substance of the report is concerned, I must say that European Union assistance to Greece through the CSF certainly is essential. Greece is lagging behind in terms of development and has the lowest GDP of the 15 countries, and in striving for convergence, as it has to do, it needs to obtain money - which is available through the CSF - without putting pressure on the deficit or fuelling inflation."
"There is also the problem of defence spending. Our defence spending in Greece, as a percentage of GDP, is by far the highest in the European Union."
"If the CSF money that is available up to the year 2000 is fully taken up, Greece will see tremendous changes: the motorway network will be doubled, railway electrification will be increased from 3 % to 21 %, natural gas will be developed to generate 12 % of electrical energy and tens of thousands of jobs will be retained or created."
"However, I feel obliged to say that the delay in the take-up of the CSF appropriations is a source of worry to me. The rapporteur has expressed his concern about this, too."
"I do not want, of course, to appear unheedful of several helpful developments that the Commission has insisted on, such as the unit for organizing the management of the CSF and the establishment of the Greek investment centre to help foreign investors, but there are serious problems that must be resolved because the overall take-up rate stands at less than 50 %, and in crucial sectors, such as health and education, where there is total non-take-up, and industry, where the take-up rate is extremely low, there are very special problems."
"What needs to be done?"
"In my view, efforts should be concentrated on three areas."
"First, more, much more, needs to be done in connection with the public administration, because it is that which is a major impediment to the realization of the CSF at the present time."
"Second, we need to look again at the institutional framework for public works."
"Some modifications have been made, but I consider them insufficient. In order to be able to proceed with greater speed and transparency we need to look at what has been done in other countries where things are going well."
"Third, we need to look for ways of drawing in the private sector as a means to increasing the overall result, just as we did at Spata airport. This needs to be attended to immediately, without animosity towards the private sector and without bias."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by reminding Parliament that we are going to be assessing this report three years after the approval of the Regional Development Plan presented by the Portuguese government and halfway through its execution, which means that it is already, therefore, possible to analyse its development and its adaptation to the current socio-economic reality."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur. I think that his work quite closely reflects and fairly thoroughly analyses the situation in Portugal."
"However, I would like to point out some aspects which seem to me to be worthwhile."
"This Community support framework is being worked out at a time of increasing economic growth, in other words the plan is being carried out in a different economic background such that some of the measures in the programmes may not be tailor-made for today's realities."
"I think that we might have to adapt and readjust this plan and we hope that the Commission will understand this."
"I think that we urgently have to cut down the complexity of the whole system of funds and its management - this is a subject which has already been aired today - and that there should be greater flexibility so that it can take account of and react more swiftly to meet the needs of the people at whom these measures are directed."
"There is no need, of course, to point out here the importance of this Community support framework for Portugal, for its economy and for the Union's economic and social cohesion, nor do I have to point out the efforts made by Portugal and the success achieved in making use of Community funds."
"However, as the report rightly points out, there are structural deficiencies which continue to call for a huge effort both by Portugal and the Union."
"I should like to highlight two or three ideas in the report which seem to me particularly important."
"The first refers to the importance of the participation by local communities in promoting initiatives, defining economic development strategies and, consequently, creating employment."
"Experience shows us that operational initiatives and programmes set up locally and managed at a local level have a greater rate of execution and effectiveness than those devised and managed in a centralised way."
"Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur for referring to a particular element, one that is both positive and important for economic and social development, namely the geographical and strategic potential for relations between Europe, Africa or the Americas, with the possibility of developing particular industries or maritime services."
"In my view this is an area where Portugal can play a role which is in keeping with its history, linking Europe up with cultural and economic areas which are of interest not only to Portugal but also to the European Union as a whole."
"Mr President, with reference to Portugal, I should like to compliment Mr Chichester on his work and the way in which he was always willing from the beginning to work with his colleagues."
"This report shows the satisfactory results for real convergence achieved in Portugal over recent years but also points out the need for continually monitoring those developments in great detail, and to find out more accurately the impact of financial measures taken through the Structural Funds as well as the results obtained, and finding out exactly what those results were."
"I raise this point because it is extremely difficult to obtain all of the facts and figures needed - our colleague endeavoured to do so."
"For example, there are blanks in his report (on page 15) concerning the two Portuguese island regions which are precisely the most peripheral regions and which therefore face the most difficulties."
"Furthermore, the facts and figures which are reproduced date back to 1991, in other words five years ago."
"If the Commission does have these facts and figures to hand then it should let us have them and if it does not then it should do something about getting them."
"From the statistics which we do have available it is possible to conclude that regional imbalances have only become greater."
"Portugal has become closer to the European average but not all of its regions have done so."
"There are two ways of tackling these disparities: focusing resources more, on one hand, on regions facing greater imbalances and on actions which are more specifically targeted at special problems, bearing in mind that different answers are needed for different problems."
"On the other hand, the actions financed by the European Union should be better liaised with those carried out by the Member States since they, too, have responsibilities for reducing imbalances and dealing with those problems."
"We see the question of economic and social cohesion in a broader perspective."
"Our work will only have effects if we tackle the imbalances within the European Union and if we also tackle those which exist within the Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this analysis of structural actions in Portugal shows that, essentially, the objectives which had already been agreed between the Commission and the Portuguese Government have been achieved, either during the first Community support framework or during the first two years of the second."
"This does not mean, though, that we should not call again for greater transparency and controls of Community expenditure which should, therefore, be extended to all sectors and not only focus on structural expenditure in a special or particular way."
"A point which has become very obvious in the discussion of this report and one which is topical in Portugal is that the participation of both sides of industry and the participation of local and regional authorities - in the latter case heightened by the revelations of democratic illegitimacy in five of the seven regions presented by the then Portuguese government to the Community authorities - has been very limited in the definition of regional development plans and their monitoring."
"This alone, but not only this, justifies the calls for a review of the priorities defined so that we can actually better adapt our structural actions to the real needs of sustainable development in the whole country - and this calls for by full participation by those bodies."
"Despite the overall effects of the Community support frameworks we have also seen that structural actions have not prevented the worsening of regional imbalances between coastal and inland areas, between conurbations and villages, between most of the mainland and the ultra-peripheral islands."
"We have stated time and time again that this shows that structural appropriations, despite everything, are qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient for promoting the much mentioned objective of economic and social cohesion, as it calls at least for a thorough compliance with the Edinburgh Agreement which, in 1992, called for 1, 27 % of the Union's GDP to be set aside for the Community budget."
"Finally, we can only remedy the delays in the execution of the last two years of the second Community support framework - the result not of incompetence, a lack of projects or, even less, because there is no need - or in the fulfilment of global objectives in 1999, if the national budget can spare its own appropriations so that it can meet the additionality required by the structural actions and that will not happen without an increase in the tax burden. This will be even truer if, as the current Portuguese government is doing, we insist on a strict and blinkered fulfilment of the Maastricht nominal convergence criteria."
"I should like to end by complimenting Mr Chichester and making it clear that I am happy with his willingness to cooperate with his colleagues on the committee, and to accept many of the amendments which I tabled on behalf of my Group."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we Members of Parliament welcome the diversification of the new programme planning in the three countries Greece, Spain and Portugal, especially the concentration of investment on important infrastructure measures, the more broadly-based assistance to services and the more broadly-based assistance to employment, we nevertheless call for urgent improvements in the implementation of the structural funds in these countries."
"That applies to Greece."
"As in the past there are obstacles to innovative projects in Greece because of its inefficient and insufficiently transparent administration."
"Those responsible for small projects find the situation particularly difficult."
"It is also urgently necessary for the Greek authorities to implement the provisions of the regulation, to include regional and local authorities in the planning and implementation of projects and to insert the projects, in particular the transport projects, into an integral, sustained development strategy in order to avoid any adverse effects on regional planning and the environment."
"For Spain, the use of water is increasingly becoming a key development issue."
"That is why the protection of this resource must be a major factor of project decisions."
"In the case of Portugal, it is energy resources."
"Overall, the statement made in the tenth chapter of the Delors white paper has proved true: that the EU will remain inefficient as long as it is geared to the exploitation of finite natural resources and disregards the potential of labour."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs Sierra on her good work, and also to say that I agree with her report as a whole."
"It is true that there are still great regional disparities in Spain, but it is also true that our GDP is moving ever closer to the Community average."
"In this connection the structural funds have contributed very substantially, not only to this process of convergence, in terms of income per capita, but also to the major change which has taken place in the Spanish regions in terms of modernization of the production base, better linkage between areas, vocational training and generally improved levels of wellbeing."
"Spain is making a great effort to achieve the nominal convergence objectives required for access to the single currency."
"Clearly such an approach to the convergence objectives demands a very stringent monetary and budgetary policy, and the weaker the region the greater the negative impact of such a restrictive policy."
"The structural funds and the Cohesion Fund are thus of inestimable help to the process of real convergence of the least developed Spanish regions."
"I should like to add that I agree with Mrs Sierra on the need for information to reach potential beneficiaries of the structural funds fully and promptly, so that we never have to be told that such or such an aid has not been applied for because its existence was unknown."
"I regard any step taken by the Commission along these lines as highly positive, particularly as regards local authorities, which are closest to the citizen, and also the social partners."
"And I entirely agree with the rapporteur that the effort to overcome regional disparities within the European Union will only achieve success when the objective of economic and social cohesion is included in the formulation and implementation of all Community policies."
"Mr President, may I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sierra, on her work and on the tactful and understanding way in which considerations and opinions to which she was not a party have been incorporated in it."
"The importance of economic and social cohesion to the European Union project is beyond all doubt."
"There will be a Union to the extent that there is genuine cohesion."
"This is why we must focus our attention and efforts on the instruments which will make it possible, and on improving their real, and not just their statistical, efficiency."
"This would represent a major contribution to the construction of the European Union."
"Hence it essential from every viewpoint to evaluate the regional impact of the structural funds."
"The evaluation is needed, but as a measure serving basically to draw conclusions to be taken up where possible in order to improve both the scope of the Funds and the actual evaluation system."
"Mrs Sierra's report shows that, whilst the Funds have contributed to Spain's convergence with the other Member States, the process has been slow and uneven: slow overall and uneven as regards the regions, to the point of increasing regional inequalities and differences."
"This ought to make us think seriously."
"As instruments for achieving cohesion between regions the structural funds are intrinsically good, but their effectiveness depends both on the amount of money and on the human factor; it is just as dependent on attitude and culture as on economics."
"In the last resort, each Member State is responsible for using the instrument to achieve cohesion."
"In Spain regional and local powers are of particular relevance in terms of effectiveness."
"The new Community support frameworks reflect the importance for economic and social cohesion of developing and training human resources, which should prompt us to set up an educational system with creativity and development of the ability to learn and adapt as its main objectives in a continuously changing society, plus completely non-academic vocational training which is socially valued and suited to the context of the day after tomorrow."
"Why is this only relatively effective?"
"We need to improve information, and above all the transparency of such information."
"It must reach - and really reach - local bodies and the actual potential beneficiaries."
"Because of their own size and range, and the complexity of the Funds, local bodies have great difficulty in designing and managing projects, and need advice and technical help."
"The pump in the basement has to raise water to the top floor, but on the top floor there must also be a tap to turn on and a glass with a capable hand to hold it."
"We are talking about making the European Union possible. We are talking about getting its citizens to create it."
"I assume no one will object if I suggest to the House that we keep the debate going for a little longer, without having the suspension during it, in order that the three Members who are still waiting to speak can do so and to allow time for Mrs Wulf-Mathies to reply. She will be not be here after 9 o'clock, and I would not like the debate to come to a close without a reply from the Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this evening's debate on the structural funds is of great importance, and I should like to stress that, although these funds account for almost 30 % of the European Union budget, this budget is less than 2 % of the gross domestic product of all the Community Member States."
"Hence we may expect good results from the structural funds, but we must also be aware of their amount in relation to the Community's gross domestic product."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Sierra González for her magnificent work on the effect of the structural funds in Spain, and their influence on regional development throughout these years."
"I believe progress has been made here and that the participation of local and regional authorities, in strict and intelligent application of the principle of subsidiarity, can contribute to a more effective use of the structural funds."
"In this connection is has to be recognised that each State of the European Union has a different internal structure and that in some the powers of regions and local authorities will allow more effective use of the money assigned to the structural funds."
"I should also like to comment on something already mentioned here by the chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Mr Speciale, concerning the influence which the new composition of the structural funds may have from 1999 onwards, particularly within the framework of a possible expansion of the European Union."
"Commissioner Mrs Wulf-Mathies has already spoken several times of the prospects for such structural funds, which I believe to be a subject we cannot overlook but must begin to consider, since Spain, today the largest recipient in absolute terms of money from the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, may of course see its position change in future; this is a matter which must be considered sufficiently in advance in order to anticipate any possible consequences."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mr Chichester on his balanced, conscientious and consensual work."
"Indeed I go along with his over-all judgment and think that these reports are very much a judgment of what has happened in the past, a kind of stock-taking; I would go as far as to say that their most important aspect is that they clear up any doubt as to whether the Structural Funds have been well applied."
"There are plenty of rumours that the Structural Funds are corrupt, and vested interests have used arguments in the European debate to fight the Structural Funds. Every time we assess the Structural Funds in this Assembly we find out that sometimes occasionally money has gone astray and sometimes that has been done in an underhand way but we have to see the wood for the trees and the wood is a positive one in this case."
"For example, in my country, to which Mr Chichester referred, it is obvious - and there is a general consensus - that we have achieved growth which we had never previously achieved and, at the same time, that far-reaching reforms have been possible. As a result, Portugal now has a competitive economy which can compete in the 21st century."
"It could be said that, if the country had had the same growth rate, in other words around 1 % greater than the European average, since the beginning of the century as it has had in recent years it would now be one of the most highly developed countries in Europe."
"This is sufficient proof of the usefulness of these Funds which have not only benefited the Portuguese economy and the Portuguese people."
"Many European companies which have invested in Portugal have also benefited and have increased their markets - we are not dealing with some kind of Far West here - and many a European company such as Ford, Volkswagen or Siemens, to name just a few, have realised how much profit they can make from these Structural Funds; all of this, in the end, has actually boosted the competitiveness of major European undertakings, and helped them to increase their markets. They have even made investments showing that, at the end of the day, some of these peripheral economies were much more dynamic and far more able to develop than they seemed."
"We might also say that perhaps too much emphasis was laid upon basic infrastructures and that there are still serious sectoral weaknesses; it is also true that there are still regional inequalities but, after all, neither Rome nor Pavia were built in a day and the second Community support framework was quite rightly negotiated in order to offset some of those weaknesses and introduce qualitative factors, including calls for investment in science and technology in a country such as Portugal."
"Perhaps it might be a good thing to stop thinking of science and technology as something which is reserved for the more advanced countries whereas less advanced countries should only have their infrastructure improved. That is the best way of going about creating new inequalities in Europe."
"We have to deal with new development in a more positive way."
"And here you have to call a spade a spade and we have to point out that since enlargement the very positive cohesion policy, which has borne excellent results, obviously needs another Community budget."
"Nobody is allowed to speak of another budget."
"It is true that, for example, in European Parliament reports on the IGC no-one could refer to the budget because money was a taboo word."
"Unless we look at this problem seriously and realise that the word 'money' is a vital one we will not resolve the vital problems, for Portugal, Spain, Greece, or for the whole European economy."
"Unless we have a cohesion policy there can be no enlargement."
"It would be a very poor start, for example, if the enlargement of the European Union had to be financed by the cohesion appropriations as was hinted at recently."
"The truth is that enlargement itself should also be a cohesion instrument and should be seen from that viewpoint."
"That is why I think that the fundamental conclusion that we have reached is that, although development brings new problems with it, we cannot slide back into nostalgia for underdevelopment and the policy of cohesion is essential for European unity."
"Mr President, I think the discussions and studies in committee are very relevant for us, as is this general debate on the position and application of the structural funds in three 'cohesion countries' , as we usually call them."
"I believe that we all agree in general terms with the report prepared by Mrs Sierra González, who has helped us all considerably and whom we should congratulate."
"We must try to draw some conclusions in addition to those pointed out by other colleagues."
"I think one is that inequalities persist and we shall have to draw conclusions from that."
"The Commission could do the three 'cohesion countries' great service by producing a thorough evaluation report which could be used by governments to correct policies."
"In the case of the Spanish Government, another key conclusion is that the tendency on the part of previous governments to develop a national policy not consistent with the objectives laid down by Community policies and the support frameworks must be corrected."
"Such an evaluation document could be of great importance in this context."
"We must get across the message that the European dimension of national policies must be present in all areas."
"We should like, Mr President, to remind the Commission of something we have said on many occasions: the Commission must evaluate the quality of works carried out."
"We have put questions on this matter on several occasions, since construction work carried out two or three years ago are now in very poor shape."
"On more than one occasion I have recalled the case of 'Motorway 92' in Andalusia, which was completed in 1992 and is currently unusable."
"I think the Community budget may have been defrauded here and the Commission should set up an inquiry."
"We have all stressed the need for the people, the social bodies which have to start investing and, of course, the local authorities to be informed."
"Why do we say this?"
"Because, as an example, the Community support frameworks in Spain were not even discussed with certain regional parliaments, and this trend obviously needs to be changed."
"Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, it has to be said that, looking to the future, these structural funds are tremendously important to countries with a low level of development, despite problems of management and evaluation, and we hope that, between Council, Commission and Parliament a formula will be found for them to continue after 1999."
"Mr President, I thank the three rapporteurs and the committees responsible for the excellent reports and above all for the work achieved at the hearings, which well describe the programme situation in the field."
"I have already responded in part to the main questions raised in all three reports in my own report and in my statement on Mr Teverson's report: in spite of the different background situations and problems and the difficult framework conditions resulting from economic and structural crises and the consolidation of the budgets, undeniably positive effects can be recorded in all three countries, and there indeed we all agree."
"But it is also clear that significant structural successes can only be achieved in the long term and that the degree of success depends largely on whether the administrative obstacles can be overcome at both Commission and Member State level, on the participation of regional and local authorities and the social partners and on the quality of the programmes and their evaluation."
"Further intensive work needs to be done to improve these aspects."
"As regards priorities - and here too I agree with you - we must take more care to concentrate on combating unemployment, developing human resources and strengthening small and medium-sized undertakings."
"Infrastructure investment must be directed more at the structurally weakest regions and integrated in a strategy of sustained development."
"There remain major obstacles to be overcome as regards achieving environmental objectives, although I believe that the persistent efforts made by the Commission are leading not just to stricter respect for European environmental standards but also to a greater understanding of integrated regional development plans, aimed at improving the quality of life, technological know-how and the employment potential of environmental protection."
"The Commission agrees with some of the main points of the assessments and the concerns expressed by the three rapporteurs."
"As Mr Klironomos rightly notes, new structures and mechanisms must be created and in particular applied so that the second CSF can be implemented more efficiently."
"I fully acknowledge the courageous decisions taken by the Greek Government with a view to improving the public services situation and revolutionize the public contract system."
"Large-scale legislative measures had to be taken in order to reform the public works system, create what is called the MOD or Management Organization Unit and the one-stop shop and turn to private financing for major projects."
"What has to be done now, with the help of the new structures and qualified teams, is to speed up the implementation of the structural assistance and attract more private investment into Greece."
"Even though, contrary to what many people feared, the rate for Greece is almost exactly the average for all fifteen Member States in terms of the take-up of funds for 1994-96 and last year ECU 400 million more appropriations were committed than planned, there are a few programmes that urgently need to be adjusted."
"The Greek Government, my colleague Mr Flynn and I myself are currently endeavouring to ensure that programmes with an alarmingly low take-up rate can still get under way."
"Mr Chichester's report makes it clear that Portugal is certainly one of the success stories of structural policy, as others here have underlined."
"That applies in particular to investment and take-up of funds, even though Portugal has just recently been overtaken by Spain; but that may also stimulate them to compete to do equally well and thereby achieve better results for all concerned."
"In that respect it would appear correct to strengthen the development trends that began with CSF 2 and to define qualitative and quantitative goals."
"The creation and protection of jobs is a priority that is to receive greater attention in the interim evaluation of the operational measures, namely by giving priority to the use of the deflator for jobcreation measures and by the creation of regional employment initiatives on a partnership basis."
"I would like to emphasize, as nearly all the speakers have, that the quality of the programmes improves the more the people involved on the spot participate in the decision-making and implementing process."
"Mr Chichester, the goals are certainly ambitious, but I do not think they are entirely unrealistic if we make joint efforts."
"The interim evaluation of the operational measures undertaken jointly by the Portuguese Government and the Commission is designed to target the strategy, administrative structures and available resources more specifically towards Portuguese development needs."
"It must also examine whether development poles need to be created in central areas to prevent the gap between coastal and central regions from widening even further."
"Last year the Commission considerably improved the coordination between regional and cohesion funds, and not only in Portugal, so that both instruments can work together more effectively to promote regional development."
"Synergies with the other funds are also being strengthened in order to make the measures more efficient and we are happy to take up the recommendations that have been made on this subject."
"A common problem referred to in the reports by Mr Chichester and Mrs Sierra González is the need to use the water resources of the Iberian peninsula in such a way as to combat the drought in both countries successfully and promote their development."
"The Commission has therefore supported Spain and Portugal with the appropriate studies and is offering a range of instruments for common action in this area under INTERREG 2 C. We hope that this support will also contribute to the success of the negotiations on common water resources, for in the end both countries could only benefit from taking a joint approach."
"On the whole the Commission endorses Mrs Sierra González' conclusions on the situation of the Spanish regions."
"But I would stress that the second CSF lays special emphasis on improving the production system as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating jobs, for to reduce the extremely high unemployment figure is our common concern, which is why vocational training measures are receiving considerably more support."
"In that respect we have taken on board a number of points of criticism made by you."
"With regard to the involvement of regional and local authorities, let me point out that at the Commission's instigation a special committee was set up in every region in order to involve the regions in the decision-making process and integrate the programme implementation more closely."
"Both aspects are important, because this means that all programmes can then be evaluated and decided on jointly in that committee."
"For the rest, about 10 % of the CSF funding for Objective 1 areas and 16 % of funding for Objective 2 areas is being used for projects that come under the responsibility of local authorities and we will make every effort to make this plain to those concerned so that they can make practical use of the resources."
"When it comes to the mid-term review, the Commission will examine on a basis of partnership with Spain, as it will with all the other Member States, whether the chosen strategy for achieving the goals set for 1999 are appropriate or whether some of the individual intervention measures need adjusting."
"Following what the last speaker said, I would like to point out once again that thank God we have now overcome the Member States' opposition to involving the Commission in the evaluation."
"In the past Spain in particular took the position that the evaluation was no business of the Commission's."
"So I think we are glad we have got beyond that point and that we now carry out joint evaluations and that the interim evaluations in particular give a chance to change things at the halfway mark and set the priorities in such a way as to ensure that they can be implemented better and more effectively and that we are not forced to continue doing things we do not regard as for the best during the remainder of the programme period."
"I thank you for the debate and I thank the speakers who took part in it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"1995 annual report on R & D activities"
"The next item is the report (A4-0195/96) by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the 1995 annual report on the research and technological development activities of the European Union (COM(95)0443 - C4-0437/95)."
"Commissioner, the 1995 R & D report we are discussing today is the first the Commission has submitted under the provisions of Article 130p and we agreed in committee that this report is acceptable as a first attempt of its kind."
"But we expect a little more in future."
"We expect that in future this report will provide a structured overview of research activities, which will help us to evaluate them."
"Until now, and that is certainly a positive aspect, this report has provided a broad overview of research activities, a broad and good overview."
"But the analytical aspect is still missing from this report."
"It does not provide adequate justification for the new priorities that are being proposed."
"That is somewhat regrettable given that we are constantly discussing the expansion and further development of R & D activities."
"Following the refinancing of the Fourth Programme we are now discussing the Fifth."
"There is no consistent analysis of what we have done so far."
"Let me refer to another area."
"It is certainly curious for us to be discussing the evaluation of the transport programme for the Third Framework Programme while at the same time we are drawing up the Fifth Programme."
"So in general we need a more consistent and speedy evaluation and analysis of the Commission's research activities to enable us to really draw on these experiences for the next programme."
"That is why five simple and clear criteria must be established for the 1996 research report on the basis of the experience gained from the 1995 report."
"One: we need a standard system of evaluation to make the individual programmes a little more comparable and make what we have achieved with these programmes more comparable over the years."
"Two: we must make greater efforts to evaluate the actual effect of these programmes."
"Instead of a mere description, we also need an attempt to evaluate them and then draw the appropriate conclusions."
"The problems can certainly be highlighted too."
"Of course it is a pleasure to submit a research report telling of the positive side, but an honest approach also means identifying and discussing the problems."
"Three: research funding must be integrated more closely in the other European Union programmes."
"We need closer investigation of areas where the programmes overlap and also of where they might need to be supplemented."
"Four: it must be made clearer what sort of practical problems have arisen in relation to support for research, whether in relation to applications, approvals or implementation."
"On the basis of this analysis of the practical difficulties, we then of course need proposals for solutions in order to improve matters."
"Five: we have monitoring reports on the specific programmes."
"Both I and the committee think that the findings of the monitoring reports should be incorporated in the next annual report, but in the form of findings with comments by the Commission, not of a 700-page document."
"If these five criteria are respected, the report really can make a substantial contribution to the European Union's further research activities."
"The 1995 research report was submitted rather belatedly."
"This was of course due to the fact that it represented a transition from the third to the fourth report and was the first of its kind. I hope that the reports drawn up at the beginning of each year can be submitted rather sooner in future to give us sufficient time to debate them and reach conclusions."
"Commissioner, would you please take these five suggestions for the next research report on board!"
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1995 we received an evaluation report on the transition from the third to the fourth framework programme."
"And at exactly the same time we are moving full steam ahead towards the fifth framework programme."
"Unlike the previous speaker I must say that our group can understand why a certain time elapses between execution and evaluation."
"However, I really do wonder how we can learn from experience if we plan the future before we have taken a proper critical look at the past."
"Surely we should approach things rather differently here."
"Secondly, as has been said, but I want to go a step further: the links with the research aspects of other programmes, whether programmes of aid or TACIS and PHARE, or all our cohesion programmes - and much has been said about structural policy today - the links between the research aspects of these programmes and the purely research programmes should be identified more clearly."
"This year in particular the Commission has talked a great deal about coordinating the various research policies."
"It would be very useful if the Commission tried to begin by coordinating its own activities properly."
"It is always best to start at home."
"Thirdly: in my group's view, evaluation should not be based on the idea that we continue to go on as before."
"We have seen over the years how specific programmes keep being drawn up in the same way because that is how it always was."
"Instead, strategies should be defined for improving efficiency and then these same strategies should be reviewed in subsequent programmes and whatever successes or failures emerge should be examined more clearly and in depth."
"Last point: I wonder whether we should not as a matter of principle and in view particularly of the fifth framework programme also give some thought to whether evaluation as it currently stands makes any sense or not."
"We need objective criteria, comprehensible criteria, however difficult this may be."
"Nor do they need to be generally applicable throughout the world, they need only create some sort of continuity for us from one year to another year."
"At present each evaluation report forms a separate entity."
"There is little chance of comparing them."
"To return to the beginning: we can only learn from the mistakes of the past if we constantly re-examine them, and it is extremely urgent that we do so in the context of the fifth framework programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mr Lange on the high quality of his work."
"His report will enable us to improve the transparency of the fifth R & D programme, or at any rate for the time being of the fourth framework programme on research and development."
"It also complies with a specific commitment laid down by Article 130p) of the Treaty on the European Union."
"This report includes a number of specific data relating to various programmes, but without adding any appropriate analysis."
"What is lacking, then, is any specific data regarding the evaluation of the various programmes and the information relating to the break-down of the funds allocated, respectively, to universities, undertakings and research institutions."
"Furthermore, I must stress that the report also fails to deal with the most important problems."
"There is, for example, a clear increase in the number of unsatisfied applications for participation, because the Member States have reduced part of the funds intended for research."
"In this context, and in order to limit applicants' wastage of time and money, it is essential to make an effort to simplify applications for access to the programmes."
"This is fundamental in order to allow access by small and medium-sized enterprises, whose financial resources cannot stand such additional costs."
"I believe that the Community budget allocated to research must not be reduced."
"The European Union's research and development policy is, indeed, the key to the future development and competitiveness of our undertakings by comparison with our competitors - especially by comparison with our natural competitors, the United States and Japan, but also by comparison with the new emerging countries whose capacities for production and marketing must in future be taken into account."
"Moreover, it will be necessary to encourage the participation of certain laboratories engaged in basic research."
"Hitherto, they have derived little benefit from the programmes proposed by the Commission."
"Basic research, apart from the fact that it broadens the area of existing knowledge, makes it possible to prepare for the future and even to avoid tragedy, mad cow disease being an excellent example of this."
"Finally, an effort at coordination should be made between the Community programmes and the Member States' research activities, for example encouraging appropriate distribution of the results."
"I therefore endorse the conclusions of the rapporteur when he stresses the need to institute a uniform system of evaluation. Its purpose will be to allow a comparison between the implementation and the results of the various programmes."
"Allowing for a system of this kind will require the preparation of follow-up reports by independent experts, which incidentally do not appear in the annual report."
"In the absence of such a measure, a posteriori evaluation will be difficult."
"The Commission will lack the evaluation necessary for the perspective, a lack which will also affect the preparation of the political decisions appropriate to the responsibilities of our Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it amazes me that time after time the Commission tries to hoodwink the European Parliament by fudging data."
"Take this report."
"It addresses not the annual report for 1995 as the title would suggest, but the report on Union research activities carried out in 1994 and the third framework programme."
"I ask myself, as previous speakers have done, why it is that evaluation reports always reach Parliament so late."
"After all, in order to shape good policy for future research one needs to know the results of research done under earlier programmes."
"I urge the Commission to take due note of conclusion 12 that in future annual reports should be considered as soon as possible in the following year and by 31 March at the latest."
"The Union's prime role in the area of research and development is to promote cooperation and not to promote projects and programmes."
"The research policy of Member States can only be coordinated if there is cooperation."
"In future annual reports the Commission should include a specific section on the relationship between the research activities of the Union and those of individual Member States."
"In this way duplication or aberrant strategies can be avoided and the best possible return can be obtained on the research funds deployed."
"Preparations for the fifth framework programme are already well under way."
"The Commission has even produced a document giving draft guidelines."
"Splendid."
"With an eye to the political decisions required it is necessary for the individual programmes forming part of the fourth framework programme to be subjected to regular critical analysis using a uniform set of methods."
"Annual reports, evaluations by the Commission, are not just a requirement but documents of material importance when it comes to setting the priorities for future research."
"Mr President, I am very glad that this first annual report from the Commission has finally reached Parliament - better late than never."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I think it is of the utmost importance that we have such a report available to us, since we need to assess the activity on which the decisions we take concerning various research projects later on will be based."
"It is important above all in view of the enormous sums of money involved."
"The Fifth Framework Programme involves billions of ECU scaled over five years, and we must know what we are spending that money on."
"Against this background, it is regrettable that the report does not live up to the expectations raised when one reads Article 130p of the Treaty. The annual report is written in exclusively positive terms, there is nothing about the problems that reasonably arise in this type of activity."
"I cannot find any analysis in the report or proposals from the Commission as to how the problems that exist are to be remedied."
"The Swedish group of experts investigating public finance in February this year published a report which, amongst other things, said that the EU's own assessments were often defective."
"This annual report from the Commission thus confirms the conclusion of the Swedish report on that point."
"I therefore hope that the next annual report from the Commission will include an evaluation of the results and conclusions with regard to them."
"The Swedish report also contained some swingeing criticism of the EU's research, particularly as regards the dissemination of research results."
"The EU must do much, much better here in future."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission will take to heart what is in this report from Mr Lange, which we in the Green Group will be supporting, and that the Commission will learn from its experience and, next time, present a better annual report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I should like to thank Mr Lange for his careful examination of the 1995 annual report on the Union's research activities."
"Mr Lange has conducted an in-depth analysis which has enabled him to make very valuable recommendations."
"I should add, though, that I do consider some of the views contained in this report, and expressed in the motion for a resolution under discussion today, to be a little harsh."
"To some extent, I feel, this harshness is based on a misunderstanding."
"So what I would like to do this evening is briefly to recall the nature and function of the annual report on the Union's research activities, to place that report in its context amid the overall apparatus for providing information on, evaluating and monitoring research activities, and finally to let you know what improvements the Commission intends to make to that apparatus, along the lines of the recommendations contained in your motion for a resolution."
"The submission by the Commission of an annual report on the Union's research activities complies with an obligation stated in Article 130p) of the Treaty. The annual report is not an evaluating report."
"Nor is its function to enable research activities to be reoriented or new priorities defined."
"Its purpose, first and foremost, is to provide information."
"A rigorous evaluation of the research programmes and their results is, of course, essential."
"But that is provided by means of instruments other than the annual report."
"That is the second point upon which I would like to touch."
"The Commission's communication of 22 May 1996 on the evaluation and monitoring of the programmes makes a very clear distinction between two functions."
"The monitoring function is provided through the annual monitoring reports on the specific programmes and the framework programme."
"Those reports are essentially factual in nature."
"Next, the function of evaluation: the objective here is to assess the degree to which the programmes have achieved the objectives set for them, and how suitable they are for the intended purposes."
"Another objective is to identify those areas where the Union's activities should be redirected."
"With this in mind, five-yearly reports evaluating these specific programmes and the framework for them are prepared by panels of independent experts."
"The first monitoring reports have been sent to the European Parliament."
"The first five-year evaluation reports are in preparation, and will be available at the end of the year, at the time of the debate on the fifth framework programme."
"As far as the framework programme is concerned, Mr Étienne Davignon is chairing the group responsible for preparing this report."
"The annual report, which like the monitoring reports is essentially factual in nature, will take its place alongside this dual apparatus."
"Finally, as agreed, a few words on our intentions for the future."
"The 1995 annual report certainly leaves room for improvement."
"There are three facts I should mention by way of explanation for this running-in period."
"First, this report was the first of its kind. Its preparation coincided with the installation of the new evaluation monitoring arrangements."
"It also coincided with the launch of the fourth framework programme, the initial information on which was not available until quite late in the year."
"But I would like to be very clear about this: the Commission intends to use all the appropriate diligence in carrying out the evaluation and monitoring work."
"The communication being prepared for tomorrow, which provides guidelines on the fifth framework programme, explicitly refers to the need to develop an instrument of the indicator type which enables the progress and performance of the programmes to be measured."
"Improvements are going to be made to the entire apparatus of information, evaluation and monitoring, which has to be regarded as a whole."
"Those improvements will be specifically along the lines recommended in your motion for a resolution."
"A harmonized system for recording information on the implementation status of the programmes will be set up."
"Those factors which are related to the aspects causing more concern, especially the implementation periods and the break-down of financing by participant or by region, will be more clearly illustrated."
"Elements of a qualitative assessment of the implementation of the programmes and the results obtained will be provided."
"Efforts will be made to expedite the production of the annual report, within the time limits necessary for the availability of the mathematical data."
"In conclusion, I believe that the annual report, the monitoring reports and the evaluation reports constitute a highly complex array of instruments at the disposal of the Members of Parliament, and indeed of the authorities in the Member States."
"This should enable them to gain a full and accurate idea of the Union's research activities, and to assess the extent to which their stated objectives are being achieved."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Common system of value-added tax"
"The next item is the report (A4-0225/96) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of Value Added Tax (level of the standard rate) (COM(95)0731 - C4-0153/96-95/0362(CNS))."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal amending the directive on the common system of value added tax was discussed in detail in recent months in the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy as the committee responsible."
"In a total of four meetings that committee examined the Commission proposal and the committee members gave their views on it."
"The legislative proposal before you was adopted on 26 June 1996."
"The purpose of this proposed directive is to prevent the different rates of value added tax and tax structures in the Member States from drifting further apart."
"Since the transition to the levying of value added tax in the country of origin of a commodity can no longer be implemented on schedule, the Commission is rightly attempting with this minimal proposal to limit further distortions."
"In order to prevent the value added tax rates from drifting further apart, a future maximum tax rate of 15 % is to be fixed alongside the minimum tax rate of 15 % currently in force."
"Since all standard value added tax rates in the Member States of the European Union - there are many exceptions, not just for agricultural products but also for others, such as books - now lie between 15 % in Germany and Luxembourg and 25 % in Denmark and Sweden, this fixing of a maximum rate, which is to apply from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1998, i.e., for two years, will not directly cause any changes in particular tax rates in the Member States."
"Although that is the case, the Commission's proposal is a good one because it ensures that tax rates cannot drift further apart during a period when no decision could be taken in the past."
"Under the Commission's proposal the Council, however, will have to decide not later than 1998 whether the spread of value added tax rates should be further reduced."
"In July, Commissioner Monti presented a programme on this for the single market with a precise time schedule which is very ambitious and which we for our part unconditionally support."
"The Commission's present proposal, which is basically designed to maintain the degree of harmonization achieved hitherto, must not be allowed to conceal the fact that hitherto the Council, which is responsible - and not the Commission - has blocked any furtherreaching harmonization of tax systems through the unanimity principle and that it is not certainly not impossible that it will continue to do so."
"It is crucially important to harmonize tax systems in the Union with a view both to the third stage of economic and monetary union and to an effective employment policy."
"That is why a closer approximation of tax rates is urgently needed to ensure the sound operation of the single market and to prevent distortions."
"Only with the early creation of a highly uniform European tax area can we remove many of the administrative barriers to trade and create and protect jobs in the long term."
"In this connection I would like, as rapporteur, to give my views on the amendment tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which rejects the 25 % ceiling."
"A similar proposal did not obtain a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and was rejected by a majority and I would ask Members to do the same now in plenary."
"The Commission has done its homework now and I would urge you to really change the current transitional rules on taxation in the country of destination to taxation in the country of origin, for the administrative outlay, the opportunities for tax evasion and the many problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises should not be underestimated."
"I would thank Mr Monti personally for not losing sight of the objective of tax harmonization in spite of a rather sobering interim balance sheet and for not being discouraged from making constructive proposals in spite of the manifold opposition from the Member States."
"It is now up to the Council finally to get on with the harmonization of value added tax."
"Mr President, I shall concentrate on the amendment put down by the Socialist Group to the effect that there should be no ceiling on VAT rates."
"I think we should take as our defining framework the economic stage which Member States have reached at the moment, and the economies which Economic and Monetary Union will necessitate."
"Then we have to look at Delors' White Paper to which Commissioner Monti also referred in a recent communication in March. This says that Member States need to shift the burden of labour costs on to other factors."
"If we start with this last thing and look where that burden might reasonably be shifted to, we see that capital, which is certainly not possible in the immediate future, capital which is nevertheless the most mobile factor, and perhaps an increase in excise duties but certainly in VAT, really offers the only realistic opportunity for Member States to shift the tax burden from labour to other factors."
"The Commission really admits as much in its document of March last when it cautiously proposes that when the definitive system is adopted one should perhaps opt for a percentage a few points higher than the average in order to compensate for labour costs."
"If you look at the background the Commission's thinking is to say the least inconsistent here, because the Commission is in fact, and without real need, limiting the Member States' room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy."
"Mr Langen made the point earlier that at least two Member States are already very close to that 25 % threshold."
"Why is there no immediate urgency?"
"Because the only reason for aligning the rates more closely would be a move to the definitive system."
"Because under the current system, as a study conducted for the Commission reveals, there is no fundamental distortion of competition between Member States."
"In other words, convergence of the rates is only needed really when we change to the definitive system."
"But when is the definitive system going to happen?"
"The Commission has not even got as far as submitting a proposal."
"All they have submitted is a discussion document, which I have not yet received, incidentally, but it has since become clear that if the system does come, it will not come before the year 2000."
"My own feeling is that unless the present system throws up so much fraud that it really becomes unworkable, all Member States may perhaps be persuaded to move to the definitive system."
"But reports reaching me so far are that there is no evidence of such large-scale fraud."
"To my great surprise, I have to say."
"I shall be very curious to hear what arguments the Commission uses to insist that the present system is so very unsatisfactory that we have to change."
"In short, given that we still have no exact information on when we shall be moving to the definitive system and what the situation will be, I think it is very premature, in these years before Economic and Monetary Union when all the Member States are under enormous fiscal pressure, to restrict the Member States' room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy and for this reason we of the Socialist Group have put down an amendment to abolish this ceiling."
"Mr President, first I want to give warm thanks to Mr Langen for his clear and convincing report, which of course deserves our approval."
"Today we are taking a major step forward towards the closer approximation of taxes in the European Union."
"Just because we want competition between the different places and systems of the European Union, we need common rules of play which everyone observes The proposed rate - from a minimum of 15 % to a maximum of 25 % - fully reflect the needs of today."
"The German Social Democrats have even objected to the possibility of an increase from 15 % to 16 % and they certainly consider it totally wrong to cease to apply the ceiling rates."
"That is why I cannot understand, Mr Metten, why you are even questioning the 25 % rate today, which would of course mean that even higher rates than this one would be possible."
"Without the restrictions and rules proposed by the Commission, there could not be any competition between the different systems in Europe and we would end up with a kind of catch as catch can."
"We cannot and do not want that; quite the contrary, I am convinced that the European Union must in fact take further fiscal measures in the coming months and years in order to put an end to tax evasion."
"Surely we cannot accept that large earners, for instance, should pay lower taxes simply because they have moved their place of residence from their home country to a neighbouring EU state."
"If we want to put a check on tax evasion, then we need not less but more European cooperation in this area."
"One particularly serious disadvantage of the capital gains tax is that nationals are treated worse than foreigners."
"As soon as we treat nationals and foreigners the same in relation to capital gains tax throughout the European Union we will have overcome the main cause of tax evasion and taken a major step toward fiscal justice."
"Mr President, the harmonization of value-added tax is both wrong in principle and unworkable in practice. value-added tax varies greatly in both its contribution to and its purpose in the budgets of the Member States."
"Harmonization will create chaos in national finance."
"A reduction in the top rate of taxation is a further threat to public infrastructures in countries where the tax is a significant source of revenue."
"Tax harmonization also violates an important principle in all democratic systems, namely a people's right to tax itself."
"We should therefore realize that a common taxation policy is not politically workable."
"Nor is it necessary in European cooperation; on the contrary it can damage that cooperation."
"Mr President, I am among those who are critical of this report in its present form, and that for several reasons."
"Firstly, I do not consider that different rates of value-added tax represent a significant barrier to trade."
"Economic barriers to trade which distort competition arise when goods from a country or region are discriminated against, for example by imposing a tariff targeted at another country or the rest of the world in general."
"In this case, other countries' goods are penalized in favour of those of the country imposing the tariff, and the relative advantages of trade do not benefit the consumers."
"Where different rates of value-added tax are concerned, this discrimination does not operate."
"If a country has high rates of tax, they are aimed at all production and not to a specific area."
"Thus, Mr President, different rates of tax do not mean a distortion of competition."
"Every country in a democratic system should be able to decide on its own taxes."
"Political views, for example as regards how large the public sector should be or how comprehensive the social security system should be, vary from one country in the Union to another."
"It should be possible for these different appraisals to be reflected in different taxes."
"Furthermore, I entirely agree with the amendment tabled by Mr Metten."
"We have a situation of serious budget deficits in our Member States."
"Many governments are now seeking to bring down these deficits by cutting back on public services."
"But a budget can also be improved by boosting revenue, instead of cutting expenditure."
"Member States must have the right, if they consider it appropriate, to increase value-added tax to a rate above the proposed limit of 25 %."
"Imposing this upper limit is tantamount to putting an upper limit on public services."
"Finally, Mr President, I consider that the proposals on absolutely identical rates of value-added tax is wrong for the simple reason that each country needs to arrive at its own optimum mix of taxes (income taxes, value-added taxes etc) in order to achieve economic effectiveness."
"I believe that the proposal for identical rates of value-added tax is economically ineffective, not effective."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Driving licences"
"The next item is the report (A4-0206/96) by Mr Farassino, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences (COM(96)0055 - C4-0207/96-95/0040(SYN))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report proposes that Directive 91/439 be amended in order to adopt a basic harmonized set of codes for the additional information to be included on driving licences and the principles governing their use in accordance with the provisions of the Directive, as can be seen from Article 1; to set up a committee to advise the Commission on all questions relating to the annexes to Directive 91/439 and to scientific and technical progress (Article 2); to adapt Article 3(3), third indent, of Directive 91/439 to bring this provision more into line with the trade description, including a reduction in the maximum design speed for motorcycles from 50 km/h to 45 km/h."
"As rapporteur I have favourably received the Commission's proposal, which harmonizes the system for codifying on driving licences the wording of the conditions under which the licence has been issued."
"It will certainly facilitate the free movement of persons in the Community, particularly disabled drivers, and will contribute to road safety by making it easier throughout most of Europe to check driving licences where so required, whatever the issuing Member State, the nationality of the official checking them or the administration managing them."
"The system of harmonized codes will also apply to the Member States of the European Economic Area."
"This having been said, as rapporteur I have sought to meet the specific requirements and requests made by certain Member States in the amendments brought to the attention of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and which I now present to Parliament."
"Firstly, in addition to the information codes, the Commission should also propose in the near future the subcodes already worked out in meetings between the Commission and national experts, particularly for codes 04 (medical certificate), 05 (restrictions for medical reasons), 44 (modifications to motor cycles) and 55 (combination of modifications to motorcycles)."
"Secondly, provision should be made for a new universal code 00, to make provision for very special cases, such as those cited by Mrs Muscardini in Amendment No 8."
"Furthermore, the additions requested to codes 70 and 71 concerning the indication of the symbol of the third country in accordance with the harmonized EEC/UN list would make for a better understanding in cases where a holder is exchanging a driving licence obtained in a third country."
"The addition of a code 79 is therefore intended to meet the requirements of certain Member States."
"This would make it possible to cater for cases of equivalence between the categories of licence issued before 1 July 1996 and the categories defined in Article 3 of Directive 91/439."
"The use of this code 79 would be restricted to cases where the rights acquired by holders of a licence obtained before 1 July of next year might need to be maintained."
"The other changes set out in Amendment No 5 - to codes 02 (hearing aids) and 03 (prosthesis/orthosis) - are intended to introduce greater clarity."
"Further, since Directive 91/439 deals only with the issue of driving licences, action should be taken at European level to harmonize provisions governing their withdrawal in connection with offences committed in a Member State other than the Member State of issue; these problems are closely linked to Parliament's repeated calls for the introduction of a European penalty points driving licence system."
"On the last-mentioned subject, Amendment No 3 sets a deadline (31 December 1996) for the completion of the work of the working party which is to study the practical arrangements for such a system."
"On the basis of this working party's conclusions, the Commission could table a legislative proposal by 31 March 1997."
"Finally, Amendments Nos 2 and 6 are designed to replace the management committee (type IIa) for the adaptation to technical and scientific progress of Annexes I and Ia (model driving licences), II (driving test requirements) and III (physical fitness for driving) of Directive 91/439 on driving licences by a more flexible technical advisory committee, as suggested by the Conference of Presidents, for the application of the modus vivendi on comitology."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a politician I am always pleased when we adopt legislative proposals that officials can actually apply without too much difficulty."
"The harmonization of the rules on driving licences can certainly also help ensure that every security officer in the European Union can at a glance implement and check the driving licence provisions applicable to drivers from all the Member States."
"It cannot be repeated too often that the harmonized European driving licence will improve the mobility of Union citizens while at the same time contributing to transport safety."
"But I do have some doubts about the practical implementation of Directive 91/339."
"As from 1 July 1996 all Member States were supposed to implement the provisions on the European driving licence."
"But it is only now that we are deciding at first reading on a not inconsiderable component of this driving licence, namely harmonized codes."
"If Member States do not want to issue new driving licences every year, it is therefore impossible for them to implement the directive."
"So what I would expect of the Commission is that it finally submits consistent proposals for directives rather than presenting us with new piecemeal rules every six months."
"For after all it is we politicians who have to explain this to the EU citizens and sometimes also justify it."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for once again proposing the penalty points driving licence system which this House has long advocated."
"I know from countless discussions in my home country of Austria how many arguments are put forward against this, including those from drivers' organizations that pretend they are protecting drivers' interests but are in fact totally disregarding the urgent need to ensure safety on the roads."
"The example of France has made it impressively clear how the number of road accidents can be reduced by 10 % in the space of one year."
"Every 1 % reduction in road deaths should act as a spur."
"That is why I would urge the Commission to support the demands set out in this report."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists endorses this report."
"The only difficulties are in relation to Article 8."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Farassino for the excellent work he has done on this question of harmonizing the rules for driving licences in the EU."
"The conditions for freedom of movement were already laid down in the Treaty of Rome."
"This also gave rise to the need gradually to harmonize the Member States' provisions in a whole range of different areas, not least that of traffic and transport."
"One such concern was the need for common rules on driving licences."
"This was also referred to by the European Court of Justice in a judgment dating back to 1978."
"The grounds cited by the Court were that different rules for national driving licences could constitute a direct or indirect restriction on freedom of movement for persons."
"A number of initiatives were subsequently taken to ease the mobility of persons establishing themselves in a Member State other than that in which they obtained their driving licence."
"All initiatives facilitating this are clearly worthwhile."
"The Commission has now put forward further proposals on these lines."
"We have reason to welcome the proposals aimed at harmonizing the coding of information to be included on driving licences concerning the conditions under which the driving licence was issued."
"For many different reasons, this is good, not least because it will ease mobility, in particular for disabled drivers, since the licence will then clearly show the conditions subject to which it was issued."
"Harmonization will also help to improve traffic safety by making it easier to check a licence, whatever Member State may have issued it."
"In my opinion, such checks will be eased still further by the fact that the harmonized coding system will also be applied in the EEA countries."
"I would also like to highlight some additional advantages that stand to be gained by harmonizing this coding system."
"People who perhaps suffer from a particular illness or who are involved in a serious accident in another country often have difficulty communicating with staff at the hospital they are taken to."
"This may be the position of a person who is in immediate need of a special medicine and cannot convey the fact to the hospital staff."
"This type of information can in future also be included in an international, harmonized coding system by entering, in coded form, the illness a particular person suffers from or the medicine on which he or she vitally depends."
"This could save a great many lives."
"I think that the totality of what we are debating here is extremely positive."
"In the PPE group, however, we will be voting against some of the amendments that have been tabled."
"This applies to Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7."
"Whether we can vote for the report as a whole will depend crucially on the outcome of these votes."
"Mr President, since 1980 there have been a number of steps towards a Community driving licence, all of them aimed at better road safety and freedom of movement for individuals within the Union."
"The recent amendment of June this year marked Parliament's advocacy of an alternative model in the form of a 'credit card' -type licence in addition to the paper licence."
"The proposal now under consideration defines in greater detail the conditions under which the holder can drive a vehicle."
"The rapporteur has put down a number of good amendments which we are able to support."
"But we would make an exception in the case of Amendments Nos 4 and 7."
"In these the rapporteur suggests it should be possible for the legal consequences of an offence committed in one Member State to be transferred to the Member State in which the licence was issued."
"Although there are good arguments in favour of this, this legal question belongs under the third pillar and not in this directive on the issuing of driving licences."
"My thanks to the rapporteur for the excellent text he has put to us."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank the rapporteur Mr Farassino for his report and in particular the very clear way in which he has analysed the obvious benefits of this Commission proposal: a proposal to harmonize the system of codifying the information to be included on driving licences, considering the conditions under which that licence has been issued."
"I too believe that the proposal will contribute to the free movement of persons in the Community, particularly persons with disabilities and will contribute to road safety, by making it easier throughout most of Europe to check driving licences where so required."
"However, this evening I would like to highlight Amendments Nos 4 and 7, which seek the mutual recognition of the disqualification of driving licences."
"At present, bans imposed for dangerous driving are only enforceable in the Member State where the offence was committed, not elsewhere in the European Union."
"This means, for example, in the case of the United Kingdom, non-UK citizens banned for a serious offence whilst on holiday in the UK, will have their licences returned once their holiday ends and can then drive freely elsewhere in the rest of the European Union."
"Similarly, for example, a British driver who commits a serious offence whilst on the Continent on holiday can ignore a ban and then return home, potentially free, I fear, to commit the same offence."
"The amendments tabled by the Transport and Tourism Committee seek to close this very serious loophole."
"Whilst not in any way underestimating the serious hurdles that we need to overcome, we must legislate for the mutual recognition of driving licences throughout the Union."
"We must also seek to ensure that where these licences are revoked in one Member State, the ban applies in all."
"I would also like to comment on an amendment that my Group will not be able to support, namely Amendment No 8 from Mrs Muscardini and 28 others."
"Whilst we sympathize with the need to clarify the situation regarding drivers with diabetes, we believe there are many other conditions that could also be cited."
"Moreover, we fear that the wording so drafted would not actually secure the objective that I am sure those tabling the amendments aim to secure."
"For my final point, we hope the Commission will consider the points that the committee has made tonight, the serious point about disqualification, and comment on whether or not they feel proposals can be brought forward in the future to close that serious loophole."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's discussion about driving licences is not in fact a major issue."
"We are defining the code numbers of a driving licence that is to be applicable Community-wide in future."
"So it is not a major issue, but as always it is the small things that cause problems and I would say to Mr Farthofer and Mr Watts that we should be clear in our minds about what we actually want."
"At one time indeed some Members of this House wanted a driving licence with time limits."
"Then there were some who wanted a driving licence that served as a universal document, if possible also acting as a credit card."
"Thank God we have managed to avert all that."
"Now we are dealing again with two very specific aims."
"First, a European penalty points driving licence is to be introduced."
"I can really only warn you against that."
"We do not need a central office for the whole of Europe which centrally compiles all the offences that have to be entered in the record of penalty points!"
"Why do we not leave that to the Member States, where it really belongs!"
"Secondly, we do not need the possibility of people losing their driving licence for the whole of Europe."
"Once again we should not get carried away."
"I am not even talking about driving on the left or the right."
"What is a tourist from the UK to do if he happens to drive on the wrong side on the first day of his holiday and is therefore committing an offence?"
"Then he will not be allowed to drive in the United Kingdom either."
"If the English are so keen on this, perhaps we should introduce driving on the right there too!"
"So long as we do not have uniform systems of fines we cannot take away driving licences for the whole of Europe on a uniform basis because the offences that may involve the withdrawal of a driving licence tend to be committed on holiday and not at home."
"People seem rather less enthusiastic about that."
"I thank the rapporteur for his work and would merely urge Members not to vote for Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Community model of what will continue to be national driving licences is finally being perfected."
"After adopting the first supplementary provisions to the 1991 directive on driving licences, which relate to plasticized driving licences in credit card format, some weeks ago, we are now discussing a second set of supplementary provisions."
"They concern the additional but no less necessary information that is to be included on driving licences regarding the conditions of use for drivers and vehicles."
"This information is to be set out in a uniform, codified form."
"That is a good idea, for if the driving licences issued by the various Member States continue to use different codes for the information given, practical problems will continue to arise between the various countries for drivers, firms, administrations and the police."
"I therefore welcome the creation of standardized international codes and I also think it is sensible to split them, with the numbers up to 99 being harmonized Community codes and the numbers from 100 remaining national codes in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"This system of codes will definitely lead to greater freedom of movement for the individual, especially for the handicapped in the EU, and to greater road safety and legal certainty."
"That is something our people will perceive directly, for it will benefit them directly."
"For instance they will no longer be exposed to possible arbitrary police decisions."
"The simplifications in the control, checking and administrative systems will also make the rules more transparent and citizen-friendly."
"We should not ruin that again by establishing Community-wide procedures for the withdrawal of driving licences or the introduction of a European penalty points driving licence."
"In my view only the country issuing the driving licence should continue to be responsible for doing this."
"Mr President, this is the first occasion on which I have had the pleasure of addressing Parliament since the lamented death of Ken Stewart who was a Member of this House and of the Committee on Transport and of the party which I was once privileged to lead."
"I should like to pay tribute to the memory of Ken Stewart."
"He will be sadly missed by his many friends and colleagues not only here in this House but also in the United Kingdom in the Labour movement particularly and most of all in his beloved Liverpool."
"Mr President, the House will be aware that the 1991 directive on driving licences entered into force on 1 July this year."
"When the Commission made its proposal, however, it was well aware of some practical difficulties that such a provision would generate for Member States."
"We therefore proposed that any addition or restriction put on the licence would be in code form instead of in words so that the Greek police, for instance, would be able to cope with a Danish licence, not only for tourists but for people who had taken up permanent residence in their country."
"The list of codes has been thoroughly discussed both in this House and in the Council and I am pleased to see that there is broad agreement, as has been evidenced by the contributions made in this debate again, on the basic formulation."
"The new committee established for this directive will update this list of codes where necessary and that committee will also be useful in helping to solve potential problems like those which could arise for example out of developments in medical standards for drivers."
"I am glad to inform the House that since several of the amendments to the proposal are consistent with these aims, the Commission is able to agree to them."
"Amendment No 1 and most of the changes proposed under Amendment No 5 are therefore accepted."
"We cannot, however, support a universal code OO, which by its very nature could not be understood and neither can we agree to any deadline for setting a sub-division of the codes by the proposed committee."
"I agree that the committee should proceed to sub-divisions as soon as possible, while recognizing that further sub-divisions may appear necessary after a time."
"As to the other amendments, Amendment No 2 is an unnecessary addition since the Commission will naturally respect the agreement on the code of conduct."
"Amendment No 6 is not in conformity with Council Decision 87/373 on comitology and therefore cannot be accepted."
"Amendment No 3 is not appropriate for inclusion in this text."
"However, the Commission will give further consideration to issues relating to penalty points in its work in the framework of the experts group which will be established in order to consider the implications of any microchip being incorporated into the credit card driving licence model."
"However, I repeat only to emphasize that this House will have the opportunity to give its opinion on any such development in line with the cooperation procedure."
"Clearly, I and my colleagues are in sympathy with the arguments in favour of developments - and of what would be Amendment No 3 - that have been offered in the course of this debate."
"Amendments Nos 4 and 7 fall outside the scope of the proposal."
"Directive 91/439 already effectively extends the consequence of a disqualification, whether in the form of suspension or withdrawal of a driving licence, to the whole of EU territory if the disqualification is imposed by the Member State of residence."
"Mutual recognition of a disqualification that is imposed by a Member State, other than the state of normal residence is, as some have said tonight, a complex legal matter, sometimes involving constitutional difficulties."
"It is currently, however, under discussion in the third pillar with the aim of drafting a convention relating to judicial cooperation."
"Clearly, it is best left in that setting where, I must say, I hope it will have positive results, since I have considerable sympathy with the kind of points offered this evening by, for instance, Mr Watts."
"I recognize that there is an argument against centralization."
"I also recognize that there is an argument against habitual breakers of speed limits or habitual drunkards behind the wheel of a vehicle."
"I do not really care where they committed their original offence, I should like to see that any suspension inflicted on them has effect across the Community."
"I hope therefore that the discussions under the general aegis of the third pillar will have the consequence of making our roads safer from those who have committed serious offences."
"Should the position evolve on this point, the committee provided for in Article 2 will be empowered to introduce the necessary changes."
"In conclusion, may I thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and in particular the rapporteur Mr Farassino for the rapid and very thoughtful consideration that has been given to this particular proposal."
"I also thank you, Commissioner, for your words in remembrance of our colleague, Mr Stewart, to whom tribute was paid by our President when he spoke at the beginning of this afternoon's sitting."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Safety rules for passenger ships"
"The next item is the report (A4-0230/96) by Mr Stenmarck, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (COM(96)0061 - C4-0208/96-96/0041(SYN))."
"Mr President, over a period of many years the European Parliament has taken several initiatives to improve safety for passengers on ferries."
"In many respects, this is of course the consequence of a number of very tragic accidents that have cost many people their lives."
"Not least in connection with the Estonia tragedy a few years ago, the European Parliament acted in a particularly decisive way in demanding proposals and measures from the Commission."
"I think many are grateful for that today."
"We may of course differ on the point of how much power and influence the European Parliament should have."
"But as a pressure group and when it comes to demanding standards, not least for the improvement of safety in different areas, one could say that this Parliament is pretty well unbeatable."
"I think we should actually make use of this power much more in order to tighten up safety standards in other areas too."
"As regards requirements for increased ferry safety, the aims pursued are clear."
"The waters around the Member States of the EU must be the safest in the world."
"With this as our starting point, we must then work for improvements on other aspects too."
"Passengers must feel able to travel on ferries sailing between EU Member States with confidence and a sense of security."
"Parents must feel safe in allowing their children to travel on these ferries."
"In view of the need to get a working set of rules in place as quickly as possible, I was keen to work as fast as possible on this matter, all in the interests of demonstrating the importance of safe seaways and safe ferries."
"The report we are debating here covers so-called 'non-SOLAS vessels' , i.e. vessels which sail mainly in national traffic. This traffic is not covered by the SOLAS Convention adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)."
"This field is currently only covered by national legislation, with laws of very variable quality."
"The Commission proposal now aims to apply the comprehensive rules of the international Safety of Life at Sea Convention to national ferry traffic too."
"I think this is an excellent thing, and it is supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"The outcome of the work is that we go along with the Commission proposal to a large extent."
"Let me briefly mention some areas in which we go further than the Commission on safety requirements, and I hope that Parliament will give us its support on these points today."
"1.When safety rules are harmonized, there is a risk that the standard of safety in one country may be lowered."
"We think this must not happen."
"We therefore say that a country which, in any respect, already has a higher standard of safety must be allowed to retain it.2.As part of the work of increasing safety, it is vital that the training given to shipboard personnel be effective."
"As this is to a large extent regulated by other measures, we have chosen to refer to those measures in the report.3.The environment is important in this context, not least the fact that improved safety is also good from an environmental point of view."
"However, this is also dealt with elsewhere, namely in the MARPOL Convention, which regulates questions relating to the marine environment."
"On this point too, therefore, we have chosen to refer to the relevant Convention.4.We go further than the Commission with regard to the documentation that must be available for inspection demonstrating compliance with safety standards."
"We propose that there should be a Passenger Ship Safety Certificate.5.We also want to introduce a requirement that survival gear be carried on ferries sailing in waters where the water temperature often drops below a certain level."
"I think I speak for many when I say that the Commission should come back with proposals on this point.Finally, Mr President, over a period of years there have been a large number of accidents in waters around the EU Member States."
"Many people have lost their lives."
"It is our duty to all these people and to their survivors to do all in our power to ensure that such accidents never happen again."
"Let me also put the following question to the Commissioners who are here this evening: what further initiatives will the Commission be taking to achieve even greater improvements in ferry safety?"
"With that, Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report and the Commission for a particularly constructive dialogue."
"Mr President, I congratulate my colleague Mr Stenmarck on his report."
"To pick up on Commissioner Kinnock's words, I should also like to pay tribute to my comrade Ken Stewart."
"It is ironic that we are discussing safety at sea tonight because, as many people here know, that was Ken's main interest within Parliament."
"For many years he worked on the safety aspects of sea-going vessels."
"If Ken had still been alive he would have been in my place tonight conducting this debate."
"But if he had been then like myself I am sure he would have been delighted to see somebody from the right of this Chamber actually taking a serious view on the safety rules and standards for passenger ships."
"Over the last few years we have witnessed a number of tragedies at sea."
"As Mr Stenmarck remarked, we have had the Estonia ."
"We have also had the Herald of Free Enterprise ."
"They are two which spring to mind immediately."
"But every day there are scores of accidents at sea, many of which are never reported, either because there has been no loss of life or the vessels involved were so small that it did not warrant a mention in the press."
"Safety of life at sea, however, should be our priority."
"As this report correctly points out, the advancing age of many sea-going vessels and the rapid deterioration in maintenance standards means that safety standards are becoming harder and harder to uphold."
"Couple this with the registration of many ships under flags of convenience, especially in those countries which have very poor safety records and the risk of loss of life at sea is increasing rather than diminishing as one would have hoped."
"The report makes clear that the safety of seagoing vessels is not solely the responsibility of the states."
"That is true."
"But the maintenance of the safety standards and the implementation of those standards are the responsibility of the state and that is a responsibility that they must not evade."
"However, while the state can uphold the various safety regulations, the greatest responsibility lies with the owners whether they be private individuals or companies."
"It is here that we are going to have to bring greater pressure to bear by whatever means possible."
"Too many companies are flouting international safety standards and escaping prosecution."
"While we have a duty to tackle this problem within EU waters, ultimately this a problem which requires international action."
"Turning now to the amendments which have been tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Socialist Group will be supporting all the amendments with the exception of Amendment No 16."
"We welcome the commitment to a minimum level of training for maritime occupations, the introduction of survival clothing for passengers and crews on passenger ships operating in water where the temperature is low, i.e. under 15o Celsius."
"The only amendment we have some difficulty with is Amendment No 16."
"I mentioned at the start of this speech the ongoing everyday accidents which happen at sea, many of which are never reported because many of the vessels involved are so small that they do not warrant attention."
"That is why we opposed Amendment No 16 tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"We believe that the Commission text is far stronger and encompasses all the vessels and therefore nobody escapes."
"That is why we will be opposing Amendment No 16 while supporting the rest."
"Mr President, I would like to endorse what the Commissioner and the previous speaker said."
"I always held Ken Stewart in particular esteem."
"We agreed that human beings play a particularly important role in shipping and need to be protected, be they passengers or crew."
"I think we will always remember Ken Stewart and it is most important to have people such as him among us, to remember them and, we hope, to find successors with the same greatness of mind."
"Unfortunately we come now to the sad question of passenger ships."
"I think the Commission has made good proposals."
"I think it is a good idea to have uniform safety standards for passenger ships in domestic waters too, for our citizens find it inexplicable why there are different standards in a Community of fifteen states."
"Commissioner, what we are not so happy about is the long transitional provisions, which extend up to the year 2010 in the case of some details."
"I hope you and we in this House will agree to call on the Member States not to apply these transitional provisions in any part of the Union, for if we believe that minimum safety standards are necessary, then these must apply in every part of the Community, because people and tourists have the same right to safety when they use a passenger ship in every part of the Community."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could say a few words on this."
"Secondly, I want of course to thank the excellent rapporteur, Mr Per Stenmarck, for his report and ask the Commission to take on board a particular request he made and to defend it vis à vis the Council; this special request, which the Socialists also support, reads as follows: ' such common standards should not impair the implementation of existing higher standards of safety in Member States' ."
"We all agree that no Member State should use this directive as a means of lowering existing higher safety standards and here too I would be grateful if the Commissioner gave his views."
"Mr President, no-one wants another Estonia disaster, no-one wants any more accidents at sea at all."
"Yet on average 230 vessels are lost each year, claiming thousands of lives."
"We, as elected representatives, must do all we can to prevent future seafaring disasters."
"This report is a contribution to that work."
"It is a good report, and the Liberal Group supports both it and the proposal for a directive."
"Apart from the improvements to vessel standards that the report addresses, the risk of human error must also be minimized."
"Better training, life-saving equipment and working conditions, regular inspections, checks and safety exercises are examples of this."
"Finally, Mr President, the directive must obviously be formulated in such a way that common standards, as the rapporteur has said, do not mean a lowering of existing standards and do not prevent new standards from being introduced."
"This means Amendment No 1 must be adopted."
"Mr President, there have been a number of Commission proposals in recent times aimed at improving safety at sea."
"Today's proposal concerns safety rules and standards for passenger ships and is a further contribution to that objective."
"Most of the rules applicable to sea-going vessels are set by the IMO, but even so major differences still remain between Member States."
"It is thus necessary that the international IMO rules should be applied consistently by all the signatory countries."
"But the terms of the SOLAS Convention do not apply to passenger ships used for domestic voyages which are outside the international area of application."
"The Commission's attempt to close this loophole through this directive is thus to be welcomed."
"But in our view this should not mean that Member States whose national legislation imposes safety requirements stricter than those of this directive should be obliged to relax their standards."
"We thus support the rapporteur's amendments which want Member States to be able to retain these higher safety standards."
"I can also endorse the other amendments to Mr Stenmarck's excellent report."
"I also applaud the importance he attaches to rules on working and rest periods, working conditions, training, safety inspections by classification societies and so on. In the interests of safety all measures must ultimately form one cohesive whole."
"Mr President, every year millions of Europeans use passenger ships."
"In the view of my group they should all meet a high level of safety."
"Yet passenger ships on domestic voyages do not enjoy the same high level of safety required for voyages between Member States."
"As a result two similar ships operating at times in the same sea area are subject to very different safety requirements."
"Indeed, the results of investigations into recent tragic events at sea confirm that those ships operating on domestic voyages are exposed not surprisingly to the same risks as similar ships on international routes."
"Moreover, passenger ships on international voyages can also be exempted from safety requirements in certain circumstances and new types of high-speed craft are subject to inadequate and vastly different rules in the various Member States."
"All of this creates a confusing and complicated two or even three-tier system."
"Therefore, I warmly welcome the Commission initiative to ensure a high level of safety for all passenger ships including high-speed craft plying to or from the ports of any EU Member State irrespective of whether or not they were engaged on domestic or international voyages."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Stenmarck for producing a comprehensive report which not only positively endorses the Commission proposals but attempts to build on them in a constructive way."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our colleague Ken Stewart who died earlier this week."
"Mr Stewart had a justifiable passion to make our seas safe and reduce the appalling toll of over 200 ships and countless lives needlessly lost each and every year."
"His safe seas report highlighted the need for action in areas such as the one we are debating here this evening."
"His report, in my view and in the view of many people in this House, will continue for many years to act as the benchmark against which we judge progress in this area."
"In conclusion I should like to endorse Mr Stenmarck's report which will contribute to a higher level of safety for both seafarers and passengers."
"With the exception of Amendment No 16 as outlined by my colleague Mr Miller, it deserves the full support of this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Citrus fruit, fruit and vegetables"
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the Commission on the proposals put to us, despite minor differences which have emerged in the amendments."
"I regard the separation of the system of aids to citrus processing from the common organization of markets in fresh produce as of great importance, since it will surely foster responsibility in the sector and encourage competitiveness and the search for proper sales outlets."
"It will also enable the industry within the European Union to diversify into products such as freshly pressed or pasteurized juices, where we can surely be more competitive."
"Abolition of the minimum price and a more active role for producers' organizations should also be seen as positive proposals."
"For producers' organizations to enter into contracts with industry, allowing for multi-annual contracts where appropriate, should result in a concentration of supply, as it has already done in the case of satsumas."
"Finally, the inclusion of segmented clementines in the processing aids is welcome, since it has long been called for by the processing industry."
"The Commission's proposal does, however, contain some features which need improvement, and the Committee on Agriculture has approved various amendments which I should like to put forward."
"Firstly, we accept the gradual reduction of processing aid over five years until it is set at the level of aid for clementines in the season 2000-2001."
"However, we think it essential for such aid to remain in proportion to the withdrawal compensation for fresh produce, if only to encourage processing rather than withdrawal or destruction."
"Secondly, the threshold level proposed by the Commission, particularly in the case of secondary citrus fruits (265, 000 tonnes) seems too tight, since the average of the last five seasons was about 264, 000 tonnes, and the Committee on Agriculture has therefore felt the need to raise it to 365, 000 tonnes."
"The third adjustment sets a certain limit to the penalties provided for in the proposal."
"We accept 1 % loss of aid for every 1 % by which the threshold is exceeded, which is the present system, but the Committee on Agriculture proposes that the penalty should never exceed 20 % of the amount of the aid, since we believe that if this limit were exceeded the aid system would become non-viable. This would also confirm a provision now in force that penalties for exceeding the threshold should not go beyond 20 %."
"I should add that the Committee on Agriculture accepted all the amendments put to it by the Committee on Budgets in respect of monitoring systems and their implementation, and these are incorporated in the report of the Committee on Agriculture."
"We believe the Commission should adopt these amendments which, in our view, improve its wording and may ensure the future of the citrus fruit processing sector, bearing in mind the risks now facing it; on one hand, the opening up of our domestic markets to imports as a result of both the GATT accords and bilateral agreements, and on the other (an important factor) the recently-approved reform of the common market organization for fruit and vegetables, which has considerably reduced the volume of withdrawals and the amount paid for them."
"For these reasons I think the Commission should take account of this contribution by the Committee on Agriculture in the citrus processing sector."
"Finally, I must say that encouraging the use of processing will always be preferable to a policy of withdrawal or destruction of the product, and on this point we could not be more in agreement with the Commission's proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a discussion in which, apart from a few minor points which I shall now explain, we are in agreement with the Commission's proposal."
"In the citrus fruit sector there are varieties which, although intended for consumption as fresh produce, generate surpluses which are either sent for processing or else would be withdrawn."
"Our view is that the system of aid should be broad and attractive enough to prevent withdrawals with the many attendant economic, environmental and social image problems resulting from destruction, and that a system of processing aid should be promoted which creates added value and encourages the launch of innovative and competitive products on the markets of the European Union and other countries, such as freshly pressed and pasteurized juices or clementines in segments, for which our sector has traditionally called."
"We urge the Commission, as proposed in our Amendment No 10, to increase the processing threshold by 190, 000 tonnes for oranges, 64, 000 for lemons and 110, 000 for mandarins, clementines and satsumas."
"The Commission ought not be so parsimonious in setting the price, having taken that of clementines, the lowest of all."
"We also deplore the fact that the scheduled aid declines by ECU 10 million over five years, i.e. up to the year 2001, whereas this is not the case in other sectors."
"We do agree with the proposal on Community withdrawal compensation, and support the amendment put forward by the rapporteur adjusting such Community withdrawal compensation upwards or downwards according to the prices fixed by the Council at the appropriate time for fresh produce."
"Mr President, as the House will know, the draft reform of the Community support regime for the processing of citrus fruits is the final phase of the reform of the common organization of the markets in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The Agriculture Council of 23-24 July, as the House will also know, reached political agreement on the projects concerning fresh fruit and vegetables and processed products."
"Last May, in order to finalize the complete reform of the sector, the Commission presented two draft regulations which this House is giving consideration to now."
"One proposal sets up a new aids scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits and, following on from that, the other modifies the draft in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector. These two proposals are to be examined at the same time by the Council."
"Before the House decides on the proposed amendments, I would like to indicate the position which the Commission takes on those amendments."
"The first two amendments relate to the 'whereas' clauses."
"They aim to set out general principles, one concerning the commitments of the Council of September 1993 for financial solidarity and Community preference, the other concerning the need to direct the European citrus processing industry towards the manufacture of new products."
"The Commission offers two comments on these amendments."
"Firstly and obviously, the final text of the 'whereas' clauses will only be drawn up when the text of the regulations themselves has been finalized."
"It would be most appropriate to take these suggestions made in the amendments into account at that point."
"Secondly, however, the House will know that the drafting of 'whereas' clauses must only take account of legal needs."
"This is the reason why the Commission considers that the statement of principle or of objectives which are not legally necessary, should not appear in the 'whereas' texts."
"As far as the draft amendments on the regulation text themselves are concerned, I respond with the following:"
"Amendment No 3 proposes the automatic adoption of aid as set out in the annex of the current regulation according to the Community withdrawal compensation for fresh produce."
"Such a modification of the regulation arrangements seems unnecessary but the Commission will nevertheless seek to ensure that the final decision by the Council on the amounts in the annex takes account of the decision of the 23-24 July Council on the Community withdrawal compensation."
"Amendment No 4, which proposes to increase the threshold for mandarins, clementines and satsumas by 100, 000 tonnes cannot be accepted because it goes against the principle used to fix the threshold of other citrus fruits, which is based on the quantities usually processed."
"Amendment No 5 limits the decrease of aid in the event of overshooting the threshold."
"The Commission cannot accept this because any limitation of the decrease in aid harms the efficiency of the threshold system and moreover might actually provoke budgetary overshoots."
"Amendment No 6 is already in the current proposal, given that in the case of overshooting the threshold the aid is reduced and therefore available credits will always be respected."
"As far as informing Parliament of implementing arrangements is concerned, that is already carried out, as Members will know, according to the existing institutional procedures."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are superfluous because they are already covered in Article 6 of the proposal."
"In conclusion, I express the wish of the Commission that this reform will enable the Community's citrus sector to face up to the development of the market by further enhancing its creativity, its efficiency and its competitivity to the mutual benefit of producers, processors, the trade and, of course, customers."
"In commending the two proposals to the House, I express my appreciation to Mr Salamanca for his work and of course for the efforts of the Agriculture Committee as a whole."
"I also express my appreciation to my dear colleague Franz Fischler, whose unavoidable working absence tonight gave me the great honour and opportunity to contribute to an agricultural debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.05 p.m.)"
"Local development and employment initiatives"
"The next item is the report (A4-0231/96) by Mr Schiedermeier, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament on a European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives (COM(95)0273 - C40289/95)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European Union there are still more than eighteen million people registered as unemployed."
"The real number of people seeking work is undoubtedly considerably higher than that."
"All the experts agree that there is no magic formula for combatting unemployment, but that there are a number of possibilities."
"In the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, one of the objectives set out was to harness new employment opportunities in the national economies of Europe, in particular in the services sector."
"This was to be done by opening up to the employment market needs that had so far not been met."
"One year later, in 1994, at the Essen Summit, the Council asked the Commission to prepare appropriate measures."
"The communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives, of 13 June 1995, also contains, in addition to an excellent analysis, important proposals, which will have to be implemented in all Member States of the EU as quickly as possible, if governments really are serious about reducing unemployment."
"For example, the Commission is proposing the following seventeen fields on the supply side to be included in the encouragement of local development and employment initiatives: home help, child care, local shops and handicrafts, assistance for and integration of young people facing difficulties, better housing, security, local public transport services, refurbishment of public facilities in urban areas, tourism, audiovisual services, cultural heritage, local cultural development, waste management, water services, protection and maintenance of natural areas, monitoring of quality standards, pollution control and the requisite installations, new information and communication technologies."
"The positive experience gained so far in various sectors and various EU Member States enables us to hope that local jobs can be successfully created."
"My work as rapporteur was concerned chiefly with the following points. Firstly, there should be no restriction of the Commission's efforts, but, on the contrary, every opportunity should be left open to exploit to the full the seventeen fields on the supply side, and possibly to expand them."
"Secondly, support should be given to the removal of any obstacles standing in the way of this, by means of legal innovations, for example, creating legal forms to facilitate multiple skilling, particularly in rural areas, and to recognize the status of spouses who provide help, and in connection with this, giving wider powers to the relevant chambers of industry and commerce. There should be occupational reintegration systems which allow for a combination of paid work and unemployment benefit."
"A scheme should be created for partner-entrepreneurs in non-profit organizations, and labour law and social security regimes should be updated to suit the new ways of working made possible by information and communication technologies. In addition, public service concessions and delegated management deserve wider application."
"Thirdly, these local employment-initiative options, which are promising from the cost-benefit point of view, need an effective set of framework regulations and financial instruments, for example: service vouchers, which are payment instruments that can be used to obtain certain services and which have already been used successfully in Belgium and France; joint local placement funds for a particular urban or rural area, which bring together savers and project executors; changes in the treatment of operational expenditure vis-à-vis capital expenditure in terms of public accounting procedures, in order to facilitate investment in human resources; better formulation of European Union structural policies, for example through the simplification and rationalization of programmes."
"Fourthly, there should be no requirement for additional financing instruments in the form of additional taxation, because this would run the risk of being blocked, in Council, by individual Member States."
"It was for this reason that I proposed my only amendment, because I regard financing by means of a possible one-off tax on CO2 energy as somewhat uncertain, because in the long term, if it is successful, it will make an ever-decreasing contribution to the funding each year, and because unilateral reliance on this tax would place at risk the financing of local employment initiatives."
"The structural funds and the existing support options seem in my opinion to be adequate."
"On this point I agree with the Commission, and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Commission most warmly for its valuable cooperation."
"In the interests of the unemployed workers of Europe, I hope that the European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives will be rapidly and successfully implemented, and I also hope that my proposals, which have been drawn up in cooperation with and with the agreement of all the groups within the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment - for which I should like to express my grateful thanks - will meet with your acceptance."
"I hope, as I said, that the initiative will be rapidly and successfully implemented, in the interests of the unemployed workers, of social peace, and of the people who will benefit from the services provided."
"Furthermore, I hope that the effective implementation of local development and employment initiatives will be an important step towards the strengthening of local authorities, in other words the practical implementation of the principle of subsidiarity, something which I, as a local politician of long standing, wholeheartedly support."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic Affairs Committee is unanimous that this Commission report is an extremely interesting document."
"It stresses that there is a great potential for jobs in the 'seventeen fields' it lists, especially for those with lower skills, and that market forces alone will not provide the solution."
"Above all, the Economic Affairs Committee is aware of the obstacles which hamper the development of new services."
"Firstly, government policies on employment are still too passive."
"Secondly, there is not enough worker training and education."
"Thirdly, some Member States have no legislative and regulatory framework for initiatives and organizations created under partnerships between the public and private sectors."
"Major obstacles are also found in the financial domain."
"Certain services are too expensive because of heavy social costs."
"Making some services tax-deductible would take them out of the black economy."
"A survey by a Belgian university shows that 300 000 Flemish households employ domestic help."
"This equates to approximately 70 000 full-time jobs which could be created officially."
"The Commission has calculated that an employment policy geared to satisfying new requirements could create between 150 000 and 400 000 jobs a year in the Union."
"Such a policy is, furthermore, five times as efficient as increasing employment in government departments and ten times as efficient as creating jobs through government investment."
"It is a pity that this debate has been divorced from the other debates on jobs."
"Even the Commission President says nothing about it in his pact for jobs."
"Despite the fact that President Delors, in his White Paper, described the meeting of new requirements as one of the best ways of creating jobs."
"We are pleased to note that the Irish presidency of the Council intends to focus attention on the contribution which local employment initiatives can make towards solving the problem of unemployment in the Union."
"Further encouragement of these initiatives is needed and we urge the Commission to continue playing a role here as catalyst and driving force."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this document, local development and employment initiatives have finally achieved Europe-wide recognition of their importance as an essential instrument in combatting unemployment."
"If the obstacles that often help to make those initiatives so short-lived could only be removed, and if the initiatives themselves could be encouraged as described in the strategy document and enlarged upon in Parliament's report, then the unemployment rate could be halved by the year 2000."
"For the last fifteen years, local development and employment initiatives in areas of industrial decline have been preventing regions from dying out, by means of effective management and innovative projects."
"We are now asking Member States to delay no longer in implementing this strategy, and to include capital for local employment and development initiatives in all their multiannual employment programmes."
"Seventeen service areas, in which local authorities have been involved up to now, must not, however, lead to a situation in which women are dismissed from occupations requiring a high level of qualification, and forced to work in badly paid sectors."
"It is essential, therefore, that in these areas identified as options for employment initiatives there should also be appropriate remuneration, and it should be possible to obtain vocational qualifications, and also, it goes without saying, people should be able to operate independently and responsibly."
"The 10 % that has so far been spent on local employment initiatives is nowhere near enough."
"We are asking for a significant increase."
"I would be looking for a figure of 25-30 %."
"However, it must be emphasized that the whole problem of mass unemployment cannot be solved by local employment and development initiatives alone, even though they are an important factor."
"Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the paper by Mrs Wulf-Mathies, Mr Flynn, Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino does not include a substantial section on local employment initiatives, despite the fact that it is important that even now, within the current structural-funds period, a move towards more employment should be made possible, by means of precisely such innovative projects."
"We are asking the Member States to rapidly demolish the obstacles that they have so far set up in the way of such local employment initiatives."
"There are legal and administrative obstacles, and above all there is the sectorallyoriented thinking on the part of the administrative authorities."
"Above all else, we are asking the Commission finally to change its policies, which have to date had a deleterious effect on local employment initiatives, and we are asking that this type of policy, which has had the effect of concentrating and polarizing economic power within central authorities, as a result of the trans-European networks, will finally be reconsidered!"
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur for the report that we are now debating. The report manages to blend in the opinions of our other interested and competent parliamentary committees, and it comes before the House in its present form after a great deal of discussion and many amendments in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on behalf of which I speak."
"In addition, I think that I should say at the outset that the Commission communication that we are discussing and being asked to pass judgment on today - a communication, Mr Flynn, with which we are all very familiar - is the tip of an iceberg, the fruit of much analytical work, of work which is not only, or not chiefly, an exercise on paper but which is based, essentially, on an inventory of endeavours embarked on in every corner of Europe."
"Yes, unemployment certainly is the biggest threat to the social cohesion and development of Europe, and combating it, therefore, is - must be - the top social and political priority."
"At the same time, developments in society the length and breadth of Europe, which of late have been very profound or come with great rapidity, have clearly altered the needs of the citizen."
"Many of those needs, the needs today of our citizens, of three-quarters of society, are not catered for by the conventional forms of employment, and I believe that this approach, the encouragement, that is, of local employment and development initiatives, makes it possible to pursue these two major objectives in combination."
"The 17 closely analyzed fields are not mutually exclusive, of course. They are linked and can have effects one on the other, and I would describe them as indicative in that it is possible that other, new, forms of work will emerge."
"They are obviously directed in the main at working people who are under-privileged and their real value will show in areas of deprivation."
"I believe that this approach, with this communication, this text and this contribution today by the European Parliament, really can provide the key to getting to grips with the unemployment problem."
"What is needed, of course, is for this mainly theoretical piece of work to be put into practice, to be given expression and real shape in society, to become a common conception throughout the European Union."
"There are opportunities already in place: ongoing programmes such as LEADER and URBAN."
"And there are new possibilities as well - I go to the other end of things - such as the carbon dioxide tax. Allow me to say, in concluding, that we consider this approach to be truly creative and that we are therefore looking forward to the next phase from the Irish presidency, which has declared its interest, and in particular to the conference to be held on the matter in November."
"Madam President, culture creates jobs."
"That is a fact which, despite being pointed out by many professionals in the sector, has only recently been given recognition in the Commission's official documents."
"I am thinking of, for example, the documents presented by Mrs Wulf-Mathies to the Council of Ministers on Regional Planning in Venice and the first Commission report on the cultural impact of the Community's policies."
"Furthermore, the governments of some Member States, France in particular, are now sending out strong signals of recognising the potential of local employment and the role of small companies, where culture takes pride of place."
"I should like to mention here new areas of services such as maintaining local the heritage, making proper use of urban public spaces, information technologies, leisure and activities for young and elderly people."
"These are areas which are appropriate for women's jobs, and also are areas where women can find innovative solutions."
"I must point out that in 1991 Portugal was the country which made the biggest commitment to launching a European strategy for promoting local development and employment initiatives, something which is now beginning to bear fruit."
"Why do I attribute such importance to culture as a job creator?"
"It is because the 'employment' priority only makes sense if we link together two fundamental concepts of the European Union: citizenship and social cohesion."
"Cultural employment improves living standards, increases people's self-esteem, creates the conditions in which we can finally attain the ultimate objective of the European Union: the well-being of its citizens."
"On the other hand, we must bear in mind that employment must not be created at the cost of company competitiveness nor by means of a return to huge unwieldy public sectors which we did so much to rid ourselves of."
"We must avoid the perverse effects which job creation can bring with it. That is why we must involve local authorities and encourage, as far as possible, partnerships between the public and private sectors and between authorities and companies."
"Support under ERDDF for innovative action and inter-regional activity in the social and cultural areas, under Article 10, is one example which must be strengthened and broadened."
"This Commission programme might be the manna we were waiting for and help us to create employment and consolidate popular participation."
"Let us hope we can recognize its importance and use it intelligently."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unemployment is still a crucial problem in the European Union."
"The unemployment level - the rapporteur, Mr Schiedermeier, has referred to it - is currently running at 10.8 %."
"There is therefore an urgent need for action."
"The Commission's current idea is to regard local development and employment initiatives as an important and valuable aid towards the creation of jobs, and calculates that, on an EU-wide basis, up to 400, 000 new jobs a year can be created."
"These will be jobs in the regions, jobs in rural areas, which we must create if we want to maintain and strengthen rural areas in the long term as places in which people can live and work."
"The Group of the European People's Party supports the Commission's proposal."
"In the document, seventeen areas are defined in which new jobs could be created."
"I should just like to mention a few of those areas that appear to me to be of particular interest."
"Stronger support must be given to shops in rural areas."
"Shopping for food and other everyday requirements can often be a problem, not only for the elderly, but also for young families living in a village, where the husband needs the family car to get to work, because there are no longer any shops in the vicinity."
"Structures in rural areas must be expanded and consolidated."
"Only in this way is it possible to offer young people an incentive to stay in the region."
"This includes expanding public transport facilities and also extending the road network."
"In addition, I welcome the fact that domestic work is to be given recognition."
"A job in a household is worth just as much as a job in industry."
"Therefore adjustments need to be made in areas such as taxation and insurance law."
"These jobs must be brought out of the grey area."
"The Commission is planning to introduce service vouchers, along French lines, as a local method of payment."
"By means of these vouchers, private individuals can obtain services on an hourly or a daily basis."
"One private household rarely provides a full-time job."
"Women work in several households and in none of them are they subject to national insurance, so they are unable to obtain pensions insurance and social security."
"Service vouchers would make it possible for several workplaces to be combined together to make one job that would be subject to national insurance."
"The constant challenges and changes in the economic position of a business mean that employees are often forced to look around for other opportunities."
"Nowadays, hardly any employee will spend his or her whole life working in the same career, for the same employer."
"Only by means of a broad-based basic education system is a change of career possible."
"Therefore we must make sure that those who are educated in future are provided with a broad spectrum of basic knowledge."
"The world of work today has many different aspects."
"Job sharing, multiple skilling and the combination of self-employed activities with activities that are subject to compulsory insurance."
"In other words, it is a question of making adjustments to the legal conditions in this area too."
"We must do everything in our power to combat unemployment in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, going beyond the Member States' need to develop economically and socially, with the eternal objective of improving the living standards of their people, we must now tackle urgently, and with special attention, measures and practical and efficient actions to combat unemployment, that scourge which is unfortunately growing in the European continent and threatens to increase further in the future."
"These measures should include, in particular, local development and employment initiatives which the Commission hopes to encourage and to which the Schiedermeier report has made a special contribution."
"There is no doubt at all that these local initiatives are of great importance for creating jobs and it would be a good thing for small companies, including very small ones, to mushroom in all the Member States and their regions, with subsequent results in terms of job creation."
"In general, the UPE Group is completely in agreement with the Commission communication on the European strategy of incentives for local development and employment initiatives and the well-drafted Schiedermeier report which fleshed it out and improved it."
"In truth, the Commission - fulfilling its role of carrying out research into the interest and operations of these initiatives and the creation of the necessary stimuli for their creation and development in the Member States and defining the most appropriate areas, especially in the tertiary sector, where new opportunities for employment could best be explored - has made a major contribution to the necessary search for local job creation potential."
"Along the same lines, this report calls for more Commission intervention, either by coordinating actions, disseminating or exchanging past experiences or acting as the main vehicle for bringing about fresh employment initiatives, or else by lending financial support for the creation of small companies on a local level, for their material needs, infrastructure and developing and training the management."
"It is precisely this financial support which has to be increased just as we must try and eliminate any administrative or other obstacles which come in the way of the development of local initiatives or make them more difficult."
"Since we know the main obstacles which crop up when setting up small local companies, especially in terms of the cost of necessary funding, we have to have an overall strategy in which these aspects can be considered and which do not prevent us from attaining the final objective, in other words, at the end of the day, fighting unemployment."
"Finally, I should like to point out that, if we take a closer look at this report, we can see some less positive aspects which, without lessening the overall effects or the ultimate objectives, make the report less satisfactory and more controversial."
"I am thinking in particular of point 10, which proposes approval, with little or no serious basis, of the famous CO2 energy tax which should never be decided at Community level alone, otherwise we might only worsen the situation of the European economy, especially its industry, which is already so uncompetitive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have here an interesting communication from the Commission. The Social Affairs Committee responded creatively to it and Mr Schiedermeier worked hard to produce a good report on it."
"I think this report deserves to be acted on."
"But I fear it will hit a bottleneck."
"What we need to get this report acted on is cooperation from the Member States and cooperation from the regions."
"As I see it, the regions will respond positively, the local authorities, the provincial authorities, but there will be a bottleneck in the Member States at national level because there is scant enthusiasm for cooperating on European policies over matters which are to some degree perceived as areas for subsidiarity."
"So it will take a lot of persuasion to get the national Member States on board, financially as well."
"Looking at the budget we find that Member States are busy cutting back on the very budget lines which might be used to fund this."
"So I would ask the Commissioner to make an extra effort here."
"There are a few more points close to my heart."
"I, together with my Group, am not so hostile to a Europe-wide carbon tax."
"I think if one introduces that kind of fiscal measure one must do so for the whole of Europe and then one has a certain level of financing available."
"For the rest I would draw your attention to the role of insurance companies."
"In my country insurance companies sometimes conclude contracts with companies providing services which then form part of the terms of insurance."
"I think these are also points which we might encourage, for example in pilot projects."
"In my country the Minister for Economic Affairs has calculated that a third of jobs in Belgium come from start-up companies and a third from creative initiatives on the part of existing companies."
"I would urge the Commission to give real additional opportunities here both to profit-making and non-profit-making bodies, but in any event to the private sector."
"Lastly, Madam President, I think we should also take an in-depth look at the Commission's agricultural policy."
"There are excellent things in the report about protecting areas of natural beauty and I think we shall have to move towards switching funds in the farm budgets into the preservation of areas of natural beauty."
"That can in principle be done, but we shall need to deal creatively with the funds which Europe itself already has."
"Madam President, the gradual elimination of the mass unemployment which exists in the EU Member States calls for a great many different measures."
"The report rightly stresses that the basis for local employment initiatives - partnership, participation and autonomous planning - is very important in combatting unemployment, and it should be strengthened."
"It is important to promote innovative ideas such as, precisely, employment agreements among the various parties at local level."
"I should like very briefly to outline my home town's efforts to resolve the problems, as they are very similar to those in many other towns, and the problems they face are similar."
"Last year an employment project began in Tampere one element in which was an agreement of intent to preserve employment."
"The parties to the agreement are the town authorities, the employment exchange and the labour district."
"The short-term aim is that the agreement should be endorsed by entrepreneurs, organizations representing them, voluntary organizations and the unemployed."
"Special attention has been devoted to the long-term unemployed and the young."
"The means of preventing exclusion is to offer permanent or temporary work, vocational training and/or apprenticeships, traineeships and specialized training as an employment measure."
"Despite its high unemployment rate - 23.6 % - Tampere belongs to the European Union's so-called white area."
"The EU has imposed significant limits on economic aid to the projects I have just described."
"The vertical organization of society and the sectorization of public administration have also impeded the development of local employment initiatives."
"Partnership particularly requires horizontal cooperation, cutting across administrative fields."
"Like the report, I consider it important to develop Member States' judicial and administrative practices in such a way that they support partnership at local level."
"The Commission's new measures to support local employment initiatives are welcome, and I hope that all towns will receive assistance from them soon."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday Mr Schiedermeier gave us an excellent example of a non-factional, expert piece of work, reaching, as we saw in yesterday's debate, from Portugal to Finland, and this is all the more remarkable if we bear in mind the fact that a number of Member States - Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has mentioned this, and of course I am thinking mainly of Germany here - have tried to block the Commission's initiative in this sphere in the name of subsidiarity."
"I share the view of Mrs Schroedter, but I should just like to point out that progress on the subject of the social economy, which is closely related to the present subject, was made in this House during the earlier legislative period, by Aline Archambaud."
"I should just like to make a few necessary comments on the subjects covered by this report."
"Firstly, we must take care to ensure that local employment initiatives do not fall into the trap of duplicating other work, on normal working conditions, access to the employment market, qualifications etc."
"Secondly, we must incorporate them into more far-reaching objectives which must be pursued at the same time, such as: halving unemployment levels by the year 2000, decentralization and local and regional development of the economy, culture and society, as our Portuguese colleagues have pointed out, as well as economic and social reform, and feminization, and that means the balanced redistribution of paid and unpaid work, and not the creation of a new servant class of housemaids and car-park attendants."
"Seen as a whole, this is an important contribution towards replacing the status of women employees with that of female working citizens, and in quantitative terms it is a significant contribution."
"In the Federal Republic of Germany alone - and you can work this out - with about eight million people affected by unemployment, about one million new jobs will have to be created in this sector, meaningful, future-oriented jobs, which really will enrich society."
"In this sense, the implementation of the Commission's initiative is an urgent demand, which we must make together."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before anything else I must compliment Mr Schiedermeier on his report and thank him most warmly for the cooperative way in which he went about compiling his report."
"I share his appreciation of the Commission's communication on local employment initiatives which, in our view, have been and still are far too much of an underdeveloped and even undervalued part of a European strategy on jobs."
"Because, as other speakers have already said, all the research shows that local initiatives do far more to create jobs and do so at a lower cost than the large-scale infrastructure policy which we seek to defend. Because the Socialist Group does not see local initiatives as an alternative to trans-European networks, although we sometimes have difficulties with the nondescript colour of many proposals, but as a necessary complement to these trans-European networks and we hope that they will have a rather better chance of completion than the TENs with their long and painful progress so far."
"It is obvious that if we want to give this sector the chance to develop, we must provide not only a European framework of support but also European financial incentives."
"That much is clear from a whole raft of initiatives and experiences from the various Member States."
"In Belgium, for example, a start was made some time ago on an initiative known as local employment agencies, whereby the unemployed can do odd jobs in addition to receiving unemployment benefit and which uses a system of vouchers."
"The system has clear merits but at the same time a number of risks in the formula have also surfaced."
"First and foremost, if these local employment initiatives are to be expanded into a promising sector offering employment opportunities for women, who take them up on a huge scale, the long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, then it is important that we do not leave them to rot, working in hamburger joints with poor conditions of employment and welfare levels of pay."
"Secondly, it would be a real shame to limit this promising sector to odd jobs, to casual jobs."
"The seventeen areas mentioned by the Commission offer potential for development to a large number of projects in the social economy and independent firms which may indeed prove wholly or partially profitable and which may benefit very much from the demand and high purchasing power which still exists in society."
"I hope, Commissioner, that we shall get more than just a communication."
"We need a European programme of action, a coherent programme, a global programme which is equipped with European instruments."
"You are very well aware that the European Union can play a part here."
"It has already done so in experiments financed through the European Social Fund and above all URBAN."
"I agree with other honourable Members that we must do everything possible to ensure that there are no cuts at all in the budget for the European Social Fund or other structural funds but that we should on the contrary think in terms of increasing these funds for the purpose of these initiatives too."
"I will say just this: we have to do more."
"Why not think about creative combinations with large-scale capital projects; to my mind, Commissioner, these is no point in a high-speed train unless it meshes seamlessly into a large-scale public transport network."
"I would thus ask the Commissioner to put a proposal to the Council to widen the mandate of the European Investment Fund to include urban initiatives and not just trans-European networks alone."
"And I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak that the carbon tax might go a very long way towards developing this sector."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I congratulate the Commission on its initiatives but I hope it will now think creatively and come up with a concrete programme of action."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how many people are unemployed in Europe? Eighteen million?"
"Twenty million? The battle over statistics will not create a single new job."
"All this moaning about structural weaknesses and past mistakes, that is nothing more than a lament now."
"Accusations of mismanagement and redundancy therapies on the one hand, and a lack of flexibility or quality deficit on the other, this reciprocal mud-slinging may well fill the newspapers but it will not fill people's stomachs."
"It is clear that we need to take practical action, and achieve changes at local level."
"Local employment initiatives make it possible to improve living and working conditions."
"Local work for local people using local resources means, in the first place, services."
"For example, there is the environmental sector, from waste management to the maintenance of natural areas; there is the housing sector, from security to urban renewal; the everyday-life sector, from health protection to child care; and finally the leisure sector, from tourism to cultural initiatives."
"The potential which can be achieved at local level, but which is all too seldom used, or is even transferred elsewhere, must be exploited to the full."
"This spatial proximity makes it possible to have a precise knowledge of special circumstances, supplies and needs."
"We can see who the target groups are, from women to young people with problems to the elderly, those who are difficult to employ, and other disadvantaged workers."
"We can also see what the framework conditions are."
"Private job providers and public agencies should stop blocking each other's initiatives all the time."
"They should cooperate, and agree to have the courage be creative and develop in new directions."
"Let us not deceive ourselves: the obstacles are still enormous."
"The rapporteur, Mr Schiedermeier, who received the unanimous support of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, has shown us what is missing: a willingness to cooperate on the part of government bodies, public resources to finance orders and start-up capital, and qualifications for those who might be involved in these initiatives."
"We need a coherent framework for action, plus financial incentives for development, the removal of administrative and legal obstructions, and target-specific consultation."
"It is high time that the coordination of specific measures by the Community and specific measures by the Member States, the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises, the more effective use of the structural funds, and the effective implementation of educational programmes, from LEONARDO to LIFELONG LEARNING, were expanded so as to include an important area, namely that of local development initiatives."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are now debating on a European strategy for local development and employment initiatives calls for our full agreement."
"I would actually say it is stimulating for anyone who deals with local and regional development in our countries."
"Acknowledging the importance of the regional and local levels as a fundamental nucleus of the social and economic fabric might be one of the most humane and effective ways, among the wide range of solutions which can be adopted for this very serious problem, unemployment."
"It means encouraging people themselves to identify and develop employment at a local level and it means making the most of the job-creating opportunities that exist in some major areas such services linked to daily life, services linked to leisure and culture, those linked to the environment and housing, as well as many other areas which might appropriately meet the new needs and thereby help to slash unemployment in Europe."
"It is worth pointing out the demand to the Commission to bring about framework conditions which are favourable for local employment initiatives as well as compulsorily introducing financial resources for local development and supporting local companies in as many different ways as possible."
"The Commission should encourage and promote an exchange of experiences between Member States where local employment initiatives of interest have already been implemented and also will have to play in full the role of dynamic force in encouraging any credible and effective solutions that might help to tackle the social scourge of unemployment."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Schiedermeier's report, the opinions of the various committees, and European Union studies appear already to have recorded more than 17 areas of job creation potential, primarily in social, cultural and environmental fields."
"I am very interested in the environmental areas, since I am a member of the Committee on the Environment."
"There are very worthwhile possibilities in water and waste management and protection of natural habitats."
"The rapporteurs note, however, that there are legal and tax obstacles as well as obstacles relating to educational background; most workers come from industrial restructuring in Europe."
"We believe we also have to consider better management of resources, and locate jobs in old trades and in craft industries."
"But I should like to place some emphasis on the opinion expressed by Mrs Marinucci as representative of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Mrs Marinucci highlights the contradiction between competitiveness and job creation."
"Europe cannot compete with the very low wages and abysmal working conditions of the Third World."
"And this contradiction is unresolved."
"I should also like to signal the continuous creation of insecure jobs."
"I live in a country where 34 % of jobs are insecure, a situation mainly endured by women."
"It is not enough just to create jobs."
"We need to create jobs with some degree of security."
"And we are worried that the public sector may cease to finance most welfare benefits."
"We are therefore concerned over the replacement of public by private action, since there are poor and scattered populations in which private enterprise would find no profit."
"To conclude, I believe the obstacles and contradictions have to be overcome so that local job initiatives can go forward, since they are of real importance."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of jobs is becoming one of the most important tasks for the immediate future."
"Mr Schiedermeier's comprehensive report makes this absolutely clear, and I am able to agree with his ideas in many areas."
"However, I do not think that job creation in any of the seventeen fields in the services sector will create jobs on a long-term basis, if it is not preceded by the creation of value-creating jobs."
"In order to do this, innovative people and businesses must be motivated and supported by framework conditions which will trigger a business-creation offensive."
"This is the prerequisite for the creation of jobs in the tertiary sector, because without businesses, information and communication technology in particular will not be used at all, and tourism will be unable to develop further because of a lack of tourists with money to spend."
"If fourteen studies on the subject of employment initiatives have already been carried out, and a fifteenth study has been commissioned, then the Brussels bureaucrats have not yet grasped the idea of how the value-creation chain operates, and they are just frittering away the subsidy funds."
"Therefore I should like to point out that regional and local employment initiatives must be encouraged before anything else."
"This means that the framework conditions of national governments must be oriented towards enabling businesses to develop at local level, businesses with innovative products, which can be competitive at international level too, businesses whose activities are not continually thwarted by overregulation."
"This will only be successful, however, if the nation states are made to see that performance does pay off, and if they do not interpret development policy as meaning the redistribution of capital, but rather understand that success and competitiveness can be improved if they reinforce regional strengths and encourage local creativity."
"Only if these conditions are met will we be in a position to create jobs in the long term!"
"Madam President, housing cooperatives, women's employment projects, new media and cultural industries, environmental regeneration projects are known to many of us in our local area."
"They are at the heart of local economic development strategy and they often arise, when traditional mass employment in an area declines, to develop new services and to offer hope of work to people not getting a fair deal within the labour market."
"They should be at the heart of Europe's attempt to support new employment, to combat discrimination and to facilitate change in the economy which is sensitive to need and fair to those in work."
"There has been a lot of talk in this debate about the legal and administrative obstacles to local employment in the Member States."
"But what does Europe itself do for those at local level who seek its support?"
"Only a small fraction of the structural demands are aimed at innovatory projects."
"There is a periodic newsletter and a methodology for the Member States to use if they wish."
"This is not bad in itself but the truth is that in the over-long, overcomplicated, over-bureaucratic processes used for agreeing the structural fund programmes, local employment projects are often last in line."
"The fact that they are new and different means that all too often they will not have the local contacts, the track record, the knowledge and especially the time it takes to come to terms with the rules that Europe lays down for access to its support."
"As this Parliament's rapporteur for Article 10 funding, the innovative projects, I know there is a great demand in the localities and regions to harness European support for their endeavour."
"I do not want to see this limited to a few demonstration projects."
"I want local economic development to be first in line when European programmes are planned, managed and implemented."
"Then the 150, 000 to 180, 000 new jobs a year the Commission projects - the ambitious plans laid down in the Delors White Paper - will be much closer to becoming a reality."
"Madam President, the debate on this report has been encouraging."
"Given that we are fighting massive unemployment in my country, we study with interest all ideas which can improve employment."
"We all know that economic growth is necessary but not sufficient."
"All the special measures are therefore needed."
"Our country does not have a long tradition of small enterprise and private service provision."
"Many of the welfare and non-profit-making services mentioned in the report are provided at local-government level in Finland."
"Their impact on employment is very considerable, and their development accords with the ideas mentioned in the report."
"Privatization does not create new jobs: on the contrary."
"It is true that private services are needed as a supplement to public ones."
"Experiences from elsewhere naturally interest us and we hope that we can progress by exchanging information and that we will receive from other areas of the Union good indications and ideas as to how we could improve the employment situation."
"When trying to identify such measures, frequent reference has been made to cooperation among the various parties, and this should be secured locally, including by means of the famous tripartite model."
"Government could be represented by local government; the second party could comprise entrepreneurs, employers and enterprises, while the third would comprise the trade unions."
"They could tackle this serious employment problem with local resources."
"Part of unemployment benefit should be used for this purpose."
"More could be achieved than at present using these resources."
"The trade unions would certainly be interested in the idea and would set to work on behalf of the unemployed."
"We could find ways of working close to the unemployed."
"If the Union also actively supported such measures, this would provide an effective and practical model which would emanate from the Union and operate at local level."
"Madam President, I would like to repeat what I said in my report."
"I am worried about two aspects of the Commission's work, which I otherwise appreciated because it was preceded by an excellent investigation, excellent research work and a very interesting cultural study."
"The first is in a way connected with yesterday's discussion on public services in this House: the Commission is pursuing a number of courses leading to a weakening of the public services, which are on the other hand the characteristic European model we are constantly claiming that we want to defend."
"Furthermore, if it goes on presenting employment proposals which do not complement but replace facilities currently provided by the public services, it seems clear that the financial resources, which are shared among a number of channels, would not even be sufficient to create genuine additional work."
"On the one hand, therefore, loss of jobs, loss of services to citizens, loss of the European social model, and on the other not even more work and, probably, not even enough replacement work."
"The second aspect that worries me is that this approach, which is very interesting and ought in any case to be incorporated into a kind of guide and ought, that is, to be given greater organic unity by the Commission, badly ignores the 'question of women' ."
"We have previously, and again yesterday in this House, deplored the fact that, where jobs for women are concerned, there has been little but talk in the Regional Development Fund and in URBAN II: programmes have been drawn up, but they are not actually being implemented."
"On the contrary, one programme - called ILO and including local employment for women - has unfortunately been cancelled."
"In this case, therefore, as regards this subject, this project is not giving employment to women, whereas women are the main beneficiaries of these services, including in particular those women who normally provide them because they possess skills which they can then make available to society."
"For these reasons I believe that we should think carefully and consider the desirability of going further in this direction or of improving the Commission's position."
"Madam President, I would like straight away to thank Mr Schiedermeier, the author of this report, for the excellence of this report and also thank the Members of the committee who contributed in the process."
"A very high level of debate has taken place here this morning and it is very encouraging for me and for the Commission to get such strong support from the House for our proposed European strategy to encourage local development and employment initiatives."
"I am very taken by the standard of the contributions here this morning on this matter."
"As you know, following from the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment of 1993 the Essen Summit defined an action programme and a structured approach to fight unemployment."
"This strategy has now been refined during successive European Summits from Cannes to Florence last June."
"The promotion of local development and employment initiatives is an important component of this integrated framework and this is the strong point being made by Mrs van Lancker this morning: we need such an integrated framework approach."
"From our point of view, these local initiatives are, of course, of major importance for several reasons."
"They provide new job opportunities for people, including the long-term unemployed, young people and unemployed women."
"I would like to assure Mrs Marinucci that women, in so far as these local employment initiatives are concerned, are of paramount importance to us all."
"I would like to remind you that the economic analysis which has been carried out supports the view that local initiatives, if adequately supported, could create a possible 140, 000 jobs leading to a possible 400, 000 new jobs annually in Europe."
"Mrs Klaß made the very important point that of the 17 areas of potential that had been identified the care sector, in particular in its reference to rural development, is a very important feature."
"These initiatives also provide a response to the new requirements of our societies, by generating new types of jobs in services for day-to-day living: services that improve the quality of life in the cultural and leisure sectors, as well as in the environment sector."
"This was very much brought home to us in the debate by Mrs Schroedter and by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, who talked about the potential that was there in these new areas and the need to take action in all of them at this time."
"These initiatives are also frequently part of a local process, which includes public and private partnerships involving various players within society, such as local business, social partners, voluntary bodies and what we call the promoters of the social economy."
"However, this important new job-creation potential does face some difficulties."
"There are obstacles which need to be dealt with and they were referred to generally throughout the debate this morning."
"I would like to list some of those obstacles."
"Firstly, the financial obstacles."
"There are very often excessive direct and indirect labour costs; the difficulty of gaining access to capital and to loans; the low purchasing power of the poorest households and the unattractive level of return for certain types of services."
"Secondly, there is the question of training and technical problems which arise, amongst other things, from inappropriate initial training, outdated skills and working conditions in certain traditional sectors and a lack of training in new technologies."
"I would like to highlight that for the House, and some of the contributions to the debate reflected the need for better skills and better training in the new technologies that are going to dominate all our lives in the future."
"Thirdly, legal and regulatory obstacles."
"These stem from the absence of proper legal status for partnership between private and public organisations and the absence of quality standards in the service sector."
"Finally, institutional obstacles."
"These arise from a failure to appreciate the job-creating local development process, sectoral and hierarchical bureaucracies and excessively restrictive short-term financial support which does not enable the long-term survival of initiatives."
"I support Mr Howitt's point of view in this matter and he carefully stated it here this morning."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know that jobs cannot be wished into existence."
"They are the result of investment and they are the result of investment by very many people."
"We believe that public authorities and administrations have an important role to play in establishing a framework favourable to the creation of new jobs."
"We believe that institutions, at all levels, can and must play their part in the creation and promotion of that coherent framework to encourage the development of local employment initiatives."
"On the one hand, national and regional policies must concentrate on removing structural obstacles, whether financial, technical, legal or administrative. Of course, on the other hand, the added value of the Union is provided, particularly through the promotion of experimental and pilot projects and their evaluation, the dissemination of good practice and encouragement for the exchange of experience, notably through cooperation and support of transnational networks."
"Not enough is known of things that are succeeding and things that are being done well in many Member States."
"We have to pinpoint what is good, isolate it, tell others about it and encourage people to adapt it to their own circumstances."
"There is support being given to national measures which benefit local initiatives, particularly via the structural funds."
"A lot of comment was made this morning about better use being made of our existing financial resources and I support that point of view strongly."
"The strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives was conceived as part of the larger framework designed by the Essen European Council to fight unemployment."
"Some Member States had begun to translate this support for local initiatives into concrete measures in the context of their multi-annual employment programmes."
"We are going to hear more about that later this year when we see at first hand in these programmes what the Member States have done to implement these initiatives and what they propose doing over the next couple of years."
"Even though much remains to be done, I am convinced that this strategy for encouraging local development initiatives is a promising way to fight unemployment."
"For far too long it remained in the shade, that is true."
"We have often looked at the bigger issues; now we are coming down to recognize that the great potential exists in local development, local initiatives and the encouragement of voluntary and smaller groups in our Member States."
"These have often been outshone in the past by the macro-economic strategy but today we find that there are a lot more active policies coming forward to develop local initiatives."
"The Commission is aware that more has to be done."
"You have called for this to be taken on board and that it must be done better and quicker than in the past."
"It is for that reason, following our action for employment in Europe, our confidence pact, that the Commission presented its communication on Community structural assistance and employment."
"The aim of this communication is to provide markers for the negotiations currently under way in the use of Community structural funds."
"It has a special place in the promotion and the development of local initiatives."
"In keeping with the Commission's proposal concerning territorial and local pacts for employment, the Florence European Council also stressed the importance of local employment and development initiatives."
"Finally, I would like to thank you, Mr Schiedermeier, for the encouragement that you have given us all at this time, the widespread unanimous support that is here in this House today for what we seek to do in encouraging local development."
"As an instance of good faith, with the limited funds available to me, I have initiated better use of part of the Social Fund and I announce my decision to grant a budget of Ecu 25m under Article 6 of the Social Fund for the promotion of innovatory projects and job creation and I am pleased that Mr Nußbaumer has highlighted the need for innovation."
"This Article 6 money is pointed directly at new job opportunities, new innovatory ways of doing things and I feel that we have here the genesis of something special and long-lasting and effective in so far as job creation is concerned, and I thank the House for their support this morning."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Extension of common transit system"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0682/96-0-0163/96) by Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System, to the Commission, on further extension of the common transit system."
"Mr President, this is an unusual oral question insofar as the majority of the Members of the House are actually interested in the answer."
"So I will assume that the oral question is asked."
"I will listen with great eagerness to the answer as will other members of the committee of inquiry into transit fraud."
"In the light of Commissioner Monti's answer and with your permission Mr President, perhaps we can ask further questions so that we can do justice to the answer itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tomlinson's question gives me the opportunity to provide clarifications on some important points, and is therefore welcome."
"Transit systems are a measure for facilitating trade; commercial operators have well understood the usefulness of this instrument, because in 1995, two years after the creation of the single market, 18 million documents were issued to cover transit operations in the Community."
"The simplification of the formalities, combined with considerable flexibility in the use of the procedures, explains the success of these systems in business circles."
"They constitute a factor of primary importance which assists trade between the Community and third countries."
"It is in this context that on 1 July 1996, as part of the pre-accession strategy of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic, the Hungarian Republic, the Polish Republic and the Slovak Republic became contracting parties to the EC/EFTA Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit system."
"This first extension of common transit was explicitly provided for by the European agreements, on which the European Parliament expressed a favourable opinion, within the framework of cooperation aimed at bringing the customs systems of these countries closer to those of the Community by the introduction of a 'bridging' system between the transit regimes of the Community and of these countries."
"The accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the Common Transit Convention is therefore fully in line with these countries' strategies leading up to accession to the European Union."
"During the three years preceding adhesion to the common transit system, the Community, together with the other parties to the Convention, contributed significantly to the preparation of these candidate countries in order to ensure that the customs administrations and operators were fully briefed about these systems and trained and prepared for their use."
"The decision to extend the system was taken only when the Community and the other contracting parties were convinced of the ability of the Visegrad countries to assume all the obligations of the common transit system."
"The technical assistance supplied to the four new contracting parties is therefore an important acquisition of experience in preparation for the future extension of the Common Transit Convention to Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states, with which the Community has concluded a European association agreement."
"These candidate countries will of course receive the same technical assistance as the new contracting parties which enabled them to accede to the Convention on 1 July last in the best conditions of preparedness."
"The first measures to assist the new candidates are due to begin next autumn, but without prejudging in any way the possible date of future extensions of the common transit system."
"In any case, as far as the Community is concerned, the decision to issue a formal invitation to accede to the Convention will be adopted only when it has been duly established that the candidate countries have reached a level of preparation which will enable them to ensure correct application of the transit procedures."
"In view of past experience, a preparatory period of several years is to be expected."
"Consideration also needs to be given to another important aspect: the plans for reforming the transit system."
"In association with the Member States, the parties to the Common Transit Convention and the economic operators, the Commission is in fact preparing plans for reforming the transit system in which a great deal of attention is being given to the work of the European Parliament's temporary committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr Tomlinson."
"As a result, the transit systems which the candidate countries will join will by then very probably have undergone various further changes, designed to strengthen their management and safeguard them against fraud, especially through the computerization which should be completed in 1998."
"It is thus clear that, in order to become contracting parties to the Convention, the candidate countries will have to be capable of meeting the obligations of the transit system as it will be when it has been reformed."
"Lastly, in the context of the battle against transit fraud, I wish to emphasize, as I reminded the Ministers of Finance of the Community and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on 8 July, that every European association agreement is accompanied by a special protocol on mutual assistance in customs matters."
"Together with the customs provisions of the Common Transit Convention and the collected administrative agreements on transit, this protocol constitutes the legal and administrative framework for cooperation between the customs administrations of the contracting parties."
"It is in this context that the customs authorities of the contracting parties implement the administrative cooperation which is essential for the proper application of the systems in question, particularly by using the fraud-prevention machinery placed at their disposal."
"Mr President, we have heard from Commissioner Monti that the decision to extend the Common Transit Convention to the Visegrad countries was taken by the EC/EFTA Joint Committee in 1996 in Interlaken."
"I have four specific questions to Commissioner Monti concerning that."
"At what political level was the Commission represented on this committee?"
"Did the Commission seek explicit prior consent of Parliament and Council to the extension before it was finally agreed?"
"Was the decision the subject of unanimous agreement in the Joint Committee?"
"And was the Joint Committee itself bound by the terms of the Europe Agreements between the EU and the Visegrad countries and did they specify a timetable for extension?"
"My second question to Commissioner Monti asks specifically whether the Commission apprised the Visegrad countries themselves of the difficulties being encountered in managing the Community and the common transit systems before accession."
"Would the Commission agree that the economic and financial risks associated with accession were subordinated to the political commitment to extend the system itself?"
"Thirdly, has the Commission undertaken any negotiations with any other associated countries with a view to their accession to the Common Transit Convention and will these countries be required to wait longer than the Visegrad states before acceding to the common transit system?"
"If so, with what justification?"
"My final question is to ask the Commission to give us an undertaking."
"It presumes that the reform of the transit system will be completed before the next extension of the common transit system."
"Will the Commission therefore commit itself to subordinate further extension of the system to the completion of the reforms that Commissioner Monti referred to?"
"Finally, I criticized the Commission publicly yesterday in committee for not having sent us some information they promised."
"Commissioner Monti has today shown me a letter which shows quite clearly that the Commission did despatch the information and as publicly as I criticized them yesterday I should like to say today that I accept that without reservation."
"Unfortunately, however, just as we have problems in the common transit procedure, we clearly have common transit problems between the Breydel and the Berlaymont that we must sort out."
"Mr President, the questions that Mr Tomlinson has raised on behalf of the committee are questions that I had hoped the Commission would have dealt with in its reply. Of course, they are also questions that are not being raised for the first time here today."
"In the course of the work of the committee of inquiry we have repeatedly raised them, right from the start, and with exactly the same degree of clarity and precision, and yet we have never received an answer to them."
"If we had received answers to these questions, at least answers that we could understand and perhaps even accept, then this debate, or this question about future extension, would not have been necessary."
"Of course we do actually receive replies, Commissioner Monti - please don't misunderstand me."
"Of course the Commission has sent us replies, but the replies are such as to raise yet again the question that had already been asked, and we cannot really tell who is failing to express themselves clearly, the people asking the questions or the people giving the replies, or indeed whether we are simply talking at cross purposes, so that we are really no longer able to communicate at all, because obviously such difficulties in communication do not occur only in the postal services."
"As I see it, the question that lies at the bottom of everything else, and therefore the question that I am now going to ask - since Mr Tomlinson's questions, as I have said, are very comprehensive - the question that kept cropping up in committee, was not whether it was right to invite the Visegrad countries to join, or whether it was right to accept their applications, but whether it was right to do so at that particular moment."
"I believe, and I am sure that no one would dispute it, that of course it is part of our accession strategy that those countries which want to join the European Union should gradually, bit by bit, be introduced to this system and integrated into it."
"The question was simply, when the Commission itself had recognized what a bad state the Transit System is in, was it necessary, at that moment, to complete the accession process, even when the situation in the candidate countries had been reviewed?"
"That is the key question that lies behind all this."
"It is not a matter of the principal question: ' Should we or shouldn't we?' ."
"But we simply cannot have a situation - and nobody has yet given us an answer on this point - in which one part of the Commission is sending out a sort of dunning letter, saying 'The Common Transit System is collapsing. Do something!' , while another part of the Commission is actually extending this collapsing system."
"Then, of course, we are told that reform and extension are not mutually exclusive, that somehow we shall manage to do everything at the same time."
"But one phase of the extension scheme has now been completed, and - as you have just explained to us - we are in for the next phase."
"This is not going to do anything to reduce the problems, and the longer the committee of inquiry lasts, the more we are convinced that this step, at this particular moment - and I emphasize at this particular moment - was the wrong one."
"Mr President, I make no apology to Mr Monti that this oral question is in fact a continuing series of questions because many questions still remain to be answered."
"First, who made the commitment to the Visegrad states that they would be brought into the system?"
"Was it the Council acting as the Council or was it intergovernmental?"
"Was it at a lower level, at COREPER?"
"Was it the Commission or was it an administrative decision?"
"From the answers we have received in the committee it looks as if some customs officers met, put the whole thing together and made it a policy for the Community at that level."
"I do not want to anticipate the report of the committee of inquiry but before the committee first met four papers were already written which made it clear that the present systems are in crisis."
"We look back to the Court of Auditors report of 1988."
"That alerted us."
"There was a stronger report from the Court of Auditors for the year 1994."
"Then there were two papers which the Commission itself produced to justify the expenditure for computerization to try to overcome this crisis in the system."
"It was quite a problem and, as I say, we had four documents before the committee ever met which would have alerted anybody to the fact that an extension of the system was a mistake."
"So why was it extended?"
"It is possible that the first decision was made before any of these notices were given that the system was in chaos."
"So we would like to know on what date that decision was taken."
"Concerning the question where, we keep being told about Interlaken and it may be that Interlaken was the place where decisions were taken - high-level decisions taken by lower-placed officials."
"That causes concern."
"How was it put into operation?"
"We understand that the training given by PHARE was good."
"The investment was high."
"But there were not sufficient trained officials on the ground by 1 July to enable them to come into the system."
"We have been told - I think somewhat cynically - that one or two Member States have a lower level of readiness than the four Visegrad countries themselves."
"But, as I say, that is a cynical comment."
"What happened is that the Community created new trade frontiers well beyond the present EU boundaries."
"It allows these four countries to have a veto on any changes to the system."
"This seems odd because they do not have Members in this House."
"They are not represented on the Council or the Commission so how is it that they can be involved and possibly veto any changes?"
"For the present, what steps is the Commission taking to monitor the extension which has been granted since 1 July?"
"I hope that all our warnings and forebodings are not borne out but I should like to be assured of that and that, as a result, there has not been a growth in the fraud committed in the transit system."
"The Commissioner has been kind enough to say that plans for amendment to the transit system are under way."
"I would be grateful if he would take us into his confidence along the way so that the committee which has been working very hard can be involved and not have a confrontation about the amendments which are being brought forward."
"Mr President, I too find it easy to echo the questions raised by previous speakers."
"One of the hardest things for me to understand is this: if Parliament decides at the beginning of this year to set up a parliamentary committee of inquiry because customs services in the countries of the European Union are not working properly, despite the fact that these customs services have years of experience with all manner of regulations, if things are still not working properly why is it necessary to extend the system?"
"Could the Commission not have waited?"
"At the moment the position is that the agreements stipulate conditions."
"If it is true that in one of the Visegrad states things are in a total mess, what can the Commission do to put things right?"
"Can anything now be done?"
"I have the vague feeling that perhaps nothing can."
"The big question then is what can be done to improve matters?"
"And my big question is this: how are the PHARE funds being used?"
"What influence has Mr Monti over the way in which PHARE funds are used?"
"Does he receive regular reports on the length of waiting times at border crossings?"
"Is he able to influence the way in which funds are used for new buildings, training courses and all that kind of thing?"
"I think that if it is too late to unravel the mess then all we can do is try to improve things and we can only do that by an active use of PHARE funds."
"I should appreciate a reply to these questions."
"Commissioner, would you agree with me that the Commission is not simply the custodian of the Treaties, but that it must do everything imaginable in order to protect the financial interests that we administer in the European budget?"
"If so, then I should like to ask you how I am supposed to understand your reply to my question of June 5th, as to how the Commission came to decide to extend the Transit System to include the Visegrad countries."
"On July 24th you replied to my question, to the effect that the Commission took the decision to extend the Transit System to the Visegrad countries - and this is the astounding part - by means of the written procedure."
"Am I therefore correct in assuming that the Commission did not hold any oral debate in committee at that time with regard to the possible financial repercussions that we shall have to accept as a result of fraud in the Transit System?"
"Am I right in assuming that even beforehand the Commission did not hold any collective discussions about the question of extending the Transit System?"
"Can I therefore conclude that until the setting up of the committee of inquiry the Commission never, at any time, collectively - and here of course I mean principally you and the other Commissioners - came to any political understanding of what it would mean if we extended this system?"
"Finally, Mr Monti, my last question is this. Why is it so difficult for you and the Commission to admit, for once, that at a given moment you did not take into consideration something that really ought to have been taken into consideration?"
"Mr President, the Commission rightly maintains that widening of the Community to encompass Eastern and Central Europe is not possible unless there has first been deepening."
"At the same time this same Commission thinks, and this is the nub of our debate, that the Community transit system can be extended beforehand and unconditionally."
"That is indeed strange when we are talking, as has become manifest here, about a system in deep crisis."
"What I am now hearing from the Commissioner is one of the arguments that the Eastern Europeans or the Central Europeans of the Visegrad countries have all the technical preparation required to introduce the system and that this is also the background to the decision taken at Interlaken."
"But I would like to know what percentage of all customs officials in those countries are trained to operate this kind of system."
"I have a second question in addition to all the other questions already raised, namely whether it is true that talks are currently in progress with Turkey, under the customs agreement we have now had with Turkey since the beginning of this year, with a view to concluding an agreement whereby Turkey will form part of the Community transit system and our external border for transit will thus be moved to Northern Iraq, Iran and Azerbaijan."
"Mr President, Mr Monti himself has told us on previous occasions that the Common Transit System is going through a difficult period because of a loss of efficiency in national Customs authorities coinciding with the arrival of the single market."
"This is where the main cause of the transit problems seems to lie, in Customs and in the delay in, among other things, harmonizing taxes throughout Europe."
"The handling of VAT, which is paid at source rather than at destination, may add incentives for transit fraud."
"The structure of the Common Agricultural Policy, with its export refunds, has also encouraged the fraudulent use and abuse of the transit system."
"Freedom of trade is not something which can be exported, it is something which must grow from roots within the national economic systems."
"Even in national economic systems such as those of Europe, where the market economy is linked to these nations' history, we find that freedom of trade encounters serious problems and obstacles, and that a system as potentially excellent as the common transit system meets with instances of misuse and fraud."
"To hope, as Mr Monti does, that an extension of the transit system to countries which are just really starting their transition to a market economy will not cause major disruption of the already weakened transit system is a very risky venture on the part of the Commission, which could only be conducted successfully in two ways: firstly, with a huge effort on the part of the national authorities of the Visegrad countries, and secondly with a huge financial effort on the part of the Commission to strengthen the chaotic Customs systems of those countries."
"I very much doubt whether the Commission currently possesses the resources and commitment to set about strengthening, as other speakers have already mentioned, the Customs systems of these Visegrad countries. So the question I should like to put to Mr Monti is this: does he actually have the financial resources and commitment needed for an improvement of the Customs systems of the Visegrad countries?"
"Mr President, the EU's transit system is in crisis, with rampant fraud and organized crime."
"How is it possible for the Commission to extend the transit system to other eastern countries before a system in collapse has been completely reformed in order to curb fraud?"
"After all it is clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation ever since 1988."
"How then is it possible to extend such a system before it has been properly reformed?"
"I await your answer with interest as I am keen to learn on what level the decision was taken to extend it."
"If it was taken at political rather than administrative level - perhaps by the customs authorities getting together and making it a matter of EU policy - would it not be better to acknowledge that, take political responsibility and change such a patently wrong decision?"
"Organized crime is a step ahead. There is a need for clarity in the action of politicians."
"They must not be afraid to acknowledge mistakes and must reform the entire system first."
"There will be a need for cooperation between the customs authorities and for very clear administrative rules."
"Obviously, new technology will be needed, very advanced technology, and above all there will be a need for effective control."
"What is Commissioner Monti prepared to do?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my warmest thanks to the various Members of Parliament who have contributed and particularly to Mr Tomlinson for having, shall we say, acknowledged receipt and having drawn attention to a problem of internal communication to which we shall continue to seek better solutions."
"There is a general fundamental point to which I ask you to give close attention: I am not an optimist - as has been said - I do not close my eyes to the serious problems of the transit system; when I am convinced that the Commission has made mistakes, I have no difficulty in admitting it, but I do ask that the matter be properly looked into."
"For instance, I am happy to answer the question put by Mrs Müller about her letter, to which I have already replied."
"In her letter she asked me for the minutes of a decision of the Commission: I replied that there are no minutes, because this decision was taken by the written procedure."
"But this does not in the least mean - I do assure you, Mrs Müller - that the Commission is any less aware of it."
"There are decisions, some of the greatest importance, which the Commission takes by the written procedure, which requires the agreement of all its members."
"Naturally there are no minutes in that case."
"I am certainly willing to admit mistakes made by the Commission when we become aware that mistakes may have been made - and naturally there are some - but in a case like this, I do not feel that I have to do so."
"Mr President, this has been a sitting for oral questions which has developed in a very interesting way, because the question has received an answer from me, on which I am furthermore willing to enlarge, but the opportunity has moreover been seized - understandably and usefully, I would like to say - to discuss not only the future, that is, extension or non-extension to new countries, but also the past, for example through the detailed questions put by Mr Kellett-Bowman, concerning when, how, by whom and where the decision about the Visegrad countries was taken."
"On these subjects, as the members of the committee of inquiry will recall, we - either I or my services - have had talks at meetings of the committee and we have given very careful answers on the basis of the position as then known."
"It may very well be that some answers are not considered satisfactory: I am willing to look back to provide further details, but it seems to me that today's sitting has been directed rather towards the future, and it is concerning the future that I have sought and wish to confirm the Commission's assurances with regard to the concerns expressed by Mr Tomlinson."
"I would like, however, to give some details on a few points concerning the future generated, as it were, by the past."
"For example, it has been asked how the Commission might react if proposals for reforming the common transit system ran up against the veto of one of the contracting parties."
"I have to say that, up to the present, the negotiations within the working group have always made it possible to arrive at a consensus; if, in the process of the reform which we will have to undertake, there were in fact a blocking move from someone, the problem of revising the rules for decision-making would then undoubtedly arise."
"With regard to the question of the present and the future, I would like to revert to the point raised on how we at present monitor the Visegrad countries."
"I have to say that the services of the Commission and the Member States are continuing the close cooperation entered into with the customs authorities of the Visegrad countries to accompany the introduction of this system and to ensure effective supervision."
"On 10 October 1995, at the last meeting in Brussels of the task force which organized the technical assistance to the Visegrad countries, agreement was reached on a number of additional measures to assist the four contracting parties from 1 July 1996 onwards."
"These are multilateral meetings between the Commission and the Visegrad countries to deal with problems connected with the application of the system; visits by Community customs experts to the Visegrad countries and vice versa, and other measures which I could detail and which were detailed in the committee of inquiry."
"I would like to add something about the future, which is the direct subject of your questions, Mr Tomlinson."
"First of all: what line do we propose to take with regard to the reform of the transit system, independently of future extensions?"
"As Director-General Currie said when he came to the committee of inquiry on 17 July, the task force on transit will during the next few days complete its interim report, which will be forwarded to the European Parliament."
"This report will comprise an analysis of transit, identification of the problems, suggestions for reform and the conditions for successful reforms."
"In what way then - and I turn particularly to you, Mr Tomlinson - will the Commission make use of the results of the committee of inquiry?"
"As I have said, the report which the committee is about to present is an interim report: it will be distributed during the next few days to the European institutions, the Member States and operators; it will be followed by a final report - towards the end of January 1997, we expect - which will incorporate the contributions made during the consultations and will list the options which the committee considers appropriate."
"All this work will take - and is already taking - great account of the points to be developed and of what will then be the final report of the committee of inquiry."
"Now what are the reforms of the transit system on which we are actually working?"
"Computerization, the strengthening and extension of the customs union in order to improve cooperation between the customs services and the quality of the checks, especially 'Customs 2000' , the overall management of the system, the strengthening of cooperation between customs and operators, clarification of the responsibilities of the users of the transit system and of the customs authorities."
"Lastly, with regard to the resources, it has been asked what resources are available to the Commission."
"There are those connected with the 'Customs 2000' programme and there are, as far as the associated countries are concerned, the resources of the PHARE programme: in particular, this programme includes ECU 800 000 for technical assistance to the countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) for customs questions for the period from 1 September 1996 to 1 September 1997."
"I would like, in conclusion, to repeat that this was my reply to your question, Mr Tomlinson; in view of the wider scope of the debate, I would not like this reply of mine to pass unnoticed."
"There will not in the meantime be any extension of the transit system to other countries and, as I have stated in detail, other countries will have to show that they are able to adjust themselves effectively to the transit system not only as it is today but as it will have been reformed as a result of the work now in progress."
"Mr President, I should just like to say - and I am sure in this respect I speak on behalf of all members of the committee who asked questions today - that whilst we might all agree with Commissioner Monti that he gave a comprehensive reply, it was a reply to almost everything except the specific questions that Members asked."
"That is part of the frustration of our committee of inquiry."
"Questions are asked specifically on the subjects on which we want information."
"We do not want the generality of information, we want the specific detail."
"I hope now that Commissioner Monti will read the specific questions, will read the inadequacy of his reply as answers to those questions, interesting as it may have been in other regards, and will then answer the questions."
"We approach this with a totally open mind."
"The committee decided not to have a motion to wind up the discussion on the oral question because we did this unusual thing of asking questions to get answers."
"For the next plenary we might have to consider how to respond to the inadequacy of the responses."
"Mr President, I say to Mr Tomlinson that I am really sorry but I cannot agree with him."
"I would like to read out the text of the oral question to which I was asked to give a reply."
"' On 1 July 1996 the common transit system was extended to Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics, despite the Commission admission that the system is in a state of crisis, that there are rising levels of fraud and that the system is in need of fundamental reform' . And then the question: ' Will the Commission give an undertaking that it will not seek to extend the common transit system beyond the four Visegrad countries until such time as the system has been reformed and that these reforms have been shown to be effective in reducing fraud against the system' ?"
"I have articulated, as well as I am able, a response and given an undertaking."
"I am fully prepared to answer, as is my duty, any other questions concerning the past and the Visegrad countries within the context either of the committee of inquiry - I am always at the disposal of the committee - or here in response to specific questions pertaining to those matters."
"Mr President, it is very kind of Commissioner Monti to read me out my question."
"I understood it quite well because I actually wrote it."
"I also understand quite well the first answer."
"We then had a series of supplementary questions and it is the latter I was speaking about when I said that they were not answered."
"We do not have time for me to go through the six specific questions I asked but I have to say that my luck with the Commissioner is rather like my luck with the United Kingdom lottery."
"I choose six numbers every week and none of them ever comes up."
"I asked the Commissioner six supplementary questions and had the same success rate as I have with the national lottery."
"Mr President, regarding this controversy between Mr Tomlinson and Mr Monti, it is necessary to point out that John Tomlinson is not talking only on behalf of his political group but on behalf of my political group and I believe he is talking on behalf of all members of the committee of inquiry."
"And that is what makes the matter so serious, Mr Monti."
"Mr President, I merely wish to confirm my total readiness to cooperate with the committee of inquiry, both in giving a detailed answer to all questions asked for which we have prepared elements of a reply and in taking full account of the committee's future conditions, criticisms and proposals."
"The debate is closed."
"Votes"
"Upon several occasions, this House has called for stricter safety standards for passenger ships."
"In 1994, after the terrible accident to the ferry 'Sea Empress' , we called for a European regulatory framework to be set up which would be consistent with the international rules."
"Today, we have before us a proposal for a directive which reflects our wishes."
"It makes good existing defects, such as the multi-track application of national safety standards."
"It also has the virtue of attacking the systems of navigation and exploitation of vessels."
"We cannot close our eyes to passenger safety, and, in giving my support to Mr Stenmarck's report, I must congratulate him on his efforts."
"After all, we should remember that since 1986 the average number of vessels shipwrecked each year has been 230, with the loss of more than a thousand people."
"It is our responsibility, therefore, to take the necessary steps."
"Langen report"
"My position of principle is that the rates of value-added tax must be allowed to vary from one Member State to another and must not be harmonized."
"The European Union must not interfere in this area; this is a question solely for the Member States acting at national level."
"Just as the report says, there are at present differences in levels of value-added tax, the explanations for which are of course to be found in the Member States and in the ways they finance their public sector."
"In my own country, a relatively high rate of valueadded tax is levied to finance parts of our social security system, which I think is good."
"Value-added tax is also used as a policy instrument to control the supply and demand of goods/services, depending on the priorities adopted."
"This possibility and the right of Member States to make use of it must, I believe, continue to be available in the future."
"The idea that value-added tax should only be collected in the country of production poses the risk of further distortions of competition, since the country of production can be switched at short notice in response to changes in tax rates, whereas consumers have less freedom of choice when it comes to choosing the country in which to consume."
"Colino Salamanca report"
"I voted against this report for the following reasons:"
"1.I am completely opposed to the institution of any new support mechanism in agriculture."
"Although I understand the good intention, I think that the support will lead to an even greater waste of financial resources in this area.2.I am entirely opposed to the principle that the support should be disbursed to producers' associations, which would then pay it out to the individual producers."
"This will force the individual producers to become members of the producers' associations in order to receive the support.3.I am likewise opposed to the condition that producers must undertake to deliver their entire harvest to processing industries."
"This will introduce a distortion by disadvantaging those who produce for the fresh produce market and will inhibit marketing options such as selling part of the harvest through 'pick your own' schemes.To sum up, I consider that the proposal is a typical example of how a subsidy begets a new subsidy."
"The problems of agriculture will not be solved in this way."
"Teverson report"
"I voted in favour of the report because it gives a good presentation and summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the structural funds."
"In the longer term, the entire regional policy of the EU must be reformed."
"The EU Member States must decide for themselves how regional policy efforts are to be deployed, without having to go through Brussels."
"By reducing taxes and duties in regionally sensitive areas, the EU structural funds can be halved and the number of objective areas and programmes can be reduced."
"That would increase effectiveness, simplify the support system and reduce bureaucracy both in the Member States and in the EU."
"Klironomos report"
"First of all I should like to stress that the extravagant optimism, assessments and declarations about the role of the structural funds in Greece, both generally and specifically, cannot conceal the fact that the measures in question do not match up to the words and cannot reverse, or even begin to rectify, the damage done by Community policy overall."
"The main lesson of experience as regards Community funding in Greece is that the appropriations have not been equal to the country's needs. In recent years those needs have become more acute as a result, let it be said, of policies imposed by the European Union itself."
"They are being further increased by the procedure for the pursuit of EMU and the severe fiscal burdens being forced on us in the name of convergence."
"We should also mention the higher level of need imposed by our country's particular geographical configuration and the requirement for Greece to strengthen its position in view of the situation on the frontiers with Turkey and for the purpose of contributing to peace in the wider Balkan area."
"With reference to the effectiveness of the European Union's structural measures, I have to point out that Greece was the only one of the Objective 1 countries whose GDP, expressed as a percentage of the Community average, fell over the course of the implementation of the first CSF from 50 % in 1989 to 40 % in 1993."
"Unfortunately, as far as the second CSF is concerned, we doubt whether it, too, will do very much to assist the development effort in Greece."
"For it to do so, the main eligibility criterion would need to be the contribution made by projects to local and regional development and to the combatting of the structural problems of the economy, rather than to the achievement of the objectives and policies of the European Union."
"One serious weakness of the second CSF, for instance is the very low allocation of funding for the Greek islands."
"We believe that the resources should be increased in line with the problems and needs of our country and that measures must be put in place to speed up the absorption of funding and to monitor its use."
"Without those conditions, regional inequality and decline and divergence will worsen."
"This situation for Greece is one consequence of the Community's regional policy, and it is being exacerbated rather than improved by the much-vaunted reform of the structural funds carried out by the Council and the Commission."
"Without in any way wishing to call the rapporteur's objectivity into question, I consider it inappropriate in principle that Parliament's rapporteur should come from the same country as that in which support is to be assessed."
"For reasons of principle, Parliament should always endeavour to appoint a rapporteur who does not have any special interest in connection with the question under discussion."
"There has also been much debate in the European Union as to whether the EU should have a 'greener' budget."
"I think it would be desirable to pay greater attention to this and to commit more resources to railway and metro developments in Athens than to the motorway works which are mentioned briefly in the explanatory statement to the report."
"Sierra Gonzáles report"
"Without in any way wishing to call the rapporteur's objectivity into question, I consider it inappropriate in principle that Parliament's rapporteur should come from the same country as that in which support is to be assessed."
"For reasons of principle, Parliament should always endeavour to appoint a rapporteur who does not have any special interest in connection with the question under discussion."
"While paragraph 6 of the resolution does criticize the fact that a greater share of the investment in transport networks has been in road rather than rail infrastructure, I think this criticism could have been more strongly worded."
"Support from the structural funds to the Member States is criticized in many quarters in the European Union."
"Amongst other things, it is felt that the support benefits the rich regions of those countries which receive it more than the poor regions."
"The results achieved by support from the structural funds are also insufficiently evaluated."
"These problems are only covered superficially, and it is my impression that the positive aspects are overemphasized at the expense of justified criticism."
"Schiedermeier report"
"The Commission's communication on the European strategy for encouraging local development and employment initiatives is a very positive document which usefully illuminates and supports the activities pursued by all of us, as elected representatives, in the fertile area of local job creation."
"Mr Schiedermeier's report on this document is a good report, too, as it supplements, elucidates and enriches it."
"I myself and the Socialist Group, on whose behalf I speak, will certainly be voting for this report."
"All this prompts a few thoughts on my part, which I shall offer you in a light-hearted way, to cheer up our glum proceedings a little, though they are quite far-reaching for all that."
"What next! All our countries, to differing extents, are being crippled by unemployment."
"We can't do very much about it, mainly because we can't agree on the diagnosis."
"Those political forces in Europe which argue in favour of liberalization, strongly represented in this parliament, consider the situation mainly attributable to malfunctions of the market, excessively rigid structures and what they perceive as an excessive degree of regulatory and social protection."
"The course suggested by this analysis is to restrict state intervention wherever possible - a maximum of deregulation, delegalization and desubsidization."
"I think this analysis is wrong and that course of action ineffective."
"But it does sometimes find majority support in this Parliament."
"The other line of argument, my own, the social democrat line, holds that even - or especially - in a market economy, the public authority, whether it be national and/or European, still has a function of regulation and stimulation."
"The fact that we are living through such a serious situation is largely attributable to the under-use of that function, the inhibition of this responsibility by the forces of conservatism in Europe."
"And here we have the Commission, where the forces of liberalism carry a lot of weight, calmly telling us that in the limited but important sector of local job creation initiatives, government regulation, government stimulation and even, here or there, government subsidies do all have a place."
"And, what's more, it is undeniably true. This is wonderful."
"Positions are changing. We are beginning to see glimmerings of understanding."
"And it is our friend Mr Schiedermeier who produces this report."
"And this report is not a torpedo."
"Wonderful."
"Perhaps I may lose a few votes for our common cause by talking like this."
"Well, so much the worse: nothing is more important than thinking about what one is doing."
"All this debate about one small subject opens the way to very large issues."
"There is a juicy lesson to be learnt, too."
"When the forces of liberalism find that there are a few cases, after all, where we need the State in order to do something intelligent, they are out of their depth."
"Thinking about the right way to use the machinery of government is not their cup of tea."
"And so, like the Commission's document, the report did show signs of confusion."
"It is essential to distinguish between market situations, in which an initial handicap has to be offset, and intermediate situations where government aid is needed temporarily to support the effort to enable new services and previously marginalized workers to become viable in the market, and finally the permanent aid needed to make unprofitable services viable."
"Not all these things can be dealt with in the same way."
"Clarity of thought is essential to effective government action."
"We believe we have made a useful contribution to it."
"We thank the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment for having understood and accepted that contribution."
"And, ladies and gentlemen, we recommend that you should vote as unanimously as possible in favour of this excellent report."
"To begin with I agree with the position adopted in this report, namely that employment initiatives are best taken at what the report calls 'local' level, which I would call national or regional level."
"European cooperation can help to build a framework and infrastructure, but really nothing more than that."
"If this were not so it would be impossible to explain why, within a European economic area a country like Belgium should have an unemployment rate - almost 15 % - more than twice that of its neighbour, the Netherlands, which has less than 7 % unemployment."
"Lest there be any doubt I would add that employment in Belgium is being ruined by a Social-Christian Democrat government which does nothing but think up new taxes and levies and which has already succeeded in pushing up gross wage costs to the highest level in the European Union."
"A second comment is one which I think applies to all the reports on employment considered in this House."
"Once again I deplore the absence of the essential choice in favour of national and European preference."
"I know that Mr Schiedermeier's report addresses a very specific topic, but even in this case it seems to me a most unfortunate tradition of this Parliament that unemployment and jobs are debated without at least touching on the taboo subject of immigration and foreign labour - a major element of national and European preference."
"It is a matter of common sense to ask whether a European Union which has so many millions of people unemployed does not have an equal excess of non-European foreign workers, and incidentally that has nothing to do with xenophobia or anything like that."
"That concludes the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare closed the sitting of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.25 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Thursday, 5 September 1996."
"Order of business"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is to meet from 23 to 27 September and will be looking at the draft Bioethics Convention, among other things."
"Parliament has already held lengthy and detailed discussions on this extremely important issue, but we have unfortunately not yet delivered an opinion on the subject, having failed to adopt the Pelttari report at the July partsession."
"We feel it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament to state its position on this issue, which has such far-reaching implications for the future of mankind."
"We are therefore proposing that our group's oral question should be put on the agenda for this week, and I also hope that the Christian Democrats will propose the same for the PPE Group's question."
"The European Parliament must say something, otherwise the Council of Europe will simply decide what it wants and we shall be left without any official position whatsoever, which would be completely irresponsible of us."
"We have requested, pursuant to Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure, that the vote on this motion today should be taken by roll call, in accordance with Rule 119."
"It is up to you to decide when the debate should be held."
"It was not our intention for us to start the discussion today; we simply wanted to ensure that the issue is debated and voted on at some point during this week."
"Mrs Roth, I have a written request from you for the subject to be included on the agenda for the week at 5 p.m. on Monday, 16 September."
"I see that you meant this differently."
"You meant that it should be taken during the week."
"So the request is for this oral question to be added to the week's agenda."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten wishes to speak in favour of the request."
"Mr President, I find it rather strange that one group has tabled an oral question, but another is allowed to speak first."
"Be that as it may, it is extremely important that we should decide on our position on the Bioethics Convention as a whole."
"We failed to do so in July, as a result of a number of misunderstandings, and I would now urge you and all the other Members of this House to decide what Parliament's position on the subject should be, since having no position at all is the very worst thing we could do."
"I would therefore urge the House to support the inclusion of this oral question at some time during the week."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our opposition to the request that has just been made."
"We are well aware that bioethics is a contentious issue which causes divisions among the various groups and gives rise to questions of conscience. But this is not the problem."
"We are opposed to this request for three reasons."
"Firstly, there has already been a decision and a vote."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights debated these issues at some length, under the guidance of Mr Pelttari, and other committees were involved in the discussions too."
"These culminated in a vote, and we cannot start using oral questions to cast doubt on the validity of a vote against. No parliament in the world can operate in that way."
"Secondly, contrary to what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has said, there has not been any confusion."
"In any event, as the coordinator of the Socialist Group for legal matters, I take it upon myself to say, on behalf of my group, that we had set a minimum level below which basic rights as we see them, in particular women's rights, would no longer be respected in the document that was before us."
"The series of votes led us to take the responsibility of voting against it."
"As far as we are concerned, there has been no confusion."
"The vote was perfectly clear."
"Thirdly, our opinion will be irrelevant in any case."
"The European Court of Justice clearly indicated last March that the Community could not be a party to the convention."
"The Commission refused to ask for a negotiating mandate, and Mrs Cresson has explained..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) Our vote would therefore be no more than a pious wish which the Council of Europe would, of necessity, have to disregard."
"(Applause)"
"I now put the request to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"For Tuesday to Friday, no changes have been proposed."
"I would point out, however, that Question Time to the Council has been removed from the agenda for Wednesday."
"Members will therefore receive written answers to their questions."
"The reason for this is clear, and as you know is due to the large number of items that we have to deal with on Wednesday afternoon."
"Mr President, on Wednesday afternoon we have on our agenda a statement by the Council on the political situation in Turkey and a statement by the Commission on the implementation of the customs union with Turkey."
"Last week in the Conference of Presidents it was agreed that the issue of Cyprus, what had happened in Cyprus over the summer and the tension currently in Cyprus, should be taken as an urgency debate on Thursday afternoon and kept separate from the discussion on Turkey."
"I want to say on behalf of my group - and I know this was said in the Conference of Presidents by our representative - that this is absolutely unacceptable."
"We will be arguing that our relations with Turkey must be, and are, influenced by the way in which that country retains an occupation and invasion force in the north of Cyprus."
"We have just heard in the Turkish Grand National Assembly that the Foreign Secretary of Turkey released 65 million Turkish lire to send a group of the Grey Wolves, a fascist organization, to Cyprus over the summer."
"Those very people, paid for by the state, were involved in the attacks and murders in Cyprus."
"It is unacceptable that we should treat an applicant state of the European Union in a time of crisis and tension to a three or four minute debate as part of the topical and urgent debate."
"My group will be dealing with what has happened in Cyprus as an integral part of our discussion on the political situation in Turkey."
"We hope that other groups will respect that."
"We shall also seek to comment on these events in the resolution."
"We do not seek to remove the item from topical and urgent debate."
"If people wish a second debate on Cyprus on the human rights aspect, fine!"
"But this is a political issue, it must be dealt with as a political issue and we shall certainly be striving to do that."
"Mr President, our group too has just had a meeting with Mr Matsis, the party leader from Cyprus, and we had a very interesting discussion with him."
"I entirely agree with Mrs Green that we should try to include Turkey and Cyprus on the agenda, on Wednesday afternoon at least."
"I did not quite understand what she said about having an urgency debate on Thursday."
"I think if this is what is proposed, then we could also consider having a longer debate on Wednesday afternoon and two resolutions, if necessary."
"It is not really important, but we would at least have Thursday free to look at something else."
"Before further divisions develop among us - and we are still on the order of business - I shall make a proposal to the House, on the basis of what has been said by Mrs Green and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"The groups are of course entirely free to mention any issues relating to Cyprus in the context of the statement by the Council on the political situation in Turkey and the statement by the Commission on the implementation of the customs union."
"That depends on how you organize the debate."
"It is also a question for the groups."
"You decide what you wish to include in the resolution."
"Moreover, you have an opportunity, if you agree on this procedure, of changing the list of urgencies on Wednesday morning and replacing the first item, ' Cyprus' , with a different subject."
"That can be done without any difficulty."
"Should there not be enough time on Wednesday afternoon, I am also prepared to say that the sitting will continue until 8 p.m."
"If you are in agreement with that, we can proceed accordingly."
"Mr President, I am speaking for my Group, since its chairman cannot be here at this time for reasons beyond his control."
"And in expressing my Group's view, I want to say that we agree with the proposal that reference should be made to the Cyprus problem on Wednesday in the statements by both the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, granted the experience we have, it is unthinkable to debate the situation in Turkey, to discuss whether and to what extent Customs Union has been implemented, without also mentioning the Cyprus problem which is absolutely linked with both those subjects."
"In that way, the debate can be more complete and there can be a resolution which, of course, will refer to all three issues: the situation in Turkey, Customs Union, and the Cyprus problem."
"The issue is different under the urgency procedure: in that case the Cyprus problem stands alone because of the murders that took place in the middle of August."
"That is another matter. We should not let one issue get in the way of the other."
"So, we are agreed on the procedure."
"The groups will mention what they consider necessary on Wednesday, and you will decide on Wednesday morning whether or not to leave the item 'Cyprus' on the list of topical and urgent subjects."
"Mr President, I hope the cancelling of Question Time to the Council is an absolute exception."
"I would like to point out to you that when it was decided to move Question Time from its late evening position to an earlier slot, we were assured that it would not be pushed off the agenda."
"So, may I have your assurance that this is an exception."
"This is really only intended as an exception, Sir Jack."
"The group chairmen were agreed, however, that in the special circumstances which we have this week, Question Time could not be held for reasons of time."
"Mr President, a small correction to Tuesday's agenda as regards the Rocard report."
"At the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, it was agreed to start the debate at 4.30 p.m. to comply with the Council's request, but not that it should only go on for an hour, till 5.30 p.m."
"Granted that the Rocard report will start at 4.30 p.m., it could also continue into the evening if necessary, given the importance of the issue."
"I think that simple correction is in line with the Group Presidents' decision."
"That is correct, Mr Dell'Alba, the debate on the Rocard report can be continued after Question Time to the Commission."
"Our aim was to have another hour on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of the Irish presidency; this would therefore be from 4.30 to 5.30 p.m., as set out in the agenda."
"Mr President, it is not unusual for Question Time to be cancelled, unfortunately."
"Since it was moved from its evening slot, it has been postponed or cut short on a number of occasions and this is now the second time it has been cancelled, if I am not mistaken."
"I am afraid that it will carry on like this, because no one bothers to turn up for it now that it is no longer held in the evening, which is why I think it should be returned to its old place."
"The only disadvantage with this is that it means the Council has to work another hour and a half after dinner, but that should not be too much to ask."
"We should now bring this item to an end."
"Mr President, my point of order is based on Rule 103 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Could you please confirm that Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Member of this House, has indeed received the selection of instruments from the Treaties which includes the Joint Declaration on Racism and Xenophobia of 11 June 1986?"
"In this declaration, amongst other things, we vigorously condemn all forms of intolerance, hostility and use of force against persons or groups of persons on the grounds of racial, religious, cultural, social or national differences."
"Recent statements by this Member bring disgrace on Parliament and are clearly a total contradiction of all the texts upon which our Community is founded."
"All Members have received the documents to which you refer, Mrs Berès."
"No, I shall not allow a debate on the matter now."
"We have established the order of business."
"That was a point of order based on Rule 103."
"I am not allowing a debate on the matter now."
"Amendment of Rule 80(1)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0208/96) by Mr Wijsenbeek, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the amendment of Rule 80(1) of the Rules of Procedure on conclusion of the assent procedure."
"The report which it is my privilege to present to you today on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure marks a step towards the further revision of parliamentary procedures."
"This is not just a natural process which every Parliament has to go through from time to time to keep up with changing responsibilities and ideas, it is also necessary to prevent us from becoming bogged down in procedures which are often not entirely clear to those whom we are here to represent."
"The European Parliament sometimes finds it very difficult to get through to the general public properly, partly because of our unfortunate position of having two seats."
"When we meet here in Strasbourg, there are sometimes so many interesting things going on in Brussels that the press prefer to stay there."
"And if we have something important on the agenda, you have to be very familiar with our procedures and be here all the time to understand how everything works."
"We have 20 different types of powers, each with their own characteristics, ranging from simple consultation in one reading to codecision, which can involve three readings and conciliation, or the budget procedure which, including the discharge, involves five different stages."
"It is to be hoped that the IGC can simplify matters a little."
"However, this is not the subject of this report, which deals with just one of those procedures, the assent procedure, under which Parliament is required to grant final assent for an international agreement or legislative proposal."
"Rules 89 and 90 set out more detailed procedures for the accession of new Member States and international agreements."
"These two, like Rule 80, state that the vote is always to be taken, as is customary in Parliament, on the basis of a report drawn up by the committee responsible."
"Let us assume that the committee responsible decides that the agreement, accession treaty or legislative proposal in question is not worthy of assent."
"If the House agrees to reject it, it must vote 'yes' , which means that the agreement, treaty or proposal will not be adopted."
"If the House supports the proposals in question against the advice of the committee, it must vote 'no' ."
"Ladies and gentlemen, believe me when I say that I have no desire to cast doubt on the intelligence of Members of this House, or of the journalists who have to report on everything we get up to, or of the voters who elected us, and who must therefore be extremely intelligent."
"But this procedure can be confusing, even for someone with a high IQ, and this was why our committee, at your request, Mr President, instructed me to present this report to you."
"These proposals will prevent any possibility of an agreement, treaty or legislative proposal being adopted or rejected by mistake on the basis of committee reports."
"From now on, we shall be able to vote 'yes' when we agree with the proposal and 'no' - or 'kata' for those who know Greek - when we want to reject it."
"If you approve this proposal by the required two-thirds majority, Parliament will be helping to make its procedures more transparent for the press and for the public."
"In conclusion, I would just say that I hope the Council and the Commission will follow our example and make their own procedures more transparent."
"Mr President, I can be very brief."
"First, I should like to thank Mr Wijsenbeek for his report."
"It is a technical revision of the Rules aimed at simplifying and making clearer the Rules as they currently stand."
"Mr Wijsenbeek himself summed it up in his own explanatory statement where he said: how are the media, to say nothing of the citizens of the Community, supposed to understand and keep abreast of a procedure in which in order to say Yes, one has to say No?"
"Under the Rules revision if we mean to say Yes we will vote Yes, if we mean to say No we will vote No."
"On that basis the Socialist Group commends and will be supporting the Rules amendment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Human Rights in the European Union"
"The next item is the report (A4-0223/96) by Mrs De Esteban Martín, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on respect for human rights in the European Union in 1994."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank all the political groups for the interest and commitment that they have shown with regard to the drawing-up of this report on respect for human rights in the European Union in 1994."
"As you are all aware, a report of this kind will not be without certain difficulties which require a major effort of cooperation and dialogue, with a view to achieving a compromise that accommodates the various viewpoints and positions."
"We all know that examining and dealing with the issue of human rights is a complex and wide-ranging task, in the sense that there is a great variety of national standards, reflecting the different constitutional traditions which stem from the various histories and specific circumstances of the individual Member States."
"Similarly, at international level, there are many instruments designed to address human rights problems."
"In view of this complexity, and taking account of the provisions of Article F.2 of the Treaty on European Union, I took the view that the European Convention on Human Rights was the proper legal basis for the preparation of this report."
"It is important for us to distinguish between the traditional human rights that are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and the economic and social rights which are also encompassed by this report, and which - as the House will be aware - are different in terms of both their legal nature and the degree to which they are protected."
"Traditional human rights are the rights of individual persons, as determined by the appropriate law, which implies the ability of legal persons to bring proceedings against those who violate such rights, using the necessary means."
"Economic rights, on the other hand, are programmatic, in the sense that they derive from the development of the law, politics and the economy; and the State must therefore guarantee those rights by means of a specific undertaking."
"However, this does not mean that, in general terms, legal persons have the direct ability to demand specifically from the State the benefit implied by the recognition of a given right."
"The State's obligation lies in the fact that it must make available, within the bounds of its economic and financial possibilities, the resources necessary for the fulfilment of those economic, social and cultural rights."
"That distinction being made, Mr President, I have tried in my report to reflect the actual situation of respect for human rights in the European Union in 1994, with priority being given to direct or formal legal sources - such as legislation, case-law and jurisprudence - at national, international and Community level; to the reports of the Council of Europe and the judgments of the Court of Human Rights, which helped us to collect reliable information on the actual situation of respect for human rights in the European Union; and to the contributions of certain nongovernmental organizations."
"Clearly, the Member States of the Union belong to a group of countries which fully guarantee respect for human rights by means of democratic, pluralist political systems with effective parliamentary institutions and independent legal systems. Nevertheless, we were able to identify cases of the abuse of these fundamental rights throughout 1994, including the violation of the right to life by terrorist groups and situations of ill-treatment, particularly in the form of overcrowding in prisons."
"The report expresses concern for the rights of persons charged with an offence, especially as regards the slowness of legal proceedings and the need to establish certain procedural guarantees in the legislation of the Member States. It addresses the subjects of the rights of the child and the need to guarantee the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination in the broadest sense, as well as specifically condemning all manifestations of racism and xenophobia."
"The development of the law within the framework of universal respect for human rights is a fundamental commitment, and the prime objective of any blueprint for a genuinely democratic society has to be human freedom and dignity."
"Consequently, the European Union, which is moving towards a common political future whose legitimacy must be based on fundamental democratic principles, has long been concerned to defend and protect these fundamental rights; and the European Parliament, as an institution directly elected by free universal suffrage, has a special duty to safeguard respect for those rights."
"This Parliament will not have the moral authority to adopt resolutions concerning respect for human rights in third countries if it does not prove capable of deliberation and constructive self-criticism with regard to respect for human rights within the European Union."
"Consequently, I call on the Members of this Parliament to assume their responsibilities, so that together we can take forward this report, the difficulties and complexity of which I referred to earlier."
"The European Parliament must prove capable of adopting resolutions such as that which is now before it, in order to be able to maintain its prestige, authority and influence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mrs De Esteban Martín for all her hard work over the last few months."
"I hope - and this is repeating the call she herself has just made - that Parliament will now be able, this year at least, to adopt a report on the human rights situation in the European Union."
"We failed to do so last year because our discussions were far too ideological, and we lived to regret it, because the House really has no place discussing and passing resolutions on human rights violations outside the Union when it cannot even draw up a report on the situation within the Union because it is unable to agree on a definition of what human rights are."
"I should therefore like to stress that the report as it now stands - thanks once again to Mrs De Esteban - is very much in line with my group's ideas and is something that we can broadly subscribe to."
"We are most grateful to the rapporteur and the committee for adopting it."
"The fact is that as we go into the twenty-first century, we need to set about extending the traditional 18th- and 19thcentury concept of civil human rights to include a number of basic rights which are of fundamental importance to people in Europe and throughout the world."
"There are rights associated with the environment, because the inviolability of man also involves environmental considerations."
"There are social and cultural rights which advanced societies such as ours in western Europe should be able to guarantee."
"These are all ideas which should be included in the report as new perspectives generated by our discussions."
"We hope that our colleagues in the PPE Group in particular will support the rapporteur, who has suggested in her report that we should work together to try to extend the concept of human rights, whilst still carrying out our traditional review of the human rights situation in the European Union."
"You would be playing a vital role in ensuring a majority for the report, on which there is already broad agreement, rather than its rejection, which is what the result might be if you voted against it with the extreme right."
"We must not allow a repetition of the events of last year, when the human rights debate foundered because the extreme right used their votes to prevent the House from adopting a report on the human rights situation."
"Or do we really want to allow people who sit in the House but should really be in this report to determine how the human rights debate in the European Union should develop?"
"Do we want to let Mr Le Pen, a racist and fascist extremist, have a say in how the human rights debate is conducted?"
"He can try to sue everyone who calls him a racist and a fascist in France."
"He is welcome to try to sue me."
"That is what he is!"
"The far right-wing parties in Europe are trying to use the kind of fascism we saw in the 1920s and 1930s to appeal to people's baser instincts and to bring the oppressed minorities even further under the yoke."
"And these people are sitting here in the House voting on this report."
"It is up to you, the members of the UPE and PPE Groups, to help us to ensure that this rabble are not given the opportunity to decide what human rights should be in the European Union."
"That is why we welcome this report as it stands."
"We intend to vote in favour of the amendments we have tabled, and some of those proposed by Mrs De Esteban."
"I am addressing my colleagues from the conservative groups when I say that I hope we have finally found a common platform on which we can conclude the human rights debate in the European Parliament with dignity."
"Mr Schulz, I cannot let the word 'rabble' pass as a description of Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, we must not allow the human rights report to be used as a cudgel in our internal political wranglings, and I am afraid that your speech, Mr Schulz, showed distinct signs of doing that."
"How can you talk about human rights in a way which is bound to earn you a reprimand from the President?"
"We want to see Mr Le Pen and his colleagues out of Parliament just as much as you do, but this is a matter for the voters, not for you as an individual!"
"Mrs De Esteban Martín has done an excellent job on her report, and made an outstanding speech on which I warmly congratulate her."
"This Parliament has not had much fortune up to now - to put it mildly - with its human rights reports, which have either failed to be adopted or been highly controversial, for the most part because they were not so much a reflection of the human rights situation in Europe as of the internal political disagreement on the concept of human rights."
"As long as this remains the case and we are unable to find a common definition of human rights, we cannot claim to speak about them with any credibility or legitimacy."
"We cannot allow the concept of human rights to be expanded indefinitely."
"The previous report called for it to include things like the right to housing, work, a healthy environment and life-long education, which are all entirely legitimate political demands, but as Mrs De Esteban Martín rightly pointed out, they are not human rights, they are a political manifesto."
"Manifestos are there to be argued about: human rights should not be."
"That is why we need to restrict ourselves to the concept of human rights and leave manifesto demands alone."
"The simple key to the problem lies in the Convention on Human Rights, which everyone has signed, and the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg."
"The issues which can be brought before the Court are human rights matters, and everything else should be excluded."
"Mr President, a debate on human rights in the European Union should be an occasion to highlight issues of major importance."
"However, many elements of the report which we are now considering, not through any fault of the rapporteur, are unacceptable."
"I will come to these shortly."
"I have no difficulty in supporting the request to the Commission to submit a communication on instruments aimed at combating trafficking in human beings, a subject which we will have an opportunity to consider later this week in the context of our group's oral question on the need for EU measures aimed at tackling violence against children, which is particularly and tragically topical in the light of recent events in Belgium."
"Equally I have no difficulty in endorsing - and indeed emphasizing - the need for effective cooperation to combat drug gangs whose members, if they care in any way, have so many deaths and ruined lives on their hands."
"Existing policies on drugs have failed to prevent illegal drug trafficking, which is now more intense and more deadly than ever before."
"The days of kid-glove treatment for drug pushers and the unseen drug barons must end."
"It is a question of who represents the law: the drug barons and the murder squads or the police and the justice department or the politicians."
"In my own country gang warfare, intimidation and shootings are becoming all too frequent an occurrence, particularly in my own constituency."
"In West Dublin, in my own constituency and in the inner city the drugs crisis and heroin addiction have reached epidemic proportions."
"The people appear in certain areas to have resolved to take the law into their own hands in an effort to protect their own children and go beyond the law in some cases."
"The cold-blooded murder of an Irish journalist, my friend Veronica Guerin, by one of our drug barons whose identity is known but who is evading prosecution is only one recent case."
"These evil men who toy with and destroy the lives of adults and children alike, who pay no respect to human rights, must be brought to book and the full rigour of the law brought to bear on them."
"Their ill-gotten gains must be frozen."
"They must be prevented from transferring their assets anywhere within the Community."
"The necessary police and judicial cooperation must be forthcoming at European level, and urgently so."
"One has to ask who rules society."
"Many of our citizens are asking this now."
"Is it the legitimate forces of law and order or the drug barons operating throughout Europe with their vast fortunes and their hit-men striking terror into our towns and cities?"
"As a result of the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the adoption of many amendments, the balance of Mrs de Esteban Martin's report has been overturned."
"On the one hand we are calling for effective cooperation to combat drug barons and on the other we are turning the report into a charter for prisoners, with scant reference to the needs and rights of the victims of crime."
"Many of these prisoners are the very people who are responsible for organized crime, murdering and terrorizing elderly people in their own homes."
"No reference has been made to the need for the transfer of prisoners which could go a long way to restoring the IRA cease-fire."
"There is an awful lot to be said for this report."
"I congratulate Mrs de Esteban Martin on the immense work she has put into it but I think that when it comes to voting we will either have to abstain or vote against because of the complexity."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by sounding a warning note in this debate."
"The world has never seen such long lists of human rights as in the constitutions of the former communist states."
"Page after page, they set out all the rights which people had in the communist people's democracies, and because there were so many rights, it was always possible to suppress one by referring to another."
"Social rights were used as an excuse for suppressing political freedoms, and without political freedom, it was impossible to check whether social rights were being suppressed, so they were naturally suppressed too, with the result that people had neither one freedom nor the other."
"That is why we have had these repeated disputes concerning human rights reports here in Parliament."
"Some of us quite seriously take the view that human rights in Europe are damaged by including everything possible from our domestic party programmes."
"If Mr Newman never had his human rights reports adopted, it was because he could not refrain from adding every possible item from his domestic party programme in the United Kingdom - reasonable points, no doubt, but items which do not belong in a report on human rights."
"This report by Mrs De Esteban is much better."
"It is shorter, and therefore more powerful."
"I am pleased that it also addresses the question of trade union freedoms."
"We should not just be stressing the freedom to form unions and associations and campaigning for such rights; we must also emphasize the freedom to remain outside these organizations without a threat to one's trade or occupation."
"I also think it is necessary for us to have a separate clause on the need for the Member States to punish offences against children, even if these are committed in countries where they are not prohibited."
"And the right to life was, after all, referred to as the very first right in the American declaration of independence."
"We in the Liberal Group will be voting against several paragraphs in the report."
"I would ask the House to appreciate that we are also voting against some things that we may well agree with, but are doing so because we do not feel that they belong in a report on human rights."
"We hope the Socialist Group will change its mind and not vote to include so many party political items in the report that we are obliged to vote against it at the end."
"We would vote in favour of the report as it is now, but there are limits to what we can accept being included, and we think there are a good many paragraphs which should be taken out of the report as it now stands."
"As Liberals, we are ardent supporters of human rights."
"We value them so highly that we do not wish to have them mixed up with everything else."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the area of human rights involves enormous problems, and without wishing to neglect all the other issues associated with human rights, which are often flouted in the Member States, I shall confine myself today to talking about the predicament of those families without papers who are suffering violence at the hands of the French Government."
"These families are hoping that their problem will be resolved without delay."
"This House can help by supporting their campaign."
"In France, the Pasqua laws of 1993 on immigration have 'clandestinized' - if I may use the term - many immigrant families and put them in a situation of permanent legal insecurity."
"Parents of children born in France are being refused the right to stay and threatened with expulsion."
"Asylum-seekers are being herded shamefully onto chartered aircraft, and the Minister of the Interior regards these expulsions with the same satisfaction as if they were the tally of a successful day's hunting."
"Since March, these people without papers have been conducting an admirable campaign, and I would pay tribute in particular to the courage of the hunger strikers."
"They have had the support of associations, churches, trade unions and political parties, like it or not."
"A large delegation of people without papers will be in Strasbourg on Wednesday to inform Members of the reasons for their actions and their objectives, and to breathe the spirit of the church of St Bernard into our Chamber - which for some of us would be no bad thing."
"The French Government has responded to their quest for recognition and justice with contempt, excessive violence or an entirely arbitrary approach to dealing with individual cases."
"Our group supports these people without papers in their fight against a government whose immigration policy has been reduced to a low-grade policing operation for sordid political ends."
"Although we need to combat clandestine immigration, its networks and traffickers, we cannot do so by disregarding people's rights."
"We are asking for the position of those without papers, who have settled in France legitimately, to be regularized without delay, out of respect for both human rights and international conventions."
"By the same token, I welcome what is happening in Spain and Portugal."
"By contrast, at European level, I deplore and condemn the recommendations and resolutions adopted by the Council, which are always more restrictive and discriminatory as regards immigration and asylum."
"Let us say no to fortress Europe!"
"Let us say yes to a Europe of brotherliness and solidarity!"
"It is a matter of urgency to bring this strategy of scapegoats to an end. Using immigration for political purposes is dangerous, and only serves to strengthen and lend credibility to those who favour a populist policy based on exclusion and xenophobia."
"The axes wielded by the French police in the church of St Bernard prepared the ground for Mr Le Pen - who I believe is a Member of this House - to make his disgraceful racist comments about the races being unequal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we start talking about human rights here in our own back yard, as it were, I really do have the impression that there are a good many among us who think the same as the Pharisee in St Luke's Gospel, Chapter 18, verse 11: ' God, I thank thee that I am not - that we are not - as other men are' ."
"This is a very two-faced view of things: we make a great deal of noise about human rights, but are very selective when it comes to putting them into practice."
"Human rights policy here is always primarily a question of protecting interests."
"A political theory of relativity seems to apply in our dealings with countries which commit classic human rights violations: the bigger and more important these countries are, the quieter our anger."
"It is always - and this brings me back to where I started - easier to condemn crimes in others than to acknowledge one's own wrongdoings, but this is exactly where the question of credibility comes in."
"We must all take a long, hard look at just how good the human rights record is in the European Union."
"For the sake of our own credibility, we must not just concentrate on defining human rights on paper, as has been done so often in various protocols, conventions, final acts and declarations."
"We also need to find out what the situation is in reality, and assess it using a very broad and comprehensive definition of the concept of human rights, rather than a narrow, restrictive interpretation."
"So when I talk about human rights, I include the right to a healthy environment, I include poverty and exclusion, I include the rights of women, children, the elderly, disabled persons, homosexuals and lesbians, foreigners and refugees."
"The conservatives have scorned this as being what they call a watered-down version of the traditional concept of civil human rights."
"So including social and ecological rights is meant to be wateringdown?"
"This is what the developing countries have been criticized for doing for years: demanding social rights to help their poor and suffering people out of poverty."
"But what has Europe been doing?"
"It is the EU countries themselves which have been watering down traditional agreements such as the Geneva convention on refugees by failing to apply them correctly."
"So the main danger for human rights is that they will gradually cease to be binding, not because they have become so all-embracing, but because of the European Union's failure to apply them."
"Only if we in the House are prepared to tackle the existing abuses as a domestic policy issue will the annual human rights report be anything more than just lipservice."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for adopting a genuinely broad and comprehensive definition of human rights, and I hope that this report on the human rights situation in the EU in 1994 will now finally be given the necessary majority in the House in September 1996."
"Mr President, our group will of course vote in favour of Mrs De Esteban Martín's excellent report."
"However, in discussing human rights in the European Union, we cannot confine ourselves to the behaviour of the Member States and their governments towards their own citizens."
"Here in Parliament, we ought also to be discussing our behaviour towards the citizens of third countries, and how such behaviour should be firmly incorporated into our laws, regulations, the attitude of the authorities, and everyday life and practices."
"But what does fighting for human rights really mean in practical terms?"
"It means being opposed to battering down the doors of a church with axes in order to seize hunger strikers confined to their beds."
"It means obliterating the disgraceful assertion which would have us believe that men are not born equal before the law."
"Of course, the volley of warning shots which has been fired recently in France by militant fascists has only a limited range."
"But let us be on our guard!"
"The way in which we now treat people from Africa, Turkey or the Arab countries, and the inhumanity we have shown towards them, certainly foreshadows the way in which we, the citizens of the European Union, will be treated if we leave the way clear for the nationalists. They are enemies of democracy who can easily turn into assassins, as they have already shown recently here in Europe."
"Mr President, respect for human rights, which has its roots in our commitment to the dignity of the person and thus in our oldest spiritual traditions, deserves the utmost attention from the countries of Europe."
"That is why the Member States of the Union are particularly vigilant in this context, especially France, which has respected human rights perfectly well in the case of the immigrants without papers who, whether Mrs Pailler likes it or not, have after all broken our laws."
"It is in order to protect these rights that the Member States have acceded to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"We are today considering the question of whether the European Union as such should accede to the Convention."
"The Esteban Martín report answers this in the affirmative."
"We do not share this view, since accession, which would be of little practical use, would cause the Union to take an institutional leap forward which it did not control."
"The fact is that Article F of the Treaty already states that the Union is to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and, for its part, the Court of Justice has integrated them into its caselaw."
"In reality, the only outstanding issue is the possibility of a divergence of view on matters of Community law between the court in Strasbourg and the court in Luxembourg. However, this is of secondary importance, and does not present any difficulty which could not be resolved in the course of time."
"On the other hand, the accession of the Union to the Convention would involve a complex set of legal arrangements which would be slow to use, since on top of the delays in our Court of Justice, there could be an appeal to the court in Strasbourg."
"In these circumstances, the only advantage of direct accession by the Community would be to bring it a little closer to a goal at which it has long been aiming, namely to pass itself off as a state."
"Moreover, if the Union were to accede in this capacity, it would first have to be given legal personality. This would once more lead us into uncharted territory."
"Finally, if the Community, or the Union, were able to conclude international conventions on human rights, this would doubtless mean that, in this area, it would henceforth have a general competence that has always been denied it in the Treaties."
"This would obviously be even more true if one were to include a list of basic rights in the Treaty, as some have been demanding."
"Should there be such a swing from technical to general competences, we would not be very far away from a change in the nature of the European institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is strange to hear Parliament discussing human rights when just now the President twice refused to let me speak so that I could reply to Mrs Berès and Mr Schulz, both of whom had directly insulted our colleague Jean-Marie Le Pen and thus indirectly the other ten National Front Members of the House, including myself."
"Furthermore, I am bound to say that the people have already decided on that particular issue. Last night, four byelections took place which showed the National Front making very considerable progress, in spite of the debate that has been raging in the media throughout the past week."
"So Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure has not been observed."
"Point noted."
"Human rights are, it is true, the most appropriate basis for the worship of a particularly obnoxious vice, called hypocrisy. Unfortunately, the report we are debating here today has a grave historical tradition behind it, since as long ago as 1793, Robespierre had a particularly demagogic declaration on human rights approved by the Convention, and accompanied it with a brand of state terrorism known as the Terror."
"Another example referred to just now by a colleague is the USSR under Stalin, who, without batting an eyelid, signed a splendid Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the San Francisco Conference."
"Having a Gulag that contained millions of prisoners did not embarrass him in the least."
"Furthermore, the great philosopher Hegel, in his writings on the French Revolution, very ably showed how modern totalitarianism was founded precisely on applying general legal and philosophical norms, which we call human rights, in order to crush the individual."
"Leaving aside this philosophical debate, I note that the report fails to mention certain breaches of human rights which nevertheless cannot be denied. A case in point is the infringement of the right to free speech."
"Our movement, the National Front, has been the victim of some extremely serious violations of the right to free speech. These have occurred not only as a result of the sometimes arbitrary behaviour of the media and the government, but also as a result of a communist-inspired law - the Gayssot law - a totalitarian measure which has no place in a democratic country."
"Moreover, the Justice Minister recognized its totalitarian nature at the time it was adopted."
"Another example is the violation of the freedom of the nations of Europe to decide by referendum whether or not they really wish to become countries of immigration."
"In this context, I would refer you to the works of Kant, who states in his plan for everlasting peace that the native people of a country have always had the right to say whether or not they would accept immigrants."
"I should mention that Kant was particularly concerned about protecting the American Indians. That unfortunate race has had to suffer immigration to the point where it has now almost disappeared, at least as a sovereign people."
"Violation of the safety of the individual is yet another example. Strangely enough, this report has very little to say on the subject."
"I see that five times as many crimes are now committed in the European Community as in 1957."
"As is usual in cases where human rights are violated, it is the poor who are the victims."
"Infringement of the right to work, as mentioned by the rapporteur, represents another very serious assault on human rights. However, she was careful not to say that massive unemployment is the result of European policy on reducing inflation and unbridled free trade."
"Amongst the 20 million unemployed it is once again, as if by chance, the weakest who are affected, as they are by immigration and insecurity."
"All these violations, which are neglected or ignored in the report, obviously affect the weakest of our fellow citizens and represent a decline in civilized standards in everyday life, even though, day after day, people are frantically publishing texts on human rights."
"All of which goes to prove that an internationalist Europe is an oligarchic idea designed to protect the interests of an extremely arrogant ruling class which has taken over the reins of power in Europe and is pursuing policies that show contempt for people's interests."
"Firstly, I am astonished that there is nothing in the report about the right to life of the unborn child, which is quite plainly not recognized. Such an omission makes a mockery of two thousand years of Christian tradition and two and a half thousand years of humanist tradition, since Hippocrates himself had already acknowledged this right five centuries before Christ."
"The attitude to immigration is yet another example."
"The report does not mention the need for a democratic provision, once again, to enable people to decide whether immigration is justified."
"I should also like to condemn paragraph 60, which criticizes the attitude of the Greek Government."
"I regard this as an infringement of Greek sovereignty which I find hard to countenance on the part of the European institutions."
"With regard to the condemnation of racism in paragraph 86, I note that no mention is made of the need to protect members of the native population who are the victims of racism on the part of certain immigrants."
"One has the impression that it is always the same people who are the victims of racism. However, any group of people can experience racist attacks."
"This has indeed happened to the native population in most European countries, but there is nothing about it in the report."
"Finally, paragraph 93 states that the extreme right-wing parties advocate xenophobia."
"I would make the point that xenophobia has existed throughout history, both on the right and on the left."
"The Hébertistes were xenophobes during the French Revolution;"
"Blanqui was a xenophobe."
"Nowadays, all the television channels are guilty of xenophobia against Iraq, to say nothing of the anti-Russian xenophobia to be found in some French newspapers, such as that prestigious daily 'Le Monde' ."
"As regards the right of family reunification, it should have been made clear that this is to take place in the host country."
"I have one final comment to make, namely that current economic policies in Europe show no respect for economic rights, but I have already said as much a few minutes ago."
"As a result, I believe that there are huge gaps in this report, which is immensely hypocritical and thus reflects the present state of the political debate."
"Mr President, it is very distressing to hear what we have just heard when we still..."
"Is this what you call free speech!"
"Let me express my views - I said nothing at all while Mr Blot was speaking."
"I was saying, Mr President, that it is very distressing to hear what we have just heard when we still have in our minds the pictures shown on French television last night of a demonstration by Mr Blot's party that was no more than a sordid exploitation of a human tragedy being acted out in France."
"(Heckling) Free speech, Mr Blot, free speech!"
"This is not a personal attack on Mr Blot. It is simply an attack on the exploitation of this tragic event in France by a political party for purely racist and electoral reasons."
"And why?"
"Because the decision to hold a demonstration, Mr Blot, was taken..."
"(Applause) The decision, as you well know, was taken only after the members of the National Front had received confirmation of the origins - I did not say nationality - of the perpetrator of the crime."
"He was of Moroccan descent, and last night on television, Mr Le Pen referred to a Moroccan."
"To Christine Ockrent he insisted: ' No, he was not French, he was Moroccan' ."
"Whereas we know that he was French, with a French identity card."
"Unfortunately, he had a Moroccan mother."
"But enough said about intentions."
"What this really means - and this is what the National Front has said in a number of past statements, I would point out - is that if you were to come to power, you would not beat about the bush as regards nationality and you might well, as happened under the Vichy regime, simply turn the clock back."
"I am sorry, Mr President, I shall now return to what I really wanted to say, which is that Parliament devotes a considerable amount of time to condemning human rights violations in third countries, and quite rightly so."
"There is a French saying that if you climb a coconut tree, you need to be wearing clean trousers."
"So are we really in a position to be lecturing people, when human rights are not universally respected in the European Union, and when we all know very well that there are indeed numerous infringements?"
"In the time I have left, I shall give just one example. It concerns the tragic way in which the right to asylum in Europe is becoming more and more exclusive every year."
"Under the Geneva Convention, however, the European Union has a duty to protect those who are being persecuted which cannot be abandoned."
"But as a result of some restrictive interpretations of the Geneva Convention, this protection is no longer guaranteed, and the number of people receiving immigrant status is currently declining, even though not a great deal of progress is being made in the world towards improved respect for human rights."
"For instance, among those without papers in Paris, there were some who had been refused asylum, even though the UNHCR had recognized that they were genuinely at risk in their own countries."
"I would end by saying that it is essential for us, at the very least, to condemn violations of human rights within the European Union as we do in the case of third countries."
"That is the subject of the report we are discussing today."
"Last year, however, we were not even able to approve and agree on the 1993 report on human rights."
"Our refusal to do so sanctioned the opposing stance of two different views of human rights: a static view, rigidly based on fundamental rights, and a broader, progressive view, in touch with changes in our society."
"This distinction still persists - as we have just seen - and threatens to lead to the same outcome."
"I too would therefore draw attention to the remarkable achievement of the rapporteur in managing to reconcile these two disparate points of view."
"She has shown great courage under extremely difficult conditions."
"I hope that her efforts will not have been in vain."
"A positive vote might lead to a calmer approach in future years."
"Our credibility outside the European Union is at stake."
"Mr President, I must protest about the way in which you have applied the Rules of Procedure, or rather not applied them."
"It is quite disgraceful that, regardless of the subject under discussion, a speaker on the list who has a speaking time can in fact have it virtually doubled to enable him to hurl abuse at another Member, before going on to make his speech."
"This cannot be allowed, and I would ask for this point to be noted in the Minutes."
"Mr Bazin, your comments will be entered in the Minutes but I was generous because of my interpretation of the facts."
"Our colleague was, it seemed to me, wrongly interrupted and so I gave her an extra twenty to thirty seconds. I do not see that as a violation of our Rules."
"Let us continue our debate calmly, I hope. Mrs Colombo Svevo, you have the floor."
"Mr President, we need a report like this and we also need to think carefully about its coverage."
"Year on year we need to take stock, in summary, of the standing of these rights within the Union."
"In my view the rapporteur has made a very good effort at that, but every year there is the recurring diatribe from those who believe that the report should concern itself strictly with fundamental human rights and those who want it extended to economic and social rights."
"There are many arguments on either side, but if we were to keep strictly to the position of those who concentrate exclusively on fundamental rights, we would have to succeed, together with the Council of Europe, in pinpointing increasingly scrupulously every violation and shortfall in that area."
"For example, we ought to think carefully about the right to life and human rights as regards what is going on in the field of bio-ethics, finding free expression and new language so that new ways of thinking can be continually opened up."
"This would not mean cutting back, but we should honestly say that the other rights ought to be the subject of a parallel report on social and economic rights."
"If we do want to try to include them in a single report, and I think it is possible, then clearly social and economic rights, within the report on human rights, cannot be confined to a repetitive list of all the objectives we are raising to the level of rights but which are not rights in the legal sense."
"We will also have to find the right point of convergence for the coverage of this report, and that point can be identified because court judgements emphasize that, while the Convention on Human Rights essentially sets out civil and political rights, most of these do have economic and social repercussions and there are no hard and fast walls dividing them."
"In fact the Convention is intended to uphold actual rights as well as theoretical rights, which is why the practical application of these rights by the State confirms the interdependence between civil and political rights."
"So I call for a debate on this issue of possible convergence before the next report on human rights so that Parliament can approve it much more widely."
"It is important for all the countries to reach the widest consensus on this."
"That is the target our rapporteur set herself and I thank her for the work she has done."
"Mr President, I may not have been present for the whole debate, but I did listen very carefully to the last speech and I think it pinpointed the problem we are dealing with."
"Mrs Colombo Svevo's experience has in fact enabled her to encapsulate it perfectly: at the moment the report is again in the eye of the storm because we cannot get agreement on the concept of 'human rights' in this Parliament, nor can it be established whether we can or cannot effectively bring violations of the civil and general rights of Union citizens to general attention within our Community."
"In our view the problem is that the concept has actually been stretched to an extremely risky and dangerous extent."
"When people start talking about social rights, economic rights, union rights, the right to a home, work, health and so on, we are really getting into a minefield, and I think we have to give some thought to this."
"For instance I do not believe we can talk about a right to work, but rather about a right to access to work;"
"I do not think we can talk about a right to a home, but rather about a right to shelter;"
"I do not think we can talk about a right to health, in the strict sense, but rather about a right to choose between different health systems."
"Mrs Colombo Svevo is quite correct when she says we must reach agreement."
"I fear we will end up arguing again, or perhaps failing to approve - again - this report on human rights in the Union in 1994, demonstrating for the nth time that we are not even capable of reaching agreement on what constitutes a violation of citizens' fundamental civil rights."
"I present just one symbolic case: the issue of justice in our countries."
"Well, if we do not agree on the starting point, namely this point, we will never get a result."
"So I would suggest that on this occasion - and I make this a formal request - we look for the lowest common denominator of drawing up an internal self-regulation code for Parliament so that we can finally come to an agreement on what constitutes human rights."
"Without this internal regulation code we will continue to argue, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and we will go on failing to pass any report on human rights in 1993, 1994 or 1995."
"Mr President, Mrs De Esteban's report is the first to succeed in showing a certain respect for human rights within the European Union, and I should like to thank her for that."
"However, there is one point with which I would take issue, and that is the point about the right of association for conscripts and regular military personnel, which is something that I myself and many others in the House fought for a number of years ago."
"This right of association may now be recognized in the resolution, but there is still far too much scope for preventing soldiers from exercising it."
"Reference is made, for example, to special characteristics of hierarchy and discipline and any restrictions considered necessary because of the role they play in guaranteeing national security."
"Any ordinary soldier out on patrol knows that there is no point in even thinking about what we call human rights."
"The right of association is a fundamental right in any democratic state, and I reject the tough conditions which the rapporteur is proposing to apply here and sincerely hope that the amendment on this point will be adopted."
"It is high time that the Member States started talking about what the right of association means in the European context, now that multinational military forces are being set up and Europe's defence policy is set to develop further."
"Mr President, I should like to begin my speech by congratulating Parliament on the step forward which it is taking and the political maturity that it is displaying in debating a report on respect for human rights in the European Union; because the fact is that human rights are being violated in the Member States of the Union, and not only the so-called 'modern' or social, economic and environmental rights, but also - and this is more serious - those enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"I am confident that tomorrow, without further delay, we shall prove capable of adopting the resolution contained in Mrs De Esteban's report, and that consequently we shall display sufficient political courage and consistency to engage in open self-criticism which leads our respective Member States to take the necessary measures to eliminate these violations of human rights."
"I should like to remind the House that the motion for a resolution on the illegal deportation of 103 immigrants without papers from Melilla, Spain - which was included in the topical and urgent debate at the July part-session at my instigation - was roundly rejected. A golden opportunity was thereby lost to condemn publicly a specific case of the violation of human rights: that committed by the Spanish authorities in the form of the deportation of the immigrants in question, with total contempt for the European Convention on Human Rights and even Spanish laws, as indicated recently by the Spanish Ombudsman."
"Today, in contrast, I welcome the fact that the issue is being addressed at this part-session, and that the House is finally displaying some consistency - since it would make no sense to hold this debate and disregard previous events."
"Indeed, Mr President, in our resolution, we call on the Member States to ensure that detention prior to deportation is ordered only for a short period, and we maintain that the return of a person to a country where he or she risks being persecuted constitutes a violation of human rights."
"Both these factors came into play in the Melilla case, especially in the sense that the majority of the deportees were waiting to receive a formal reply to their application for asylum."
"Consequently, I believe that it is time for us to leave the rhetoric behind and address specific cases."
"It is time, as we say in my country, to replace words with deeds - and I am sure that our concern at human rights violations will not only be displayed when such violations occur beyond the borders of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Esteban Martín's excellent report should arouse a feeling of humility on the part of us MEPs who are so quick to condemn human rights violations in other parts of the world."
"It shows to what extent the fundamental rights of human beings are being flouted in our own so-called democratic countries."
"Of course there should be a more refined interpretation of the concept of human rights in the European Union."
"Unemployment, exclusion and poverty, which are the lot of a growing number of our fellow citizens, open up an area where respect for individual rights should be improved, and the European Social Charter is a response to this new demand."
"We cannot, however, classify everything neatly under the heading 'human rights' ."
"To do so would be hypocritical and ineffective. The gaps we have noted in social justice require policies based on an act of will, which is not quite the same thing as dealing with these problems of infringements of civil liberties."
"This is all the more important since - no doubt not by chance - it is an area in which the European Union has kept a low profile, probably for reasons of subsidiarity."
"Be that as it may, recent events have demonstrated just how flimsy our achievements are with regard to human rights, especially in my own country."
"I will not dwell on the outrageously racist nature of certain statements."
"Nor will I dwell on the recent expulsion from France of the people without papers."
"The brutality with which they were treated is particularly unacceptable, since I would point out that deporting people en masse is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Finally, I should also like to say a word about the rights of the child."
"The violations of these rights make it a matter of urgency to include a charter of children's rights in the Treaty on European Union."
"Mr President, there are sound reasons for arguing that human rights are indivisible; in principle, however, the traditional fundamental rights should be distinguished from socio-economic objectives, and this is where the report by Mrs De Esteban Martín falls down."
"In recent decades the spotlight has been very much on social rights, but at the same time we seem to have forgotten that rights, when acquired, create just as much responsibility."
"The report illustrates the spirit of our culture: we have rights, therefore we make demands."
"However, we are not yet in a position to make any fundamental statements about human life."
"The report is against the death penalty, but says nothing about unborn life, which is meant to be covered by national legislation in the Member States."
"In my country, we now have an absurd situation where anyone performing an illegal abortion is liable to 12 years in prison for violently terminating a human life, which is classified as murder."
"However, if a pregnancy is terminated at the request of the woman herself, the social system will cover all the costs because she is exercising her right to self-determination."
"Fortunately, a great deal has already been achieved in the social field, and it makes sense to establish clear objectives for the many social problems in our society."
"But we should not forget that society cannot exist without fundamental spiritual rules and values."
"The fact that we have never before had such prosperity, such high levels of education, social services and health care, and at the same time so much crime, violence and drug addiction, is surely food for thought."
"In a society which seems to have abandoned God and the Ten Commandments and in which people's aspirations do not extend beyond the here and now, it has been suggested that true happiness in life lies in acquisition and our right to independence."
"However, it should therefore come as no surprise that so many people struggle to find a meaning to life, or that greed, crime and racism are eating away at their rights."
"Mr President, there are different approaches to human rights in the European Union."
"Those of us who raise social rights and rights at work as human rights are accused by some of resorting to the Stalinist demagogy which uses social or collective provision as an excuse for suppressing human rights."
"This was true of the former Soviet bloc but it is certainly not true of me and those of us supporting the amended report."
"All the usual items listed as human rights - including the right to life, freedoms of conscience, religion, speech and private life, democratic rights, pluralism, the rule of law - are included and supported by me and those who think like me."
"The fresh approach we take is to include such matters as social rights, ecological rights and cultural rights, and to regard these as fundamental human rights too."
"What about the approaches of the two main groups in this Parliament opposing this fuller concept of fundamental human rights?"
"Liberals have strong policies on certain individual rights linked to their support for individual liberty and freedoms."
"However, pre-eminent for the Liberals seems to be laissez faire economic freedom for individuals to do in the economic marketplace whatever they want without too much concern about the effects on people with fewer entrepreneurial inclinations or abilities or less economic power."
"In this ideological approach the Liberals are supported by other economic liberals, including most British Conservatives."
"For Liberals individuals have the fundamental right to seek to become millionaires or to seek to create a large business or to live in a mansion, but individuals do not have the fundamental rights to live free from poverty, to have a job or to reside in decent housing."
"When Mrs Thatcher claimed that there is no such thing as society, just individuals, she crystallized this philosophy."
"The other main group opposing a full inclusive definition of human rights is the Christian Democrats."
"In western and southern Europe Conservatives have not been at the forefront of the struggle for individual liberty and freedoms."
"Certainly they now accept them and the democratic norms which exist in the EU."
"Christian Democrats appreciate perhaps more than Liberals the idea of social solidarity in collective values and that there is such a thing as society which has a duty to support weaker individuals, yet when it comes to specific commitments in this area the Christian Democrats always seem to find reasons to vote against and, at best, just to resort to paternalism."
"Society has a duty to organize itself - ourselves - to provide work for all, decent housing and free education."
"And, yes, that involves planning and intervention, not just leaving everything to the anarchy of the untrammelled free market."
"Will the Christian Democrats support these fundamental rights if they are described as fundamental duties? - because they are duties as well as rights."
"In conclusion, I call on all democratic Members of this Parliament to support this report and to have the courage to support full human rights in the European Union as we enter the new century."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strong protection of human rights is one of the most important elements in the Union's foundations."
"Respect for human rights is a qualification for membership of the European Union."
"Our Parliament is also demanding more participation in decision-making."
"It must show itself worthy of that influence."
"If Parliament cannot manage this, it deserves to remain stuck in the sometimes abnormal constitutional situation it finds itself in."
"More legislative power places greater demands on seriousness."
"Not everything can be solved by politicians, not everything can be solved at European level."
"There is a private area, which lies outside that of politics, an area which is set to grow in many countries."
"Our President, Mr Hänsch, who is a staunch defender of our Parliament, put it in the following terms in the Committee on Institutional Affairs: we must not assign to the EU tasks which we know the EU has neither a mandate nor the means to carry out."
"Precisely."
"But the red parties propose rights which cannot be upheld, for which no-one knows whether resources can be found and for which there is no legal basis."
"In this way, the left threatens Parliament's ability to function as an effective legislator."
"There is a risk that its influence may be damaged and, most serious of all, that protection of human rights may be drained of all substance."
"We in the PPE Group stand for basic human rights that can be enforced through the European Court of Human Rights."
"But anyone who violates the wish-lists of the left risks nothing."
"These political wish-lists are nothing more than a bid to exploit human rights for selfish political purposes, a means of securing the release by the back door of economic resources which will not gain approval at national level."
"The heroic efforts of the rapporteur to establish basic human rights has been in vain."
"The 126 rights in the report make for some painful reading and provide a sorry but striking example of the fact that Parliament must not concern itself with everything."
"If Parliament is to present these annual reports at all, the red parties should ponder on a couple of sayings we have in Sweden that go something like: ' true mastery lies in moderation' and 'reach out for everything, gain nothing' ."
"Let today's business serve its purpose as a cautionary example for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, protection of human rights is perhaps the most important opinion-forming issue that we, together with the Council of Europe and the national parliaments, have to deal with as elected representatives in the European Parliament."
"It covers everything from the right to life, through condemnation of the death penalty, torture and violence against detainees and prisoners, to the right to asylum."
"On this point, Mr President, I am rather concerned at the fact that especially policy on refugees, immigration, asylum and visas is being made more restrictive and that the EU is on course to erect a wall against countries which are not Member States of the Union."
"This must not happen."
"The Schengen Agreement is a regrettable example of things moving in that direction."
"This can create a fertile ground for the spread of the very racism and xenophobia which we want to prevent and which is one of the main themes of this report."
"Perhaps the most important thing in this debate, Mr President, is that we should review past years and that present Member States and countries that have applied for membership and have agreements with us, such as Turkey, meet the demands we impose and that we should show the rest of the world that we are serious in our insistence on respect for human rights."
"Mr President, this report on human rights has had a troubled past and a difficult path."
"So we can only congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Estebán Martin, for completing such an arduous task - already attempted in vain, with great courage and dedication by our colleague, Mr Newman - and she has our appreciation and our gratitude."
"The Estebán Martin report is sound and positive in many respects. It is an all-embracing report which leaves no stone unturned in its general approach and in the particular issues dealt with, even if we would have preferred a more distinct identification of violations of human rights, both inside and outside the Community."
"While it is appropriate that the preamble to the report lists at least seventeen existing agreements on human rights, it is equally a duty to highlight, with growing consternation, how many of these declarations of sacrosanct principles have remained dead letters for years."
"That consternation is certainly not relieved by the fact that the right-wing lineup of this Assembly repeatedly prefers to skate over violations involving their own countries."
"A few examples: the law passed by the Italian Parliament which violates the rights of immigrants; in France, the expulsion of stateless persons by executive decree, a point Mr Pailler has eloquently covered; in Germany, the policy of persecution and discrimination against thousands and thousands of ex-citizens of the DDR."
"And how can we ignore the fact that Turkey has been provisionally welcomed into the customs union while it continues to imprison political opponents of the regime - events that took place only last week?"
"We would also have preferred the report to make some reference to violations in countries aspiring to join the Community or which have long influenced decisions positively or negatively through their power and specific weight."
"We are talking about the recent massacre in Chechnya, the tragedy of the Kurdish people, the 560 thousand deaths, mostly of children, caused in Iraq by the prolonged United States economic sanctions, sanctions aggravated by military intervention already carried out or being carried out at this very moment."
"We recognize that Mrs Estebán Martin's report retains its validity and we shall vote to approve it."
"Mr President, I know what human rights are."
"This report was preceded by the controversy which accompanied the report that we produced last year."
"If we lose this opportunity, we shall let slip a second chance to look inside the European Union and see what is happening with regard to human rights. And I believe that - if we are honest - we all know what we are talking about, even if only intuitively."
"We are talking about drawing attention in this report to situations in which respect for human rights - the meaning of which is quite clear to us when we refer to third countries - is deteriorating or simply does not exist."
"We must therefore make an effective effort to tackle such situations, since I believe that no citizen of the Union will be secure as long as the human rights of the weakest and most vulnerable sections of the population are being eroded."
"I am aware that many Spanish socialist Members abstained in the vote on last year's report."
"Contrary to what some members of my group seem to think, I believe that it is sometimes necessary to make an effort to achieve a result, and that this report must be safeguarded as a report on the subject it seeks to address - and I repeat, I believe that we all know what that is."
"We must therefore make an effort and not lose this second opportunity."
"And I would call on the other groups to do the same, since I think that it would be most frustrating to emerge from the vote without having adopted the report and, moreover, that this would jeopardize our work in this field in the coming years."
"Mr President, we have had considerable difficulties over the last couple of years with these reports on human rights because of differences of view as to what constitutes human rights and other similar problems."
"But I believe this time we have a report which, though it might not be what all of us would have wished in every respect, nevertheless commands very wide support."
"We have worked very hard in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to produce a report that goes a very long way towards facing up to many of the injustices and abuses of human rights in our Community."
"The European Union would be a vastly better place if all the proposals enshrined in this report were to be adopted."
"It would be splendid if this report could be adopted by a large majority in Parliament."
"I am one of those who believe that such injustices as poverty, homelessness and unemployment are denials and abuses of human rights."
"I would say to those who have doubts about this that you cannot really enjoy even the narrow legalistic conceptions of rights such as freedom of expression or religion and so on unless you have employment, a home and the other basic requirements of life."
"We could all perhaps agree that the right to health is one of the most important, but all the detailed statistics show that people who are homeless, who are unemployed, who are in poverty, live much shorter lives and have much poorer health, than those whose social rights are safeguarded."
"I would particularly like to comment on two of the many good points in this report."
"Recital p and paragraph 34 deal with the plight of domestic servants in my own country and a number of others."
"Certain wealthy people are allowed to bring in domestic servants who have no rights whatsoever."
"They must be guaranteed the same employment and civil rights as all people resident in those countries."
"Paragraph 51 refers to the right of people who are arrested and imprisoned abroad not to have their trials indefinitely delayed and to suffer thereby because of technicalities like lack of translation facilities and lack of understanding of the legal systems in other countries."
"These are just two of the many very valuable points enshrined in this report which I hope will receive very broad support in Parliament."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs De Esteban Martín for her report and to stress once again how important it is and how much I welcome the fact that such a report is discussed here in the House and given the attention it deserves."
"The European Union is first and foremost a community founded on justice in which human rights are accorded great importance, as they are in our external relations."
"I am therefore pleased to see that Parliament is to debate the report by Mr Carnero González on human rights clauses in treaties with third countries this coming Friday."
"Most of what this motion for a resolution calls for actually concerns the Member States, since the Treaties do not in fact give the Union the power to enforce respect for human rights in the Member States."
"What the Community can do is apply Community provisions relating to human rights."
"I shall therefore focus in my reply on the comments that were addressed to the Commission."
"Before I look at the specific points raised by this report, I should like to say a few words about the discussion which the Foreign Affairs Ministers had at their informal meeting in Tralee on the sexual exploitation of children."
"The Commission supports the various initiatives which the Member States have put forward for combating this terrible phenomenon, and has itself proposed three practical measures directly or indirectly related to the problem."
"First of all, following the conference on the trade in women held in Vienna last June, the Commission intends to forward a communication to Parliament and to the Council proposing measures in this field."
"Secondly, it is to present a proposal in the autumn designed to clamp down on sex tourism."
"Thirdly, it is to put forward proposals designed to combat paedophile networks, such as on the Internet."
"It hopes that these practical measures will help to provide rapid and effective solutions to the problems, and it is pleased to see that Parliament is also scheduled to discuss the issues involved on Wednesday."
"As you know, the Commission has in the past strongly urged that the Community should accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the issue is to be discussed again at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"However, I have to say that, in view of the opinion delivered recently by the Court of Justice, I think it will be very difficult to make any progress in this field."
"It is something we have been talking about for years, but the majority of the Member States do not appear to feel any great urge to take such a significant step."
"On the subject of equal treatment, the Council recommendation on the equal right of men and women to participate in decision-making has still not been adopted."
"The Commission put forward a revised proposal on 30 May 1996 which reflected Parliament's amendments."
"It should be pointed out here that the existing directives in the field of equal treatment - seven in total - have already gone a long way towards improving working conditions for women and men in Europe."
"The Commission also intends to introduce a number of specific measures to improve equality in the legal position of women and men."
"With regard to combating racism and xenophobia, the Council of Ministers has, as you know, officially declared 1997 to be the European Year against Racism."
"This is a milestone in the history of the Community."
"For the first time the institutions of the Community, acting on a proposal from the Commission, have agreed on practical measures to combat racism within the current institutional framework."
"This sends out an extremely positive signal."
"The European Year is, of course, only part of our strategy to combat racism, and a great deal of progress has already been made since the Cannes European Council."
"Two resolutions have already been adopted as part of the shared responsibilities and joint action under the third pillar, and we are optimistic that a racism monitoring centre will be set up in the near future."
"In its report for the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission recommended the inclusion in the Treaty of provisions banning any form of discrimination and condemning racism and xenophobia."
"It believes that the adoption of Community legislation offering at least a minimum level of protection against discrimination in the Community could be an extremely important step towards achieving the aims of the Treaty."
"It is to review this whole issue again in the light of the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In conclusion, I would point out that the Council has launched various programmes over the last 20 years to tackle poverty in all its manifestations at European level."
"It is another issue which has been discussed a great deal in recent times and has received the attention it deserves."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for her most detailed and comprehensive report."
"I am sure that, as in previous years, Parliament's report on human rights in the Union will play an important part in ensuring that we maintain a consistent approach towards human rights, and will also, and equally importantly, help to improve the credibility of the Union's position on this issue in the eyes of third countries."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Rail, road and inland waterway transport"
"Mr President, I must inform the House that Commissioner Kinnock sends his apologies and regrets that he will be unable to attend this evening."
"He wrote to me to inform me of this, which I very much appreciate, and it goes without saying that his apologies are accepted."
"He has kindly asked Commissioner van den Broek to replace him."
"In February this year, Parliament delivered its opinion on a package of measures proposed by the Commission relating to inland waterway transport."
"This was quickly followed by the Council's common position."
"The package consists of three closely linked proposals which are designed to liberalize, restructure and promote the inland waterway market and, ultimately, to strengthen the position of the inland waterway sector."
"It is clear from the common position that the Council agrees with the proposed measures, but has made a number of amendments to each of the three sections."
"I should like to make a few brief comments about these."
"First of all, the restructuring programme."
"The most important change here is that the Council has limited the provision of Community co-funding to 1996, whereas Parliament and the Commission had proposed that the Community should contribute towards the scrapping costs for the whole of the three to four-year scrapping period."
"Although the Committee on Transport feels that the Council's position is disappointing, it decided not to retable its amendments in view of the budgetary restrictions and the problems which the Council faced in making available even the ECU 20 million included in the 1996 budget."
"We still feel that the dramatic overcapacity in the tanker sector calls for extra scrapping measures, and this is why we are maintaining our amendment to set up a separate scheme for this."
"On the subject of liberalization, the Council agreed with the Commission's original proposal for the gradual abolition of the system of chartering by rotation by 1 January 2000."
"The House and the Committee on Transport had already approved this, but things cannot stop there."
"We need to think about the situation after the year 2000 as well as what happens up to then."
"It is in the period after that date, when the inland waterway sector has been restructured and liberalized, that it is most important to have instruments which can help restore the balance in the event of any market disturbances."
"Parliament tabled two separate amendments on this at first reading."
"The first aimed to extend the 'old for new' system beyond 1 January 2000, and the second called for the structure and remit of the group of experts supervising the scrapping programme to be expanded to include regular consultations with the Commission, even after the completion of the present measures."
"During the debate on this issue, the Commissioner spoke in favour of both these ideas, but it was felt that the amendments did not belong with the present proposals, so the Committee on Transport has not retabled them at second reading."
"We are still convinced, however, that inland waterway transport will continue to require close attention after 1 January 2000, so we have written to the Commissioner to ask him to take the necessary steps on both of these issues."
"We would have asked Commissioner Kinnock for his response, but perhaps Commissioner van den Broek will be able to speak on his behalf."
"Our reasoning here is that because the inland waterway transport sector is made up of a large number of small firms, fluctuations in the market caused by new investment could easily result in overcapacity once again."
"What is more, water transport will be required to play an increasingly central role in our long-term transport policy, so inland waterways will certainly be on the agenda until well after 1 January 2000."
"However, there are also a number of issues which will affect inland waterway transport in the short term, such as the Commission's mandate to conclude an agreement with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Parliament will no doubt have an opportunity to comment on the results of these negotiations in the near future."
"Mr President, can I thank Mr van der Waal for his report and his contribution today."
"There is no doubt that my group is concerned with the crisis in the inland waterways sector, and indeed we support Mr van der Waal's report and his efforts to reduce the existing overcapacity."
"We support the scrapping programme and the finances to be made available for it."
"It is a sad fact that within the transport sector the inland waterways are underutilized throughout the European Union, just as our railways are underutilized, mainly because the vast majority of freight is now transported by road; and the congestion and the environmental pollution that causes is there for all to see."
"So our group is always supportive of any moves to help sectors that would take freight off the roads, be it railways or inland waterways."
"There is no doubt that for many years inland waterways have been a Cinderella of the transport industry, but that does not mean that we should forget about them and that we should not invest in them, because that is what is needed."
"Investment is needed in order to reduce the overcapacity, and that means helping in the scrapping programme."
"It also means helping small businesses to actually go into the market."
"But we also need investment in port infrastructure within our inland waterways network, and until we get that I fear that the inland waterways sector will continue to suffer, to be the Cinderella service, and will have to make do with the crumbs from off the table of the road haulage industry."
"Our group would like to see the inland waterways sector flourishing."
"We support Mr van der Waal's report because we believe that his principles are right, that his views are right and that that is the only way the inland waterways sector can go forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group also regards inland waterways as an environmentally-friendly and safe element of the transport sector."
"This may be underrated as a means of transport, but it deserves the support and respect of Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Mr van der Waal's report and the Commission's proposals were, quite simply, a joy to read as far as we were concerned, because of the very positive approach they adopted towards the subjects of chartering, pricing, restructuring and the rules on aid."
"We welcome the fact that market distortions caused by the chartering by rotation system, for example, and overcapacity are to be eliminated by the scrapping fund and the 'old for new' system."
"But we also need to provide aid to improve or modernize our inland waterway transport."
"The Commission's attitude and Mr van der Waal's work on this issue were very encouraging, but we have been very disappointed at the Council's refusal to adopt so many of our amendments."
"However, we are prepared to do what the rapporteur has asked by being sensible and not retabling all our amendments again."
"We would, of course, have been delighted if the Council had allocated more aid for this extremely important but underrated sector."
"The chartering by rotation system, which distorts the market and in some areas even means that the prices charged for carrying the same load over the same distance differ by up to 100 %, could also have been phased out earlier."
"However, we are convinced that what we are doing now is an important step."
"We still insist on keeping some of our amendments, and we feel that any firms which leave the sector voluntarily should be given some kind of social assistance to help them."
"The aid which the Member States currently provide for the transport sector, which faces such fierce competition, could also be supplemented by aid from the European Union."
"Working on the principle that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, we are prepared to accept these proposals and do as Mr van der Waal suggested."
"Mr President, a few years ago we had a debate on inland waterway transport in which Mr van der Waal and Mr van der Lek spoke, and Mr van Rijn from the Commission's Legal Service replied."
"From his name, Mr van den Broek should know a good deal about water, although it is swampy water and that makes for hard sailing, but nevertheless we are curious to know what the Commission will have to say."
"We should first of all assure the rapporteur, who has already prepared many reports on inland waterways for us, that he once again has our support."
"However, there is one problem which I should like to ask the Commission about, and I hope we shall be given a proper answer."
"Aid and scrapping schemes are all well and good, we all support inland waterway transport, it is environmentally-friendly, it offers plenty of capacity, there are new facilities for containers and storage, port installations, inland ports and so on, all absolutely fine."
"But the problem is that inland waterways are mainly used for transporting goods in bulk and, in particular, petroleum products."
"Now that NATO no longer needs as much benzine, its pipelines are being used for the commercial trade in petroleum products instead."
"This is all well and good, and much less dangerous, but it has resulted in overcapacity in the tanker fleet which needs to be dealt with by the scrapping scheme, as the rapporteur says."
"The problem is that it will be mainly the smaller vessels that will be scrapped first under the scheme, and this will be counter-productive, because it will mean that all kinds of smaller ports will no longer be used and only the larger vessels will remain, sailing between Basle and Rotterdam."
"So I should like to ask the Commission whether there should not be some sort of differentiation in the scrapping scheme, so that it is not just the smaller vessels that are taken out of service, since this would limit the scope of the inland waterways?"
"Mr President, we Greens set great store by development, reconstruction and incentives for inland waterway transport because, as honourable Members have said, this is an ecologically compatible form of transport, provided it does not presuppose massive infrastructure projects which can sometimes have a strong environmental impact."
"But we definitely regard this form of transport as very valid."
"In fact we are convinced of the need to restore balance to transport, moving goods and passengers away from road transport towards rail, sea and river, and inland waterway transport is also less risky for dangerous goods."
"For these reasons we think it was very negative of the Council to reject the majority of the amendments approved by Parliament at first reading."
"But we understand and support the reasons given by the rapporteur, Mr van der Waal, and we invite the European Parliament to vote in favour of the few amendments that have been presented again."
"We certainly expected something different from the Council."
"The crisis in the sector requires that liberalization be accompanied by social security standards, especially as regards tankers."
"We think it is right to retable the amendment which provides additional measures for the sector."
"Finally we take note that as regards granting incentives for inland waterway transport, the Council has in fact accepted the position of the European Parliament."
"I believe this may also constitute a precedent for the measure to grant incentives to the rail sector, for which I am rapporteur."
"In conclusion, I support a vote in favour of Mr van der Waal's amendments and proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr van der Waal on his patience in recommending this second reading on a common position."
"I would inform colleagues that on this occasion it appears that New Labour coincides with Old Conservatism."
"The emphasis has to be on dealing with the problem of over-capacity and in this regard I welcome Mr van der Waal's comments that we must ensure that the amount of funding is secured not just for 1996 but for 1997 and 1998 and indeed urge the Council to extend the scrapping programme right up to the end of 1999."
"We must ensure that the fund will apply until the position of over-capacity has been resolved."
"As has been mentioned overcapacity is possibly as high as 20 % in the European tanker sector."
"Therefore, I particularly support the extra scrapping system in this sector with the aim of removing at least an extra 10 % of capacity in the first year."
"I would remind colleagues that the provisions in this common position are to liberalize and open up the market."
"There are three parts to the common position: liberalizing, re-structuring and promoting the inland waterway sector."
"I hope that all three will carry equal weight."
"With regard to the last common position on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway, this is particularly welcome as it will streamline decision-making and reduce bureaucracy."
"My one concern is that while we welcome an emphasis on combined transport, and particularly in the UK under a Conservative government trying to transport more freight by rail and take it off the roads wherever appropriate, it must not be to the total detriment of conventional freight operations."
"Let us not lose sight of the good old lorry."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would like to comment on that."
"Mr President, it is a question of taking a final decision on what we considered in February in Parliament, when we delivered our opinion on a package of measures for inland waterway transport."
"The most important concern of the amendments in my view is that ways are now being proposed to stimulate and develop inland waterways in all Member States, not least my own country, Sweden, which has a lot of water and many lakes."
"Transport by rail and transport by inland waterway are more environmentally friendly alternatives to road haulage, which has grown alarmingly in recent years."
"We must do something about this, because road haulage vehicles emit exhaust gases in an entirely different way."
"We therefore support this report."
"Regeneration programmes of various kinds and incentives are important if this route is really to be taken and if the volume of road haulage traffic is to be reduced."
"The amendments proposed point in that direction."
"In this context, severe criticism of the Council is warranted, since it has not understood this."
"We therefore vote for the amendments tabled since, in our opinion, they will lead to more and better transport using environmentally friendly methods."
"Mr President, as Commissioner Kinnock unfortunately cannot be with us, let me say how delighted I am that it is Commissioner van den Broek who is standing in for him, since inland waterway transport is an area where Dutch bargemen in particular have long distinguished themselves."
"I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur for working so quickly and for producing a report which not only recognizes the very serious problems currently facing inland waterways, but also offers prospects for the future."
"It is perfectly clear that the inland waterways can and must play an important role in our long-term transport policy."
"It is, of course, mainly up to the inland waterway sector itself to make the best of the new opportunities available, but the governments can and must offer it a helping hand here."
"I would ask for special attention to be given to the tanker sector, where many firms are already in deep water."
"The two letters which our committee sent to Commissioner Kinnock form an important element in our approach."
"Following earlier talks, I regard these letters as a gentlemen's agreement between the Commission and Parliament."
"Can I assume that the Commission also sees them in this light?"
"Can Commissioner van den Broek assure us that the Commission is aware of the need to prevent unfair competition and market distortions from inland shipping companies in Central and Eastern Europe?"
"When can we expect agreements to be signed with the countries in question?"
"What form will they take?"
"Will Parliament be involved?"
"Finally, could Mr van den Broek perhaps also take this opportunity to tell us what he intends to do about the insuperable problems that still exist at the frontiers with the countries of Eastern Europe, particularly for road transport?"
"I should like to start by saying how pleased I am to have the honour of standing in for Commissioner Kinnock this evening, and I should particularly like to thank Mr van der Waal for his words on the subject."
"It is indeed a matter of particular interest to me, because I actually began my career as a lawyer dealing with collisions on the inland waterways."
"Mr van der Waal will be pleased to hear that the first case I had to deal with - cases were always called by the names of the vessels involved in the collision - was 'The Lord is king' versus 'It always happens to me' ."
"I am sure this is how things will continue on our inland waterways for a long time to come."
"As honourable Members are aware, the proposals under discussion today form an integrated package of measures designed to increase the competitiveness of the inland waterway sector. This answers Mr Cornelissen's question: the Commission is indeed aware of the need to make this sector more competitive and to clamp down on unfair competition as much as possible."
"I hope he will understand that I prefer to leave it to Mr Kinnock to explain exactly how the Commission intends to step up its efforts in this field and how Parliament can be involved."
"The measures we are discussing are designed to enable the inland waterway sector - which is having to get by under its own steam, as it were, in a liberalized market - to maintain and increase its share of the total European transport market."
"This is very much in line with our ideas on 'sustainable mobility' ."
"The first proposal, on the systems of chartering and pricing in national and international inland waterway transport, aims to liberalize inland waterway transport by harmonizing the legislation which the Member States concerned are currently introducing, with full liberalization by 1 January 2000."
"The second proposal concerns the expansion of structural improvements over a three-year period from 1996 to 1998. These measures will operate in tandem with the process of liberalization and also enable the Community to provide financial assistance for the national scrapping funds in the Member States concerned."
"The third proposal, on aid for transport by road, rail and inland waterway, will provide the Member States with subsidies for investment in inland waterway terminals and fixed and mobile loading and unloading equipment up to 31 December 1999."
"The new provisions which the Council has included in its common position are in line with the aims of the Commission proposals."
"On the second proposal, the Council felt that the Community's contribution towards the cost of structural improvements should be limited to 1996."
"The Commission has no problem with this, since the aim is still to reduce the fleet capacity by around 15 % in three years."
"It is up to the Member States collectively to ensure that adequate funding is provided to achieve this objective."
"The Commission has therefore accepted the Council's amendments, and on behalf of Mr Kinnock and the Commission, I would now ask Parliament to approve the common position."
"The Commission has examined the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Transport at second reading very carefully, but I am sorry to have to tell you that Mr Kinnock and the Commission are unable to accept them."
"Let me explain why."
"Amendment No 1 is intended to enable the Member States to introduce accompanying social measures for operators leaving the inland waterway transport sector voluntarily."
"This was rejected by the Council, a decision with which the Commission agrees, since this possibility is already provided for in Article 9 of Council Regulation No 1101/89."
"Amendment No 2 concerns the Financial Statement on the budget line for scrapping schemes in inland waterways transport, and the description and general purpose of the measure."
"The Committee on Transport considers that there is at least 20 % overcapacity in the tanker sector."
"This is why it is proposed that an additional scrapping scheme should be carried out in the tanker sector during the first year of the Commission programme, to reduce the tanker fleet by at least an extra 10 %."
"The Member States concerned are to set up separate scrapping funds with new funding arrangements."
"The Commission considers this amendment superfluous, since it already has the opportunity under the existing regulation to allocate more of the funding available for scrapping tankers, if it feels this is necessary."
"Furthermore, amending the Financial Statement would, from a procedural point of view, have no effect on the actual text of the legislation."
"In my opinion, the common position is consistent with the objectives pursued in the Commission's proposals, and I therefore feel I must call on Parliament to support it."
"At the same time, I should like to express my appreciation for all the work that Mr van der Waal and the Committee on Transport as a whole have done."
"Before I end, I should just like to come back to three questions that were raised by speakers."
"Mr van der Waal referred to the letters which the Committee on Transport wrote to Mr Kinnock, one of which suggests that a new group of experts should be set up on inland waterway transport."
"The committee will be receiving an answer in the near future, the gist of which I already know."
"Suffice it to say that Commissioner Kinnock does not feel that this new group of experts needs to be set up just at the moment, and he will certainly wish to give you further information on this when he can."
"However, he also said that the Commission will, of course, be remaining in close contact with the socio-economic sector which covers inland waterways, and that it will be consulting the sector within the existing committees and ad hoc groups in order to find out its opinions, recommendations, and so on."
"In other words, Mr Kinnock sees no particular reason to intensify contacts with the sector by setting up a new group of experts."
"The second question you put to him in writing was whether the 'old for new' system could be extended for a further five years."
"He will be informing you that the Commission does not necessarily oppose extending the system, but he feels it is a little premature to be talking about it and deciding on it now."
"He would prefer to let his decision on this depend on market developments, and he would agree with the committee that the report on market developments which it has asked the Commission to draw up during the first half of 1998 could be used as a basis for deciding whether an extension of the system is justified."
"That is all I can tell you from the information I have available."
"I have certainly not been able to explain things as clearly as Commissioner Kinnock would have done, but I think I have at least given you some idea of what he is thinking."
"Mr Wijsenbeek asked whether we can ensure that it is not automatically the smaller tankers that are the first to be scrapped, now that the NATO pipelines are being used for commercial purposes."
"Mr Kinnock's experts alongside me here have assured me that the current system is based on the principle of first come, first served, irrespective of size, and that differentiation does not need to be applied artificially, since it is simply a question of who is first in line, large or small."
"Finally, Ms McIntosh asked about the question of funds for the scrapping scheme."
"I am informed that the Member States have given assurances that the funding needed will definitely be made available."
"That concludes my reply."
"I should like to apologize for any points that I may not have explained entirely clearly, but Commissioner Kinnock will certainly be more than happy to provide you with any further information which you may require."
"With all due respect to Mr van den Broek, we are aware that the system will operate on a first come, first served basis, but the problem is that it will be the larger vessels which come forward first, because they are worth more."
"That is why I should like to know whether Commissioner Kinnock will consider introducing differentiation in future schemes stretching beyond the year 2000, so that it is not just the larger vessels which are taken out of service, since this simply reduces the scope and effectiveness of inland waterway transport."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner van den Broek for doing his best to answer our questions."
"Since one or two letters of reply to us have been drafted, I would ask him to urge Mr Kinnock to read our two letters through again very carefully."
"I do of course know what these letters say, since I signed them on behalf of the committee, and I would point out that we are not asking for a new committee to be set up - in fact we specifically say that this is not what we want - we simply ask whether our objectives can be achieved through the existing committees."
"To avoid any unnecessary correspondence, I would ask Mr van den Broek to take the matter up with Mr Kinnock and ask him to read our letters once again."
"Mr President, I will faithfully pass on these requests, of course, together with the question that Mr Wijsenbeek raised."
"I think I know what the answer to that will be, but I would prefer to leave it to Mr Kinnock to reply, as would Mr Wijsenbeek, I presume."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Air carrier liability"
"The next item is the report (A4-0228/96) by Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(95) 0724 - C4-0209/96-95/0359(SYN)) on air carrier liability in case of accidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, air carrier liability in the case of accidents in international carriage by air has hitherto been covered by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention and other supplementary instruments, which together make up the so-called 'Warsaw system' ."
"This convention provides that the airline is presumed to be liable for damage and sets the limit of liability at USD 10 000."
"However, it also provides that the airline may be exempted from liability if it proves that it took all necessary measures to avoid the damage, and that it may pay a lower amount of compensation if it proves the contributory negligence of the injured person."
"The inadequacy of this system of subjective liability and the lack of an automatic mechanism for adjusting the amount of compensation paid have given rise to unilateral action on the part of many signatory states, whereby the limits established have been raised."
"For example, the Montreal Agreement of 1966 increased the limit to USD 75 000 for all flights to, from, or with a planned stopover in the United States."
"Similarly, over the last few years, the majority of European countries have introduced liability limits which are higher than those provided for under the Warsaw system, for both national and international flights."
"The result of this unilateral, albeit necessary action has been a growing disparity of national rules concerning air carrier liability - a situation which threatens to lead to the fragmentation of the present internal civil aviation market."
"Furthermore, the aim of Community air transport policy is to ensure that flying is perceived to be the safest way to travel, and this objective is undermined by the current system regulating liability, whereby the passenger is viewed as someone who must necessarily take a risk."
"There is also an inconsistency between the rules on liability and the Community's consumer protection policy, in that passengers and their families are forced to endure situations of uncertainty when they attempt to claim amounts of compensation which are higher than the established limit, apart from having to face long and costly procedures."
"In these circumstances, the Community considered it necessary to take steps to create acceptable conditions for the air transport sector, ensuring common liability rules and guaranteeing fair treatment for users."
"The proposal for a regulation which is before us today reflects this commitment."
"In its proposal, the Commission has retained the essential features of the present system, since despite its inadequacies, the Warsaw system constitutes an internationally recognized and uniform legal basis."
"With this as its starting-point, the Commission has attempted to adapt the regulatory provisions to current needs, eliminating all limits and ensuring simple and rapid procedures, thereby substantially improving the protection of users and the position of carriers."
"I agree with the substance of the Commission proposal."
"The aim of the amendments contained in my report is to make a number of improvements and refinements, though of course without changing the underlying philosophy of the text."
"In this sense, I believe it is appropriate to increase the limit for objective liability proposed by the Commission from ECU 100 000 to ECU 120 000."
"In fact, this amendment does no more than reflect in legislation what has long been the practice of most airlines."
"In no case will this increase be to the detriment of the airlines, not even in terms of insurance premiums, as was demonstrated by the Commission's prior studies. Moreover, ECU 120 000 is an amount which is more appropriate to present times."
"As regards the elimination of all the liability limits provided for in the convention, I believe that such a measure is consistent with the goals of minimizing risks in the air transport sector and enhancing consumer protection - bearing in mind, moreover, that for the airlines, it will involve only a minimal increase in operating costs."
"Likewise, I considered it appropriate to delete the reference to the amount to be paid to meet initial costs, in the belief that the provisions to that effect of the plans of the individual airlines are more advantageous than the Commission's proposal for a sum of ECU 50 000."
"Finally, I wish to highlight an issue which I believe to be of the utmost importance: because of the structure of the Warsaw system, any amendment of the rules requires a prior agreement between the contracting parties."
"The effects of the Community's action will evidently be restricted to Community airlines, with third-country carriers operating within Community territory being excluded."
"Given the legal impossibility of extending application of this legislation to third countries, I am calling on the Commission to step up its efforts in the negotiations on the Civil Aviation Agreement."
"Let me take this opportunity, Mr President, to bid farewell to Parliament, since I am leaving tomorrow."
"I should therefore like to thank everyone, and especially the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for treating me with such courtesy."
"I am returning to the Canary Islands."
"Thank you."
"Thank you, Mr Sánchez García."
"We wish you every success in your future professional or political career."
"Mr President, I would join with your good wishes for the rapporteur and congratulate him on his report."
"At least his name will be enshrined in Parliament even if he goes."
"I hope that he has a good journey and does not need to avail himself of any of the provisions of this carrier liability."
"This is a complicated report, as anyone who has listened to the rapporteur would agree."
"It is an attempt to update the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and to harmonize existing voluntary agreements amongst European airlines, as the rapporteur has said."
"There are a great number of agreements here."
"The Warsaw Convention is very much outdated because it was adopted at a time when air transport was thought to be a very risky business."
"You can tell just how long ago that was because 1929 was the year I was born."
"Nobody ever thought much about flying in aeroplanes in those days."
"I welcome the Commission proposal because it improves the situation for people who need to claim compensation in the event of an accident, both in terms of the amount they will receive and the speed with which they will be helped."
"To do this, the Commission proposes abolishing the Warsaw Convention limits which, as I said, are completely out of date, bringing in a more objective definition of liability rather than a subjective definition - although here, I agree with the rapporteur when he suggests that the figure should go up to ECU 120, 000 rather than ECU 100, 000 because that brings it more into line with existing IATA agreements and would cause less confusion."
"I also welcome the provision for emergency payments and, in particular, the widening of the area in which one can take action, allowing people to take action in the courts of the Member State in which they are domiciled."
"That is a big improvement."
"I support the various arrangements the rapporteur has mentioned, including the amendments asking for full information rather than just adequate information to be given to passengers and others."
"One issue that caused problems was the case of third-country carriers."
"Ideally I would like to have seen all of them subject to the new EU regulations."
"We have some precedent for this in areas such as denied boarding compensation."
"As the rapporteur has said, the Montreal Convention, although it applies to the United States, does in fact include air carriers from outside the United States."
"Nevertheless, when this was fully discussed in committee, we had to accept the very strong legal view of the Commission that this would not be possible."
"But in conjunction with the rapporteur, I put forward amendments which were accepted, suggesting that the Commission should seek to incorporate in its negotiations for civil aviation agreements with third countries a commitment to applying the provisions outlined in this regulation."
"If this is successful I feel that, as most airlines offer reasonable compensation on a voluntary basis and many of them are signing up to the IATA agreement which their own regulation overlaps, there will eventually be not only uniformity in what is offered to European Union passengers, but also a more realistic level of compensation, no matter which airline they use."
"Mr President, I would also like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and wish him every success for his future career, and just say to Mr Megahy that, obviously, 1929 was an extremely good year."
"There is a general consensus that the Warsaw Convention needs to be modernized and there are various attempts to do so."
"If the Commissioner or any one has any doubt why there is an urgent need to so, I would simply remind colleagues about the Lockerbie disaster."
"Pan Am aircraft No 101 was bombed and destroyed over Scotland."
"The bereaved are still trying to sort out compensation claims, subject to the Montreal Intercarrier Agreement."
"Compensation has not yet been fully paid out."
"Pan Am subsequently went out of business."
"I heard particularly disturbing news through the newspapers recently that Pan Am may be resurrected as a different company but maintain the same name."
"In all honesty, we in this House must ensure that all outstanding claims should be met before another airline by that name should be allowed to carry passengers - certainly in the European Union."
"The lack of uniformity in arrangements for air carrier liability across the European Union is a particular point of concern, not just to the Commission but also to the European Parliament."
"I wish to look in particular at the Commission proposal and a number of our amendments."
"I regret to inform the rapporteur that as far as Amendments Nos 3, 6 and 16 are concerned the Commission text is much clearer."
"I understand that there may be some confusion, particularly as it is very much a legal text, between what is meant by both 'domicile' and 'permanent residence' ."
"The Commission text for both Amendments Nos 6 and 16 is much clearer."
"It is quite right that we introduce what is known as this fifth jurisdiction for those who currently have their domicile or permanent residence in a European Union country."
"It would be quite wrong for this House to seek to remove that jurisdiction."
"Amendment No 4 raises the strict liability of European Union carriers to the sum of ECU 120, 000 rather than the Commission proposal of ECU 100, 000."
"I certainly support that figure as being more realistic."
"We should remember that total liability would be unlimited."
"But over this figure the claimant would have to prove that the airline was at fault."
"My direct question to the Commission is: how would this new situation change, i.e. that of unlimited liability?"
"Where we can prove an airline was at fault, how would that situation be so different to the situation with Pan Am where so many difficulties compounded the question of compensation?"
"In conclusion, I welcome the provision that this would apply to domestic as well as international travel, fifth jurisdiction and domicile and permanent residence."
"The fact that the European Union action reflects that already undertaken by IATA and to be followed by ICAO will enhance consumer protection and fair competition in the European aviation sector."
"I congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commission on bringing forward this proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text before the House today on air carrier liability in case of accidents represents a very interesting step forward."
"I therefore thank the rapporteur for it."
"This proposal for a regulation in fact achieves a quite satisfactory balance between the parties: on the one hand, the position of the air carriers will be strengthened by a precise redefinition of liabilities on both sides; and on the other, the rights of air passengers will be better protected by the introduction of the principle of objective liability of the carrier."
"In addition, this proposal introduces a system of emergency payments and extends the possibilities of legal recourse."
"Of course, it is regrettable that it is purely a Community regulation and that there has been no in-depth revision of the Warsaw Convention."
"Such a course of action is still desirable to improve the level of compensation available to passengers."
"It is also to be hoped that this move will serve as an example for improving passenger protection on a worldwide scale."
"While we are awaiting the revision mentioned above, the report before us today puts forward a number of improvements to the Commission proposal, with a view to ensuring greater consistency between the Community document, the Warsaw Convention and the IATA agreement of 31 October 1995."
"For this reason, my group will vote in favour of the report."
"Mr President, I can be brief as much of what I wanted to say has already been said by the rapporteur and by my colleague Tom Megahy."
"It is true that the Warsaw Convention is outdated and needs upgrading."
"There is also a need to harmonize the various agreements that exist at present."
"One of the problems with regard to air carrier liability is that passengers do not seem to be the primary concern."
"They seem to be a secondary issue when there is a major accident."
"For example, Miss McIntosh has quite rightly pointed out that the Pan Am victims' relatives are still awaiting compensation."
"And there is no guarantee that the relatives of the victims of the TWA aircraft which crashed in the Atlantic will not have a similarly long wait for any compensation they may be entitled to."
"That is an intolerable situation as we approach the next millennium and nearly 100 years of aviation."
"The Warsaw Convention seems to be biased towards the airlines."
"I agree it is important that in any negotiations third countries must accept EU legislation and practices."
"There I echo the point made by my colleague Tom Megahy, because in civil aviation at the moment we are seeing a growth in a kind of flags of convenience situation."
"What are known as flags of convenience in the maritime sector are now spreading to the aviation sector."
"In particular, Eastern European registered aircraft are now plying their trade on a regular basis within the European Union: what are the rights of people involved in an accident in one of those aircraft?"
"That is something we need to clarify with any country which decides it wants to join the European Union."
"I thank the rapporteur for his report."
"I know it will get a lot of support and it deserves a lot of support."
"I wish him well, back in the Canary Islands."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by joining you and other speakers in wishing Mr Sánchez García every success in his future career - and more particularly, of course, in thanking him for his report."
"I would remind the House that the Commission has been very active on the issue of liability since 1989."
"We were, and still are, concerned at the fact that the situation is so muddled and confusing, and offers passengers little protection."
"The advantage of the Warsaw system has always been that it has provided a certain degree of uniformity, though not in the matter of the maximum level of compensation."
"Passengers' rights and the obligations of the airlines currently depend on the place of departure and the type of service, in other words whether the flight is domestic or international."
"Air carrier liability under the Warsaw Convention is also limited to USD 10 000 to 20 000, unless the passenger can specifically prove negligence on the part of the airline."
"After two decades of fruitless discussion, the question of liability is now finally receiving the attention it deserves."
"The IATA has even scored a notable success in putting together an agreement, which is something the governments have not managed to do since the Hague Protocol of 1955."
"The Commission supported this initiative from the start, and will continue to do so until it is completed."
"However, we wish to ensure that this agreement between the IATA companies is not just applied by a few airlines, which would produce a most unwelcome situation in the European Union at least, and this was what led the Commission to put forward its proposal last December."
"The main aim of the proposal is to improve protection for airline passengers."
"It proposes to scrap the current maximum levels of compensation, so that passengers or their dependants are fully covered in the event of injury or death."
"The proposed rules will apply to all domestic and international flights operated by airlines from the Community."
"The proposal establishes the principle of objective liability up to a maximum of ECU 100 000."
"It also requires the airline to offer or make an advance payment to the passenger or his immediate family, which will be extremely helpful in cases where a deceased victim's family is facing serious financial difficulties, for example."
"I would point out here, in reply to Ms McIntosh's question, that this proposal actually supplements the provisions of the Warsaw Convention."
"It is very rigorous in its definition of liability, and provides for an advance payment in cases of serious financial difficulty, alongside the unlimited financial liability."
"This is why it will offer new scope for compensation following terrorist attacks, as Ms McIntosh mentioned."
"In addition to the jurisdiction established by the Warsaw Convention, the proposal also makes it possible to bring cases before the courts in the Member State where the passenger is domiciled or permanently resident."
"Finally, although they are not covered by the regulation, third countries are required to give their passengers clear and detailed information about all these facts."
"I think that airline passengers can feel confident that this gives them adequate protection."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism clearly shares this view, since its amendments all support this approach, and I am therefore pleased to announce that the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 16 and 18."
"The Commission also accepts the following amendments in part: Nos 7 and 15, which promise that, in negotiations, third countries will be urged to apply the regulation;"
"No 11, which improves the definition of persons entitled to compensation;"
"No 13, which introduces greater flexibility as regards the advance payments under Article 4; and No 14, which gives passengers fuller rights to information under Article 5. The Commission is also prepared to accept the following amendments in principle, provided that certain changes are made to the text: Nos 3 and 10, which make it clear that the regulation lays down only the maximum financial limits for liability;"
"No 12, which increases the objective liability under Article 3 from ECU 100 000 to ECU 120 000, in accordance with the IATA rules; No 17, which adds a new Article 7a giving air carriers rights of recourse; and No 19, which calls for an evaluation report to be presented in 1999."
"On the basis of the amendments which it has accepted, the Commission will be able to make a number of improvements to the proposed measures, without affecting the balance of the regulation."
"I should once again like to thank Mr Sánchez García and the Committee on Transport and Tourism most sincerely for all their hard work."
"There are a number of points which will undoubtedly be helpful in our discussions with the Council next month."
"Mr President, I appreciate that this is not Commissioner van den Broek's area, but one thing which concerns me is that the Commissioner has indicated his willingness to replace a reference to values in Amendment No 9 and a subsequent amendment with a reference to financial amounts."
"Secondly, he has also indicated his willingness to change the reference in the proposal to the claimant's domicile or permanent residence with a reference to his place of domicile at the time of the accident."
"As I indicated in my speech I would much prefer that we kept to the original Commission text unless the Commission gave us some extremely compelling reasons for those two changes."
"The key point about consumer protection should be where I, as a claimant, have my domicile or permanent residence at the time of the claim."
"Why would the Commission seek to change that?"
"Very briefly, Mr President, Commissioner Kinnock has followed the legal advice he was given on this point, which was that the definition supported by Parliament is probably clearer and better."
"That is why he chose it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)"
"Madam President, on a point of order under Rule 136, concerning committees of inquiry: yesterday evening I and two other colleagues attempted to have access to the meeting of the BSE inquiry."
"Politely but firmly that was refused."
"I should stress that what we were seeking was simply access: we did not want to participate in the deliberations or to vote at the committee."
"Having looked again at the Rules of Procedure, the position is not entirely clear as to whether the committee had the right to exclude other Members as opposed to the public at large from its deliberations."
"I just want to mention to you, Madam President, that I will be writing to you asking for an interpretation from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities of this matter."
"Until that is clarified, I will make a political appeal to colleagues on the committee as far as possible to allow their colleagues to participate, in the sense of observing, what obviously is politically and agriculturally a very interesting and delicate question."
"I have noted that, and we await your letter."
"Madam President, I was dismayed to find out this morning that the only Dutch television station we can receive here in Strasbourg has disappeared from our screens."
"Today we have the opening of the States-General and the Queen's Speech in the Netherlands, and now we cannot watch them."
"I would ask you, Madam President, to ask the mayor of Strasbourg whether she might be able to arrange for us to receive a Dutch station here in Parliament, so that we can follow the news in the Netherlands."
"We take note of that."
"Decision on urgency"
"Madam President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has given a favourable opinion on this first request for urgency on Regulation No 805/68, and the report will be ready for tomorrow."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"You cannot really take the one request for urgency on its own; you need to take the three together."
"I am speaking from a budgetary point of view."
"Whichever way you do it is immaterial but if we vote 'yes' for the first one, we need to vote 'yes' for the other two."
"Parliament will make a fool of itself if it votes 'yes' on the first and 'no' on the second two."
"Madam President, there are three separate reports involved here, and I would ask Members to look at the documentation."
"You will see then that we are dealing with three reports with three different numbers, which were also drawn up at different times."
"Yesterday evening, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided by a large majority in favour of urgent procedure for the proposal on the common organization of the market in beef and veal."
"By a similarly large majority, the committee rejected the request concerning amendment of the support system for producers of certain arable crops, since this is not an urgent matter."
"The funds in question will not be needed until 1998."
"That was confirmed to us by the Commission representative who was present."
"Lastly, the committee also rejected by a large majority the request for urgent procedure on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures."
"I would repeat: urgency for beef and veal, but not for the other two reports."
"That was decided quite clearly by the committee."
"The recommendation from the committee is to take three separate votes."
"I shall now put to the vote this recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to vote separately on the requests."
"(Parliament agreed to the proposal)"
"We shall now repeat the vote concerning the regulation on the common organization of the market in beef and veal."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Madam President, you have followed the rapporteur's proposal and put the first item to the vote."
"That request for urgency was approved."
"According to his recommendation, you should now also put the other two items to the vote."
"We wish to reject urgency for these, so that it is made clear to the Commission that we do not see this link between beef and veal, the support system, and the general pursuit of agricultural reform."
"Madam President, I think this regulation requires us to balance our accounts."
"Perhaps a former agriculture minister could be allowed to ask Parliament not to make itself look ridiculous."
"The regulation on beef and veal deals with the expenditure side, while the other two concern revenue."
"We cannot vote for the one without the others, unless we wish to appear irresponsible again, and I am afraid the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has already given that impression here."
"There is something rather tragic in this attitude."
"I would urge Parliament to be logical and responsible, so that this is reflected in our regulations, Madam President."
"Madam President, I would simply point out that in view of the scale of this subject, we feel it is important to discuss the matter calmly, outside urgent procedure. This would enable us to hold talks and work constructively with the Committee on Budgets, rather than making adjustments to a budget of ECU 1 billion in just a few hours, as Mr Rocard has suggested."
"We therefore propose to take the matter seriously and follow the normal procedure."
"Consequently, we wish the House to reject urgency."
"Proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(96)0422 - C4-0448/96-96/0212(CNS)) amending Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1872/94"
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"The information society - copyright and related rights"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I have the honour of presenting to you was subject to the constraints of the 'Gomes' procedure."
"In other words, we are putting together in a single report the six or seven other reports compiled by the various committees in question."
"Unfortunately, the final result does not measure up to our hopes and expectations."
"We are bound to ask ourselves why should this be."
"While we appreciate the obviously valuable contributions from each of the committees, we have to realize that because of the very scale of the subject - and the information society covers so many areas - the final report was bound to be a long one."
"It therefore contains some 120 paragraphs, which inevitably gives the impression that it is neither forceful nor radical enough."
"We would have hoped to be able to put the key points to the Commission in a few words, but this was not possible."
"We have therefore repeated many of our hopes, and put forward a whole host of advice, fears, anxieties and uncertainties, with the result that the document is hardly a masterpiece of clarity and so will have a limited impact."
"This is unfortunate, and we shall have to change our procedures in this respect."
"If Parliament wishes to say more on the subject, it will have to use methods other than the 'Gomes' procedure."
"We shall also see what is produced by the amendments we shall be voting on, which may well not make our message any clearer."
"Having said that, by looking carefully and reading through all the paragraphs, those who have the courage to persevere will find that the important issues are all there, though widely dispersed amidst a mass of considerations, some general and others more practical."
"Such a broad approach, however, does not leave much room for the latter."
"In one paragraph, for example, the fiscal arrangements have been decided on in the form of a tax, which has been weighed up, assessed and even had a figure put on it."
"Such measures clearly do not belong in a report of this kind."
"Where the information society in its present state is concerned, we should be talking about the main principles and not going into such precise details as a tax, especially when we have neglected to say exactly how this is going to be applied."
"Such examples show that the general nature of the report impairs its relevance."
"Having said that, I should now like to go over the important points in the report."
"First of all, information is not just a commodity like any other."
"It impacts on all aspects of life in society, especially our modern society."
"Europe is facing a considerable challenge, and is ill-prepared to meet it."
"We must redouble our efforts if we are not to be left by the wayside, because the whole situation changes every day."
"It is more important than ever to take stock of the issue, confronted as we are by alliances between multinationals and by the fact that individual states have been completely overtaken in this area."
"Not all of us have yet fully appreciated the nature of the phenomenon that is now under way."
"I have been struck by the fact that the emphasis has been placed, first and foremost, on fears and anxieties."
"Of course, these are very real and should not be ignored, but rather fully appreciated."
"Above all, however, we must not forget the most important thing, which is to be in the race, if we wish to arm ourselves against all the concerns and dangers which are threatening us."
"And indeed, the dangers are real, the threat posed by media concentration is real, free speech is under attack, social inequality and exclusion are both becoming worse."
"All these things are true."
"But unless we do something straight away, they will inevitably continue."
"And, at the moment, we are not doing a great deal."
"It must be said that most of the Member States are reverting to the tactics used in the last war, rather as in 1940, they relied on the Maginot line to stop the tanks."
"More or less the same thing is happening now in the way we view the public service and state monopolies."
"We talk endlessly about the content of the universal service, and in the meantime the world is being criss-crossed with networks, service-providers are supplying these networks, companies are being set up, new services are being offered to everyone and we are being excluded, or at least our presence is less and less noticeable."
"This is the message I should like to pass on."
"I should like Parliament to pull itself together; I do not want it to search through all 120 paragraphs for all the dangers that can be imagined and for things that should be done, nor to add yet another list of measures which it would be impossible to implement all together and, above all, quickly."
"I shall therefore end my message by saying that it is time to pull ourselves together and get down to the essential issues."
"Madam President, the future of the global information society is as fascinating as it is disturbing."
"We are only at the beginning of an extraordinary adventure and I am not going to repeat the more or less apocalyptic assessments bandied about every day."
"It is our task as politicians and Members of Parliament, and I say this to Mr Herman too, to identify what needs to be done now and immediately."
"I think we are all aware that we are seriously behind the times."
"Technology is advancing and every day it throws up a confusing panorama which is difficult even to analyze; liberalization is proceeding, frequently in a wild unregulated way, but there is a risk of policy standing idly by and watching."
"The essential rules for healthy development to counter disequilibrium and inequality are weak, or there is delay in specifying and implementing them."
"Faced, for example, with pervasive networks like the Internet, faced with multi-media weakening and obliterating the distinct boundaries between personal computers, television, traditional broadcasts, telephone, satellite broadcasts, and faced with the greater and greater blurring between private and public, between personal and collective, that results from all this, the governance of information must make a very courageous leap, but so far there is no glimpse of this, at least no appreciable glimpse."
"The report I am presenting on copyright and related rights, drafted over a long period on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, may look limited but actually it is not."
"The harmonizing dynamic of global information threatens to give rise to a shredder which regards every message as a product or text to be used for purely economic ends, not something to be respected for its invention, language, creativity and art."
"That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs emphasizes certain points which I would like to draw to your attention: first, if there is to be protection of an author's work and of right-holders, this protection should be available regardless of the way the work itself is broadcast."
"A film is a film, a musical performance is a musical performance, they create certain rights and require a certain kind of management and so on. So we cannot be tied to the categories and instruments of the past."
"Secondly, citizens must be guaranteed parity of access - that is in the text of our resolution - to works and services deemed to be of public interest."
"Thirdly, which law is applicable to govern such a complex sector?"
"Responding to the excellent Commission Green Paper which put this question, we consider, and it is a crucial point, that protection cannot be guaranteed merely by applying the law of the country of origin. The solution given in the cable and satellite directive, for example, is deficient because the criterion is inadequate in a global perspective."
"Paragraph 14 is carefully drafted and we do not want to adopt forced and simplifying formulae. The law of the country of reception must be taken into account as well because this is fundamental if we are to prevent any undermining of the protection of works and avoid unscrupulous relocation manoeuvres."
"Fourthly, the moral right of authors is, in our view, a fundamental masterstroke of the European model for protecting works and messages, because it establishes a relationship between author and work which is renewed every time the work is used and qualifies the work not as a thing or an object, but as a continual creation."
"Finally we are aware, fifth point and here I will close, that to resolve the questions already mentioned, we need more than a careful and precise set of legal standards, which is necessary, more than the consistent application of the international conventions - I am thinking of the Berne Convention, Article 6b, and the need to ensure that every country conforms to it - we need Europe to speak with one voice and act with one will at the international level, especially, but not only, in dealings with the United States, to ensure that these Conventions are applied."
"It is also indispensable to implement electronic identification systems for works, because otherwise we do not think protection will be possible."
"Experiments are already widespread on these electronic systems for numerical coding of works, which must and will achieve a higher level of protection in the fight against electronic piracy."
"We want an international convention, an international agreement, against illegal trade in pirated copies, which is more indispensable than ever today."
"May I just add something briefly, because otherwise I will have failed to comment on the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the amendments presented by it as regards the Herman report. We are disappointed that the Commission has not succeeded in agreeing on the proposal for a directive presented by Commissioner Monti, and intended to protect media pluralism in the single market."
"This proposal for a directive is another decisive chapter in establishing clear rules during the actual shaping of the information society."
"Without European intervention to prevent abusive and abnormal concentration of power, it will not be possible to build an information society where citizenship rights, the sense of belonging, and the widespread demand for knowledge and culture find effective, incisive and genuine responses and are not cynically sacrificed on the altar of an entirely apparent, quantitative and ephemeral growth, ultimately empty and impoverishing."
"Madam President, in contrast to the previous reports, where we are in the process of forming the law, I would say that with the report which I am presenting today, we are on relatively solid ground, because Community legislation already exists in this field."
"I refer here to Directive 92/100 on related rights and Directive 93/83 on intellectual property rights in the field of cable and satellite broadcasting."
"I was appointed Parliament's rapporteur for the report on the directive on rights in the field of cable and satellite broadcasting, and in the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights we had the opportunity of an exchange of views with the Commission on the appropriate procedure for the approval of this convention."
"In view of the fact that under the previous directives, the European Union does not exercise exclusive competence with regard to these rights, we are required to apply the procedure for so-called 'mixed agreements' ."
"Since the European Agreement on Road Transport - the Court of Justice's judgment in the EART case, that is - there has been the idea that there has to be a special procedure for mixed agreements."
"It should be recognized that the Commission has acted quite reasonably in this context, and the procedure it has proposed is regarded as acceptable by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. I believe that Parliament should also consider it acceptable."
"The proposal for a Council decision provides firstly for the signing of the convention on behalf of the European Community, subject to approval, with the opinion of the European Parliament then being required before ratification."
"I believe that this is the correct procedure. In this case, moreover, there are no problems, since not only is the European Convention on the protection of copyright compatible with Community law, but it also contains a special reservation, in Article 9, whereby parties which are members of the European Community are to apply Community rules amongst themselves."
"In other words, this convention will not require any modification of Community law."
"It will strengthen Community law, and in fact the Council of Europe took account of the acquis communautaire in this field when drawing up the convention."
"From the legal point of view, I regard the strengthening of the Community's rules by the Council of Europe's European Convention as a positive move."
"With reference to certain legal aspects - and Mr Barzanti, for example, mentioned the principle of the jurisdiction of the country of origin of the broadcast - it seems that in the area of the information society, in view of the progress of digital telecommunications, whereby there is a kind of relationship between supply and demand, a kind of contract between disseminator and recipient, the law of the country of reception may be taken into account."
"In the area of satellite and cable broadcasting, however, the principle which applies must be that of the unity of the act, whereby the law of the country of origin of the broadcast is taken to be the only applicable law, despite the problems which may arise from the point of view of relocation."
"Indeed, I believe that the appropriate way to deal with the issue of relocation is not intellectual property law, but fiscal harmonization measures which prevent a company from taking refuge in the legislation of a given country, for example, while we continue our efforts to harmonize the law on intellectual property."
"Finally, another important aspect of this convention is its conformity with the Berne Convention - as Mr Barzanti said, the Berne Convention is the cornerstone of this entire sector - and the 1961 Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations."
"I believe, Madam President, that the European Parliament must approve the conclusion of this convention, so that it can be ratified without delay."
"In this case - as in many others at the moment - I should like to emphasize the goodwill and spirit of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament on issues of a particularly legal nature, where it is always desirable for the Community institutions to act together."
"I should just like to respond to what Mr Herman said."
"He seems to feel that the whole debate is about getting everyone involved in the information society, but I think everyone already accepts that, and the real question is how we go about it and what role the authorities should play, including this House."
"I also think, Mr Herman, that your report lays too little emphasis on the fact that as well as being the product of market forces, the information society is also man's handiwork, and it is what the authorities decide to do with it which will determine whether it brings benefits for ordinary people and workers."
"I would remind you of one of the main points made in the report by the high-level group of experts set up by the Commission, namely that the biggest problem with the whole of the information society which we are busy creating is how to ensure that the benefits are shared fairly, and the need for the authorities to be actively involved in the market on a regular basis."
"And one of the problems here is that it appears extraordinarily difficult to juggle several long-term considerations at once."
"The first thing we focused on when the single market was created was liberalization, and it was only later that we started thinking about the social dimension, and later still the social impact, and this is exactly what Parliament is doing now."
"It seems to find it extremely difficult to bring all the strands together, and to stop looking at things in purely economic, social or legal terms."
"It is now time to adopt an integrated approach, and I entirely agree with Mr Herman that the 'Gomes' procedure is by no means the right one to use here."
"But I have to point out, Mr Herman, that if you had been a little firmer in directing the procedure and not allowed it to drag on for so long, we could have dealt with the whole issue in Parliament months ago, instead of waiting until after the Commission had published its Green Paper on social impact."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the differences in the ground covered by the individual committees and in their contributions to this report already indicate the difficulties of coming to an agreement within Europe on the structuring of the information society."
"It is not just a matter of procedure in committee; there are also the different cultural and national experiences which become clear from the draftsmen's various contributions."
"What are the main points highlighted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media?"
"Firstly - and this will come as a surprise to many people who have a fixed idea of the committee - we took a basically positive view of the information society."
"It is not seen as a wrong turn, culturally speaking, but as a great opportunity for cultural enrichment and a chance to increase democratic involvement."
"Just as reading was not superseded following the emergence of radio and television - and nowhere does so much reading take place as in the societies which now have radio and television - the information society will in future only serve to create a new range of possibilities, with traditional modes of culture continuing to exist and not being suppressed."
"Of course, the means by which these new opportunities are handled will have to change."
"There will be changes in the role of teachers in education, for instance."
"But in how many societies does teaching still look the same today as it did when you and I were at school?"
"These changes are perfectly normal."
"What the committee and I do not believe, however - in contrast to many public statements by Mr Bangemann and others - is that the information society and broad involvement in it are best achieved by unlimited commercialization and the dismantling of special regimes for radio and television, for example."
"We are therefore making the point that there must continue to be a separate legislative arrangement for radio and television, with special criteria which may very well be graded."
"Discussions must then take place on individual cases in this respect."
"There is a need for continuity in decisions of the kind we have already taken here in the House on telecommunications infrastructure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, the successful development of the information society is the greatest challenge facing European businesses today."
"It is the key to reducing unemployment and boosting the competitiveness of European industry."
"Small and medium-sized firms too must be able to compete in the new developments, because this is where new jobs lie."
"As politicians, we have to ask ourselves what these changes will mean for our society."
"What do we need to do at European level to cushion the impact?"
"First of all, the European Parliament needs to anticipate new developments at an earlier stage."
"The Bangemann report and the Commission action plan date from May and July 1994 respectively, yet it is only now, two years later, that all Parliament's reports are finally ready."
"Parliament's snail-like pace is in stark contrast to the rapid and irreversible progress of the information society."
"We in the House must become involved and provide a stimulus, instead of holding things up."
"Secondly, there will be a great deal of movement on the labour market."
"In the digital age, firms will base themselves wherever the cost and tax advantages are the greatest."
"The Liberal Group believes that our main task should be to give our citizens the best possible preparation for this, through education and training, through continuing education from primary school onwards, and by setting an example ourselves."
"Governments at local, national and European level must stop talking and lead by example."
"People should be encouraged to become involved, and the information superhighway is an excellent way of doing this."
"But there will be a number of difficult political issues to be resolved first."
"It is difficult for the authorities to resist the temptation to give priority to security rather than privacy."
"The Union, for example, has given the green light to telephone-tapping."
"The Liberal Group is not convinced that it is really necessary to sell democracy short in this way, or that more criminals are actually being caught."
"Governments are also finding it more difficult to levy taxes, because it is hard to determine the value of transactions through the network."
"Are we soon to see taxes being shifted from products or income to the use of raw materials?"
"One final point: governments are being confronted for the first time with communications technology on a worldwide scale, and they therefore need to show restraint when it comes to legislation."
"Censoring the Internet is a disastrous idea, since it will restrict freedom of expression and the free movement of services."
"National legislation has no place in the transfrontier digital age."
"Madam President, the information society gives enormous opportunities."
"Certainly in my constituency, which has large rural areas close to the Welsh border at Kington, in the Golden Valley and at Newcastle on Clun, I have seen at first hand the way in which new technology is being harnessed to create new opportunities and new jobs for ordinary people."
"It is exciting, a lot of good things can happen, but there are some fears."
"There are some very real fears that what we could actually be seeing is the concentration of power and privilege in the hands of the urban areas."
"It is all very well saying that the massive liberalization of telecommunications and the information society will make jobs available."
"The thing that worries many people is that these opportunities will be concentrated in just those few hands."
"I read the report from Mr Bangemann."
"It worried me."
"It had a sort of macho liberalization about it: we must liberalize, because if we liberalize it is going to help and it is going to work."
"There are many people in rural areas who fear that what we are going to see is exactly the opposite to what that report suggests."
"We need to make sure that there is a universal public service."
"We need to make sure that there are adequate incentives, that there is good funding for local schemes which can work, that all corners of the European Union are strategically linked; and we need to ensure that all tariff barriers are at a flat rate within the European Union."
"My great fear is that all we are going to do is to give to the favoured few and take from the many."
"Madam President, I would like briefly to draw attention to the potential impact of the information society on equal opportunities."
"I am speaking for the Committee on Women's Rights in this respect."
"Although there are obviously positive and new opportunities which must be welcomed and exploited, there are dangers for those who may become second-class citizens of the information society."
"Many women in particular may be excluded from the benefits because they do not have access to the training and the technology."
"For example, recent studies have shown that only one in seven of Internet users is a woman."
"It will therefore be necessary for awareness and resources and programmes to be aimed specifically at women and girls, taking into account their interests."
"Secondly, the impact of the information society on the nature of work will create new employment and working practices which will have a particular impact on women: for example, an increase in tele- and home-working."
"Social protection for home workers therefore becomes more necessary."
"That should take into account health and safety aspects and the potential for social isolation and insecure employment situations."
"The Committee on Women's Rights expects that the Commission and the social partners will address the issues of home- and teleworking and prepare proposals which recognize the effect of these new working practices."
"Thirdly, since we know that information technology is being exploited for the portrayal of violent and interactive forms of pornography and racism, we must recognize that efforts at a global and European level are required to combat this."
"In this Parliament and in the Commission we have the opportunity to plan so as to ensure that the citizens of Europe - men and women - benefit from the developments of the information society and from information technology."
"I hope we will ensure that equal opportunities are at the forefront of our planning."
"Madam President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy expresses its satisfaction with the Commission's Green Paper on copyright and related rights in the information society."
"We would like to stress that determined protection of intellectual property rights, and an approach based on the principle of equal treatment to the rights of all those who participate in the market, are prerequisites for the broadest possible development of the information society."
"Within that framework, I believe the existing situation concerning copyright and related rights should be the cornerstone of the information society, and that in addition, the importance of the principle of national treatment, the principle of freedom to conclude contracts and to choose the applicable law that will govern the contract, is extremely great."
"However, I would also like to stress that there is a need for some level of harmonization - or indeed clarification - of these matters, such as:"
"the principle of the exhaustion of rights, so that copyright will not be exhausted internationally, -the principle of distribution rights, so that the exhaustion principle will not apply to the transfer of intangible copies of works, and finally, -the principle of reproduction, to cover digital reproductions and exclude exceptions related to private use.The committee would also like to stress the importance of voluntary licensing schemes in the management of rights and in technical identification systems."
"In that context, we recognize that technical identification systems will facilitate the normal exploitation of digital works and help to counter piracy."
"We also recognise the need to establish harmonized rules to prohibit the manufacture, import and use of devices meant to circumvent technical measures for the protection of copyrighted works."
"Finally, Madam President, we ask the Commission to collect detailed information on the economic value of activities in Europe related to works covered by copyright."
"Madam President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Barzanti is a fairly full one and for that reason I will only dwell on some of its points."
"First of all, concerning the harmonization of laws in the Member States dealing with authors' rights."
"It is of course desirable for that harmonization to take place at the highest level, but being realistic, if we want harmonization to be achieved within the most appropriate time scale, we must begin by aiming at an intermediate level of protection."
"Furthermore, provision will have to be made for effective means of monitoring the implementation of and compliance with the laws in question."
"Then, concerning the matter of rights acquisition and management, the development of the creation of multimedia works complicates the problem of protecting copyright."
"Indeed, the creators of such works will have to secure authorization from each author or rightholder, for all their works that they are thinking of using."
"There is therefore a practical problem, that of collecting information about all the rights involved."
"This is where the one-stop shop can play a part."
"Of course, its precise role does not seem well enough defined."
"Whether it is to operate simply as a centre for identification and the collection of information on existing rights, a thing that would simplify procedures for all the likely users, or whether it is to function as a body for the collective management of the rights associated with a given work, is not clear."
"I also want to mention the issue of moral rights."
"The new ways of using works inherently presuppose special treatment and adaptation."
"In that event moral rights must be regarded as an obstacle and will more and more often be the subject of negotiations, because they ought not to be regarded as a source of risk."
"Though it is true that contractual freedom must play its part in maximizing the information society's potential, there are risks of infringement, mainly for new authors, who may try to waive their rights and might later regret it."
"Perhaps we should consider setting barriers so that this waiving of rights will not be total."
"The last point to which I should like to draw your attention concerns private copying."
"It seems essential to redefine what this means in the context of the information society, and effective sanctions must be introduced against private copying."
"This last point is as fundamental as respect for moral rights, if we want to protect creative richness and ensure correct remuneration for authors."
"The Commission's proposals on private copying are therefore awaited with great interest."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Fernand Herman for his excellent report and the other rapporteurs for their reports."
"I do not want to deal with a retrospective view but to look to the future, as Fernand Herman said."
"On 24 July the Commission produced a new communication on the information society from Corfu to Dublin and the new emerging priorities."
"And that is what this House should now be preoccupying itself with, not with a retrospective over the last two or three years."
"The fact is that in Corfu in June 1994 we set down the programme for the information society."
"We worked out the concept but the problem now is that we have moved on two years and we need carefully to audit how far this process has been developed and what needs to happen in the future to set a new agenda for the European Union."
"As with so many issues in the European Union we start very well."
"There is common cause amongst the Member States, the Commission, Council and Parliament and then, on any issue, a year or two years down the road we find that the Member States start to back off."
"They get concerned about budgetary considerations and, as a result, we lose the competitive advantage that we have gained in so many areas."
"We are in the same situation now with the information society."
"I say to the two Commissioners present today and to Members of the House that we only need to look at what the Council is proposing on the budget for Info 2000 and on the information society to see that the Council's support for information technology does not even stretch to maintaining the budget lines that are necessary for the coming year to really develop information technology for the European Union."
"I want to look specifically at the four headings that Commissioner Bangemann identified in his new communication which, no doubt, we will be discussing in this House in two years' time - because of the length of time it takes us to deal with things."
"He talks about improving the business environment, investing in the future, putting people at the centre and meeting the global challenge."
"These are four clear political agenda items which we in the European Union have to address."
"The information technology Council meets on 8 October."
"We should be saying to our Commissioners that we want them to come back after 8 October to give a statement to the House, to inform us what the Member States are now saying on information society and information technology developments."
"Are they going to support the budget line issues?"
"Are they going to put in place the sort of legislative and regulatory measures necessary to develop information technology?"
"Are they going to provide the networks which will allow people to take advantage of the benefits of information technology in schools and public places?"
"Let us put to one side the conceptual arguments of the past."
"We are beyond that now."
"We need detailed, concrete proposals."
"We need the support of the Member States."
"We need the budget lines for the Commission to implement its programmes and we need a proper coherent strategy in Europe if this programme on information technology is going to benefit our people - our young people in particular."
"Otherwise, the United States and the Far East will get that competitive advantage and once again Europe will have lost out."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that here, as on so many other occasions, Parliament is performing its task very well."
"Today, we are not considering Parliament's legislative role, but its function as a sounding-board for the social realities which surround us."
"These reports, therefore - as general ones, which perhaps have a number of technical shortcomings - reflect society's concerns."
"Society is now at an historic crossroads, like few before that come to mind: perhaps the discovery of the Americas, I do not know."
"It may be an even more important, more revolutionary situation, since the social realities that we now have to face will have a greater impact on our lives, and will affect our very being in a more intimate way, than any others in the past."
"At present, the two tendencies between which humanity has always vacillated are in the process of crystallizing: fear of the unknown and the challenge of discovering new lands."
"And that is what these reports reflect: noise and confusion."
"We have no clear idea of what is going to happen or where we are going."
"And the reason why we have no clear idea is because of the emergence of what is undoubtedly the fundamental debate: market forces or legislation?"
"Should we give priority to the liberalization of the market, the promotion of industry, leaving the rest to come of its own accord?"
"Or should we, on the contrary, take the view that the way to create order is through legislation, since the market left to its own devices will never bring about social order?"
"And at this crossroads, we must ask ourselves: is the law capable of creating that order?"
"Because there is no doubt that our present legal instruments are unable to provide a response to these new social facts, and are incapable of bringing order to these new realities which are emerging."
"And the other major question which we must ask ourselves today is: does it make sense to debate and address, within the context of the European Union, realities which are a global phenomenon and must undoubtedly be examined in international forums?"
"Of course, I realize that, as always, it is the law which will provide our Ariadne's thread, and the thinking must come from a European Union which speaks with one voice."
"This is because all these new realities are calling into question the two basic principles of our legal orders: the distinction between the public and the private sectors, and the dual concepts of territoriality and sovereignty - the foundations of our national legal orders, which are now beginning to crack."
"And we must seek this Ariadne's thread, in order to be able to find our way out of the labyrinth of social demands: firstly, as regards the relationships between private individuals, by seeking to strike a balance between copyright and the rights of other persons with legitimate interests which require legal protection, as well as addressing the issues of the protection of privacy and public freedoms, especially the right to information."
"Also, our thinking must take account of certain general interests which we cannot ignore - beginning with the general interest of promoting creative activity in Europe, of defending what has been the distinguishing feature of European copyright and is inseparably linked, in cultural terms, to European creative power."
"Lastly, there can be no doubt that we must take account of other general interests which fall entirely within the concept of public order - especially the interests of groups such as children, who must be protected from this uncontrollable avalanche of new technologies."
"Society as a whole must be protected from organized crime, which may exploit this unregulated scenario for the benefit of its corrupt interests."
"And we must consider the question of international public order in terms of the law that is to be applicable."
"I believe, therefore, that the response to all these issues must be to recognize that the European Union constitutes the essential framework for joint action."
"Because the European Union contains the seeds of a political structure whose purpose is precisely to meet society's new challenges."
"And finally, Madam President, in the face of this noise and confusion, we must return to our traditional legal principles: those which enabled the Sabinians and Proclians to respond to the social realities of classical Rome, and which are still relevant today."
"Madam President, information is not any old commodity, and perhaps it is not even a commodity."
"Mr Herman was right to say so in his introduction; he made it clear in presenting his long and painstaking report which is an important document, indeed fundamental, at an important time for information, and which has our support."
"In the years ahead it will in fact be information that will make the difference in every area of application. Think of the economic opportunities offered to small and medium-sized enterprises where the development of technology will bring time-saving and efficiency, thus allowing the entrepreneurs to be entrepreneurs at last and create new jobs."
"In social policy the new technology already affects a vast range of areas, from health to tax. There are thousands of other encounters between technology and telecommunications, including the organization of the needs of the citizens as consumers, from deregulation - that is, less bureaucracy at public authority counters - to the possibility that the public may finally serve the private."
"In this scenario - as Mr Barzanti rightly said - policy threatens to stand idly by and watch."
"Our institutional role requires that we do not allow that to happen."
"So we must work even harder to preserve respect for private life and for there to be a strict separation between public and private, between the collective and the individual. In conclusion, there must be certainty about rights: the right to respect for subsidiarity, the right to free movement - arguments so dear to Commissioner Monti - copyright, a moral and material right combined, and ultimately the right of the final user."
"Madam President, I shall be speaking about copyright as it is applied to the field of multi-media because it can be considered, as a result of its complexity, as a laboratory where various questions are raised and call for new responses."
"Copyright also concerns culture, economics and the question of freedom. It brings into play diverse interests which need to be reconciled: the interests of authors, those of producers and distributors and those of the consuming public."
"Copyright has two aims, and those aims contradict each other: protecting authors and producing new products quickly and in large quantities."
"The Commission Green Paper is an exhaustive list of the different issues but it is less secure when it puts forward solutions which have not yet had time to mature."
"The Barzenti report, for its part, puts forward some important ideas which are still necessarily general and which need to be emphasised and supported."
"It speaks of preserving the richness of the European concept of moral rights as opposed to the American concept of 'copyright' , aimed at harmonising the laws on copyright and related rights in the 15 Member States of the European Union, making progress on a study of technical systems for identifying works which can be rapidly used, already providing for sanctions against anyone who tries technically to eradicate the protection systems that have been created, at promoting cooperation between the Member States and linking their work with the competent international organisations, the WTO, the WIPO and the TRIS, without forgetting the important discussions taking place at the Council of Europe and UNESCO, and including agreements with third countries' copyright protection clauses, in an attempt to make all of the rules on this subject universally applicable."
"Some of these points raise difficult questions and I would like to refer in particular to the concepts of copyright concerning employees."
"Nana Mouskouri, the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture for this report, emphasizes the role of libraries and cultural and educational establishments, the importance of informing and raising the awareness of small independent producers on questions of copyright, refers to the desirable interdepartmental cooperation at the Commission so that all discussions can be carefully linked on aspects of content and technology, and insists on the urgent need to rationalize all of this work through the collective question of rights."
"I shall conclude by saying that we can see that there are, however, more questions than answers but Europe must know that it cannot lose the multi-media battle, it knows that it is lagging behind and it knows that copyright lies at the very heart of the matter."
"This is a field where subsidiarity means that this matter must compulsorily be dealt with at European level which is the only efficient way of doing so."
"Madam President, the report contains many important observations on societal effects, but also some contradictions and uncertainty as regards the long-term consequences."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, for example, fears centralization, while the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, for its part, believes in decentralization."
"The Committee on Women's Rights sounds a warning."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy approves of teleworking, but we are not told anything about the risk of weak negotiating positions or the lack of creative contact with work colleagues."
"The question is: how are we to guard against the commercial information flow leading to unintelligibility, lack of quality and fragmented awareness?"
"Finally: who takes power when everything is geared to reducing public control?"
"The Commission's neo-liberal arrogance is scaring to any democrat."
"Madam President, I should like to thank our colleague Mr Herman for his very broad approach, which has paved the way for what I consider to be the first genuinely broad debate on the information society in this House."
"Clearly, this topic concerns a development which is nothing short of a global revolution."
"Its impact on our everyday lives and on global relations is enormous, and it is therefore a good thing that we should have the opportunity to discuss various aspects at the same time."
"I myself am among those who wish to stress the fact that these opportunities which are provided by the information society require clear political guidance."
"Just as Mr Svensson has said, some believe in decentralization while others perceive the dangers of centralization; there are those who are glad that jobs are being dispersed through tele-working, while others consider this development risky."
"Our duty as politicians is to lay down the framework for this."
"I myself wish to stress education, to which attention is laudably devoted in this report."
"As the Committee on Women's Rights has previously said in these debates, we have no reason to allow the development of a two-speed information society."
"The proposal that a tax of half a percent should be imposed on data traffic, in accordance with Mrs Cresson's model, is an interesting one."
"I should like to hear what members of the Commission think about this."
"It would not be a bad idea if this revenue were to be used for education, to enable women and other people in disadvantaged positions to join the information society."
"However, would the tax have to be collected mainly from manufacturers of the information society's technical infrastructure rather than users, since we ought to encourage users to join the information society, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity?"
"In Finland we used to have a tax on data transmission, but we abandoned it very quickly because in reality it was hampering the development of the information society."
"It was levied from users of data communications, not from producers."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Herman for working at such speed and trying to guide us through the revolution that we are in the middle of."
"I would like to concentrate on the regional and cultural social aspects."
"We must have the guarantee of a universal public service reaching into even the remotest places, for example to the 90 inhabited islands in my constituency."
"We do not want a two-speed Europe with an information society benefiting only the industrialized regions."
"We do not want the marginalization of the peripheries and the over-centralization which could occur."
"The information society really can enhance lives for people on the periphery."
"Distance learning is developing very rapidly in the UK, for example."
"We have hopes that it will help the creation of a highlands and islands university, linking all the colleges right across my vast terrain through this modern technology."
"On the cultural side, I welcome the special role for public service broadcasting in minority languages because the cultural diversity of our Union must be one of the things we treasure the most."
"Each language is a vital part of Europe's heritage and the information society will assist the nurturing of these precious languages."
"I want to see free access to information networks for schools, cultural bodies, libraries, community centres, etc."
"We must make sure that this information society makes it possible for people to be in control of information rather than information controlling the people."
"Unless we emphasize the social and regional aspects, however, the positive advantages of the information society may be lost to us all."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that the Commission's aim in this document is not really to protect human beings from an information society which can be devastating in terms of people's private lives - as vaguely hinted in the text - but also for the individual who is turned into a labour commodity in the name of this concept which is becoming a ubiquitous one in Community documents: competition."
"Are not people allowing themselves be brought to the level of mere service-providers?"
"What kind of protection is to be given to those who work in the media industry, now and in the future?"
"Are they going to be paid on a piecework basis, as they were in the nineteenth century?"
"A fine advance in social policy that is!"
"What kind of society are you trying to build?"
"I am speaking here to the Members of the Commission, naturally, but also to my colleagues."
"The information society can be a great asset, as we all know, but it is only available to a small number of people, whereas the benefits should be distributed fairly."
"The document we have here, which purports to be in the interests of free competition, will only lead to more inequality."
"People will become more and more like commodities."
"Through the information society, in fact, an ever wider gulf is being created between the Europe of humanist values and an unrealistic, possibly even suicidal Union that would like to impose a development model on what is an extremely unstable economic and social situation."
"Such an approach smacks of a colonialism that no longer seems to me to be appropriate."
"Perhaps you feel that colonialism is rather a strong word to use, but it fits the facts."
"The idea of competition as advocated by the Commission sits uncomfortably alongside social progress."
"In this case, applying ultra-liberal beliefs to Europe is colonialism in disguise."
"Why?"
"It is for the Commission to supply the answer."
"How?"
"Here, sadly, the Commission has already supplied it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Herman has covered the main views of our group."
"I should nevertheless like to point out once again that his report has of course been modified by the others, so that the main features of our position do not emerge."
"I think it is a good thing that Mr Herman has now produced a further report, following a two-year gap."
"The situation has changed completely in the meantime."
"Two years ago, only a few people wanted to speak on this subject."
"Today, many people wish to air their views, and in those two years since Mr Bangemann and his group presented a report, an action plan has been drawn up and many changes have taken place."
"I believe it is important that we in Parliament should discuss this question, in order to show the public where the path is leading and to invite them to discuss it too."
"Mr Herman called on us to pull ourselves together in order to achieve a specific goal, and the reservations must not be allowed to stand in the way of everything."
"The development of the information society represents one of the greatest challenges for Europe."
"The new services offer our citizens not only undreamt-of scope for information, training, entertainment and use of a wide range of facilities, but are a challenge for our Member States and for the regions in terms of education in schools."
"As has been said many times, we really do have a great responsibility here to connect our schools to the Internet, to provide media education in schools, and especially to do all we can in universities to ensure that teachers are trained in media education."
"Nothing is more important than to make children and young people accustomed to using the screen every day, even at primary school level, and to eliminate any anxieties and perhaps fears through this media education."
"And it is not just in Europe that initiatives are being launched to connect schools to the Internet: in America, they are already the order of the day."
"As rapporteur for the report on trans-European telecommunications networks, I am in fact sorry that we spend a great deal of time talking, but hesitate when it comes to implementing these telecommunications networks and then express a large number of reservations."
"I feel it is extremely important - and this is made clear in the report - to bind in the weak areas of Europe, the weaker elements in the Community."
"By comparison with our international trading partners, the providers of new services in Europe suffer a number of competitive disadvantages, such as high telecommunications costs, partially inadequate bandwidths for networks and a lack of risk capital, as well as Europe's fragmentation into national markets, which prevents European firms from developing sufficient benefits of scale."
"Creating and maintaining a truly European internal market for the services of the information society must therefore be our principal concern."
"The Commission has recently presented a communication and a proposal for a directive on the establishment of a procedure for the exchange of data on legislative cooperation regarding services in the information society."
"This is a welcome move, since fragmentation into national legislative procedures will put Europe at a further disadvantage."
"I see it as extremely important that we should pursue this legislative initiative, so that we can then in fact develop uniform legislation in Europe."
"We should at least receive information on legislation in good time, so as not to create unnecessary obstacles."
"Finally, during the budgetary procedure, we should definitely reinstate the budget lines which were included for Info 2000 or the trans-European networks, because while we can adopt white papers on employment and make fine speeches here, unless we create the relevant budget lines, the preconditions for the development of Europe will unfortunately not exist and will be obstructed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this turn of the century, the information society is no longer just a passing fad."
"It represents a priority for Europe which should be reaffirmed at both Union and Member State level."
"The Commission's communication on Europe and the information society which followed Commissioner Bangemann's report was, we should remember, warmly welcomed by the Council at the Corfu summit in 1994, when it was hoped that the various measures envisaged in the action plan would be carried out on schedule."
"We should now commend the Commission on its determination to implement this action plan."
"Let us also remember that the question of the information society, which is the key issue in Mr Bangemann's report, has been given priority status, in particular by the German and French presidencies in 1995. It is therefore gratifying to see that some of the initiatives are taking shape in terms of both rules and practical applications in various parts of the Union."
"We should also welcome the new partnerships between towns, regions and the private sector."
"We are now seeing that the information society has made significant progress at European level."
"Here, to refresh our memories, are just a few examples: the approval of a liberal regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector; the adoption and implementation of research and development programmes under the fourth FPRD; in the fields of information technology and telecommunications, programmes have been adopted with the aim of encouraging the development of networks and the implementation of pilot projects under the auspices of the G7; and, finally, there have been many initiatives connected with information superhighways in the Member States, particularly France."
"Our group believes that Mr Herman's report is heading in the right direction."
"In particular, he stresses the urgent need for an action plan with priorities for implementation: research and development, bringing services on stream and promoting operational applications in areas of public interest - education, health and social exclusion - and standardization."
"Similarly, the approach set out in the report in terms of industrial and telecommunications policy, like the description of the legal aspects and social consequences, is well judged."
"As a result, the Union for Europe Group will support Mr Herman's report, while nevertheless expressing certain reservations about the creation of a European regulatory body in the communications sector."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Commissioner Bangemann on being a champion of the information society that is so critically important for the future of Europe and our competitiveness."
"We need that, despite the degrading of focus we have seen over the years, which Alan Donnelly described so well a few speeches ago."
"I wish to make two quick points."
"Firstly, the information society provides us with an opportunity to equalize the differences that are a consequence of distance in the Union, particularly for rural areas, one of which I represent."
"We need to take up that challenge, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises that are particularly prolific in the economies of those regions."
"Funnily enough, in many respects I welcome the idea of taxation or a small levy on information, because here we have an opportunity for hypothecation of taxation and actually putting money back in and reinvesting it in an area where it can be spent."
"Also, we need to ensure that technologies like ISDN have equal access - in the UK it is very expensive to get access to that."
"I would warn Parliament: firstly, we have to be a lot quicker than we have been over this report."
"Secondly, would it not be much better if we built a more virtual parliament, rather than the investment we have seen in this building opposite?"
"Billions of ecus have been spent on that, when we should instead be immediately improving our own electronic technology in this Parliament."
"Madam President, both the Green Paper from the Commission and the report by Mr Barzanti adopt a stance of critical openness towards the challenge of new information technology."
"This is something different from the line of 'we must join in' , as has been pointed out here this morning."
"It is a position for which the House owes thanks to both parties, and one which it should support."
"One thing is particularly important to me in this context, namely to protect the individual freedom of artists and their works against the interests and technological pressures of marketing."
"Certainly, as Mr Barzanti said, what we must do here is to stress and not abandon the achievements of traditional copyright in the Berne Convention."
"However, I wonder whether the nineteenth-century copyright geared to the originality of the author and the copyright law based on intellectual property are sufficient to meet the new technical challenges."
"Today, in my view, the point is more the individual freedom of the author to assert his rights, together with freedom of public access."
"Art cannot and should not become information."
"Rather, it should facilitate information and freedom of information."
"Only when it is free to do this can we ensure that the information society does not become one of deformation."
"Mr Bangemann, I should like to address myself to you directly, and of course to Mr Herman, as rapporteur, and Mr Barzanti."
"You, Mr Bangemann, were the main player at European level in the creation of this information society."
"We are now in the midst of it, for better or for worse."
"What is still a matter for dispute - and I believe we must dispute it very seriously - is what kind of society this should be."
"We need to dispute what kind of face it should have in the future."
"We need to dispute what kind of responsibility the state should have in this new game."
"The responsibility of the state must be different from in the past."
"The state will have to take responsibility for regulation, and has already done so."
"Regulation is a means of creating stability."
"For example, it is understandable that there is a wish to control the Internet at the moment."
"It is understandable that people wish to secure more protection for the individual through controls."
"What the state should do - and you and we will bear considerable responsibility here - is to ensure this protection on the one hand, without restricting the freedom of speech of the individual and the business world on the other."
"This will not be easy."
"It will depend on striking an even balance, and on this balance also being established at international level."
"It will involve setting up a new moral code which incorporates the old moral ideas which we certainly have throughout the world, but adds something new to them."
"And we shall have to fight for that new element."
"In this new world, it will not be possible to have the right for everyone to impose their own interests, for anyone to be able to publish as much pornography as they like, for anyone to feed as much violence as they like into the Internet."
"But there must be the freedom for anyone to publish views which they consider right and relevant."
"This is a border area where it will be very difficult to strike the right balance."
"That is one side of things."
"However, the state has a second and, to my mind, far more important responsibility here."
"It must create a basis on which all citizens - and all regions, as has been pointed out - can have access to this new network and to these new opportunities which are developing at present."
"Computers, hardware, software, the Internet, the Worldwide Web - they are all just means of providing access to information."
"Access to information is the crucial element, that is what is new."
"It will be new to search for things, to obtain knowledge."
"It will be new to create a new quality of education in Europe and throughout the world."
"And it will be new to create intellectual capital, as the current jargon has it."
"How will Europe participate in this?"
"What opportunities are we to give our citizens?"
"Universal service alone is not the answer."
"Even with universal service - at least as we understand it at present - the costs are still too high."
"How will the future look?"
"How will we connect our citizens and the regions?"
"Do you not think, Mr Bangemann, that it is time to discuss how we are going to connect all the schools, all the universities and libraries in Europe to this new infrastructure?"
"Do you not think it is time that we, as political agents of change, gave expression to our responsibility for this process by establishing a European initiative to open up access to these new sources of information for schools, regions and libraries?"
"Do you not think we should ensure that there is no discrepancy at European level, that we do not reach a situation of having some countries which, because of the cost structure or because they are lagging behind in this process of development, cannot become involved as soon as others?"
"What is your answer to these critical questions, which have yet to be resolved?"
"I would call for us to embark on this process at an early stage, and to find a truly European answer."
"Mr President, the European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Commission has recognized, in its Green Paper on the information society, that if we support the development of the information society, we must at the same time support this being accompanied by a precise definition of the rights of the parties involved."
"Where does privacy stand in the new information society?"
"Does the individual have any opportunity of determining what data are entered in the system?"
"And, conversely, who can check that the information which our children, for example, sit and lap up from the Internet should be made public in the first place?"
"If ordinary people are to be able to choose among information on the Internet, we need to be prepared for this."
"And that will only be the case when we concentrate specifically on looking after and educating both children and adults."
"Another point which concerns me is who can afford to surf the Internet?"
"If it is the same people who can afford to surf in Barbados, then we have a problem."
"Ordinary people cannot afford to leave their telephone lines open and connected to the Internet."
"The information society is therefore not for everyone, but only for the few."
"However, it is a development which is under way, and we should be pleased that it is happening and that we can follow it."
"We should simply stay in control of this development - it should not be in control of us."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Herman on an excellent report which I think certainly has captured the imagination in terms of how we must proceed into the information age."
"Of course Mr Bangemann's original report was in itself very visionary in that it described the type of future that we want to see here in Europe, because one thing is certain: if Europe is going to be competitive in the next century with the United States and the developing countries in Asia, what we need to do is develop our key technologies, in particular in the information industries, to ensure that Europe and the single market will be a success, not only for the present, but for the foreseeable future as well."
"This involves ensuring that the information infrastructure is actually present and can be used freely and cheaply at a rate which benefits businesses, communities and society as a whole."
"The freer and the quicker that information can move about the community, the quicker the improvement to the economy can be."
"That infrastructure is like the arteries of the economy."
"The arteries of an economy are like the arteries of the human body."
"I would particularly like to draw attention to the emphasis on broadcasting, because in the past terrestrial broadcasting developed in a way which was limited in terms of bandwidth and in terms of the amount of information that could be passed around."
"The new infrastructure, whether it is through digital techniques in satellite or through fibre-optic techniques, actually increases the number of channels that can be delivered throughout the Union and this will add to and proliferate the amount of information circulating within the Union."
"This in turn will develop the need for software to make it easier for people to access the information they need."
"If there are hundreds of channels, people need to be able to access the information they are after quickly and easily rather than flicking through channels in a way which we have done previously with conventional television equipment."
"This means that our research and technology institutions and our universities need to be involved in developing this new software if we are to stay in competition."
"Unfortunately, at this stage the running is being made by American companies and we are much slower in catching up on development of this software."
"With the initiatives that are going on in the European Union in developing this software, I would like to think that we can actually catch up and eventually take the lead."
"Mr President, starting out from the premise that the law must be applied for the benefit of all, we are today faced with an issue of crucial importance for the world of culture and communications."
"We are in complete agreement with Mr Barzanti when he emphasizes the need to strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of rights which may reasonably be invoked by consumers; and we are especially concerned that this balance should be maintained."
"It is for this reason that we wish the protection of copyright and related rights to be given priority over any other imperative in the use of these new technologies."
"On the other hand, we believe it is unacceptable for exclusive rights to be improperly granted to transmit information which ought to be disseminated by all the communications media to the widest possible public."
"This is a debate which is familiar to the House from numerous reports, and in which my group will continue to maintain this stance."
"Not long ago, here in the House, the European United Left warned Parliament of the need to be aware of the possible dangers: the new dangers which the introduction of new technologies into the information society might bring."
"We thus considered it important to table an amendment providing for a report to be drawn up on public service in the Community, in which account is taken of the effects of the rapid development of the information society, on the basis that protection of the artist is one of the key principles for ensuring freedom of access to the new media."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Role of public service television"
"The next item is the report (A4-0243/96) by Ms Tongue, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the role of public service television in a multimedia society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to express my full agreement with the report presented to us."
"I would only emphasize that public service broadcasting, as has just been said, has specific features and particular aims to pursue."
"These features and aims need to be updated today in the context of the mixed system and the prospect of globalization of the market."
"There is no European model of public service, but there are common problems."
"As a public service, the public broadcasters are located in the market and must try to compete without craving unjustified privileges."
"They must certainly accept the challenges of competition but if, for instance, - as Commissioner Bangemann pointed out just now - resources seem unlimited and there is no point in maintaining past attitudes, it has to be specified that while this is potentially true, the technological resources are enormous, yet the economic resources have to be there to grasp them and the technical and material resources have to be there to exploit them."
"So this is the point: while the public service is part of the market and as such cannot expect monopolistic privileges or some kind of special position, dominating advertising income and so on, because it is a public service geared to society, it has a right to such funding and such support as can further strengthen independence, autonomy and the presence of new services, in the new productive capacities which are necessary today because the public service must be equal to the challenges which it too must take up."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bangemann has already ushered in this debate."
"What interests me is how he did in that quiz show, at what point he thought of the name and answered the question."
"And I am also interested by his attitude to popular music."
"I can remember the popular song 'Join us on the yellow waggon' being a great success some years ago, but now we do not hear it quite so often."
"Turning to the matter in hand, there is no doubt that everyone here wishes to have the dual system."
"In all the countries of the European Union, we need public service broadcasting, and of course private broadcasting as well."
"I know that public service broadcasting - in Germany, at least, but in other countries too - was built on the traditions of the early years, and that this founding period was also an important one for the Federal Republic, especially as regards the emergence of a basic democratic order."
"As some of you may be aware, for a number of years I was chairman of the Broadcasting Council of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk , so I know the strengths and weaknesses of public service broadcasting."
"And who does not have weaknesses?"
"I have the impression that this report is trying to highlight the position of public service broadcasting at the expense of others."
"In my opinion, it will not help us to make progress in future discussions if we launch an attack on private broadcasting in this report at European level."
"Things do not have to be done in this way: the important assets of public service broadcasting can be enhanced without resorting to attacks."
"The PPE Group has tried to remove the negative tone from this report, and has partially succeeded."
"I hope that we shall have some further success."
"For that, our amendments will have to be adopted."
"Public service broadcasting is not only being discussed in this report."
"We also had an intensive discussion as regards the substance of public service broadcasting in connection with the television directive."
"And we shall be doing so again."
"It is not a good thing that the public service broadcasting lobby is intervening on such a scale, for example with regard to Article 1, that everything which is emerging there in terms of new services also has to be classed as broadcasting in order to be involved on the basis of national legislation."
"I think everyone is entitled to be involved, it is simply not right that it always has to be funded, and so I can only give public service broadcasting the good advice not to operate so superficially all the time here."
"That does not help any of us to make progress."
"We have also discussed the topic of public service broadcasting in the debate on rights to sporting events, on the basis of the own-initiative report by Mrs Castellina."
"I said on that occasion too that it is not very helpful for us to create images of an enemy, and to extol public service broadcasting as the only true guardian of broadcasting culture."
"The point has already been made that we can see weaknesses in public service broadcasting which need to be eliminated in order to make it strong in two ways - strong in competition with private broadcasters and strong at European level against the background of the discussions taking place worldwide."
"We need rules which apply across the board, which provide scope for all the fields of interest in Europe to be developed."
"My advice is to take a far more relaxed approach to the subject - and I say this to Ms Tongue in particular - without making the unfortunate experiences in our own countries the watchword at European level."
"Nor do I believe that we can deal with and resolve here the problems which exist in Italy, and perhaps in the United Kingdom."
"Our concern should be to develop the pan-European dimension, so as to create a sound position for public service broadcasting in the future and ensure that it has the capacity to survive."
"I believe we are on the right track, provided we do not create images of an enemy and do not respond to others simply with prejudice."
"Mr President, an own-initiative report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, as approved by the Bureau of Parliament, is today giving us an opportunity to express our views on the role of public service television in an increasingly media-oriented society."
"I would take this opportunity to say yes to public service television, provided that its terms of reference are well defined and that it meets criteria of quality and morality which justify its public financing and guarantee viewers, whoever and wherever they may be, access to information, culture, education, sport and fiction."
"Moreover, this does not rule out partnerships between public service television and private, theme-based channels, if such a choice were to be appropriate."
"The audiovisual sector cannot be treated as an ordinary commercial product."
"The new services are being called upon to expand - and Mr Bangemann will not contradict me - but they will need consumers' money for this, and they will not be accessible to everyone."
"The constant spiralling of television rights for sport in general, and football in particular, should make us stop and think."
"On the one hand, the cost of these rights plays a part in increasing the price of players and, on the other, it forces the channels into an increasingly frenetic search for ever more profitable advertising, in order to pay for these rights."
"Even worse, it also has the effect of leading the channels to show the cheapest possible films, thereby offering us an excess of American productions."
"I would ask those of you who advocate a liberal, enterprising and commercial approach if you really believe that you can market everything?"
"Have you ever imagined a world in which education, sport, health and public order would form part of a purely commercial environment, leaving market practices a free hand?"
"No, ladies and gentlemen, trade and free enterprise are not everything."
"Sadly, we have seen how freedom can turn sex into a marketable commodity, no doubt to the point where it has created consumers for the product, given rise to fantasies and generated a trade which, I am afraid, is all too profitable."
"We are already seeing racism and xenophobia being marketed on the Internet."
"Let us beware of exploitation of the weak by the strong."
"The State should be the guarantor of morals as well as public health."
"In saying yes to public service television, I am giving it the necessary power."
"Mr President, the Tongue report - and how could it be called anything else with such a fervent author? - is a courageous and exhaustive report."
"But, in my opinion, it is not a completely balanced one."
"Defending public service in television is something which obviously has to be done but confusing public service with public television is both inconsistent and an error."
"Public service may and must be performed by public and private operators alike."
"It should also be present in all broadcasting systems, be they digital or analogue, by cable or satellite."
"It is a duty for Member States to create the conditions which allow this to be so."
"And it is the duty of operators to take a social approach to their duties and to fulfil the obligations implied in this."
"What are the priorities for a public service in the European Union?"
"To offer quality and diversity, setting up a cultural reference from this point of view."
"Informing and stimulating the discussion of ideas, consolidating the sentiment of citizenship."
"Contributing to the strengthening of the European spirit, distributing products of various origins and fostering exchanges and co-productions between the Member States."
"Promoting means of access for different groups of citizens to the airwaves and not just the traditional approach of setting aside time for political parties and both sides of industry, thereby contributing towards a renewal of the very exercise of democracy."
"Public service in television is a fundamental concept in a democratic society."
"Reference should be made to this in the Treaty on the Union, which is now being revised."
"It is neither fair nor useful that we should limit this public service to public operators."
"If private operators also cooperate I think that public television as we know it now will see that its days are numbered."
"To conclude, Mr President, I call on the Commission to take a more far-reaching approach to the concept of public service in the Green Paper on new services, and I call for this as an urgent matter because time flies in the world of telecommunications."
"I call on public and private operators alike to use the enormous power they have to win over viewers and audiences instead of being won over by them."
"Finally, I should like to call on the Member States to assume their responsibilities, setting a solid economic base for the European programme-making industry, now making some progress with the Guarantee Fund, giving backing to Europe-wide distributors already in existence and wholeheartedly assuming the costs of the public service as the best way of revitalising democracy."
"Commissioner Bangemann, you are amazed at our concern about the public service and tell us no-one wants to call the public service into question! Now, if our committee has decided to choose this very issue of public service for one of our extremely rare initiative reports, it is because we are giving notice, in the new situation being created by the new technology and the ongoing processes of liberalization and privatization, gravely threatening the public service, not that there is an intention to eliminate it, but certainly that there is a tendency to marginalize it because it is not in a position to stand up to competition on the global market."
"Hence the need to reaffirm its role and importance and demand the measures required to ensure the performance of that role."
"On regulatory measures, we are very concerned that the directive on defending pluralism promised us for many years - and the existence of a strong public service is essential here - should have been further adjourned by the College of Commissioners."
"And when I say regulatory measures I also mean regulatory measures which allow the public service to be autonomous from the market."
"In fact the characteristic feature is being autonomous from the market, more independent, and being able to perform a role which commercial television, dependent on the market, cannot perform."
"Commissioner, do you know what market demand is today?"
"It is almost entirely video games and pornography."
"Do we want the great information society, with all the new technologies, to have been invented just to provide us with a few video games, some TV shopping and a spot of pornography?"
"Do we entrust the school, with its very important educational role, to the rules of competition of the market?"
"Certainly we do not."
"The television of today has a much greater impact on the education of children than school itself."
"Therein lies the delicacy of the problem and the need to preserve a role for the public service which cannot be preserved just by applying the idea of universal service."
"To extend the principle of universal service to telecommunications, to confuse that with public service broadcasting, would in fact be a very grave error."
"And that is why, Mr Bangemann, this Parliament's Committee on Culture is not raving when it asks for the public service to be strengthened."
"The same line is taken in the resolutions from the Assembly of the Council of Europe, extremely concerned, like us, about the marginalization of the public service. The Court of Karlsruhe itself, in your country, Commissioner, pronounced judgement along these lines stating that it is unthinkable that the public service should not maintain a central role because that is a constitutional principle."
"Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur for her passionate expression of a point of view which finds wide convergence even inside the Commission."
"In a sense this report completes the debate on the Television without Frontiers directive and also the debate in this Chamber on the transmission of major sporting events."
"For these very reasons, and following on from the debate which has already taken place inside the European Parliament, it has to be said that it is necessary, and certainly important, to provide guarantees to ensure the future of public television."
"It is not a question of limiting the role of commercial television, or having them compete against each other. They have different roles but precisely because they are different, precisely because there are differences between the various countries, there is a need for measures to ensure that public television is properly guaranteed and supported and can develop an important and crucial function in building European citizenship."
"In fact in this respect - as the rapporteur said - it fulfils a role that is more than multicultural, that is European, not national, to guarantee education and information independent of the respective governments and achieve the full potential of pluralism."
"For these reasons public television should not be confused with commercial television, it must have its own leading role, but nor must it become state television in a negative sense."
"The new technology raises enormous problems, but precisely for these reasons there is a need to guarantee a proper future for public service television."
"Mr President, maintaining public service television in the Member States is an extremely important issue."
"For this reason, we have to thank and congratulate Carole Tongue for taking on this difficult report."
"Like her, I believe that we must strive to maintain this very special area of broadcasting. Let us not be naive."
"We must recognize that the expansion of the information society has changed the terms of the debate. The main problem today is ensuring equal access to the channels that have increased in number as a result of new technology, which is more important than the power struggle between public and commercial television."
"But we all know that geographic, social and cultural differences are hindering open access."
"However, I believe that public service television will only achieve its objectives if it meets three requirements."
"The first is respect for viewers, regardless of age, origins or situation."
"Public television therefore ought to be pluralist and democratic, and should stop imitating the commercial television channels in their mad dash to increase audience ratings."
"The second requirement is for public service television to fulfil its educational role, particularly in terms of visual education."
"It is all too often forgotten that viewers, especially very young ones, have to learn how to decipher images."
"Thirdly, public service television should be helping to instil responsibility in those who watch it."
"It is therefore to the viewers as citizens that it should be addressing itself."
"Finally, I should like to say once again that in order to establish a truly European audiovisual sector, we need public service television that is open and dynamic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed having a debate here."
"And that is why I now have the chance, for the first time, of taking up Mr Bangemann's final words and turning round this privilege to some extent."
"Clearly, Mr Bangemann, we have the same preferences in terms of what we do not particularly enjoy watching."
"The key political difference between us, however, is that both Ms Tongue and myself, like the committee, take the view that the European system of public service broadcasting should not be developed backwards so as to resemble the American PBS, with all the rest of the market being served purely on a commercial basis."
"That is where the political difference lies."
"For this reason, public service broadcasting must also be in a position to offer something across the range of sport and entertainment."
"This means that public service broadcasting - I agree with you - must engage in competition, but it must be able to do so on equal terms."
"So the Commission, for example, should not prevent the rights to sporting events from being purchased jointly and on a pooled basis, through the European Broadcasting Union."
"If each of the national public service organizations had to bid on its own against the big combines - and Ms Tongue referred to the example of the two World Cups in football - then the game would be over once and for all, with public service broadcasting on the losing side."
"To enable competition to take place on equal terms, including the financial conditions, the Commission must therefore make it clear that the funding of public service broadcasting through fees paid by the users and/or some form of mixed financing does not contravene the aid provisions of the Treaty."
"It must also be clear that public service broadcasting has full access to new technologies."
"And a final word to Mr Hoppenstedt: the problem was not the insistence that any new services should automatically be classed as broadcasting."
"It was he who prevented a possible compromise from being reached on a sensible basis, but perhaps we can still put that right at second reading."
"Mr President, the debate and vote on this issue in committee made it clear that, in general terms, public service television plays - and, I believe, must continue to play - an important role in almost all the Member States of the European Union."
"Even allowing for the growth of private sector broadcasting, it seems clear that foreseeable developments will not prevent public service broadcasters from keeping at least some of the functions that might be seen as essential features of the audiovisual landscape."
"Hence public service television is necessary, in the first place to guarantee a variety of programming and to ensure that legitimate commercial considerations do not result in broadcasting which focuses excessively on the most profitable programmes with the largest audiences."
"Similarly, it must perform the important function of raising the general level of programming quality."
"There is no doubt that the necessary and legitimate pursuit of economic returns is an obstacle to the commissioning of quality productions which involve a high commercial risk - a risk which public service broadcasters must be prepared to take."
"Likewise, and from the point of view of both government and opposition, we would surely agree that public service television must also play the very important role of providing independent information. And, to this end, rules must be established in all the Member States guaranteeing such independence and preventing interference by the public authorities."
"These considerations should not lead us to conclude that the role of public service television should be restricted to broadcasting minority programmes - in other words, that it should play a marginal role."
"On the contrary, the existence of minimum audience levels, the variety of programming, and the guarantee that this varied programming will reach all homes can be regarded as fundamental principles of public service broadcasting."
"From this perspective, I should like to highlight two requirements set out in the report regarding the immediate future of public service broadcasting: the need for self-regulation of programming, in order to eliminate any danger of an undesirable influence on viewers; and the need for the public authorities to give a boost to ensuring that public service broadcasters lead the way - as the rapporteur says - in the development of new audiovisual technologies and the provision of public access to those new technologies."
"Mr President, we entirely agree with Ms Tongue's report on the fact that public television must exist and must be properly financed."
"It must exist, because its voice contributes to maintaining pluralism along with television generally, but it must exist within a system where the public service mission is clearly defined."
"It must be financed, because it is a public service with a social mission requiring subsidy."
"Our point of disagreement on the report is how this financing should come about."
"We do not think a report on public television can ignore funding methods which guarantee the existence of public television and the quality and balance of the vast televisual panorama constituted by private and public television as a whole, because only as a whole can it accomplish a real mission of public service."
"This financing should be transparent, directed clearly to each stage of the public service mission that television must accomplish, with year-end losses no longer written off. Paternalistic methods which hinder the growth of public television and the identification of inefficiencies must go."
"We must get away from ambiguous forms of mixed financing: fees, subsidies, advertising, write-offs of losses which grant public television privileges it is incapable of profiting from."
"I wonder which European countries are really satisfied with their public television. With the exception of the United Kingdom - and I presume that Ms Tongue is thinking of her own English public television - which other country has first-rate public television and been very successful in defining funding methods transparently and separating the funding from advertising, public finance and fees?"
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, I have to say that the Tongue report is no more than a hymn of praise to public service broadcasting, which it seems to regard as a kind of priest watching over the souls of the viewers, a loving parent in the living room."
"If only that were so."
"What the report asks in return is that PSB should be exempt from the strict European rules on competition and concentrations of power."
"The Liberal Group rejects these proposals."
"Let me briefly explain why."
"Firstly, the Liberals also support a dual system which has a strong public service broadcasting sector providing information, documentation and individual cultural identity, but which also has room for commercial broadcasting."
"Not a concentration of power, but freedom of choice."
"Secondly, the same European rules should apply to public service broadcasting and to commercial stations offering capacity for public services."
"Thirdly, efficiency and professionalism will make public service broadcasting more competitive than huge subsidies."
"The Ververs committee in the Netherlands has already taken the lead on this."
"Fourthly, the provision of universal services is not the sole preserve of public service broadcasting, and it is perfectly possible for some of its tasks to be entrusted to private companies."
"Fifth, damaging concentrations of power and exclusivity are totally unacceptable, and the Court of Justice's ruling of 11 July reversing the decision to grant the EU the collective rights to major sporting events is to be welcomed."
"We must require both public service and commercial broadcasting to be generally accessible and affordable."
"Sixth, the breakdown of established roles in the media world, far from driving a wedge between the two forms of broadcasting, is causing great confusion and distortion of competition, with public service broadcasting being more or less forced to become more commercial."
"The new commercial broadcasters, on the other hand, who are totally reliant on the market for their income, are finding themselves subject to rules which have nothing to do with a free market, such as quotas and investment commitments."
"Commissioner Bangemann, with his forthcoming green paper, and Commissioner Monti have a great responsibility."
"Which firms are allowed to provide public services?"
"What are public services, in any case?"
"What are the national and European rules governing television subsidies, and what are the criteria and restrictions that apply?"
"Finally, let me make it clear that the Liberal Group can only support this report if a number of amendments are adopted and a considerable number of paragraphs are dropped from the resolution."
"Mr President, Carole Tongue's report, for which we are grateful, gives us some idea of what public service television could be like in each of the Member States."
"It would be independent of political and economic bodies, have high standards of content, and continue to fulfil its role of disseminating democratic values. By the same token, public service television would also provide information honestly - since objectivity in this area has been hounded out of existence in recent years - and in a pluralist way, as well as entertain, improve and educate."
"It should not be deprived of the means required for it to become part of the information society, since it represents the only way for citizens to be able to access the new services without discrimination, whether economic, social or geographic."
"In view of the Commission's recent refusal to draw up a directive on media concentration and pluralism, this report deserves to be more than an own-initiative one, and I am addressing Mr Bangemann here in particular."
"Is there any future for public service television in an environment dominated today and sewn up tomorrow by four or five groups whose restructuring activities show their global power every day, and represent a formidable onslaught on digital broadcasting?"
"So, in order to strengthen the independence and durability of the public sector in Europe, there should be a political will to maintain and expand the means of production."
"More specifically, in France for example, the Commission seems to be actively encouraging the government to restructure French companies through privatization."
"Ideological blindness on the part of governments and the Commission has led them to ignore important assets such as skills, new advanced technologies in action, and a material and technical heritage - go and see them for yourselves: digital buses, studios and so on - in order to enhance the interests of the financier, Mr Butler."
"Mr Butler has hit the jackpot!"
"For a contribution of 50 million francs, he will receive a gift of 1.4 billion from public funds, in addition to the assets I have just mentioned, in return for axing 660 jobs out of a total of 1040."
"After what Mr Bangemann has just told us, I think that there are questions to be asked regarding potential jobs as well as job cuts."
"The same thing applies in the telecommunications sector. As you well know, prices for longdistance telecommunications and for big companies are falling, but they are certainly not doing so for the man in the street."
"The public service is not yet public enemy number one, but if we are honest with ourselves, it may well be so in the future!"
"Mr President, I salute Carole Tongue for her commitment and her eloquence in this cause."
"I declare my own interest as an occasional producer for public service as well as for commercial channels in the United Kingdom."
"I will return to that in a moment."
"I would say to those who have spoken in the debate - Mr Arroni and Mrs Larive - that we should remember what the market can do."
"We accept that, we accept the vitality and the vigour of the market."
"But the market gives neither genuine diversity in all circumstances nor universality of service where most needed."
"I shall refer just to things happening in my own country."
"The BBC and Channel 4 are two entirely different forms of public service: one comes from a subvention (the licence fee), the other is financed by advertising."
"One is the first and the other is the latest and perhaps the last innovation in the field of public service."
"What is happening to the BBC now?"
"Carole Tongue has referred to that."
"The BBC is crawling with consultants telling it to turn towards advertising; telling it to make deals with the very people who are trying to destroy it."
"Only today it has announced that it cannot compete in the sports field, because enormous financial resources are now being deployed to take away those staples of the mass audience which the BBC needs in order to preserve its own diversity and, indeed, its own audience."
"Channel 4, which has been the best possible way of serving new interests with a public service remit in a public trust without private shareholders, is now being told by elements within our government that it must privatize."
"There is no single argument for this in terms of programme quality; no single argument for it in terms of the diversity of services."
"It has the morality of a bank raid."
"It is a simple attack on the resources which that channel has brought to quality programming in our country."
"I apologize for speaking primarily about the situation in Great Britain."
"Broadcasting is one area in which we can still take some pride, and we have a deep feeling of shame about the sort of broadcasting that Europe may have to endure within ten years."
"Mr President, after listening to what the previous speaker has to say, I ask why cannot we have pride in the television of the public broadcaster and in the television of the private broadcaster?"
"That seems to me to be the sort of television that we want."
"I have no doubt at all that public service television has played, is playing and will continue to play an important and valuable role in serving the viewing needs of the public."
"I have no doubt this is true in each country of the European Union but I, as a British Member, am happy to pay tribute to the very high standards and the leadership that the BBC has given in public service broadcasting."
"However, we must not overestimate the role of the public sector."
"Nor should we neglect the valid and valuable role that the private sector has played and is playing in television. If this were a debate about the press we would all have very strong reservations about a public sector press."
"I am not too sure why we should make the overstatements that we do about public sector broadcasting."
"I abstained when this report came to the committee because I believe it does not achieve the fair and correct balance that is necessary."
"Let me deal with just a couple of issues."
"On sport, it is wrong to ignore the important financial contribution the private sector is now putting into sporting activity across a whole range."
"This helps sport and the public interest in watching sport, I would say, in three distinct ways."
"Many more minority sports are now broadcast because the private sector is there."
"Sports bodies have more funds, a fairer share of the money, and they are able to put that money back into the sports themselves by developing facilities and training to bring people into those sports."
"The sportsmen and women themselves are now getting a fair return for their skills and it is their skills that make the sporting activities worth watching."
"On another issue, I support the occasional financial assistance coming from the Community for broadcasters with a pan-European remit, such as Euronews."
"I am not convinced, however, that this support should be open-ended for all time."
"Such programmes need an audience to justify their raison d'être and there is no better discipline to make them seek an audience than the discipline of the marketplace."
"High subsidies for high-quality programmes that nobody watches is not a sensible way to spend our money."
"We are on the threshold of a major growth in television broadcasting, the age of digital television is upon us, but I am sure that we should not just have controls and regulations that keep the private sector out and allow the public sector to become flabby, lack innovation and fail to keep up with the public's wishes."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking my party colleague, Carole Tongue, for her excellent work, not only on the report itself but also in making it possible for us to debate this very important subject in Parliament today."
"As Carole points out, television is still the most influential organ of our mass media."
"It is therefore immensely important that the programmes broadcast feature quality, pluralism and objective information."
"We must shield our children from violence and pornography and at the same time provide high-grade entertainment and information."
"Television must take on its responsibility."
"Television sets patterns, not least when it comes to violence."
"Well resourced public-service TV companies are a guarantee of this."
"Support from the EU and the Member States must be improved."
"Television is also an indispensable forum for the seventh art - the film industry."
"In a time when so many small, independent cinemas have had to give way to large multiplexes, which make astronomical sums of money showing American mass-market products, television often offers the only chance we get to see alternative and/or foreign films."
"The TV companies thus play a very important role in this context too, namely by giving European audiences access to the cultures of their own countries and continent."
"What is shown on television reflects the spirit of our time, but it is also part of the opinion-forming process."
"Let us therefore fight together to ensure that this opinion-forming is worthy of our democratic and humanist culture."
"Mr President, there is one point made in this report which I should like to underline: the public funding of public service broadcasting is legitimate."
"And I would add that, in many cases, it is also essential."
"The reason for this is simple: public service broadcasting provides a service to society in many areas which cannot be totally funded by the market."
"There is a need for a service of this kind, so as to guarantee cultural diversity, encourage linguistic pluralism - especially in small communities - promote European production and bolster cultural and educational services."
"And in the multimedia society which is now being created, our citizens must be offered such a service. If the market is unable to provide this service completely, then it is the job of public bodies to do so."
"In our society, there are certain areas which cannot be judged in terms of competition pure and simple. And one of those areas is the obligations of public service broadcasting in relation to society - obligations for which public funding provides appropriate compensation."
"I shall give you a good example: the Basque language is spoken by some 800 000 people, in an area in close proximity to 50 million French speakers and 35 million Spanish speakers."
"In these circumstances, it is most unlikely that the market will promote the use of the Basque language in the audiovisual media on its own account."
"It is for this reason that society must fund public service broadcasting, since democracy presupposes tolerance and respect for cultural diversity; and, in our society, public service broadcasting helps to guarantee these principles."
"By providing information at local and regional level, moreover, it serves to foster European integration on the basis of respect for cultural identities, self-government and subsidiarity."
"It is important for the European Parliament to send the clear message to the Commission that, on this issue, the rules on competition alone are not enough to build a united and pluralistic Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that we are at a turning-point in the development of broadcasting."
"That is why the decisions taken on Parliament's position are exceptionally important, because we are moving more and more onto the defensive, since broadcasting as a cultural asset is increasingly being called into question."
"I would refer to the hearing, convened by the Commission, which took place yesterday and dealt with the issue of a regulatory framework for broadcasting and telecommunications, on the basis of a study whose contents can only be described as extremely disappointing."
"It attributes hardly any further scope to public service broadcasting, and the 'new vision' set out there relates solely to the multimedia market, which is geared to maximizing profits."
"We cannot accept this, and we demand from the Commission the green paper it has promised which is meant to make it clear how the new services are to be structured. The point is that we have to decide what is still broadcasting and what is not broadcasting in an age of multimedia globalization."
"The fear which has been expressed here many times, that we have our backs to the wall in terms of cultural developments, is unfortunately not without foundation."
"From what we hear, we shall only be dealing with side issues, so we can concern ourselves with the protection of young people, for example, but no longer with general public access, information, education and entertainment, which are among the original purposes of broadcasting, and must remain so in a digital age which may be opening up new technical opportunities, but should not tempt us into giving up old ingredients which have become valuable to us."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our colleague Carole Tongue from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media has today put before us an important and much-needed own-initiative report, and I would like to join in praising the quality of its contents."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to tell the rapporteur just how highly I regard her work in the audiovisual sector, and Mr Bangemann how much benefit he would derive from listening more to what we have to say on the matter."
"We are all well aware of the explosion in the number of television channels offering their services throughout the world."
"But no one is complaining about this. A multiplicity of channels ensures freedom of expression and maintains a modicum of democracy."
"So it is a necessary part of that freedom, but as everyone also knows, it is not enough on its own."
"Like the rapporteur, I am deeply attached to public service television."
"It stands for and guarantees access on the widest scale to quality television, whose task should be to promote the cultural riches of the European Union."
"It enables all those who do not have the money or the equipment to receive all the private channels to have access to culture."
"The European Union must therefore ensure at all costs that public service television is maintained and allow Member States to control its financing, in return for which the public channels would undertake to abide by a clear specification that reflects the reasons why they were established."
"A network of European public television channels of this kind can and must become the prime vehicle for broadcasting European productions, and must be a driving force behind private television channels in this area."
"This is important for the advent, at long last, of a genuine citizens' Europe."
"We would very much hope, Mr Bangemann, that you will listen to us on this occasion."
"Madam President, it is naturally a duty, but also a pleasure for me - and I must say this to Mr Caudron - to listen to him and the other Members of Parliament."
"We have of course taken account of the report by Ms Tongue in our own discussions, and will continue to do so."
"I would only say that, to my mind, the assessment of the role of public service broadcasting in the report - as Mrs Larive pointed out - is a very positive and optimistic one."
"I would ask you all to look at public service broadcasting just as critically as private broadcasting."
"One cannot allow standards of quality to fall, for example, simply because public service broadcasting is involved."
"A critical approach to quality is what we wish to see, and we believe that the simplest way to achieve this quality control is competition with private broadcasters."
"Then the viewers or listeners will do exactly what suits them."
"But now a point arises - and here Ms Tongue is quite right - namely the question of where public service broadcasting stands at present in this competition."
"Here there are both advantages and disadvantages."
"Certainly, financing through fees or other forms of public funding is an advantage in competitive terms, but on the other hand, the almost total exclusion of public service broadcasting from private revenue represents a disadvantage for it."
"In this context, we have to decide what we wish to have."
"Of course we shall tackle the question of public service and public broadcasting. However, I must point out to Members, if they would just listen to a Commissioner - the Commission always listens to Parliament, if you would just listen to me for a moment!"
"There is of course, as there must be, a debate on public service."
"Naturally, the question is to what extent we can produce European rules on this."
"For example, public service broadcasting and television is regulated differently in every Member State - Mr Barzanti is right, and Mrs Castellina always sets great store by such national differences."
"It would certainly be wrong simply to throw a European solution over them and accommodate everything under it."
"I must also correct what was said in the debate regarding controls on media concentration."
"The Commission has not rejected these."
"We have held a policy debate on the basis of a first draft by my colleague Mr Monti, in which there were not many supporters for the approach."
"It was a very European approach, and the point was made that, at least for the time being, media concentration is a problem for the individual Member States."
"If it becomes an international problem, it will also become a European one, and so we have to consider what we can regulate on a European basis."
"Mr Monti and I are both among the most determined supporters of controls on media concentration."
"We have not rejected them, therefore, as Mrs Pailler suggested, but are engaged in a process of discussion, and our wish is to regulate what can be regulated at European level."
"Let me make a final comment on the concern of Mrs Castellina - which came through in other speeches too - that public service broadcasting is being marginalized."
"First of all, this has nothing to do with the new services."
"It all depends on how the new services are defined, and the Commission has opposed the idea of including too many new services under the concept of broadcasting - in agreement with the majority in Parliament - quite simply because the licensing conditions and the controls have to be different."
"You cannot make every new service subject to these strict rules, but of course we have no objection at all - and I would say this to Mr Kuhne in particular - to public service broadcasting using the new services, or indeed providing them."
"That is not our difficulty."
"Our difficulty was only - and I hope it does not become a problem - that too many of these new services are regarded as broadcasting."
"One final word on marginalization. I am very sorry, Mrs Castellina, that everything fell over in front of you when you mentioned my name."
"That is of course an effect which I did not intend to have."
"But I must say that I am pleased about one thing, which is that public service broadcasting no longer has a de facto monopoly on disseminating information and opinions, but now has to compete with other sources."
"I definitely cannot complain about the fact that people can now obtain information through private broadcasters and news stations."
"Having someone who possesses a de facto monopoly and uses it, even with the best of intentions, cannot be an ideal form of democracy, Ms Tongue!"
"The Commission is not demonizing either public or private broadcasting."
"Like Mr Hoppenstedt, we are relatively relaxed."
"However, we should like people to prove themselves, and if public service broadcasting is as good as Ms Tongue believes, then we need have no fears as regards its future."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann."
"The debate is closed"
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"Madam President, my point of order concerns respect for the agenda."
"Yesterday, we adopted an agenda in which the period from 7 to 9 p.m. was reserved for meetings of the political groups, as at all our part-sessions, with the committees meeting from 5.30 to 7 p.m."
"I have now just been informed that at least two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, have arranged meetings between 7 and 9 p.m."
"This is unacceptable, since the group meetings are essential to enable us to discuss and define our positions for the votes."
"I should like to know who has authorized these committee meetings outside their allocated time, and I would ask for them to be cancelled and rearranged in their usual slot between 5.30 and 7 p.m."
"I am very willing to note your protest, Mr Pasty."
"I understand that it is urgent matters which lie behind the meetings of these committees."
"That being so, I would suggest that you raise the question in the Conference of Presidents, of which you are a member."
"Madam President, I should like to raise a point of order."
"I think that Parliament should be able to take its decisions freely and without constraint."
"I was therefore somewhat shocked to see that someone had placed a veal crate on the floor below, just when we were about to discuss the issue."
"If it is there to symbolize free speech, then I can certainly accept that."
"But at the same time, let me appeal to the farmers from Alsace that when they come to Parliament on Friday, they bring some live animals with them."
"Thank you, Mr Jacob. I am sure that these incidents will not prevent the House from voting quite independently."
"Votes"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for an amending directive on a solvency ratio for credit institutions on which we are about to vote is to be welcomed."
"Its main purpose is to extend risk weighting at 50 % of mortgage-backed loans in respect of offices or multipurpose commercial premises until 1 January 2001, this provision having expired on 1 January 1996."
"The possibility of risk weighting at 50 % has previously applied to only four Member States, and is now being extended to all the Member States of the European Union on an optional basis."
"The weighting of credit risk, in other words the backing of credit granted by a bank with own capital, constitutes a basic principle of bank supervision law."
"This proposal to retain risk weighting in the Union and extend it to all the Member States is indexed to the economy."
"It is justified by a whole range of safeguards against risk and raises no problems as regards the rules of competition."
"As for the risk factors, there is a lending limit of 60 % of the value of the property."
"This value is established on the basis of strict criteria, and the premises must be additionally secured."
"An upward trend is discernible in Europe."
"Failure to approve this proposal for a directive would mean an increase of 0.25 % in interest and amortization costs, which certainly cannot be justified at the present stage."
"I would therefore ask the House to approve this proposal."
"Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn, you told me that you wished to make a brief statement."
"I would in fact have liked it to be a little more brief."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"We agree with the stance adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs as regards the Commission proposal."
"There has always been a need to extend the transitional arrangements in the directive, which relates to mortgage-backed loans in respect of offices or commercial premises."
"The business and financial implications are so great that we therefore now support this compromise."
"van der Waal report"
"It is entirely correct that conditions must be created for the inland waterways to take on a greater role as a transport system."
"Developments in recent years have unfortunately shown that the greatest growth has occurred in road transport, which is very worrying from the point of view of our common environment."
"It is thus of the utmost importance to devote more resources to environmentally friendly transport systems, such as the railway and the inland waterways."
"Major structural investment is needed in these areas, instead of what is now happening - billions of kronor spent on motorways and unnecessary bridges, such as the Øresund Fixed Link project."
"In this context, the Council has adopted a stance which is, to say the least, a cause for concern, and the European Parliament must react vigorously against it."
"De Esteban Martín report"
"Madam President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to thank Commissioner van den Broek for his reply to the debate on this report on human rights in the European Union."
"He promised a series of measures from the Commission to deal with the sexual exploitation of children within the European Union, to combat sex tourism and to arrange the close monitoring of paedophile networks both on the ground and on the Internet."
"Events over the last few years in England and the recent terrible discoveries in Belgium have shown all too tragically the need for these measures."
"But such measures can only work successfully if there is a unity of purpose amongst Member States."
"I would like to know whether he is confident that he can take with him, when introducing these measures, the representatives of the United Kingdom Government, who seem willing to sacrifice any European measures, no matter of what importance to the people of Europe, on the altar of Euro-scepticism and subsidiarity."
"It is necessary that we use Europol, the police and customs liaison organization based in The Hague, to exchange information on these matters."
"We need new legislation at European level to control not just paedophile networks, but pornography and neo-Nazis and racists on the Internet."
"The question is whether we get the necessary support."
"Equally, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the fact that 1997 will be the year against racism and to thank the Commission for its support for the EU observatory to monitor racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism, to be set up in line with the recommendations of the Consultative Commission and endorsed at the Florence summit."
"I hope it was a slip of the tongue when he said he hoped that the anti-racist clause will be incorporated in the treaties."
"May I point out that Commissioner Flynn has already said that there should be an anti-racist clause within the Community treaty, a far better place than the vague promises of the third pillar."
"Finally, human rights within the Community should allow citizens to join and to leave religious organizations freely, without allowing these organizations special tax status which is denied to other cultural and social organizations."
"Madam President, the Dutch members of our group voted against the Esteban Martín report for various reasons."
"First of all, we feel that there is a clear distinction between the traditional basic rights and other socio-economic and cultural rights, some of which are perfectly justified, but are political objectives, not human rights."
"We also object to the fact that many of the paragraphs call for Community action to be taken."
"We agree that racism needs to be combatted, but this is something to be tackled at national level."
"The Member States have all acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights and are more than capable of making sure that these are respected."
"Moreover, some of the freedoms have been interpreted rather liberally, so that freedom of expression, for example, is required to respect the bounds of privacy and personal reputation, but no mention is made of blasphemy, pornography or obscenity."
"Finally, I should like to explain in particular why we voted against paragraph 93, since this is something that is only too likely to be labelled as a victory for the far right."
"The tendency which the left has of attaching this label to those with less extreme views than their own simply distracts attention from the real problem."
"Statements such as that in paragraph 93 show Parliament in just the same extreme and totalitarian light."
"The fact that the parties of the far right pursue ideas and practices in this field which we reject does not automatically mean that they should be excluded from politics or government, in our opinion."
"There is no need for this, provided that they operate within the rules of our democratic system."
"We are not forced to adopt their methods or approach."
"Madam President, we have been treated to the annual joke about human rights, since the most basic of all human rights is the right to express one's thoughts and opinions freely!"
"Yet the French Government, which I believe you support, Madam President, is preparing to hold a vote - in the name of the new dominant and totalitarian ideology, namely antiracism - on a law which judges not actions, words or writings, but in fact the intentions and ulterior motives that are supposed to lie behind them."
"In other words, the French Government is going to set up an ulterior motives police, which is an unprecedented step backwards in terms of freedom and justice."
"This law is not aimed just at a few National Front MPs, but threatens the freedom of millions of French people."
"The parents of pupils - and I believe that you, Madam President, were involved with an organization of this kind - who choose to educate their children at a school with few immigrants, having obtained an exemption from the catchment area, will risk being prosecuted under this outrageous new law introduced by the French Government."
"Employers will no longer be free to choose their staff without laying themselves open to prosecution."
"The same thing goes for teachers whose freedom will also be threatened..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) ... will be threatened by a law on ulterior motives, a law fit to cause civil war that must not be passed, or it will mean the end of freedom for us all."
"Thank you, Mr Le Gallou. I would also point out, for your information, that I am here in my capacity as a Member and Vice-President of the European Parliament and President of the sitting, and not in the role in which you addressed me."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, voting on a report devoted to human rights issues should make the House pause and reflect on a dreadful paradox."
"Historically speaking, the most generous declaration - that of 1793, in fact - was adopted by the government with the most pronounced terrorist tendencies of the period."
"A similar phenomenon occurred after 1945, when the USSR signed the Universal Declaration at the behest of Stalin."
"The United Kingdom, on the other hand, which has never adopted a bill of rights, has not committed any crime of the magnitude of those committed by Robespierre and Stalin."
"This should inspire a certain modesty on the part of those who draft such declarations."
"I would add that the great philosopher Hegel has explained why it is that the quest for perfect freedom, through ever broader declarations on human rights, inevitably ends in terror. According to Hegel, when an individual assumes the role of a universal conscience, he becomes intolerant of the slightest opposition from others."
"In this way, a love of all men is effectively transformed into hatred for everyone."
"That is why I believe that national declarations on human rights are enough."
"We do not need them at European level too."
"From the point of view of those concerned with freedom, this report is not a proper report on the human rights situation in the EU, because apart from a few items it reveals hardly any facts; nor - secondly - is it calculated, with its accumulation of 126 paragraphs and 24 amendments which cannot be studied with the necessary care in the short time which is available, to produce serious proposals for improvements."
"Thirdly, on many points it dwells too much on questions of implementation, the responsibility for which lies with the Member States, thereby infringing the principle of subsidiarity and undermining the rights of national parliaments."
"Fourthly, large sections of it consist of a listing of decisions previously taken and a frequent repetition of demands, so that it comes to represent only a rather confusingly assembled and overloaded catalogue of demands with no relation to reality. And, fifthly, on some important points it is hardly tenable, in strictly legal terms."
"We believe in full respect for human rights, but do not think they will be genuinely served by approving this confused package of demands, which touches on everything from the environment, through armed forces, to the conduct of trials in the United Kingdom, but does not deal with any of it seriously, and we are rejecting the report as a whole."
"We did not feel that it made sense to support individual paragraphs in the document, which would often have been appropriate, because they were taken too much out of context."
"We therefore abstained from voting in such cases."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs De Esteban Martín, who unfortunately is no longer present."
"In developing her initial position, she did a remarkable amount to enable many points, not least those raised by our group, to be discussed in connection with this report on human rights."
"I am sorry that she has not been supported by her own group today to the extent that she deserved, but we shall have to bear that in mind."
"With the adoption of this report today, we have taken a major step forward, since the European Parliament now once again has a basis for its work which entitles it to talk about human rights violations outside the European Union as well, since those who fail to acknowledge what is going on at home do not have the right to criticize what is happening outside."
"As for the statements by Mr Le Gallou and Mr Blot, I would only say that they have the right to talk such nonsense as they do, since talking rubbish is a human right as well, and this is after all the human rights debate that we are holding here."
"To that extent, their otherwise somewhat disturbed utterances are acceptable today!"
"Both left- and right-wing extremism should equally be rejected."
"In practice, there is often no longer any discernible difference between the two."
"Both forms are to be condemned."
"The report by Mrs De Esteban Martin on respect for human rights in the European Union covers far too many subjects for us to be able to consider them in depth."
"We are therefore being invited to cast a single vote on 125 proposals that are very different in content and very unequal in value, some of them being extremely questionable, such as the one that I complained about in the debate preceding this vote. This explains our reluctance."
"In addition, one essential problem, to which the IGC should now be giving consideration, is not covered although it has recently been raised by several Member States: the absence of any procedure for appealing against the decisions of the Court of Justice when it gives a preliminary ruling, or rules on an appeal for revocation, on the interpretation or validity of a Community act."
"After all, the Court's decisions can shed totally new and unexpected light on certain provisions of the Treaty, as we saw recently in the case of the Bosman judgment."
"The absence of any right of appeal in such cases seems to us to be a serious violation of a fundamental human right - the right to a fair and full legal hearing."
"And the fact that this kind of shortcoming quite often has an impact not on a particular individual, but on an entire nation, is of course an aggravating circumstance."
"Admittedly, in the event of a debatable judgment, it might be conceivable for the Council to amend the Community regulation in order to clarify it."
"But even then it would be necessary for the case to be referred to the Council by the Commission, which has a monopoly right of initiative and thus a blocking power."
"It is easy to see that this is not a healthy situation."
"The nations of Europe cannot allow their destiny to be steered, with regard to fundamental points and with no power to react, by a Court of Justice which sometimes interprets the Treaty in a completely different way from what the national parliaments had assumed when they adopted the initial text."
"It is thus becoming essential, today, to devise a procedure enabling the most debatable judgments of the Court of Justice to be referred to the national parliaments, and even to the nations themselves."
"This report on human rights in the European Union is both comprehensive and extremely important."
"It is therefore hardly surprising that it has provoked much heated discussion among Members of the House."
"It is very unfortunate, however, that we have not managed to reach even something approaching a consensus."
"Of course, there are among us certain Members with whom it is impossible to discuss human rights. They deny their existence, they deride them and glory in the process."
"It is impossible to reach an agreement with them, but it should be possible to do so among the democrats who are present."
"Certainly, the left in Parliament rightly supports a broader concept of fundamental human rights."
"It has no hesitation in including social, economic, cultural and ecological rights."
"And it is right to do so, for where are the rights of those without work, a livelihood or a roof over their heads?"
"Certainly too, the second largest political group in Parliament supports a classical concept of human rights, generally based on the freedoms and the right of property that are the building blocks of liberalism."
"However, I regret that we cannot reach agreement on certain basic issues. These include the condemnation of all forms of racial, sexual or religious discrimination, all the forms of physical and moral torture still practised in some Member States, the poverty caused by unemployment, and the lunatic pursuit of profit at any price."
"Can we not also agree to condemn absolutely any racist, xenophobic, not to mention anti-democratic ideas or ideologies that we see emerging, sometimes even here in the House?"
"In France the situation is getting out of hand - the evil beast has awoken!"
"Democrats in the European Parliament should not be divided on such a fundamental issue as the need to assert and protect human rights."
"The matter is altogether too serious!"
"Let our collective conscience wake up to the real problems, challenges and crises which await us."
"If our concern for human rights is ever to become more than simply lip-service, we shall need to adopt a considerably more discerning approach."
"Hollow theories and vague ideologies must not be allowed to distort our sense of moderation and reality."
"We need to give less emphasis to certain elements, and more to others."
"Even if the rights of race and nationhood are, most regrettably, not yet classified as human rights, everyone should still have the right to retain their racial and national identity."
"Everyone should have the right, now and in the future, to keep their language, culture, traditions and national identity without fear of discrimination, yet none of this is acknowledged."
"Anyone who is genuinely concerned about human rights must ensure that people have a right to security that is more than just an empty promise."
"An effective campaign against crime on every scale is urgently needed, and is something which the man in the street above all has a perfect right to expect."
"Looking to the future, it is our young people and our children in particular who have the right to protection and to physical and spiritual integrity, and I would add here that the unborn child also has a right to protection and to life."
"Anyone who does not recognize this has no right to talk about human rights at all."
"Finally, when will we realize at last that we cannot talk about rights without recognizing responsibilities?"
"Look how much harm has already been done by glorifying rights and scorning responsibilities!"
"We vote in favour of this report, because we think its content is good."
"What we are opposed to is that the EU should take over functions of the Council of Europe."
"We do of course think that racist crimes should be punished, but we do not favour a general ban on racist organizations."
"We are glad that this report has finally been put to a vote."
"We have voted for the report and most of the individual paragraphs, since we consider that the protection of human rights is in principle a general concern of humanity that transcends national frontiers."
"We therefore do not think that the EU should become a legal person with authority to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights, which is in any case quite unnecessary as all EU Member States are obliged to have ratified the Convention as a condition of membership."
"We have therefore supported Amendment No 19 from the EDN Group."
"We also want to stress that the multitude of concrete demands for human rights put forward in the report are and should remain a matter for the Member States exercising their sovereign decision-making prerogative and for intergovernmental cooperation."
"While this annual report is good on the whole, I would draw special attention to certain points."
"If homosexual persons are under threat of deportation to third countries, where they risk victimization or reprisals on grounds of their homosexuality, these aspects must weigh heavily in the consideration of their cases: the authorities should err on the side of caution and not go ahead with the deportation."
"With regard to paragraph 56, I would prefer it if Europol and SIS did not go ahead at all."
"But if that happens, these databanks must under no circumstances contain information of a personal nature, for example details of racial, religious and political affiliation and sexual disposition."
"I want to stress how important it is that persons who for reasons of conscience refuse to perform military service are not subjected to imprisonment or any other penalty."
"An equivalent form of civilian service must be offered as an alternative to military service."
"It is important that the EU Member States take any action necessary to ensure that sex tourists can be prosecuted in their home countries and to prevent sexual abuse of minors in the children's home countries."
"Finally, I wish to stress the importance of having international provisions on human rights but do not think that the EU should concern itself with these questions, because the EU is not the whole world and the Member States must act for themselves in large international organizations."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament first and foremost welcome the fact that Parliament is keeping a watchful eye on the human rights situation in the EU."
"Unfortunately, there is still a need for it to do so."
"The only way to improve matters is to go on drawing attention to the problems and to show the world how wrongly things are being done."
"At the same time, we have to say that we find Mr Haarder's amendment aimed at banning the principle of the closed shop very strange."
"This is not because we are against freedom of choice as regards trade unions, but the amendment contains a hidden agenda which stems from a hatred of trade unions and is an attempt to destroy the work which the unions have built up over many years."
"Furthermore, we find it curious that a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties should have used a report on human rights to raise the question of trade union law."
"He must be aware that trade union law, the right to strike and trade union matters in general are areas which lie outside the scope of the Maastricht Treaty."
"I have voted in favour of the report because one of our most important tasks as elected representatives in Parliament is to safeguard human rights and freedoms."
"I voted against or abstained from voting on certain parts of the report, for example the right to an abode, which I do not think falls within the field of human rights."
"I did not vote against these aspects because I think they are unimportant, but rather because they should not be tied in with the subject of this report."
"Madam President, you asked us if we would accept a list of names of people who could give an explanation of vote in writing."
"The rule is that Members have to be present."
"Clearly today it is very difficult because you gave the names later, but I think we can only accept the names of people who actually voted in the debate this afternoon."
"You cannot give an explanation of vote for a vote you did not participate in."
"You are quite right, Mr Ford, but we have checked."
"We shall indeed make sure that those Members who put their names down were actually present."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.26 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Equal treatment in social security"
"The next item is the report (A4-0256/96) by Mrs Torres Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes (COM(95)0816 - C4-0422/95-95/0117(CNS))."
"Mr President, the Commission has proposed to draft a Council Directive amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes."
"First of all, I should like to emphasize that we are not going to deal here with the general social security schemes but analyse exclusively supplementary schemes which certain companies offer to their employees and which in many cases are of enormous importance."
"Given that the scope is limited, it must be asserted that this draft Directive is a technically complex and politically controversial one."
"Therefore, it has been the subject of a number of debates in the Committee on Women's Rights to try and see if we can find solutions which are more viable and balanced."
"The proposed amendments to the Directive which the Commission is now suggesting to us are based on the case-law of the Court of Justice in respect of various cases, the most famous of which is the Barber Judgment, although others since then have fleshed out that interpretation."
"The situation is the following: as we all know, Article 119 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates equality of remuneration for men and women."
"But since the case-law of the Court of Justice considers that this article is not applied to compulsory social security schemes, where they are directly regulated by law, the same is not true of occupational social security schemes."
"As far as the Court of Justice is concerned these cases of occupational social security schemes are considered as part and parcel of remuneration and, consequently, may not be the subject of any derogations or distinctions."
"Furthermore, it is worrying that what is happening to the case-law of the Court, as a consequence of the principle of equality, is that this is being used not to guarantee women the same income as men - as many reports have shown this difference is now reaching the order of 20 % less for women than for men - but that certain advantages are being withdrawn from women even those benefits that everyone used to acknowledge they were entitled to: for example, access to retirement at an earlier age."
"It is the hard and fast rule that women carry out their occupational duties with a great feeling of responsibility and their value is acknowledged."
"But all of society knows that, without any specific benefits, women are given the fundamental role of bringing up children, i.e. new generations, and managing the domestic economy."
"The main solution for this subject, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is for us to take advantage of the Intergovernmental Conference so that, when revising the Maastricht Treaty, we should consider equality between men and women as a fundamental right of all European citizens and that this must include any positive measures needed to turn that aim from a Utopian one into everyday reality."
"However, this means that we must, for the time being, work with the Treaty as it stands."
"I am, therefore, presenting a set of amendments and I would like to take this opportunity to address my very sincere thanks for all of the support and contributions which I have received from all the different political parties and I think that all of these significantly improve the Commission proposal."
"They can be summed up as follows: including atypical and part-time working in this social security scheme."
"These are types of jobs which are now becoming quite widespread and which are mostly held by women which is why we must protect them."
"A second set of amendments concerns accounting which, on the pretext that statistics show that women's life expectancy is longer than men's, works to the disadvantage of women when carrying out the calculation of contributions and pensions."
"Yet it is not proven that women workers live longer than men workers and, therefore, they should not be prejudiced against in this way when pensions are calculated."
"Another amendment is aimed at making it possible for women taking part in social security schemes to have access to their pension rights."
"One of the proposals which I consider to be the most important is the institution, both for men and women, of greater flexibility in the choice of pension age, in conditions which obviously still have to be defined."
"Would it not be more natural and in keeping with the lifestyles we have these days, for people to be able to choose at any time within a fixed period, for example between 60 and 70 years, whether or not to retire early or prolong their retirement age?"
"Why should someone who wants to continue working be forced to retire whereas someone who really needs to stop working much earlier has to carry on until the retirement age?"
"Finally, I should like to refer to a final amendment which has just been presented by the PPE Group and which I find very interesting and which I agree with fully."
"It applies to both sexes and means that anyone who has worked for their whole lifetime should not see their legitimate expectations dashed."
"I hope, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that these contributions, as well as those already made by the Committee on Social Affairs, will be accepted and allowed to improve the Commission's proposed text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Torres Marques on her excellent report on a technical subject which is in fact a very topical one at the moment, although it may not immediately appear to be so."
"Pension schemes are coming under pressure in various European countries, systems are being reorganized, and equal treatment for men and women is an extremely sensitive issue, especially for women."
"I would make the point first of all that Parliament and the Commission must not allow European directives to be used as an excuse for cutbacks affecting women, as already often happens with equal treatment."
"This is why I have two reservations concerning the Commission's proposal."
"Firstly, women must not be held hostage to the financial interests of the insurance companies."
"Employers' contributions for men and women are calculated differently on the basis of actuarial data, making women more expensive to employ, which is a handicap when it comes to recruitment."
"Many lawyers disagree with the Court of Justice here, Commissioner, and claim that this in itself is contrary to the Treaty."
"We therefore wish to see this discrimination abolished."
"Secondly, formal equality of treatment does not automatically guarantee that women will have equal rights in practice."
"The unequal situation of women on the labour market is often reflected even more acutely in their pension rights, and this is why they will not have truly equal rights until measures are taken in the context of the pension systems - including the supplementary systems - to compensate the low-paid and to cater for interrupted careers and part-time or atypical work in which women predominate."
"Pension calculations must gradually be brought into line and compensatory measures introduced, such as establishing the right to a decent minimum pension with a low threshold, giving even people doing part-time or atypical work decent pension rights, and introducing or ensuring the wider acceptance of equivalent qualifying periods."
"My female colleagues in the Belgian Parliament have submitted this package of demands to their government, and hope that they will be considered."
"I hope that you too, Commissioner, will be able to support our amendments at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we shall soon be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Rome. However, Article 119 of the Treaty, which provides for equal pay for men and women, is still not being properly applied."
"Because this article is directly applicable, because there are always some courageous souls brave enough to test it in the courts, and because it does not allow derogations from the sacrosanct principle of equal treatment, the provisions of any directives containing such derogations are now redundant, I am pleased to say. For the obvious reasons set out by the rapporteur, whose work I would commend, we now have to amend the 1986 directive implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes."
"On the subject of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights, I shall confine myself to the one concerning the fixing of an identical age limit for men and women."
"There should be no question of infringing the rights of the sex with the more favourable retirement age in order to ensure equal treatment."
"For once, women can claim pension rights earlier than men, but overall these are much smaller, as women have been subject to discrimination in terms of pay for decades of their working lives."
"The worst affected are those who will soon be drawing their pensions. And I know what I am talking about, since I myself am a victim of such discrimination."
"I therefore hope that Parliament will adopt the amendment in question which I have tabled on behalf of my group, and I would also thank the rapporteur for her positive comments on this just now."
"In conclusion, I should also like to take the opportunity of urging the Council to approve, at long last, the proposal from 1987 to amend the 1979 directive on equal treatment for men and women in statutory social security schemes."
"Otherwise, we are really going to find ourselves in a comical situation, whereby wage earners will continue to be discriminated against in statutory schemes as regards retirement age and survivors' pensions, while this will no longer be the case in occupational social security schemes. This is because the benefits paid through statutory social security schemes are not regarded as remuneration within the meaning of Article 119."
"In some countries, including my own, the vast majority of wage earners and self-employed people draw their pensions from statutory social security schemes, rather than occupational schemes."
"It is high time that we tried to end sexual discrimination in terms of survivors' pensions and retirement age here too."
"Moreover, it would above all be men who would benefit from the ending of such discrimination, provided women are not penalized in order to ensure equal treatment for them."
"Mr President, the aim of our work today is to guarantee greater protection for women in paid employment, in line with the treatment of men."
"It is unthinkable today that a woman working in a factory or an office should be discriminated against in terms of social security."
"It is six years since the European Court of Justice laid down that all forms of pensions must provide parity of payment between men and women."
"Today the Commission is planning to modify the regulations in force so that this principle is fully adopted and consistently updated."
"The proposed amendments, which our group will unanimously support, in fact point to the introduction of flexible pensions permitting retirement at varying ages."
"In calculating pensions, account must be taken of periods of inactivity in the life of a working woman, due to pregnancy and looking after small children."
"It is also necessary to guarantee social security for part-time workers, which is a formula for enormous opportunities to revitalize the labour market."
"Part-time is the formula which will soon offer the most job opportunities."
"Finally actuarial factors, that is the different life expectancy of men and women, must not be used in calculating social security."
"There must be an identical system for the two sexes, while recognizing the greater natural longevity of the female sex."
"In conclusion, this directive is a chapter, perhaps one of the most important, in the achievement of total equality in working conditions between men and women."
"There are still too many differences and too many punitive restrictions on the other half of the universe, women."
"We are not saying women work more or less than men. But we are saying that their work contributes equally to the functioning of society and we demand that they be treated accordingly."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group is quite happy with the Torres Marques report."
"Commissioner Flynn, you and the Commission have taken all this very lightly, and only seem to want to incorporate the case-law of the Court of Justice into the 1986 directive, without considering the adverse effects of this on female workers, which is why we feel our amendments are particularly necessary."
"I am also very disappointed with the Committee on Social Affairs, which has failed to put forward a single amendment and has simply buried its head in the sand."
"This, to me, is all the more reason to make the Committee on Women's Rights responsible for the equal treatment directives and the code of good conduct."
"The following are the points at issue here."
"First of all, the system of having the same, fixed retirement age for women and men must be changed to allow them both to choose more flexible pension arrangements."
"Secondly, as Mrs Van Lancker said, the same actuarial system must be used to calculate the employers' contributions for both women and men."
"The higher payments make women a more expensive option for the employer and thus constitute indirect discrimination."
"I also wonder whether women working outside the home still have a longer life expectancy than men."
"Should not the contributions be reduced for women who do not smoke, or for women in general, simply because there tend to be less of them in prison, using up taxpayers' money?"
"Thirdly, part-time workers must no longer be excluded, since this too represents indirect discrimination."
"Fourth, Commissioner Flynn, I hope you will support our amendments and urge the Irish presidency, as I now do the forthcoming Dutch presidency, not just to support our amendments, but also to press on with the Commission proposal from October 1987, which was intended to fill the gaps left by the first two directives."
"As we approach the twenty-first century, Parliament must do everything in its power to eliminate direct and indirect discrimination in both the statutory and the supplementary social security systems."
"The key words here must be flexibility and choice for both men and women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of this directive could represent a further step towards the achievement of equal treatment and the difficult implementation of Article 119 of the Treaty."
"The amendments tabled by Mrs Torres Marques, whom I would congratulate, principally concern the inclusion of workers with atypical or part-time contracts in occupational social security schemes."
"In view of the fact that this category of worker consists mainly of women, and that the directive to be amended concerns implementation of the principle of equal treatment, it is imperative to include such workers in these schemes, since failure to do so will clearly represent discrimination against women."
"If the amendment of the directive is restricted to rectifying the present inconsistencies between primary and secondary Community law, then we shall continue to legislate belatedly and on the basis of faits accomplis ."
"The amendment of this directive therefore offers us the opportunity to implement the principle of equal treatment with greater consistency, and I believe that we must take advantage of that opportunity."
"Commissioner Flynn, this may not be a very kind thing to say, but I have the impression that when you drafted this directive, you were thinking more of the interests of the pension funds than those of equal treatment for men and women."
"To be quite honest, I am amazed that you have not taken the opportunity offered by this amendment of the fourth directive to deal with the problem of the actuarial factors, which several people have already mentioned."
"The Court has always said that higher employers' pension contributions for women are not covered by this directive and are therefore permitted."
"This was your chance to put that right."
"Parliament, I am glad to say, has actually taken steps to do so, and I therefore sincerely hope that the Commission will take our proposals on board, because it is absolutely ridiculous that employers should have to pay higher pension contributions for women than for men."
"What is more - and I know that the Commissioner is someone who always follows the Court's judgments to the letter - when it comes to the judgments regarding retrospective action and the time from which women, and in particular part-time workers, can claim their pension rights, I have noticed that the Commission is choosing not to apply Article 119, as the Court has done this year, but instead has gone back to the Barber judgment of 1990, which means that 14 years are effectively lost for many, many women."
"I wholeheartedly support the proposal to have the same retirement age for men and women, because women find themselves in the vicious circle of being expected to care for their families because they retire early, and therefore being expected to retire early to care for their families."
"We have to put an end to this situation as soon as possible."
"I entirely agree with the idea of flexible retirement."
"Equal treatment means equal rights and obligations for women, men and pension funds."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mrs Torres Marques for a very good piece of work on a very complicated question."
"There is one area in the report which I would like to comment on in particular, namely the question of atypical jobs."
"The term 'atypical jobs' in fact covers a form of labour exploitation prevalent in the cottage industry system that preceded industrialization in the mid-eighteenth century."
"At that time, entrepreneurs placed jobs with people working in their homes, mainly women, at very low hourly rates."
"There are many examples of this type of employment today in Europe and, with the development of the information society, it is on the increase."
"It is mainly women, young people and immigrants who get caught up in this system."
"For many it is a first step into the labour market, for minimal wages and with little or no social protection."
"It is thus very necessary to take account of this form of work in the social security system and to exempt atypical jobs from any provision for company-based or occupational social security schemes."
"It represents indirect discrimination against women and young people, who thus risk becoming the cottage workers of the twentieth century."
"Mr President, the fact that we need to address ourselves to the subject of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes is in itself extremely regrettable."
"Campaigning for equal opportunities means nothing other than striving for men and women to be recognized as equals."
"All the Member States of the European Union put fine words on paper."
"In this report, the Commission too has expressed admirable intentions in the form of fine words."
"But these will do little in practice to remedy the lack of equal opportunities; that is why the Commission and the Council must listen to the fundamental demands of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"To overlook the particular contribution of women to child-rearing and their self-sacrificing attention to the social needs of dependants, whilst at the same time participating in the world of work, would be to misunderstand the concept of equal opportunities."
"For many reasons, so-called atypical contracts of employment are becoming the only way for an increasing number of women to earn a living."
"These women are especially dependent on equal treatment in social security schemes."
"The same applies to part-time workers, as we have just heard."
"I very much hope that, by adopting this report, we shall move one step closer to real and tangible equality of opportunities."
"Mr President, equality between the sexes in my opinion is, above all, equality of opportunities and equality of responsibility."
"Therefore, I should like to talk of parity rather than equality."
"This far better expresses the concept of co-existence between men and women based on a sharing of rights - e.g. access - and duties - e.g. tasks - while leaving intact the differences of outlook and practicalities which might be seen to differentiate the two sexes."
"However, nothing justifies the discriminations in legal texts such as those existing in Directive 79/007 and 86/378 which call for derogations to the principle of equal treatment."
"Article 119 of the Treaty demands that treatment between men and women be equal."
"The Court of Justice confirms this position."
"The excellent report drafted by Helena Torres Marques refers to revision of the 1986 Directive."
"This is all well and good but it is not enough."
"The IGC must amend the Treaty so that it includes the fundamental right of equality between the sexes, but yet more is needed."
"Directives are as nothing unless behind them there is the political will, in States, and social awareness, among the public."
"Unfortunately, in the case of equality this small detail is as yet lacking."
"Mr President, I really have very little time in which to speak so I will not be able to talk about the technical and legal aspects of this question but I would like to make a compliment and three tiny remarks."
"I must compliment the rapporteur on a well documented explanatory memorandum and her proposal. I would like to make some remarks to emphasize that social equality is not the same as egalitarianism, and that, in some cases, confusing the two concepts can lead to positions which fail to understand those positive derogations and discriminations which the fight against inequality in society calls for but which egalitarianism cannot accept."
"When we mention applying the principle of equality of treatment as one of the main objectives of the European Union's social policy - if such a policy existed - we ought to remember that Article 117 of the Treaty of Rome asserts the principle of equalization in progress which, for example, would prevent the retirement age for women coming up closer to that for men when it would be more favourable to bring the retirement age for men down to that of women, on the basis of arguments of egalitarianism, since in that way we will not achieve social equality and make any progress."
"Mr President, Friday this week - 20 September 1996 - will be the 90th anniversary of the day when Tsar Nicholas II signed the declaration guaranteeing Finns - both men and women - general and equal suffrage."
"Finland was the second country in the world - and the first in Europe - where women were granted the right to vote."
"At the same time, Finland became the first country in the world where women were eligible to stand for election."
"This was a step towards greater equality in the Nordic countries and Finland."
"Article 119 guarantees equal treatment of men and women in employment in the EU countries."
"A directive adopted in 1979 provided for application of the principle of equal treatment in statutory social security systems."
"Is it not high time to implement these proposals?"
"Equality between the sexes is something which we Finns take for granted, but this attitude is not universal."
"In many countries, legislation still exists which discriminates against women, for instance in the field of social security."
"The EU should now lead the way and eliminate such practices."
"The point of departure of the proposals for a directive of 1987 is the individualization of social security."
"In Finland the system has operated this way for a long time."
"A social security system based on the individual is the only humane option and the only one which promotes equality."
"It should also be extended to home workers, both men and women."
"In Finland, for example, if one takes the under-40 age group, women are now considerably better qualified than men, and many earn more than their husbands."
"Social security systems based on the family detract from the status, freedom and human dignity of the lower earning spouse, irrespective of the sex of the partner in question."
"In addition to becoming individualized, social and pension insurance schemes absolutely must be extended to parttime workers and they must be made more flexible."
"This would improve women's opportunities to lead more independent and many-sided lives because many women have to stop work completely or reduce their working hours for a longer or shorter period of time in order to bear and care for children."
"Many Member States ought to review their social legislation with a view to realizing genuine equality, and the EU should help them to do so."
"This report by Mrs Torres Marques, for which I thank her, and the proposals which it contains and which have been approved by the Committee on Women's Rights should be adopted."
"Mr President, the social security systems of the various Member States still discriminate between the sexes."
"Women are still worse off than men."
"It is very good that we have once again been able to use the Court of Justice to promote the equal treatment of men and women, but things should not be taken too far through the Court."
"We should ensure that it is not the judges who legislate, but the politicians."
"So like the rapporteur, I am somewhat disappointed that the Commission's proposal does not go any further than the case-law of the Court, and that the Commission has not taken any new initiatives and built on what the Court of Justice has started."
"We have therefore ended up in a situation where women's rights are, in some cases, being curtailed."
"This applies, amongst other things, to pensions and coverage for part-time workers."
"I hope that we can rectify this by supporting the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, and that the Commission will take note of Parliament's amendments."
"In terms of statistics, women are not those who are most supportive of the EU."
"It is our task to show women that the EU is doing something for them, and we can use this proposal to that effect."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to take the opportunity of expressing my thanks to you, Mrs Torres Marques, on your excellent report on what you rightly call a very complex and technical matter in the area of occupational pensions."
"The Commission very largely shares the concerns you have expressed in your report and in the motion for a resolution before us this afternoon."
"The principle of equal treatment between women and men is a fundamental principle of Community law."
"It is important to ensure its effectiveness and transparency in order to avoid any possible confusion on the part of national authorities at all levels called upon to apply that Community law."
"It is also essential to ensure that European citizens are fully informed of all of their rights in this particular area."
"This proposal for a directive aims to ensure that an act of secondary Community law, namely Directive 86/378, on equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes, is consistent with the provision of primary Community law, namely Article 119 of the Treaty, as interpreted by the Court of Justice."
"In its Barber judgment of 17 May 1990 and in subsequent interpreting judgments the Court of Justice of the European Communities recognizes that all forms of occupational pensions and, in turn, all forms of benefit deriving from employees' occupational social security schemes, constitute an element of pay within the meaning of Article 119 of the EC Treaty which provides for equal pay for men and women."
"Article 119 of the Treaty is directly applicable and may be relied upon by individuals before the national courts against both public and private employers."
"It does not permit any derogation from the principle of equal treatment."
"Consequently, certain provisions of Directive 86/378 providing for derogations from the principle of equal treatment, particularly with regard to retirement age and to survivors' benefits - that is Article 9 of Directive 86/378 - became invalid as far as salaried workers are concerned, since such persons can invoke Article 119 of the Treaty before national authorities."
"This article, as a provision of primary law, prevails over Directive 86/378, which is an instrument of secondary legislation, and it also prevails over any national legislation."
"I should clarify, however, that Article 119 of the Treaty does not apply to self-employed workers, in respect of whom Directive 86/378 remains wholly valid."
"In the interests of legal certainty and of clarity, and in order to ensure consistency with Article 119 of the Treaty, the Commission presented this proposal for a directive amending Directive 86/378."
"The proposed amendments serve only to transpose the case law of the Court, and this proposal for a directive is hence of a purely declaratory nature."
"I should emphasize that consistently with the declaratory nature of the proposal the Commission has intended merely to amend the provisions of Directive 86/378 which, in the light of the case law, turned out to be invalid."
"The proposal does not aim to be a complete codification of all of the Court's case law concerning equal treatment in the area of social security, nor does it aim to introduce new law going beyond the existing case law."
"It goes without saying that it would be impossible to introduce any new provisions inconsistent with the case law since this could be achieved only by a Treaty amendment."
"It is important to note that the Commission has on several occasions consulted government experts, Europeanlevel pension funds and actuary representatives, the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities and the social partners on the proposed amendments of Directive 86/378 in the light of the Barber judgment and subsequent judgments."
"There has been a broad consensus for adjusting the text of Directive 86/378 to make it consistent with the Court's case law on Article 119 of the Treaty."
"I am very sensitive to your concerns about the possible impact for women of this case law as it is reflected in the proposed amendments."
"According to this case law, in order to apply equality of treatment between women and men, the rules of occupational pension schemes could , and I emphasize could , increase women's pensionable age or, in certain cases, provide that in order to ensure equal benefits, contributions paid by the employer in certain schemes - and I am talking here about funded schemes - could be different for women as against men."
"But just allow me for a moment to remind you that we are here in an area of social protection where the autonomy of the social partners is relevant and matters such as pensionable age and the organization and financing of occupational schemes are subject to negotiations between the interested parties and, in particular, between employers and employees."
"So the Commission's room for manoeuvre is very limited - and everybody knows that - since it is obliged, like any other institution or person, to follow the case law of the Court of Justice."
"To go further than the Court's case law is not appropriate at this time because it would be impossible to obtain the necessary consensus and such a step would, in any event, go beyond the purely declaratory nature of this proposal."
"Furthermore, the Commission could not propose any measures which did not fall within the scope of Article 119 of the Treaty."
"Consequently, it is not possible to accept the amendments concerning the taking into account of actuarial factors - Amendments Nos 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 - because they go beyond the existing case law which specifically states that actuarial factors may be taken into account since their use falls outside the scope of Article 119."
"To go against the case law on this point would be to introduce new law and would, in any event, go beyond the scope of Directive 86/378."
"The reason I cannot accept the amendments concerning atypical workers - and many of the contributions refer to this, including part-time workers - is that they are unnecessary - only because the case law already specifies that discrimination against this category of workers can constitute indirect discrimination."
"Similarly, Amendments Nos 11, 12, 13 and 14 are also unnecessary because they take on board points that are already in the case law and consequently it is unnecessary to deal with them here."
"I would like to thank you for your support and commitment in the area of equality of treatment between women and men."
"We are allies in this area, but I would like to say that the acquis communautaire at the European level is very important and an example for countries outside the European Union."
"Our task is to ensure the full application and effectiveness of a fundamental principle of Community law, and this proposal on which your opinion is requested seeks in every sense to fulfil that objective."
"I would like to make a comment concerning what Mrs Lulling said because I thought it was quite relevant."
"What Mrs Lulling was asking was whether the Commission would be in favour of extending full equality to areas that are not covered in the directive."
"I would answer 'yes' to that."
"We did, if you remember, put forward a proposal in 1987, the purpose of which was to complete the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in both statutory and occupational social security matters."
"It is still on the table of the Council, Mrs Lulling, and it would be prudent at this time to consider studying the possibility of updating that 1987 proposal."
"It is my intention, as a consequence of what I have heard here regarding these matters, to do so."
"I thank the House for its attention."
"Mr President, I think there must be a misunderstanding, because Commissioner Flynn started out by congratulating Mrs Torres Marques on her excellent report and said that the Commission shared our concerns, but then I heard through my headphones - though it may have been something to do with the interpretation - that despite all the congratulations and the concern felt by the Commissioner, in the same way as everyone else here, he cannot accept our amendments because there is no consensus as to whether they are covered by the Court's case-law."
"Can the Commissioner enlighten us on this, because I can understand his concern, but not the fact that he is not prepared to do anything about it?"
"Mrs Larive, I think the Commissioner tried to explain that, but because the point does indeed leave scope for misunderstanding, it would be as well for Mr Flynn to tell us more."
"Mr President, I do not think there should be any misunderstanding about what we are saying here."
"We are proposing a tidying-up operation."
"There were some inaccuracies in the 1986 directive, vis-à-vis the case law, and this is a declaratory proposal to bring about the changes necessary to satisfy the case law as it has been enunciated."
"We are not writing in all the case law but everything is covered so far as all the case law is concerned in the recitals."
"I have gone through the amendments and have analysed what their purposes are."
"Some are unnecessary because they are already covered while others are not acceptable because they would mean changing existing law."
"We do not have the authority to do this because of the constraints of Article 119."
"For example, Amendment No 1 talks about the exclusion of part-time workers but this is unnecessary because the point is already covered."
"Recital 5 also deals with that matter."
"Similarly, all the amendments have been analysed in the light of what is possible under the existing Article 119 and whether the case law already deals with it."
"In fact, there is nothing that has not been taken on board which the amendments would entitle us to do."
"Mr President, I know that time is short, and I do not wish to take up very much more of the House's time, but this is a parliament, where people are supposed to listen to one another's arguments and discuss them."
"I noticed that there were quite a few of our arguments which Mr Flynn did not discuss, nor does he appear to see any reason for adopting any of the amendments which the Committee on Women's Rights worked so long and hard to produce."
"He says that he does not intend to amend existing legislation: why does this directive have to be amended, in that case?"
"Existing legislation is being changed in favour of the pension funds and women are losing out, and that is something Parliament refuses to accept."
"I should be very glad if the Commission started treating this House as a parliament and gave our arguments proper consideration."
"It has signally failed to do so in this debate, but I can already assure the Commissioner that before the final vote tomorrow, we shall be asking for the matter to be referred back to the committee."
"Mrs van Dijk makes certain allegations and, as she says, it is here in Parliament that we should exchange views on these matters."
"I have looked at all of these amendments in a rather positive way to take on board whatever I could, if I was permitted to do so under the terms of Article 119."
"I have looked in particular at this question of atypical work and the nature of atypical work because it is reflected in several of the amendments."
"The objective of Amendment No 5, for example, is to include atypical work."
"I am simply saying to you that the atypical nature of work is already covered insofar as atypical workers are members of the working population."
"If you think and if Parliament feels that Amendment No 5 would give some substance to what you are seeking to achieve and add something extra that is not already covered I would have no difficulty in accepting your amendment."
"But I must advise you, as Commissioner, that according to the legal advice I have received, it is an unnecessary amendment because it is already catered for."
"That is the only reason."
"I would also go one step further."
"You have made certain comments about other matters concerning some amendments and a position that you would like to see adjusted."
"It was for that reason Mr Blak's point and Mrs Lulling's point were so relevant."
"What are we talking about here?"
"We are talking about occupational pension schemes."
"We are not talking about statutory schemes."
"I was straightforward enough in my submission to state the possibilities where this could be very hurtful to women's expectations insofar as certain types of schemes are concerned."
"But Article 119 does not allow me to adjust that at this time."
"I would be quite happy to bring the points that you make to the attention of the Council and to defend them, but, although I know that the amendments as they are currently constituted have taken a lot of time to put together and I can see the thinking behind them, the matters referred to are already covered, insofar as the atypical worker is concerned and there is no need to pursue them further."
"If it is of some importance to you and you press the question about Amendment No 5 then I will take it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"Posting of workers"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0265/96) on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers carried out in the framework of the provision of services (C4-0327/96-94/0346(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr Peter)."
"Mr President, five years after the first Commission proposal was submitted, the European Parliament is at last able to deal with the common position at second reading."
"The credit for having enabled us to do so belongs primarily to the Italian presidency during the first half of 1996, as I have already remarked on other occasions."
"The purpose of the directive is to ensure that the principles of the internal market on the one hand - freedom to provide services, in this case - and of economic and social cohesion on the other are not mutually exclusive."
"With continuing labour market integration in the EU, the need for rules has become increasingly urgent."
"Competition is distorted and it is socially damaging if workers from a low-wage Community country travel to a Member State with significantly higher wages and salaries, and do the same work as local workers for less pay."
"The workers concerned receive vastly inadequate recompense for the value of their work; and local companies cannot compete with cut-price offers resulting from wage dumping."
"The same applies to the posting of workers from non-Community countries."
"The proposal for a directive rightly begins by establishing the principle of minimum rates of pay and the entitlement of posted workers to annual holidays."
"The existing legislation of the Member State concerned on safety at work and working hours must also be adhered to when workers are posted, from the very start and with no exceptions."
"The fact that the proposal for a directive now enables posted workers to apply to the court responsible for their place of work to have their conditions of pay and employment reviewed is a welcome improvement."
"Overall, the proposal for a directive has been much improved during the consultation period."
"A good example is the discussion regarding whether or not to set a compulsory threshold."
"Whereas the original intention had been to suspend completely the key provisions on minimum rates of pay and annual holidays for the first three months of a posting, a compulsory threshold is now no longer specified."
"Instead, limited exceptions to the rule are possible."
"Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity is taken into account, in that the Member States may, after consulting employers and employees, opt not to apply the provisions on minimum rates of pay for the first four weeks of a posting."
"Secondly, it appears sensible, as far as supply contracts are concerned, to grant an eight-day exemption from the provisions on pay and holidays, now that it has been made clear that this exemption does not apply to the construction work covered by Annex 1."
"And, thirdly, the provisions on minimum rates of pay and paid annual holidays may be waived if the amount of work to be carried out during the posting is insignificant."
"It is for the Member States to determine what is meant by 'insignificant' ."
"The crews of merchant navy vessels are excluded from the scope of the directive."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, for which I am rapporteur, thinks it important in this context to specify that posted workers engaged in port dredging and in assisting shipping in port fall within the scope of the directive."
"Furthermore, the committee calls on the Commission, in connection with the reporting obligation imposed on it by the directive, to pay particular attention to the means whereby posted workers are informed about the content of the directive."
"Mr President, as rapporteur I advised the committee to refrain from adopting any amendments to the common position, and the committee concurred."
"I would also ask the House to reject tomorrow the three amendments which have been tabled."
"There are at least two good reasons for doing so: firstly, in the years of deliberations on this matter, the views of the House have generally prevailed; and, secondly - and more importantly at present - any amendment could jeopardize the qualified majority in the Council."
"Surely no well-meaning person would wish to do that; after all, it is high time that the proposal became a directive, to fill out the foundations of the emerging European social union and serve as one of its cornerstones."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Helwin Peter sincerely for the detailed work he has done on this dossier over the last five years - he has helped us a very great deal."
"Commissioner Flynn gets a great many brickbats in this place, but I would like to praise his role in the successful conclusion we hope will very soon be achieved with this dossier."
"At times the flame on this particular candle was flickering fairly badly but he kept it alive until the Italian presidency came along and the Italian presidency managed to bring it forward to a point where a compromise was possible back in June."
"So congratulations to him for the valuable part he has played as well."
"This proposal on the posting of workers is a very significant proposal indeed, in its own way as important as the earlier directive on works councils."
"We therefore feel that if we are to be mature in our dealings with this proposal we should do exactly what the rapporteur has proposed, and that is adopt the common position without any amendment this week."
"In fact the common position as it now stands builds upon Parliament's first reading position in some ways."
"In relation to the threshold, for example, or the inclusion of third-country nationals, it actually goes further than Parliament's first reading position."
"So we want to see this adopted as quickly as possible."
"The best way we can help that process is to adopt the common position without amendment this week."
"This particular proposal is based on Articles 57 and 66 of the Treaty."
"It therefore relates to freedom of movement and freedom to provide services in the single market, which can be very important and positive things in the operation of the single market."
"But without the provisions of a directive like this one, they can also be very negative and very destructive."
"In Britain we have a long-running comedy show called 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet ' ."
"It tells the story of a group of construction workers from my own region, a region of high unemployment, who live in a shack on the construction site in which they are working in Germany."
"It is a funny saga of the mishaps and adventures of this group of men, who live beyond the margins of German society in the shadowy areas outside German law."
"The problem is that in real life the situation is not funny at all."
"Many thousands of people in regions like mine are being forced to live in this way and it simply is not funny."
"I am not picking on Germany here, or German employers: any combination of Member States could be chosen to make the same point."
"Back in my constituency, week in and week out, people who have fallen foul of this situation bring their problems to me and to my office."
"People who have suffered injury at work, who suddenly find that they have no legal employer, who cannot seek redress or compensation, people who are not only not paid for the work they have undertaken but find that their social security contributions have not been kept up by their supposed employer, or people who have virtually found themselves trapped, paying extortionate rents on tied accommodation controlled by their employer. Not all these problems will be solved by the posting of workers directive but it will give us a framework within which people can be protected and can exercise these freedoms: the freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services."
"Freedoms are only meaningful if they involve genuine choice."
"This directive will provide the ground rules to allow workers to exercise genuine choice in the operation of those freedoms."
"It is very much, therefore, to be welcomed."
"More than three years after the first reading and more than a year after we debated the issue, the Council has finally come up with a common position."
"I think we should congratulate everyone involved - the rapporteur, Mr Flynn, and especially the Italian presidency which did so much to bring this common position about."
"The PPE Group supports the Council's decision, because now is the time to decide on this matter."
"However, there are still a few points we should like to raise."
"We had intended to present our comments in the form of a statement attached to the directive, and Mr Peter has just mentioned these in his speech."
"They concern the crews of merchant vessels, the scope of generally binding collective agreements, and the monitoring of minimum requirements by the Member States."
"However, the Rules of Procedure make no provision for statements of this kind, which sometimes means that the House is simply gagging itself, I believe."
"But we intend to raise these points again in an oral question at a later sitting."
"The PPE Group welcomes the fact that European workers are no longer to be discriminated against in comparison with the nationals of the countries in which they are employed."
"This is something which the ETUC in particular has long been waiting for."
"The construction sector, above all, is hoping that this directive will solve a number of transfrontier problems, and it will be easier to combat social security and tax fraud by illegal contractors."
"The posting of workers directive is a fundamental aspect of the single market's social dimension, and is vital for preventing a competition war based solely on wage dumping."
"It applies the principle of lex loci laboris , which means applying the law of the country in which a worker is employed."
"The inclusion of this principle in the directive, to be applied as soon as it comes into force, means that workers will be assured of equal treatment from their very first day at work."
"Foreign workers will be entitled to the same wage as local workers - doing the same work, naturally - and this will prevent employers from bringing cheap labour in from abroad and paying them much lower wages than local workers."
"And a particular feature is that the directive also applies to workers and employers from outside the European Union who are operating here."
"The PPE Group feels that this directive is so important that it is prepared to adopt the Council's common position without amendment."
"It is actually a considerable improvement on the original Commission proposal and is very much in line with the PPE Group's proposals at first reading, which at that point went further than those of the Socialist Group, Mr Peter."
"The sooner this directive comes into force, the better."
"Mr President, it is easy to understand why maritime goods transport is being excluded from the scope of the directive."
"This is in fact a totally international market, and the application of such measures would seriously impair the competitiveness of Community vessels and oblige shipowners, even against their will, to transfer their vessels to flags of convenience."
"On the other hand, roll-on roll-off services - ferries - are an entirely different case, and we propose to retain them within the scope of the measure, through our amendment, for the following reasons."
"The first reason concerns the principle of fair competition between Community shipowners, as reaffirmed by our rapporteur."
"Let us take the example of cross-Channel services."
"The annual wage costs of a passenger vessel vary considerably, depending on whether it is a French or British vessel."
"The costs for a French vessel are FF 37 million; for an identical British vessel, they are FF 29 million."
"However, if you replace half the British crew with Asian sailors, the wage costs fall to FF 19 million."
"Where is the fair competition here, if this sum is compared to the FF 37 million?"
"I shall not dwell on the second reason, which follows on naturally from the first, since it relates to safeguarding the jobs of Community sailors."
"I should in fact prefer to spend the little time I have left in dealing with another issue: the effect of a measure such as this on safety."
"We have seen this in almost all accidents at sea, some of them with tragic consequences - the human factor is crucial, whether it is the initial cause of the accident or the handling of the crisis caused by the accident."
"On board a vessel, however modern it may be, safety is first and foremost a human matter."
"That is why the international safety management code calls for the formation of well-knit crews, whose members are properly trained to cope with emergencies and can communicate easily with one another and with the passengers."
"Experience has shown that, on a passenger vessel, it is unrealistic to think that some crew members would have no role to play in a critical situation."
"The crew as a whole must be trained in safety techniques."
"Finally, I would stress that frequent crew changes, as take place on vessels with a rapid turn-round in order to avoid the extreme fatigue resulting from the very special pace of this work, cannot be regarded as an option unless the sailors live in the immediate vicinity of the port of embarkation."
"That is why Members not voting in favour of our amendment will bear a great deal of responsibility as regards the on-board safety of passengers."
"Mr President, as several speakers have already pointed out, this proposal is a case of take it or leave it."
"In 1993, our group supported the compromise which was then on the table, and we intend to do the same with this proposal, which is why we have not put forward any amendments."
"However, I should like to draw attention to an issue which a number of colleagues have already mentioned, namely the working conditions of seamen."
"The maritime sector is in absolute chaos at the moment."
"In the ports near to where I live, it regularly happens that whole crews are given the sack or even walk out voluntarily because of the awful conditions in which they work."
"I would point out that we are experiencing a period of globalization in the world economy, when trade is on the increase, and we shall be relying more and more on maritime transport."
"This is therefore an issue that is going to have to be addressed in the world trade negotiations, in my view."
"We cannot allow chaos to rule at sea when every other sector is well regulated for workers."
"Mr President, consideration of the proposal for a Directive on posting of workers has taken an agonizingly long time."
"This state of affairs has caused suffering in many countries, as the pay of workers posted to them temporarily has considerably undercut national wage levels."
"Posting of workers has made it possible to find work on conditions, as regards pay, which may perhaps have been acceptable to workers from low-wage countries, but in my opinion were unsatisfactory even from their point of view."
"The procedure in any case merely transfers unemployment from one country to another and increases pressure for cuts in pay and social security in Member States where levels of wages and social security are high."
"This is a bad thing from everybody's point of view."
"The Council's joint position does not in all respects accord with the objectives of the European trade union movement."
"The exemptions, in particular, weaken the directive and will lead to problems of implementation."
"Article 3, which permits exemptions on the grounds that the amount of work to be done is not significant, is ill-defined."
"It could be applied very differently in different Member States."
"Bearing in mind that the first exemption already permits national decisions to be taken on the treatment of cases where the length of posting does not exceed one month, it could be asked whether this does not sufficiently cover cases where the amount of work to be done is not significant."
"Despite this criticism, the most important thing is that the Directive, defects and all, should be adopted."
"It will make it possible to establish that certain terms of employment of the country where the work is carried out should apply to workers posted from abroad, and it will also prevent dumping of labour from third countries throughout the territory of the EU."
"The general applicability of collective agreements is the cornerstone of Finland's employment contracts system; Finland bases its regulations concerning the terms of employment of foreign workers precisely on this principle, and will now be authorized by this Directive to do so."
"I should like to thank rapporteur Peter for his work and express the hope that the Council will bring this Directive into force speedily."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since this is something of a tête-à-tête, I can begin by endorsing wholeheartedly what both Mr Peter and Mr Hughes have said."
"But since I am who I am, and I am a Green, I should like to add my pennyworth."
"Firstly, there is of course the problem of the exemptions: a huge amount of case-law will be required to make this truly watertight."
"Secondly, there is the urgent matter of informing foreign posted workers about their rights; the Member States will have to do something here."
"And thirdly, there is the problem currently affecting the United Kingdom with regard to the adoption of a proper definition of posted work, because many ostensibly self-employed British men go to Germany carrying their factories with them in the form of tool-boxes. There really is still a great deal to be done here."
"It is now high time for something to happen, and that is why the common position must enter into force as quickly as possible."
"To those Members who are jeopardizing that outcome by tabling amendments, such as Mr d'Aboville, who has referred to the IMO guidelines - that is the International Maritime Organization, for his information - or by discussing European directives on maritime safety and crew levels for all vessels putting in at European ports, I would say that they might do better to cooperate with us, rather than trying to clarify these issues here and now."
"They cannot be clarified rapidly, here and now, without serious risk of jeopardizing the solution of what really is a crucial problem."
"Ultimately, the only issue at stake here is to re-establish the legal and civil - or occupational - status of posted work, which is currently being attacked and undermined from all sides."
"Shipping, with its secondary registers and the use of flags of convenience, has indeed become a test case, and I shall be full of admiration for Mr Flynn if he succeeds in achieving stability in this area."
"He would be able to take credit, once and for all, for having begun to redefine the status of posted work as an occupational category, a category with rights and with the appropriate protection. That is what we should all be striving for."
"Mr President, it is very understandable that this directive on the posting of workers has given rise to many lengthy debates."
"It has been discussed in the Social Affairs Council, where the matter has featured no less than six times on the agenda."
"It has been discussed in employers' and workers' organizations, in the Commission and in Parliament, and presumably also in broader circles in the various Member States."
"Denmark is known for several things in the EU context, including the fact that in Denmark, there are clear boundaries as to what is the subject of agreements between the parties in the labour market and what is actually a matter for legislation."
"There is a concern on the part of some employers and workers in Denmark as regards directives in general and this directive in particular, namely that the directive will undermine the right to conclude agreements in Denmark."
"The fact is that every time an EU directive has to be implemented, something is lost from the right to free negotiation, since implementation is never 100 % via the negotiating route."
"The rest takes place by legislation."
"In Denmark, people in the construction sector in particular are extremely sceptical about the directive."
"However, it appears that the Council has made some reservations on this point in its decision."
"But how do things look in the other sectors?"
"The directive has not allowed for the problems which, in our view, may arise there."
"In the actual report by Mr Peter, it is said that a compulsory threshold is no longer specified, and then a number of provisos are mentioned."
"For example, in point 1 of the explanatory statement, it is said that: ' If the period for which a worker is posted does not exceed one month, the Member States may, after consulting employers and employees and in accordance with their usual procedures and practices, opt not to apply the provisions on minimum rates of pay.'"
"We then have to ask the question: is this not another way of saying that there is still a threshold of up to one month?"
"And we would also emphasize that the role envisaged for the State in this scenario is an encroachment on the right of free negotiation between the two parties in Denmark."
"It is further stated in point 3: ' The provisions on minimum paid annual holidays and minimum rates of pay may generally be waived if the amount of work is insignificant.'"
"When the FTF in Denmark - the union of officials and civil servants - also declares in this context that it sees the right to take industrial action as being threatened by this directive on the posting of workers, we must entirely agree with them."
"The directive is a real threat."
"We see this directive as another aspect of further harmonization in the area of agreements and in the labour market sector, and on those grounds we have to dissociate ourselves from this report."
"It is absolutely essential to regulate in particular the general financial conditions governing the posting of workers carried out in the framework of the provision of services in another Member State, so as to prevent wage dumping, which has already started to occur in the Community."
"Because of the serious undercutting of national wages, an unnaturally small supply of employment is available on the labour market in certain regions, particularly in the construction industry."
"Moreover, there are considerable distortions of competition between individual firms."
"This Council directive seeks to combat wage dumping and reduce distortion of competition in respect of the freedom to provide services, in order to create a level playing-field for all serviceproviders."
"The provision in the directive whereby a Member State can decide whether or not to apply the measures for a onemonth period is therefore an important one."
"A Member State must indeed be free to decide whether to introduce such a measure without any transitional period, as soon as the service-provider begins work, or whether to wait for a month at most."
"It is important for Member States to have such discretion, because the posting of workers from high-wage countries to low-wage countries, especially on short assignments, does not require any additional red tape; but in the reverse situation, when workers from low-wage countries are posted to high-wage countries, immediate application of the directive will protect local service-providers and shield businesses from distortions of competition."
"We need to recognize, however, that this posting directive is only one step forward in the campaign against distortions of competition and to increase the competitiveness of firms, and hence job security."
"It is equally important to make working time more flexible and to provide some much-needed tax relief on labour costs, particularly in high-wage countries, which will enable firms to become more competitive."
"Mr President, previous speakers have mentioned the amount of time it took for the Council to arrive at a common position on the so-called posting directive."
"To my mind, this lengthy decision-making period in the Council is just another sign that social legislation is shelved for as long as possible, if not completely blocked or killed off, in the institution of the Union which represents the national governments."
"Mr Peter, the rapporteur, states in his report that Parliament's will has largely prevailed in the course of the deliberations on the amended Commission proposal and the common position."
"That is significant."
"In the social arena above all, we, the European Parliament, represent the driving force within the Union."
"Mr Peter's excellent report is the best example of this: it does not provide the Council with any pretext for delaying further still the entry into force of the directive."
"I hope that the entry into force of the posting directive will send out a clear social message, and that the people of the Union will pay heed to it."
"I also hope that the directive will help the much-trumpeted European social union to regain some degree of credibility."
"At this point, I should like deal at slightly greater length with the problem which in fact made it necessary to draw up and introduce a posting directive."
"The livelihoods of workers in countries with high wage levels and high social standards, which are costly to maintain, are being threatened by workers from countries with low wages and social standards, especially in the construction sector, which is labour-intensive and depends heavily on the general economic situation."
"We therefore need to make sure that, as a matter of principle, the same wage is paid for the same work in the same place, and if possible as from day one."
"The critics of such legislation repeatedly object that it impinges on one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market, namely the freedom of movement of persons."
"That may be true, but let me make one thing perfectly clear: this directive is a much-needed legal instrument to correct certain extremely negative effects of free competition."
"It should protect workers in the host country, whilst at the same time ensuring that workers from low-wage countries do not have to work for peanuts abroad, so to speak."
"And I am sure that implementation of the posting directive will not destroy the competitive advantage which workers in countries with low wages have on the free market."
"After all, the present version of the directive does not go as far as that; it provides for exemptions in this area."
"It is now up to the individual Member States to push through implementation of this directive."
"I agree with the rapporteur that its impact in practice will depend largely on the effectiveness of national monitoring instruments."
"It is up to the Commission to keep a sharp eye on the Member States during the implementation process, and I hope that the report to be submitted to this House by the Commission a few years from now will state that wage dumping no longer represents a problem, particularly in sensitive sectors of the labour market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the posting of workers carried out in the framework of the provision of services is one that is urgently needed."
"The 'shareholder value' principle is very fashionable nowadays, and is put before human dignity on the spurious grounds that freedom of movement for workers should not be restricted, or on some other such grounds."
"I should just like to describe the circumstances of workers who come to Germany from the United Kingdom, Portugal or the countries of Eastern Europe."
"They earn between DM 5 and DM 8 per hour, and live in shacks or porta cabins in very cramped conditions."
"Since they cannot afford to eat in restaurants, they live on bread and sausage, just so that they have some money left to take home to their families."
"What about their human dignity, I ask myself?"
"In my view, workers within and outside the EU must at last be placed on an equal footing."
"What is more, no one mentions the fact that these practices distort competition."
"Certain EU countries have already introduced excellent counter-measures; others are filling their coffers because they have not yet passed any such legislation."
"To my mind, the Commission must prevent such distortions of competition; that is its job."
"At the same time, it would be clamping down on economic crime and the social abuses connected with these practices."
"I believe that this directive will brook no delay."
"I therefore agree with Mr Peter that neither positive nor negative amendments should be accepted."
"We shall reject them all, because we should not hold up the directive any longer and give the Council an opportunity to stall things once again."
"I am most grateful to my colleague Mr Peter and to the Commissioner for having set the ball rolling."
"I would just say a further word about media interest."
"If we had been discussing the European limited company, there would have been several television crews in the gallery."
"Unfortunately, when this subject is under discussion, they are not here!"
"Mr President, the proposal seeks to coordinate the legislations of the Member States with the aim of creating imperative rules which must be respected by companies which transfer their workers to another Member State of the Union."
"Certainly such harmonization, which by definition goes beyond the territorial competence of the Member States, implies particular attention on the part of the Union itself."
"These standards of protection must obviate that legal insecurity which accompanies the phenomena of transfer and respond to the demands of the workers. They must, in addition, cover conditions of fair competition."
"We underline the fact that the directive is not intended to harmonize the material rules of the Member States, relating to the right to work and the conditions in which it is expressed, but it is intended to coordinate the regulations appropriate to determine a list of priorities."
"We are of the opinion that the Union must put into operation a Community instrument which governs all the issues."
"The directive, finally, deals with the status of the workers and with the tendency to sub-contract which is based on the principle of making to demand the work from non-national firms."
"We trust that the Commission will effectively safeguard the industries of the south, so as to preserve their principles of concurrence and exercise it guaranteeing the relative social rights to the workers."
"We attribute, finally, great importance to the planned duty of information and cooperation between the states, an obligation which should also be extended to the Member States which did not approve this common position in the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive - which has, incidentally, been rejected in the Council by the UK and Portugal - is based on the twin assumptions that the construction industry in the so-called high-wage countries is in need of protection, and that the posting there of workers from so-called low-wage countries constitutes wage and social dumping, which results in unfair competition."
"The main cause of the wage and social dumping which is evident in some of the so-called high-wage countries is in fact the alarming rise in illegal terms of employment."
"The response of this proposed posting directive is to render the legal posting of workers from low-wage countries in high-wage countries uneconomic, by increasing rates of pay."
"Restricting legal posting in this way would therefore not make the slightest contribution to combatting the main evil, namely illegal employment."
"The adoption of contractual or national minimum rates of pay not only serves to eliminate the wage-cost benefits of posting workers from low-wage countries in high-wage countries; more significantly, it also becomes impossible, or at least much more difficult, for posted workers to find employment in host countries which have higher wage levels."
"However, Article 48 of the EC Treaty, in conjunction with Article 7a, second paragraph, of the Treaty, secures the freedom of workers to obtain employment on their own terms in any Member State."
"This right of free movement is a cornerstone of the completion of the internal market, and it applies even to posted workers working in another country under the terms of employment of their home country."
"This right would in practice become virtually impossible to exercise if the proposed posting directive came into effect."
"To impede or complicate the exercising of this right would unacceptably undermine the right to freedom of movement."
"Unilaterally excluding wage costs as a factor of competition would suppress competition to the detriment of foreign service-providers in the construction industry, thereby infringing one of the fundamental principles of the European internal market."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Peter for his excellent report."
"Also to thank Parliament for its generous response to what we have been seeking to do in so far as the final adoption of this proposal is concerned."
"There is very strong support here in the House for the common position adopted by the Council on 3 June on the proposal for a directive on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services."
"Indeed, Mr Konrad, I think it was your thought that was behind us all, in seeking finally to put this to bed."
"That was the question about protecting freedom of movement as a fundamental right and pillar of the European Union and also, as Mr Peter said, to prevent wage dumping, social dumping and all classes of dumping."
"I would certainly like to thank Mr Hughes and his colleagues, who set out the value added of this particular proposal and I also think it is appropriate to say thank you to the President-in-Office at the time, Mr Treu, who worked very hard to convince the rest of his colleagues that the final compromise should be put in place."
"In approving this particular common position you will of course be opening up the door to a very rapid definitive adoption of the directive."
"I would also congratulate you on the improvements that you have made to the original proposal for the directive, throughout the adoption procedure."
"One of the Members said it was discussed at six social affairs Council meetings; I think I counted nearly eight where this was being talked about."
"As the Commission pointed out in its recent communication to Parliament, the common position now contains a number of important features which reflect the amendments that were proposed by Parliament in February 1993."
"In this very complex field of rules governing conflicts of laws applicable to employment contracts, we have managed to arrive at a text which is both realistic and maintains an essential balance between economic freedoms and the rights of workers."
"In the light of all that, the Commission cannot accept the amendments before us today whose content is likely to jeopardize what we think is a very hard won balance."
"There was reference to the question of ro-ro services, by Mr d'Aboville in particular."
"I have to say that roll-on/roll-off services do not involve posting within the meaning of this particular directive."
"It is not an appropriate instrument for dealing with any problems arising in that connection and we cannot accept that amendment on that account."
"I would like to say to Mr d'Aboville that ro-ro vessels transport goods and passengers from one Member State to another, without any transfer of the vessels' operating base to another Member State, and on completion of operations the ro-ro vessels return to their operating base."
"In such a case workers are not posted within the meaning of the directive and, moreover, the law of flag generally applies to ro-ro vessels."
"The posting of workers from a vessel flying the flag of one Member State to a vessel flying the flag of another Member State is very rare indeed, so we cannot accept that particular amendment."
"Mr Wolf made a very important point about how difficult it might be to transpose this particular directive to national law and I think he has a fair point, but we do have a responsibility that Community law be applied effectively and efficiently."
"I would like to say to Mr Wolf and the House that we will be watching the transposition of this particular piece of legislation very carefully, because its application will reflect the transnational nature of the provisions."
"I can assure him the Commission is going to go through the provisions as applied in the Member States with quite a fine tooth-comb and also the action taken in the event of failure to comply with the directive."
"Similarly, the Commission will also be vigilant in checking the steps taken by the Member States to make the information referred to in Article 4 generally available."
"We have done this on a number of occasions in the past, quite successfully."
"In addition, the Commission is prepared to help out the Member States in seeking the appropriate means for facilitating the application of the directive."
"Finally, I would like to thank all of those who have been very generous in their praise of the Commissioner and of the Council in finally putting to bed this very important piece of legislation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Reduction in working hours"
"The next item is the report (A4-0207/96) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on a reduction in working hours."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five minutes is scarcely enough time to consider ways of solving the problem of unemployment!"
"I shall refrain from criticizing our procedures here, because I know the reasons for them, but we must admit that they sometimes verge on the ridiculous."
"Anyway, let us begin."
"The motion for a resolution before the House today for the debate and tomorrow for the vote has only one purpose: to ask the Commission to study in depth, using all the modern econometric and computer-based methods, the feasibility and effectiveness of a new policy of social taxation designed to promote a marked reduction in working time so as to reduce unemployment substantially."
"This report is the product of 18 months of work and debate in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"What is at issue here?"
"Mass unemployment is devastating Europe."
"There is no reason to believe that it will decline substantially in the years ahead: the technological revolution is still destroying huge numbers of jobs, and the latest version of it, the 'information' revolution, is only just starting to have what everyone knows will be a disastrous effect."
"The services sector long ago stopped absorbing surplus labour from industry and agriculture."
"Our governments - including the one I once had the honour of heading - have tried everything, through a vast array of measures, each more costly than the last, which have done little to change the huge and formidable scale of the problem."
"But one approach has not been explored in sufficient depth: that of markedly reducing working time."
"This is what we are saying and proposing in the report."
"Is this approach an effective one in terms of job creation?"
"It is open to question."
"There is no certainty, but the issue merits further study."
"That is what we are proposing to ask of the Commission."
"Such a process is far too complex to be imposed by law all of a sudden and across the board; it can only result from negotiations at company level."
"The problem for the authorities is how to provide strong encouragement without taking the place of the social partners."
"The idea of reducing working hours will only catch on if it proves popular, and it will not prove popular unless wages remain broadly unchanged."
"Is this possible?"
"Certainly not if the bill has to be met by businesses, which are subject to such fierce competition that this process will be acceptable to them only if unit production costs remain steady and social charges do not rise."
"By the same token, all the governments are running budget deficits and cannot tolerate any increase in them."
"The only financial reservation concerns the fact that the EU Member States spend roughly 4.5 % of GDP, or a total for the Union of ECU 350 billion, on unemployment benefits."
"At the request of the PPE Group, I have agreed not to mention this enormous sum in the text of the resolution, because assessments vary; but I would ask you to note its size."
"This spending serves to support the unemployed, but does not create one single job."
"If unemployment were to plummet, this expenditure would fall as well."
"The money saved could be made available to firms to allow them to compensate - to the tune of 85 % or 95 %, as determined by negotiation - for any loss of earnings."
"The new idea to be studied would be to alter social security contributions, and perhaps on occasion - for instance in the United Kingdom and Denmark - company taxation: these charges could be drastically cut by almost a half for a working week of less than 32 hours, and more than doubled for one of over 32 hours."
"The calculation would have to be such that a company which neither changed its workforce nor its working hours would pay the same social charges - we are not in the business of increasing deficits - but a company which did significantly reduce working time would make substantial savings on its social costs. These funds could be used to compensate for loss of earnings, enabling the company not only to maintain the number of their employees, but also and above all to recruit new ones, thereby cutting the expenditure of the public authorities and social security institutions."
"Calculations have revealed that we could expect several million jobs to be created swiftly in the Union."
"There are no equally effective measures on the drawing-board anywhere else at present."
"It is our hope that a large majority in the House will endorse what is not European legislation, but a request for an idea to be studied."
"That is why we have agreed, at the request of the PPE and Liberal Groups, to change the title of the text from 'Resolution on a reduction in working hours' to 'Resolution on a reduction and adaptation of working hours' ."
"We have also accepted a series of amendments."
"You will see these in the text tomorrow; I have no time to describe them now."
"Also, to avoid controversy, we have agreed not to refer to the huge volume of financial transactions involving unemployment benefits, which could be reduced."
"In return, I have asked the Liberal Group - successfully, I believe - to withdraw its accompanying request for the Commission to carry out a study of the effectiveness of subsidized employment, since we are dealing here not with subsidized employment, but with a policy of redistributing social security contributions, which is by no means the same thing."
"Let us not confuse matters."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the House would bring much credit upon itself by submitting not only to the Commission, but also to public opinion at large, a sound and innovative idea which just might be effective at long last in combatting unemployment."
"Mr President, first I should like to thank Mr Rocard and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment for what is a very interesting and stimulating report."
"Although, following the Essen Summit, governments have been instituting concerted policies on growth, training, labour market flexibility and social security reform, we have not given enough attention to the issue of working time and what contribution it can make to tackling our unemployment problem."
"This is a theme which follows on from the White Paper presented by President Delors."
"In Europe 18 million people are out of work while others work excessively long hours and it is incumbent on the Commission and Member States to examine closely and carefully what contribution the reduction in working time can make to solving the unemployment crisis."
"At the same time we must acknowledge that it is not a panacea for solving unemployment."
"It is not a substitute for economic growth."
"It is not a substitute for regenerating areas hard-hit by long-term unemployment and bringing the long-term unemployed back into the economic mainstream."
"However, it has a contribution to make and a contribution we must study."
"In Ireland we have looked at what potential contribution can come from reductions in working time."
"Our studies would suggest an extra 1 % employed - not trivial but certainly not an overall solution to the problem."
"One of the reasons why working time has not been that high on the menu of suggestions has been because the issues it raises are so complex."
"Those of us who are in the process of transposing the working time directive which came in for health and safety reasons know what difficulties we have experienced from both sides: from workers who are earning a lot of overtime and do not want to see that cut and from employers who are paying very low wages and expect to see their costs rise if they cannot subsidize wages by offering generous overtime hours to their workers."
"So, it is not easy to reduce working time."
"As I have said, those of us who are in the throes of doing that in order to meet the deadline of 23 November for the working time directive are already experiencing the flak."
"There are already a number of things in train which are addressing some of these issues."
"First, the transposition of the working time directive, although primarily conceived as a health and safety measure, will have an impact on reducing working hours and reducing excessive overtime."
"Secondly, the opening of negotiations by the social partners under the social protocol on part-time work is opening up possibilities in that area."
"It is important to acknowledge the difficulties and the issues involved."
"Unless we have an honest examination we are not really making progress."
"First, when we talk about sharing working time, we are fundamentally talking about sharing the income that work brings, whether it is shared through people voluntarily taking lower wages, through voluntary early retirement, through work-sharing options, through more family-friendly work arrangements, more part-time work, or whether through sharing that income through the redistribution of social security contributions which is a centre point of Mr Rocard's report."
"We must face up to the fact that we are talking about a redistribution of income and face what that involves."
"In examining the potential for social security savings to fund reductions in working time without loss of pay to those currently in work, we need to acknowledge the deadweight problem."
"In my own country about 3 % of the workforce leave employment or take up jobs every month so massive movements are already taking place with people moving in and out of work and with people already adjusting their working hours."
"If we have to pay for what is already happening there are additional costs over and above the marginal cost of paying for the extras - the extra movement in working time that we may liberate as a result of implementing some of these proposals."
"In undertaking an honest examination of what the report proposes, we need to look at the kind of arguments that will be challenged."
"First, saying why is Europe producing its working time directive at a time when our competitors are working around the clock."
"Is that going to damage our competitiveness?"
"That is an issue which needs to be faced up to honestly."
"We need to ask if this will lead to less flexibility in the labour market at a time when our competitors outside Europe are displaying total flexibility."
"We want flexibility married with social protection but we do not want to lose competitiveness."
"That is an issue we must face up to as well."
"We must also look at the effect of the proposal on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Knocking off three or four hours a week in a company employing two, three or four people is not necessarily going to create an extra job."
"It may lead to more productivity within the enterprise or the change in cost being absorbed in terms of lower production."
"In larger enterprises it is easier to see how reductions in working time - for example by changing a fourshift pattern to a five-shift pattern - may generate additional jobs."
"But we need to look at the practicalities of what is proposed."
"The overall thrust of the report, namely that we have to look imaginatively at the issue of working time, is very welcome."
"In the fight against unemployment no solution, whatever the problems - and I have sketched out some of the potential difficulties - can simply be brushed aside."
"We need to study fully what is involved and see what contribution, be it large or small, can be made by changes in this area."
"Finally, our model of the working week has been formed on the Victorian tradition of the man going out to work and the woman staying home, minding the children, washing her husband's socks and putting a meal on the table."
"We have moved to a very different era of work where a majority of women in the Community are out at work, where there are many men and women with family responsibilities, be it young children, elderly parents or a disabled family member."
"We need to look at different ways of working time that reflect the human needs of the individual."
"If, through development of more family-friendly, human-friendly work settings, we can also generate extra work time which we can allocate to our unemployed, we will be doing two jobs and not simply one job."
"In Ireland at the moment we are developing a set of proposals on work-sharing which I hope to be putting to the government in the next few weeks."
"We do not see them as solving our unemployment problem but we see them as making a contribution that none of us can afford to overlook."
"In conclusion, I welcome the Rocard report."
"It stimulates a great deal of thought."
"I do not think it will be simply a matter of straightforward implementation of the proposals."
"There is a lot of work and a lot of study to be done and a lot of negative criticism out there to be overcome."
"But if we have courage and imagination the Council, Commission and Parliament can together explore what contribution reductions in working time can make to solving Europe's largest problem and a problem we have made central to the Irish presidency - the problem of unemployment."
"Mr President, the fair distribution of work is an important objective for my group."
"It is entirely unacceptable that in a society where work is held up as such an ideal, at least 18 million people - but more likely more than 30 million - are out of work against their will."
"Of course, as the President-in-Office has already said, reducing working hours is not the only way to solve unemployment, and the creation of new jobs is at least as important."
"But the information society on which so many people have pinned their hopes can at best be expected to create jobs in the long term, and will actually destroy many before then."
"We all know that economic growth will not help all the unemployed, and the civil service and the fourth sector, which are both big employers, are cutting back as part of the efforts to meet the criteria for EMU."
"In the short term, therefore, the reduction of working hours and a crackdown on overtime are important measures."
"The number of hours of overtime worked in the Union as a whole is now the equivalent of 3 to 4 million jobs, so the solution proposed by Klaus Zwickel, the leader of the German metalworkers' union, and others to pay for overtime with time off makes good sense."
"People often worry about productivity with higher wage costs, but research in my country, where as you know, reduced working hours and part-time work are fairly common, shows that the effects of shorter working hours on productivity are much more positive than is frequently thought."
"It indicates that people working shorter hours are often more productive, and what they produce is of better quality; they manage their time better; they are better at setting priorities and take a fresher approach to tasks; they are more motivated and, last but not least, they take less time off sick."
"All these factors naturally have a very positive effect on productivity and costs."
"In the collective bargaining where decisions are taken on reducing working hours in my country, the workers agree to 'pay' for shorter working hours with moderate wage claims and greater flexibility over a number of years."
"It is unfortunate that some groups in the European Parliament are trying to equate shorter working hours with flexibility and/or the reorganization of working time."
"This is being extremely unfair to the Rocard report."
"Unlike those who dogmatically insist that flexibility and reorganization represent the only solutions, Mr Rocard is offering a combination of strategies which could encourage both workers and employers to adopt shorter working hours."
"Those who set great store by market mechanisms in particular must find the proposal to differentiate social contributions attractive, together with the financial incentives for employers designed to promote job-creation."
"These seem to me to be entirely in keeping with the market."
"Those who oppose such ideas are simply afraid of what the outcome of this study might be."
"This may protect your dogmas, but as politicians you are simply abdicating your responsibility to do everything in your power to combat unemployment."
"Mr President, combatting unemployment is the top priority for the Union."
"We must find new ways of tackling this major political and social challenge, but we have to ensure that our ideas are practicable."
"Mr Rocard addresses himself in this own-initiative report to the reduction of working hours."
"He notes with some surprise that this topic has hardly been discussed until now, and presumes that it is too daunting."
"He is mistaken!"
"Many attempts to reduce working time and recruit new staff have proved impossible to put into practice."
"The Volkswagen model of a four-day week is not universally valid, neither in the automobile industry nor in other sectors."
"Work-sharing is a defensive strategy; to defeat unemployment we need new, competitive jobs."
"We need an overall political context which will promote growth and create the right climate for investment and innovation."
"Only a competitive economy can provide scope for flexible changes in working time."
"All of this is missing from the Rocard report."
"Very few countries would be able to carry out the proposal that the funds saved on unemployment benefits should be redistributed by the authorities to compensate for loss of earnings."
"If the consequence of this is dirigisme , it is quite irreconcilable with our view of industrial relations."
"We believe that working hours should be determined by collective agreements, geared to a company's needs and work processes, and negotiated by the two sides of industry."
"Our doubts as to the accuracy of the tidy sum estimated by Mr Rocard at ECU 350 billion have not been allayed."
"These funds are not a financial reserve which can be disposed of at will."
"Instead, the task of the Member States must be to cut back on unnecessary expenditure, in order to curb national debt and achieve stability."
"The idea that it is hard to increase productivity in the public sector is provocative and untrue."
"As PPE Group members of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, we have managed to give the Rocard report a facelift."
"Moreover, the rapporteur has accepted nearly all the amendments submitted by our group under the heading of 'the adaptation of working hours' ."
"By doing so, he has departed from the initial idea of a Commission study looking solely at reduced working time."
"The original version provided for a recommendation which already set out the conditions for cutting working hours: in other words, the analysis was to have been performed, but its outcome was a foregone conclusion for the rapporteur - that is how an expensive study can turn into a cheap farce."
"The attitude of the Group of the European People's Party is unequivocal: we are in favour of a sensible, flexible adaptation of working time."
"We favour more voluntary part-time work, geared to company requirements and employment patterns."
"We also favour a smooth transition to retirement and part-time work for older workers."
"All of this must be included in the Commission study."
"Mr President, before I start I should like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Fitzgerald, to the House."
"She is a lady who I have worked a lot with in the past on the National Economic and Social Forum and whose opinion I have great respect for and whose guidance I would take on many occasions."
"Also at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Rocard on his tenacity and persistence in getting this report through despite, at times, virulent opposition from certain groups, with myself most virulent and opposed."
"It was Thomas Moore who described the land of hope as Utopia."
"That is what we are dealing with here today."
"We are dealing with an ideal that we would all love to see: a shorter working week, more money, less taxation, more leisure time."
"But the reality is something different."
"The reality is that unless we are competitive, that unless we allow our businesses and enterprises to prosper, to grow and to compete on the world market we are ultimately doomed to fail; not only in the sense of protecting existing jobs but also in ensuring that we try to find new forms of work for the long-term unemployed."
"Even here in the debate today there has been a divergence of opinion as regards how many unemployed we actually have in Europe. Mr Rocard said over 20 million."
"Mr van Velzen - maybe the interpretation got it wrong so I apologize if that is the case - said 30 million. The Minister and President-in-Office of the Council said 18 million."
"There is a huge divergence of opinion just on that point alone. If we are talking about implementing new forms of work and working time, we must surely know what we are trying to achieve and the basis that we are starting from."
"In the report that has been presented there is no impact assessment, not even in respect of what the Commission describes as the engine for economic and employment generation in the Union: the SMEs."
"Furthermore, it mistakenly assumes that international studies have said that a reduction in working hours will help to increase employment."
"Yet when we look at the most recent OECD report, it says that a reduction in working time will not increase employment."
"As well as that we are putting people on the scrap-heap early."
"There is a new ageism forcing people to retire early so that wealth of knowledge and experience will be lost to us."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Rocard has succeeded in getting us all to work hard both in the Committee on Social Affairs and in our groups, and I can assure him and other honourable Members that the debate is still continuing, in my group at least."
"I can also assure him that I shall be urging everyone to give the report a chance, but not because I think it is the answer to all our problems, far from it."
"However, I firmly believe that we have a political responsibility to combat unemployment in Europe by every means possible."
"The Rocard report contains an interesting idea that there should be tax and social security incentives based on the number of hours people wish to work, and this is what I think should be given a chance."
"I am not entirely convinced that it is a solution."
"Mr Rocard painted me as an opponent of his ideas in the Committee on Social Affairs, and I said on a number of occasions that I believed a reduction in working hours had many disadvantages as well."
"In my country, which is the same as Mr van Velzen's, there have also been cases where workers gave up some of their working hours and some of their pay, but no new jobs ever came out of it."
"I myself have experienced this in the past, so I am not just talking hypothetically."
"It also works much better in larger companies where it is easier to organize, whereas its advantages for smaller firms are much less obvious."
"I was also the one in the Committee on Social Affairs who called for work to be organized differently in the context of reduced working hours."
"As I see it, working hours should not just be reduced per week, but over the course of a year or even one's whole working life, and we must be far more flexible in how we organize work in relation to the means of production, the premises and the weekly distribution of working patterns."
"Mr Rocard was generous enough - and I was most impressed by this - to take our arguments in the Committee on Social Affairs on board and to accept a large number of our amendments."
"There will, of course, be people who say he should withdraw his report, but I do not agree."
"I think that Mr Rocard is someone who is prepared to listen to his colleagues and to give interesting ideas his consideration, and this is precisely what I would call on the Commission to do."
"I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for giving this problem a great deal of thought and raising a number of points such as SMEs which need to be looked at more closely."
"I shall be commending this report to my group, and while I cannot be entirely sure of success, I still think that many of my colleagues will vote to give the report a chance."
"Mr President, the 6 + 6 model has been experimented with in Finnish industry, and it has yielded many benefits."
"The operating times of machinery have been extended, and workers remain more alert, in addition to which it has become easier to combine employment with family life and leisure."
"All this has also become apparent from the reduction in sick leave and absences from work."
"Thanks to increased productivity, it was found possible to continue to pay the same wages to workers in these experiments, despite the reduction in working hours."
"So this is quite possible, thanks to rises in productivity."
"The majority of our Group, who are from Southern Europe, understandably consider that pay cuts cannot be accepted in any circumstances."
"It is difficult to attain in public services all the benefits to which I have referred, which were achieved in the private sector."
"Negotiations in many work-places in Finland have been difficult, and agreement has not been reached in all of them, as workers have opposed it."
"I therefore myself consider it essential to earmark economic resources particularly for experiments in reducing working time and altering the allocation of work in the public sector, to enable any pay cuts to be compensated - ideally, 100 %."
"Cuts in unemployment will permit significant savings in public expenditure."
"Employment initiatives should also be promoted, not only by means of subsidies but also by revising the principles concerning the levying of social security contributions."
"The model proposed in the report whereby social security contributions would be graduated according to the length of the working day is a good one."
"Now practical examples are needed, and must be publicized."
"The most important contribution made by this report is that it requires the Commission to collate the findings of the experiments carried out in the various countries and to encourage the Member States and the two sides of industry to negotiate the introduction of new experiments."
"This is a very important initiative, and I should like to thank Mr Rocard for his good work."
"Mr President, the Greens greatly welcome this initiative and the report's view of working hours reductions as an important contribution to bringing down unemployment."
"Perhaps it has even paved the way for a completely new approach to the deployment our common resources, i.e. public funds."
"Perhaps they can be used to compensate for loss of earnings."
"We would of course have preferred a report which had not been so watered down by the more conservative forces in the European Parliament; we would rather have kept the more forthright formulations of situations and proposals that Mr Rocard started out with."
"We should have no illusions that high unemployment also means wider divisions in society and that this in turn leads to greater conflicts and provides fertile ground for violence, racism and democratic breakdown."
"It would therefore have demeaned us not to come up with something."
"What we have before us is, so to speak, the best that could have come out of this situation."
"The starting point of the Greens has always been that working hours reductions are beneficial for many different reasons."
"Obviously because we must share jobs and bring down unemployment, but also because they lead to greater equality of opportunity, greater fairness, and an increased quality of life."
"They also offer possibilities of building up functioning social networks which, in their turn, create security and freedom."
"A range of other measures are of course also needed in order to create more jobs and a sustainable recycling society."
"I am thinking here, for example, of the 'green' taxation option and investment in new energy and transport systems."
"These measures have not been given so much coverage, but they would also really create many, many hundreds of thousands of jobs."
"An amendment has been tabled to the effect that the word 'adjustment' of working hours should be introduced into the title."
"It is a word that can be interpreted in many different ways and perhaps misunderstood."
"I therefore think that 'adjustment' or 'flexibility' should not come to mean that social or labour law rules are invalidated."
"On the other hand, the parties involved in the labour market, i.e. employees, employers and the state, must give and take in a common endeavour to ensure that a substantial reduction in working hours can be achieved."
"Mr President, the Council and the Commission have really taken a terribly long time over this issue of a reduction in working hours."
"There were supposed to be other priorities which prevented them from dealing with it."
"There was the Maastricht 3 % rule, which meant an automatic block on social issues."
"There were continual complaints from employers about the excessively high social contributions, and the reduction in our competitive capacity."
"There was the growing phenomenon of industrial migration to the countries of Central Europe and South-East Asia."
"There was also - let us be frank - an ideological stalemate between the progressively-minded and the conservative."
"So this debate is a welcome opportunity, and not before time, to give imagination and creativity another chance."
"Three years ago, we organized a conference on reducing working hours with our party in Flanders."
"At that time, it was regarded as unrealistic and dismissed as impossible."
"Now the debate has moved to the appropriate forum for such issues: the European Parliament."
"Let us be clear about one thing: a reduction in working hours is not a miracle solution to unemployment."
"A number of different approaches are needed, and reducing working hours is just one of them, but what we are trying to do above all is to introduce a new moral dimension."
"A reduction in working hours cannot simply be applied across the board, but must be decided on through negotiations in each sector or even each firm, so that account can be taken of local conditions and the competitive position of the sector or firm in question."
"There are a number of amendments to this report which talk about a reduction in working hours without loss of earnings."
"This seems like a nice idea, but - let us be honest - it is rather unrealistic."
"My group will therefore not be supporting these amendments."
"In our view, the rapporteur is right to adopt a different approach in proposing that some of the ECU 350 billion currently paid out in unemployment benefits should be used to compensate for loss of earnings."
"The Christian-Democratic group has tabled a series of amendments seeking to have the phrase 'reduction in working hours' removed from the report and replaced, euphemistically, by 'adaptation of working hours' ."
"This, as I see it, violates earlier agreements."
"I would point out that in the Coates report produced by the ad hoc committee on employment, we agreed not to spend too much time on the issue of reducing working hours because the Rocard report was in the pipeline."
"Now it is here."
"It is a report which calls for a great deal of very necessary research, which we should start on as soon as possible."
"We are standing at a turning-point in history, in my opinion."
"Basically, this is a debate on the kind of quality of life and new social developments that we, as politicians, would like to see."
"That is what this debate is really all about."
"Mr President, unemployment is the key problem, as it says in Mr Rocard's report."
"I think we can all entirely agree on that, but the question is, who is going to do something about the unemployment problem?"
"Is it the European Union, is it the Member States, or is it a case of both one and the other?"
"This report is based on the assumption that it will be the latter."
"Let me make it absolutely clear that, in my view, exchanges of ideas should always take place across national frontiers."
"That also applies when we are talking about employment."
"However, we do not wish a more binding form of cooperation to be established."
"I have to dissociate myself from the idea of drawing up common EU proposals to eliminate unemployment."
"My own feeling is that the report by Mr Rocard points to some good proposals for solving the problem, including a general reduction in working hours, but this must be something that the individual Member States decide for themselves, either through legislation or as a subject for agreement between the parties in the labour market."
"In more general terms, I should like to stress that I think it is quite incredible that there is constantly talk in EU circles about combatting unemployment, when at the same time the EU is eagerly working towards the completion of the third stage of EMU."
"The Member States are being asked to pursue a policy of convergence, which means, as we know, an even greater number of unemployed people."
"Several experts, even strong advocates of EMU, have said that the completion of EMU will increase unemployment."
"The Industry Council of the Labour Movement in Denmark predicts that if the timetable laid down in the Maastricht Treaty is adhered to, unemployment in the European Union will rise by about one million."
"To my mind, there is no clear demarcation of the competence of the Member States and the Union in this area."
"And I think it is a weakness that no such demarcation has been included in the report."
"It is often said in this Chamber how important it is to maintain cultural diversity."
"I should like to point out that it is one of the hallmarks of Danish culture that agreements on the conditions on the labour market are something for which the parties in the labour market are responsible."
"And we wish that to continue to be the case."
"Let us keep the cultural differences among the 15 countries."
"We may even be able to solve the problem of unemployment individually."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that Mr Rocard, who was Prime Minister of France for three years, did not exploit that time to eradicate the scourge of unemployment by means of the miraculous remedies which he is proposing today."
"Instead, the ranks of the unemployed swelled from one to three million in France during François Mitterrand's two seven-year periods in office."
"But Mr Rocard has not moved on in ideological terms, and unfortunately has not departed from his Malthusian and pessimistic economic thinking."
"The amount of work available in the European Union, and particularly in France, has not been frozen at its present level once and for all."
"Let us protect our markets from fierce competition, let us reform our absurd system of taxation which penalizes work, effort and enterprise, let us abandon the illusions of Maastricht and its overvalued currencies, let us curb government spending, let us turn back the tide of immigration, let us bolster consumer spending; then we shall create new jobs."
"Economic logic is not purely arithmetical; it is dynamic, responsive and alive, and will therefore not fit into the totally abstruse intellectual models set out in your explanatory statement."
"What becomes of your theories when they are applied to SMEs, to small and medium-sized enterprises with a minimum of ten employees?"
"For it to be worthwhile extending plant running time, and hence increasing production, a demand has to exist."
"You say that average working hours are a variable linked to the level of employment."
"Why is it then that unemployment is falling in the United States and is so low in Japan when, statistically, workers in those countries work longer hours than in Europe?"
"A reduction in weekly, monthly or annual working time will not, therefore, automatically bring down unemployment."
"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you give no consideration to the human dimension."
"The quality and quantity of human work cannot be confined to your statistical notion of working time."
"White-collar staff, for whom there is no such thing as overtime, will work as much as before, even if they are supposed to work 32 hours."
"The banning of overtime will deprive blue-collar workers of additional earnings, and they will not be able to make ends meet with their basic pay alone."
"No, Mr Rocard, human beings are neither interchangeable nor identical, and they cannot be computer-modelled."
"You are in fact turning a blind eye to the causes of unemployment: worldwide free trade, immigration and absurd systems of taxation."
"You have tried out all the remedies of a quack doctor, all of them whistling for the wind, but there are actually over 25 million people out of work in Europe."
"Your report is nothing but a political gimmick, to which only clueless politicians and conniving trade unionists will give any credence - two groups which are both incapable of squaring up to the economic, social, political, demographic and moral crisis which is afflicting Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall not take up the comments made by the previous speaker, but I am very surprised by the scepticism within the ranks of the PPE Group."
"After all, according to the Delors White Paper, reductions in working hours in the northern Member States led to the creation of 8 % more jobs, even accounting in the Netherlands for half of the 30 % rise in employment."
"In Germany too, between 1983 and 1992 a third of newly-created jobs were attributable to reduced working time."
"We must nevertheless be realistic about one thing: growth alone will have only a minimal impact on employment."
"The Prognos Institute in Basle has predicted, for example, that Germany will have no more jobs in the year 2010 than in 1992, primarily as a result of gains in productivity."
"Although we shall see increased employment in the service and information sectors, there will be a decrease in the production sector and further job losses in agriculture."
"Of course, as politicians we cannot just sit back and accept this."
"Paid work not only provides economic security but is the principal route to individual self-fulfilment."
"That is why I am so impressed by the blueprint outlined here by Mr Rocard - and it is a package of ideas, not just a reduction in working hours."
"This report will be a major stimulus for debate both in the national parliaments and at European level."
"For many years, employers were opposed to reduced working hours and in favour only of flexibility, which meant constant availability around the clock, variable working hours and temporary work."
"All this has now changed."
"Volkswagen in Germany is just one example; our CDU colleague is mistaken in thinking that there are no others."
"Even SMEs have taken to experimenting with modern, innovative schemes regarding working time."
"Mr Rocard's proposals represent a significant component of a European policy on employment."
"Mr President, everyone knows that my group still has one or two problems with the Rocard report, so I was extremely surprised to hear what Mr Vandemeulebroucke just said about us not keeping to our agreements."
"We abstained in the Committee on Social Affairs, so it is only to be expected that we do not yet agree with the report."
"Even Mr Vandemeulebroucke should realize that."
"The PPE Group feels that the Commission should research this whole issue in detail, and that we should base our decisions on its findings."
"This is why we have tabled fourteen amendments which, if included, would make the report considerably more acceptable to my group, I can assure you."
"Reorganizing work is not the only way to solve the unemployment problem, but - and I agree with the Council presidency here - it may be one way of helping to get more people into work."
"Mr Rocard must not forget that not all the new jobs created are filled by those registered as unemployed."
"The White Paper indicates that three of every four new jobs are filled from other categories, such as women returning to work, young people and those changing jobs."
"So Mr Rocard's claim that the governments will be saving ECU 350 billion in unemployment benefits is only partly true."
"It may even be that more spending is required."
"Coming as I do from the Netherlands, I should like to say something positive about the reorganization of work."
"In the early 1980s, employers and workers sat down with the government in the Netherlands and decided to experiment with the reorganization of work, which has functioned well in many cases."
"This decision was only taken because of the poor economic situation at the time."
"Since the Lubbers government of the 1980s, unemployment has been halved, indicating that a reduction in working hours can help towards solving the problem, provided that the overall cost to businesses does not increase."
"A reduction in working hours which does entail increased costs results in less employment, and this is something that people fail to realize."
"But if the costs are kept down, competitiveness will not be affected and may even improve."
"That is why the reorganization of work is worth looking at, without necessarily taking any final decisions on the subject."
"Mr President, today's report on the reduction of working time shows Parliament's ability to make a significant contribution to solving the problems of the day."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, his tenacity and his enthusiasm in defending his proposals on all occasions."
"His basic premise is a good one, and his proposed approaches are interesting."
"I would nevertheless add a rider to the solutions which he offers."
"First of all, Europe with all its diversity has an equal need for a reduction and a flexible reorganization of working time, in order to cater for sectoral needs and business circumstances, taking particular account of the specific features of SMEs."
"In this context, the amendments tabled by the PPE Group and ourselves would make the proposed solutions far more realistic and acceptable to all the countries and political movements represented in this House."
"There is another crucial point, I believe."
"This report, which provides a constructive basis for considering, at European level, the possibilities and consequences of reorganizing or indeed reducing working time, must not seek to prejudge the results - positive or not - of the studies and consultations for which it calls."
"In this respect, the amendments tabled by the PPE Group making European action in this area contingent on the outcome of the studies commissioned seem to me to be very wise."
"Similarly, it is unrealistic to propose as of now a cut in working hours without loss of earnings thanks to automatic compensation by the state."
"It is to clarify this point that we suggest linking compensation to the actual fall in the number of unemployed persons and, consequently, the cost to the community."
"Mr President, two basic ideas run through the Rocard report: the first is that the number of jobs is a constant, affected only by productivity."
"When there are not enough jobs for everyone, they must be rationed and shared."
"Moreover penalty taxes must be imposed on those who want to work more."
"The second idea is that work is drudgery, something that workers would rather avoid."
"These basic ideas lead to conclusions that are completely at variance with the demands of the future."
"The age distribution in a decade or so will be such that we risk serious generational conflicts."
"It will become difficult for ever fewer gainfully employed people to care for an ever larger ageing population."
"We therefore need to get rid of unemployment at the same time as improving productivity and raising pensionable ages."
"Mr Rocard is advocating job rationing, when what is needed is an increase in the number of jobs."
"Otherwise, in a few years' time we shall be faced with a social trauma of immense proportions."
"In ten years, Mr President, our debate today will stand out as hopelessly unrealistic."
"Mr President, we think the Rocard report brings up the opposite criticism from the one the conservatives have raised."
"The Rocard report reveals a contradiction between analysis and programmed information, and between information and political decisions."
"There is no doubt that it is important not to put our trust in quantitative policies, growth, increasing gross domestic product, which have not in fact reduced unemployment, and that it is right, as the report suggests, to identify the central importance of distribution and reduction of hours."
"But in reality this valuable analysis remains trapped in certain nineties illusions which have prevented the reduction of working hours being pursued."
"One of these illusions lies in connecting the reduction of working hours to the policy of flexibility achieved by firms, usually unilateral and diluted to the point of blurring the reduction in hours."
"Even more impracticable is the hypothesis of subordinating a reduction in working hours to a reduction in wages."
"If that happens, there will be no reduction in hours."
"In Europe and many countries there is now a real wage problem, frequently forcing workers to increase rather than reduce working hours, by working overtime."
"When hours are linked to flexibility and there is no integrated policy, as has happened in many countries, there is an increase in effective average daily working hours, instead of a reduction. As if that were not enough, the rise in pensionable age is extending the working life, so in many European countries we are now seeing an increase in production and productivity, an increase in unemployment and an increase in the average hours of work."
"There is a need for change, especially today with recession approaching, which leads us to draw the most rational and extreme conclusions from Mr Rocard's analysis."
"We need a proposal for a consistent reduction in hours concentrated over time, because only consistency in reduction and concentration over time can establish an employment policy."
"If the European Community can set binding targets for reducing deficits and debt for Europe, as it does, then it should also be able to set binding targets for reducing working hours in quantity and over time, so that government action and the work of social forces are concentrated on that objective."
"Otherwise the analysis may be valid but the political conclusions will not be."
"Mr President, reductions in working time are part of our economic history."
"Mr Rocard's report at least has the merit of focusing attention on a real social problem at long last, and I thank him for that."
"This is of course a controversial subject, and opponents of shorter working hours have no difficulty in stating that in the United States and the United Kingdom, unemployment is falling steadily and there has never been so much work."
"But what kind of work?"
"Much of it is part-time and badly paid; working time is divided between rich and poor, and casualization is proceeding apace."
"Nor do I believe that a reduction in working time is the only way of combatting unemployment."
"It is one way among others, and is part of an overall strategy incorporating parameters such as growth, a revival of consumer spending and even the monetary situation, because - with both the franc and mark overvalued - unemployment still has a bright future ahead of it."
"Rather than being a means of managing a scarce supply of work, a reduction in working hours must result from a change in our relationship with work, which is now losing the pride of place that it enjoyed some years ago."
"More than ever before, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, the issues of education, life-long learning, cultural and professional activity and retirement all go hand in hand, and should lead to greater freedom for individuals throughout their lives."
"I believe first and foremost in reducing working time on an individual rather than a global basis."
"Highly technical, across-the-board measures might not succeed."
"Individual reductions, in my view, mean mapping out the aspirations of each employee, beginning with annualized hours and accompanied, naturally, by a not insignificant reduction in working time, with new recruitment as an important spin-off."
"Such matters should, in my opinion, ideally be negotiated at company level."
"I naturally welcome any reduction on a sectoral basis, but I would point out that various difficulties arise at this level."
"Companies, on the other hand, are already starting to produce some interesting results: there are a number of examples, notably at Volkswagen, Philips and elsewhere."
"Every effort should therefore be made to ensure that technological innovation no longer causes jobs to be lost, but serves to create new ones."
"And it is not right to say that earnings should be eroded as working time is reduced, because the consequence would be to restrain consumer spending further still and reinforce insecurity."
"Michel Rocard mentioned the sum of ECU 350 billion paid out in unemployment benefits."
"Let us face it: it is time to put these funds to intelligent use, for example by maintaining earnings at their original level when working hours are reduced, and eliminating all the social costs bearing down on low wages."
"Finally, one concept by which I set great store is the interplay between training, research and the reduction of working time."
"One approach worth following would in fact be to link technological innovation, with the aid of research, to the reduction of working hours."
"Whatever happens, nothing will be possible without the trade unions, whose role - particularly through the European Trade Union Confederation - will be crucial."
"Mr President, Michel Rocard thought he had invented a machine to reduce unemployment, but he has discovered a time machine, turning the clock back not only to Léon Blum and his famous 40-hour week, but to the debates of Socrates and the sophists 2500 years ago."
"There is unemployment; there is confusion."
"Michel Rocard has plenty of the latter."
"The problem is an economic and political one; the problem is also philosophical because work is creation, it is human."
"Look at Michelangelo, whose hand created the Sistine Chapel."
"The scientific attitude to such a problem is to seek its causes."
"The causes are obvious."
"Unemployment exists for many reasons, without a doubt, but one of them is glaringly self-evident: unemployment exists because there are not enough jobs, and there are not enough jobs because, when enough did exist, they were destroyed."
"None are created when people want them, and when they are needed they are already taken."
"We, for our part, attribute the shortage of jobs primarily to immigration."
"You, on the other hand, blame excessive working hours, and you say: all we have to do is cut working time, all we need are new measures."
"You say the great law of history is reducing working hours: 3200 hours at the end of the nineteenth century; 1700 hours today, after the laws of 1900, 1902, 1904 and 1906 - and, your friends even add, without affecting GDP."
"If we worked 3200 hours today, there would be not 22 million but 11 million jobs."
"The reduction in working time has therefore created 11 million jobs."
"Ultimately, your slogan is a simple one: working less means work for all."
"This is in fact the title of Guy Asnar's book."
"The methods you propose are gradual retirement and reducing the length of the working week - the four-Thursday week, as Professor Godet calls it in 'Le grand mensonge ' - phasing out overtime and replacing it with leisure time - which is happening in the police force but is not solving any problems - sabbaticals, short breaks in the working day and a reorganization of work within our life cycle."
"It is fine by me if you wish to re-examine Modigliani's life cycle analysis."
"But do not forget the role of taxation in our life cycle: it takes 17 years of a person's working life to pay all the compulsory deductions!"
"Overhaul taxation, and you will reduce working time."
"Of course there are problems in following your logic. Hours were reduced in 1982 and nothing was gained."
"What are we doing now?"
"Will wages remain the same?"
"You say yes, there are ECU 350 billion available."
"And what do we do about moonlighting, because the more the official hours come down, the more unofficial hours will go up?"
"What are we doing to natural cost structures?"
"You are triggering a downward spiral."
"In reality, Mr Rocard, your method is a well-known one."
"It is that of the sophists."
"Let me show you why."
"Since jobs are created when working time is reduced, then ultimately, for zero working hours, there is an infinite number of jobs."
"The number of jobs is infinite, as long as you are operating within a closed economy."
"In an open economy, however, vacant posts are immediately occupied."
"Your conclusions, Mr Rocard, are those of Malthusian protestantism."
"You are like Michel Foucault: you believe that history is static, you believe in structuralism, with your model of the underdog living in poverty."
"The fact is that you are neither a socialist nor a liberal - you are a pessimistic internationalist."
"You believe in rationing and in quiet poverty. We, for our part, are optimistic nationalists."
"We shall adjourn the debate at this point because of Question Time."
"It will be continued at 9 p.m. this evening."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B4-0838/96)"
"Question No 30 by Ben Fayot (H-0577/96)"
"Subject: The European Parliament's right of initiative"
"Article 138b of the EC Treaty empowers the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members, to request the Commission to submit any appropriate proposal on matters on which it considers that a Community act is required for the purpose of implementing that Treaty."
"Before the adoption of the Joint Declaration on the 1996 legislative programme, the European Parliament had adopted two own-initiative reports on the basis of Article 138b (Rothley report (A4-0201/95)), adopted on 26 October 1995, OJ C 308/95, and Alber report (A3-0232/94), adopted on 20 April 1994 (OJ C 128/94)."
"In its resolution on the 1996 legislative programme, the European Parliament had called on the Commission to submit legislative proposals on the above two initiatives."
"The same request was also contained in the European Parliament's draft for a joint declaration on the legislative programme."
"Although the Commission has also undertaken, in the code of conduct of 15 March 1995, to take account of initiatives by Parliament pursuant to Article 138b, it has still not submitted any proposals in respect of those items."
"How does the Commission intend to comply with the - limited - right of initiative conceded to the European Parliament since Maastricht?"
"Will the Commission submit proposals in response to the abovementioned initiatives, and if so when?"
"Mr President, to deal firstly with the resolution contained in the Rothley report, Document A4-0201/95, it is quite clear to us that major difficulties arise when accident victims have to seek compensation for their injuries from insurance companies in other Member States."
"The insurance companies are also aware of this, and have taken a number of initiatives."
"We engaged in a wide-ranging consultation exercise with all the parties concerned, including Mr Rothley, with a view to deciding how best to proceed."
"We would have preferred to see an agreement worked out by those involved."
"That proved impossible."
"Therefore, we are considering proposing a set of rules whereby, firstly, every European insurance company will have to appoint an agent for claims settlement in each Member State; secondly, it will be up to the Member States to impose sanctions on insurance companies that do not appoint an agent; and, thirdly, information offices will be set up in the Member States to give claimants the name of the agent in their home country."
"As regards the Alber report, we have already briefed the House in our half-yearly report."
"We have commissioned a number of studies of the liability rules in the Member States and the workings of the different systems of liability."
"These studies are likely to be completed by the end of the year, and we shall issue an early communication on the basis of their findings, so that we can then decide, with Parliament, on a sensible way of resolving this matter as well."
"Mr President, I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for his extremely precise reply concerning the Rothley and Alber reports."
"My reason for putting this question was that we could not see anything in the pipeline."
"I should like to know how - in principle - the Commission intends to address the right of initiative conferred on the European Parliament by Article 138b of the Maastricht Treaty."
"As you know, Commissioner, this right of initiative is very limited. It is also strictly regulated by our Rules of Procedure, and some very specific conditions have to be met."
"I should like to know whether the Commission has a positive or a restrictive attitude towards initiatives from the European Parliament."
"The Commission welcomed this provision."
"We also supported Parliament in having such a provision included in the Maastricht Treaty."
"Of course we take Parliament's right of initiative seriously, first and foremost because the Commission is the body at which it is directed."
"It would indeed be quite uncooperative on the part of the Commission if we were to impede the House in exercising such a right, and that is why I gave you the information which I did."
"Understandably, the right of initiative is sometimes used in relation to very complex and difficult issues - if they were not so complex they might already have been addressed."
"For that reason, the process is sometimes quite lengthy, but there is no question about the importance that we attach to Parliament's right of initiative: we know how valuable it is."
"I must say I am very pleased with the reply given by the Commissioner on this occasion."
"I wish to point out to the Commission that Article 138b is a right on which I hope we can expect positive cooperation from the Commission."
"We, of course, are the elected body and, sadly, you are not, although you received our endorsement when we agreed to the appointment of this present Commission."
"I hope that you will take our ideas very seriously, because they are ideas that you can use and we can use with you and they will have a constructive result."
"For example, the medical card, which we debated in this House earlier this year."
"I have made my own enquiries about that but, again, I do not know what the timetable is."
"Are you able to help us? If you are able to assist with the evolution of a European medical card, then that would be something which we and the Commission together could put forward to a wider European public as being of practical use - that is the point."
"Can you give us a timetable on the medical card?"
"I should like to begin by dealing with the general point which you have raised again."
"Every year, we discuss with Parliament the legislative programme that we intend to set ourselves for the year, and consider both the Commission's proposals and the wishes of the House."
"In the context of those discussions, a number of initiatives are taken up which are handled much less formally than they really ought to be."
"To take an example from the discussion in recent weeks: the House regards pornography on the Internet as a pressing problem - as indeed it is - and the Commission has already said that it takes the same view and intends to consider appropriate measures to restrict the scope for pornography, if not actually prevent it."
"At the moment, although it falls within my remit, I cannot tell you how far we have progressed with the medical card."
"It is one of our pilot projects."
"We have a pilot project looking at uses of information technology in health care, and we are working on that."
"I would ask you to bear with me, but at the moment I really cannot tell you exactly when the groundwork for this card will be completed."
"The problem is not just a technical one, but concerns above all the question of how to keep protected personal data confidential."
"I am sure you will agree that if such cards are to list not only an individual's medical history, but also their life history and personal circumstances, care will have to be taken that these details do not find their way into unauthorized hands."
"This is one of the problems, and while there are certainly ways to resolve it technically, that will take time."
"We will be glad to write to you and give you an update on the situation."
"Mr President, this question is unrelated to the dreadful accident that occurred recently in Spain, but that accident was another clear indication of the need for rules in this area, a need which has been addressed until now almost exclusively by the national authorities responsible, or through agreements between organizations of camping and caravan site operators."
"There is currently no legislation at European level concerning health and safety on camping and caravan sites."
"Where matters are covered by general legislation - for example, every Member State has rules against misleading advertising - it is clear that such laws also apply to camping and caravan sites."
"Health and safety on camping and caravan sites, like health and safety in holiday complexes, hotels, discos, amusement parks and so on, represents a general set of issues connected with safety in the provision of services."
"These issues are becoming increasingly important in the context of our consumer protection policy."
"Indeed, as long ago as 1990, we put forward a proposal on liability for defective services, but it was not approved by Parliament."
"We therefore withdrew the proposal at that stage."
"However, we are considering submitting a new proposal to deal with this matter."
"Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner."
"As you will have anticipated, my question did not stem from the accident that you referred to."
"But of course it lends further urgency to the topic we are addressing here."
"Millions and millions of people across Europe now depend on caravanning for their holiday."
"All of us with families know that one can travel many miles, arrive in a caravan site late at night, maybe with fractious children, and certainly not have the energy to go and check out whether the camp-site is in fact safe."
"We have seen the tragic results that have ensued."
"So I do think this is a growing need."
"This is an area of enormous development and I am interested to hear that this has in fact been through Parliament before and was then withdrawn."
"I do hope that, since the matter is now so much more urgent, there could be a possibility of the Commission and Parliament reintroducing it as an issue that ought to be addressed urgently."
"We have, as you so rightly said, the three areas."
"But those three areas have to be linked, and the only way they can be linked is in an identifiable procedure."
"Yes, you may well be right."
"As far as the accident in Spain is concerned, we do not have enough information as to whether it was caused by a lack of rules or by failure to observe existing rules and carry out checks."
"Unfortunately, the fact is that rules alone are no guarantee of success: only by monitoring how they are observed and implementing them can we ensure, as far as possible, that disasters like this are prevented."
"I can only support what you said concerning the urgency of the matter."
"Unfortunately, it is often a problem in politics that attempts at regulation are met with reluctance until an incident occurs."
"In your own country in particular, there is little support for attempts at regulation before there has been an incident."
"Something always has to happen first, and then everyone comes and says that the situation is particularly urgent."
"I am thinking, for example, of seat belts in buses."
"If I had introduced rules on safety in buses at the time when I was responsible for the internal market, there is no doubt that I would have been heavily criticized in quite a few Member States, including your own."
"Then, as soon as something happens, everyone asks why the Commission did not introduce these rules long ago."
"So this is also something that we have to bear in mind, but on the point at issue there is absolutely no dispute between us."
"We are treating this as an urgent matter."
"Does the Commissioner not agree that the problem raised by Mrs Billingham clearly illustrates that tourism ought to have a competence within the European Union - as many of us have argued - in the revision of the IGC, so that in the case of the free movement of people, as is exemplified by this problem, we can have common rules which actually ensure the safety of tourists?"
"In my view, such rules can already be introduced under existing legislation."
"We do have a clear competence for the internal market, and services are provided in the internal market."
"If services are provided badly and damage occurs as a result, that situation should be dealt with by the Union under the legal provisions which already exist."
"I am thinking, for example, of our regulation on liability in the case of defective products."
"We have our own regulation concerning liability if a producer manufactures a defective product, and indeed under the terms of that regulation, any producer who sells a defective product is held liable."
"That rule was introduced in the context of our general competence in the internal market."
"There is no reason why it should not also apply to services."
"That is not to say that I am against including tourism in the list of Union competences, but it is not necessary to do so in order to deal with the cases in question."
"We can already introduce legislation on these matters now."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 32 and 33 lapse."
"Question No 34 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (H-0700/96)"
"Subject: OECD agreement on shipbuilding"
"A secret Council declaration was adopted on 19 December 1995 in connection with Council Regulation (EC) 3094/95 implementing the OECD agreement on aid to shipbuilding."
"This declaration seems to be in clear breach of the OECD agreement's ban on aid to the shipbuilding industry and of the Union's policy in the shipbuilding sector, cf. the 'seventh shipyard directive' ."
"Will the Commission provide an interpretation of the secret Council declaration and confirm that, once the OECD agreement is ratified, it will no longer be possible to grant state aid to the shipbuilding industry in the Union?"
"We have a strong interest in seeing the OECD agreement ratified: it would let us put our own shipbuilding policy on a firmer footing."
"Under the agreement, subsidies would not be allowed."
"But the declaration to which the question refers does not conflict with the OECD agreement."
"The cases that are the subject of the declaration have to be considered by the Commission, which delivers its opinion and publishes it in the Official Journal."
"As provided for in the OECD agreement, such decisions can be raised in the Parties Group if there is any doubt as to whether they are compatible with the agreement."
"This means, of course, that everything we do can be checked by our partners, and any problems can be raised."
"We continue to hope that the agreement will be ratified."
"You know that it is not up to us, nor to Japan or Korea - basically it is up to our American partners, who have been unable to reach agreement in Congress on the text that was negotiated, and who will certainly not address the issue again before the presidential elections."
"We hope, therefore, that it will become clear after the elections whether the USA is prepared to ratify the OECD agreement."
"Thank you very much for that answer, Commissioner."
"Unfortunately, I did not get a reply to the last point in my question, where I ask the Commission to confirm that, once the OECD agreement is ratified, it will no longer be possible to grant state aid to the shipbuilding industry in the Union."
"That is the first thing which I should once again like to have answered."
"Secondly, I should like to hear what the Commission plans to do to ensure that the United States signs the agreement."
"I appreciate that we cannot force President Clinton to sign it, but what strategy is being pursued on the European side to ensure that the United States signs and ratifies the OECD agreement?"
"And finally, as I understood the Commissioner's reply, the declaration by the Commission does not actually contain a very great deal."
"Why was it so secret?"
"Why was it not available to the public?"
"Why was a secret declaration attached to the Council's minutes when - as I understand what Mr Bangemann said - it does not really contain anything?"
"Protocols have to be particularly secret when there is nothing in them, because it is a way of enhancing their importance."
"That should come as no surprise to you."
"But in this case, there actually is some substance there."
"It is wrong to see this as a meaningless declaration. In fact, it indicates that other forms of aid continue to be possible outside the OECD agreement: aid for research and development, for example, and regional aid."
"For instance, if we consider that it makes sense to establish a shipyard as part of a regional programme, then of course that will still be possible."
"The OECD agreement does not rule out that type of aid."
"However, all cases of this kind of aid will have to be notified if the aid is granted by a national or regional government."
"The Commission will consider each case and publish its conclusions in the Official Journal."
"And this may result in one of our partners deciding, in such a case, that the decision is at odds with the OECD agreement."
"We shall then discuss the case with the partner in question."
"This is essentially obvious - but it is not meaningless."
"Since you have now made the matter public, we can discuss it publicly."
"It may be, however, that you have made a mistake in making it public - that is also a possibility."
"When I saw Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, I was deeply shocked."
"I was really anxious that something clandestine had been going on, with secret agreements, scandals, and the like."
"Now, the fact is that we in Denmark have been mentioned by a report from a firm which Mrs Riis-Jørgensen knows particularly well, and this report also proved to be without foundation."
"Mr Bangemann confirmed that there is nothing secret involved here."
"This is something you can just look up and read in the Official Journal."
"I suspect that you may be confusing something here."
"The declaration that was issued by the Commission does not appear in the Official Journal."
"What would be recorded in the Official Journal would be if a country - Denmark for example - granted subsidies to its shipyards."
"I know that this has never happened in Denmark and never will do."
"But if it were to happen, we should of course have to look into it."
"We would then publish the outcome of our investigations in the Official Journal."
"That is the procedure."
"I am becoming more and more confused as to what this declaration is actually about."
"The other day, we were told by the Danish minister responsible that the declaration was not important; now I gather from the Commissioner that it really is important, which is why the declaration was adopted and no doubt also why there is a wish to keep it secret."
"Can we not have a clear answer as to why this declaration should be kept secret?"
"Does it mean that it conflicts with the text, and is that why the public must not be allowed to know about it?"
"Does the Commissioner's statement today and the stance which is being taken here mean that he regards secret declarations as acceptable, and does the Commissioner think it is good practice for citizens and businesses to be excluded in this way from knowing quite simply what is in the texts that are being adopted?"
"Let me try to explain things again - and I must confess that I may have contributed to the confusion here, because when one speaks ironically, the irony is conveyed in the tone of voice, and this may be lost in translation."
"So I will explain again, step by step and without any irony."
"A discussion took place in the Council about whether the OECD agreement required us to end all shipbuilding subsidies."
"On behalf of the Commission, I explained that we interpreted the agreement to the effect that subsidies specifically for building ships were no longer allowed."
"Let me give you an example: a ship is ordered from a shipyard, and the country concerned pays that yard 20 % in subsidies in order to reduce the price of the ship to the client by that amount."
"Under the OECD agreement, subsidies of this kind are no longer allowed."
"I trust that what I have said is clear so far."
"Aid for research and development is of course different."
"Indeed, we have a programme to modernize shipbuilding which we are implementing together with our G7 partners."
"This includes looking at the use of information technology to rationalize the production process, so that suppliers in particular can slot into the production sequence at the right time. Programmes of this kind are part-financed by us, under our research and development policy."
"It is quite clear that what we are engaged in here is research and development."
"Or to take another example, let us say that a shipyard wishes to reduce noise levels and is taking steps to do so."
"It needs investment for that purpose, and the investment is subsidized."
"This has nothing to do with shipbuilding, in fact it may well be an environmental protection measure."
"These are the types of aid that are not covered by the OECD agreement."
"However, we do keep a check on such aid, which means that anyone intending to grant this kind of subsidy has to report the fact by notifying the Commission."
"The Commission investigates the aid and decides whether it is in breach of Article 92 or any other provision of the Treaty, and it is then either prohibited or - if it complies with the provisions of the Treaty - permitted."
"The decision is then published in the Official Journal."
"That is the procedure in its entirety."
"The whole process is therefore important."
"There are no secret protocols: all protocols are recorded and may be consulted at any time."
"If you have a question for the Council, then put it to the Council, and the Council will give you information about the protocols."
"The Commission has even less reason to keep such protocols secret, because what we record in protocols is our opinion."
"You are now asking me what our opinion is, and I am telling you, here before the House."
"We have nothing to conceal."
"Have I made myself clear enough now?"
"Question No 35 by Hugh McMahon (H-0641/96)"
"Subject: Registration of the pharmaceutical products Smoltine and Azamethipos"
"Can the Commission give an assurance that the registration of Smoltine and Azamethipos, which are extremely important for the Scottish salmon-farming industry, will be based on objective scientific criteria and will not be unduly delayed?"
"As usual, Mr McMahon has drawn attention to a problem."
"However, I must begin by saying that the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London has not received an application to authorize the marketing of the products that he refers to in his question."
"In the case of these substances, applications are made for the Community to fix maximum residue limits, as provided for in Council Regulation 2377/90."
"It must be stressed that the fixing of a maximum residue limit is by no means an authorization for a substance to be placed on the market: rather, it is one of the preconditions for authorization."
"It must first be established that the maximum quantities allowed in the form of residues are not being exceeded."
"Only when that preliminary phase has been completed can a decision be taken on whether the medicinal product can be placed on the market."
"Such authorization will only be given if the drug contained in the substance that has already been evaluated also fulfils the criteria of safety, quality and efficacity laid down in Directives 81/851 and 81/852, and if no other provisions of Community legislation stand in the way."
"The substances that Mr McMahon refers to are intended for use on fish."
"In the case of Azamethipos, a maximum residue limit was fixed on 25 June this year."
"As regards somato salm , the position is different because the Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products has not delivered a positive opinion, and this substance must therefore be the subject of a Council regulation."
"A proposal to that effect will be presented to the Commission shortly."
"A similarity between somato salm and BST was the reason for the negative opinion delivered by the Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products."
"The Commission therefore asked the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products to supply additional information concerning the risk of illegal use of somato salm ."
"The Agency has since ruled out that possibility."
"That is the present position."
"In his last answer, the Commissioner said that the possibility of harmful use has now been excluded."
"Because they cannot use Smoltine, which deals with transferring the fish from fresh water to salt water, they have to use hydrogen peroxide, which is very costly and has very serious effects on the life of the fish."
"The second product, Azamethipos, deals with sea lice, which are causing considerable problems in the salmon industry, not just in Scotland but throughout the Union, stunting growth and causing problems with stocks."
"Now that the problems seem to be solved and given the importance of these products for the Scottish salmon industry, can I have the Commissioner's assurance that he will give quick authorization?"
"The salmon industry in Scotland, Ireland and elsewhere within the Union is very anxious that these products be licensed as quickly as possible, knowing that trial runs have proved that there is no deleterious effect to fish or to human beings."
"From my personal knowledge of this case, which I have followed from the beginning, I should like to say this: Parliament rightly values the fact that the Commission takes its investigatory duties seriously when dealing with medicinal products, whether they are intended for human use or for animals."
"I believe that is important."
"There is no doubt that, as a rule, Parliament would rightly criticize the Commission if we were to take an easygoing approach, so to speak."
"That is why, when the question arose as to whether this drug should be authorized, I decided that we would first have to wait for the opinion of the scientific committees and the Agency."
"I declined simply to authorize it, although a number of documents and attestations were submitted indicating that somato salm was completely harmless."
"I hope that you agree with my decision."
"The Scottish industry is an important one, and we do not wish to do anything unlawful."
"Nor can we simply prohibit a drug if there is no reason for doing so, but we were very careful to observe the procedure, which was as follows: firstly the matter went to the scientific committee, which said no; then it went to the Agency, and we requested more information there."
"As far as the Agency was concerned, there was no reason to prohibit this drug, or whatever one wishes to call it."
"But because of the scientific committee's opposition, we could not simply authorize it."
"That is how the procedure works, and that is why we have to refer the matter to the Council."
"We shall do that, and the Council will decide."
"That is the procedure."
"We are not an elected body - as one of the previous speakers pointed out - but we are very meticulous in what we do, and I believe that such an approach is also in the interests of the Scottish salmon industry."
"Furthermore, salmon are continually switching from salt water to fresh water, and from fresh water to salt water."
"You are well aware that salmon spawn in fresh water and then move to salt water; then there is a switch back to fresh water when the young salmon reach spawning age."
"The transfer from salt to fresh water, or vice versa, is thus a normal part of the salmon's life cycle."
"But I have no objection to a drug that may facilitate the process, provided it is not harmful."
"That, however, is now a decision for the Council."
"Question No 36 by Lyndon Harrison (H-0649/96)"
"Subject: Policy on generic medicinal products"
"What measures is the Commission thinking of taking in order to develop and encourage the production and use of generic medicinal products?"
"Is it considering submitting proposals to enable manufacturers of generic medicinal products to test and register such products before the expiry of their patents?"
"We have always regarded both types of medicinal products as important, and that still forms part of our industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry."
"We need an industry that carries out research and develops new medicinal products, which is a costly business and becoming ever more costly, because only a small percentage of such products actually reach the market."
"Of course, after the expiry of the patents on these new medicinal products, we also need the generic products; this means that we need the industry which takes up the new discovery and then offers its own similar products, perhaps at a lower cost, which is important to the consumer because these medicines are normally cheaper."
"However, we must remember - and I hope Mr Harrison remembers - that without the research industry, we would not have any generic industry."
"If we have no new medicinal products, then we cannot have products being manufactured less expensively on the basis of such discoveries."
"That is why we have to strike a balance, and I believe that, so far, we have managed to do that."
"The Commissioner is absolutely right that we have to strike a balance, but I think he will be aware of the problem that there are firms who are choosing to move to America to carry out the pre-work before the expiry of the patents and thereby they steal a march on Europe because we do not have the ability to involve small businesses, SMEs in the pharmaceutical industry in particular, in the work before the expiry of patents."
"I would say to the Commissioner that if we do not do something to help the production work during the expiry of the patents, what we will have is the expiry of the patients who might otherwise benefit from having these cheaper drugs so produced."
"Yes, Mr Harrison, I am sure you know that we have already taken a very important step - a step at international level, for the benefit of American and Japanese companies too - by extending the duration of patent protection when the term of a patent is reduced by a long period of trials."
"Let us take a practical example: someone has developed a drug, and naturally has to have it approved."
"Obtaining approval necessitates a whole series of tests, which are very time-consuming, and it may turn out that half the term of the patent, or more, has elapsed by the time the drug goes on the market."
"We have made a rule, and implemented it internationally, to the effect that the trial period is added on to the term of the patent, so that the overall period of protection is the exact term of the patent from the day when the drug is placed on the market."
"This is a very important new measure which has considerably improved the position of the research industry."
"To that extent, we have already found an adequate solution."
"If firms are still thinking of moving to countries outside the Union, it is much more likely to be because of the possibilities which have now opened up for many of them, particularly small firms, in the field of biotechnology."
"I do not need to labour this point: hopefully my years of hard-fought struggle with you - not you personally, but with Parliament - in an effort to produce sensible rules on this question too will soon bear fruit, because here - and I would hark back to the debate on Mr Rocard's report - we really do have an industry that is creating new jobs and is competitive."
"We are hounding that industry out of the Union, and obviously that makes no sense."
"There will be no need for us to reduce working hours, because if we have no jobs, reducing working time is not going to help us."
"The important thing is that we should have jobs in the first place."
"That is why we need a clear set of rules."
"We are in no doubt about the importance of this industry."
"Since the last enlargement of the Union - with the accession of Finland and Sweden in particular, but also that of Austria - forest cover in the Union has doubled to more than 120 million hectares."
"Cellulose output has more than trebled from 9 to 31 million tonnes annually, and the production of paper and card has risen by more than 50 % from 45 to 69 million tonnes per year."
"In other words, we have here a really important industry."
"We are also net exporters of paper, not only of the higher-value grades, but also of recycled paper such as newsprint."
"But of course there is extensive internal and external trade in most forestry products."
"As for strengthening competitiveness, that is one of the aims of EU industrial policy."
"In July last year, we set up a department for the wood-processing and paper industry within DG III; it is now fully operational and is becoming the most important point of contact for the industry."
"Of course, the broader interests of the forestry industry also affect other areas of competence of the Commission: environmental policy, obviously, for which my colleague Mrs Bjerregaard is responsible, but also some aspects of research and development policy."
"These competences overlap, but they are also complementary, and in fact the Commission has never had any difficulty in coordinating the various services responsible. The Commissioners also work well together in this area."
"Mr President, there are many different aspects to this forestry policy."
"One of these is certification."
"Now voluntary nature conservation organizations have started to sell such certificates to the forestry industry."
"This possibility is alarming, partly because there is no democratic control whatsoever over this system."
"I would like to know whether the Commission - and particularly its member with special responsibility for industry - can conceive of the possibility that the EU might, by means of a decision, develop a forest certificate which would be fair and just and would take account of the different conditions which exist in different countries."
"We know that this is a problem, and that is why the new department which I referred to earlier has become actively involved in the discussions on the problems of certification."
"Naturally, we are in contact with the relevant groups in the industry, but we have also involved other interest groups in the debate."
"Moreover, we organized the first, and so far the only meeting of all these groups at EU level - the discussion forum on the ECOcertification of forests and forest products. So we have been active in this area."
"The Commission is currently considering a discussion paper which contains various options for resolving the problem of certification."
"We also hope that we shall be able to play an active part in the preparations for the intergovernmental panel on forests, particularly as regards the problems of trade and the environment, and I hope we shall achieve a sensible solution in that context."
"Question No 38 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0678/96)"
"Subject: Computerized numbering of telecommunications"
"What are the Commission's proposals for adopting an opinion on computerized numbering, and its possible effect on the routing of telephone calls, in the telecommunications industry?"
"Mr President, this is of course a problem that continues to concern us, because it is very important that the numbering should be implemented sensibly."
"So far, we have not introduced pan-European numbers, and have only been able to agree, in two directives, on a common emergency number - 112 - and a common international access code, 00."
"The Commission intends to publish a green paper on numbering before the end of this year."
"We have to look at how numbering is being implemented in the European telecommunications sector, above all with a view to deregulation in 1998."
"This will mean more participants in the market, with a wider range of services and more customers."
"Customers will be changing from one operator to another, and naturally they will have an interest in being able to take their numbers with them."
"The green paper on numbering will tackle this question, as well as the harmonization of national numbering plans, the allocation of free numbers for telephone services, the question of choice of carrier, and the establishment of a long-term numbering plan for Europe."
"Customer addressing in a deregulated telecommunications environment is difficult, as you can imagine."
"Mr Camisón Asensio's question is in fact a very relevant one."
"We have to create the conditions for users to be able to retain their old numbers when they switch operators."
"That is our intention."
"We must guarantee them freedom of choice in terms of quality, service and prices, and we intend to do so by this means."
"Thank you for the information you have just given us, Commissioner, and I was pleased to hear the answer that I was hoping for when I tabled this question - when, that is, the Commission intends to present the green paper on this issue, which you have announced for the end of this year."
"This is a matter which affects all the countries of the Union, and which is important because it has implications for the competitiveness of every Member State."
"It must be dealt with, moreover, in a manner which is compatible throughout the Member States."
"This is an extremely difficult task, therefore, and I welcome the fact that work has begun on it already."
"I can give you the exact timetable again, as we see it."
"By 1 January 1998, the date of deregulation, we aim to have achieved six objectives: firstly, creating the option of carrier choice; secondly, number portability for local lines; thirdly, promoting national harmonization, in other words we are seeking to ensure the convergence of national numbering plans; fourthly, the creation of a European telephony numbering space and common access; fifth, establishing a common framework for number regulation and management; this will then ensure that divergent national rules are not established."
"The next step will be carrier pre-selection by 1 January 2000."
"Naturally, this will be much simpler for the user."
"We envisage the extension of number portability for users of mobile and personal communication networks as well as for users of generic services and then from the year 2000 the implementation of a long-term numbering plan involving the creation of the European country code with the administration and management of the code transferred to the European level."
"(DE) We hope that we shall succeed."
"I know that we have the support of the House."
"Sometimes the Member States tend to drag their feet, but that, at any rate, is our timetable."
"Question No 39 by David Bowe (H-0682/96)"
"Subject: Extraction solvents"
"The annex to Directive 88/344/EEC on extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients, (revised 92/115/EEC and 94/52/EEC ) does not list the food extraction solvent 1.1.1.2-tetrafluoroethane."
"Although the UK Scientific Committee for Food has declared it acceptable for use, the 1.1.1.2 tetrafluoroethane extraction process, or its products, cannot be marketed because it is not listed in the above directive."
"Since the mechanism to review the Solvents Directive is so slow and bureaucratic, companies which develop such innovative products face financial ruin."
"Will the Commission ensure that there will be an urgent review of the Solvents Directive, a part of which would be the inclusion of an additional article to give Member States the opportunity to allow the marketing and use of new products on a temporary basis, subject to the approval of the Commission?"
"In the Commission's opinion, considerable delays can occur in the application of Directive 88/344 for the approval of new solvents."
"And that is Mr Bowe's fear too."
"The main reason for the delays is that amendments to the directive can only be made through the full codecision procedure, with two readings in the House and the adoption of a common position before the second reading."
"In other words, Parliament's understandable wish to process these amendments through the normal legislative procedure, and particularly the codecision procedure, creates delays."
"We have always said so."
"One cannot have it both ways."
"If you wish to have decisions taken quickly, there must a different choice of procedure, and that in no way excludes a role for Parliament, as we have repeatedly pointed out."
"If, as in this case, you insist on the codecision procedure, it will take longer."
"However, we have submitted an amendment to the solvents directive, allowing tetrafluoroethane to be used in foodstuffs."
"This proposal, published this year, has already been forwarded to Parliament for an opinion at first reading."
"The Commission hopes that the issue can be considered quickly, so as to minimize the financial losses suffered by food producers as a consequence of the prohibition of this solvent."
"We agree with Mr Bowe that the solvents directive must be reviewed in order to avoid such delays, but this will mean a change of attitude on your part."
"We cannot resolve the matter without you."
"If the House insists on the codecision procedure, I cannot promise you that decisions will be taken quickly."
"Other directives, such as the one on food additives, set out procedures that the Member States can use for granting provisional approvals."
"However, we would prefer that when it is a matter of adjusting the rules to keep pace with technical progress - and that is clearly what is happening here - such cases should be handed over to the Commission, with Parliament, if it so wished, retaining some form of involvement, or a blocking right where it believed that it had to block a Commission decision."
"That would probably be the optimum solution, but it would require the good will of all concerned."
"I should like to thank Mr Bangemann for what he said and in particular I would like to thank him on behalf of the small and medium-sized enterprises in my constituency which will look very favourably upon this particular proposal for change."
"You will have my assistance in ensuring that this passes through Parliament as quickly as possible."
"In a personal letter he has written to me he mentions the fact that this has been a slow process of European legislation not being operated at the right speed."
"In fact, what we need is not deregulation but correct and efficient regulation."
"I can only endorse your thinking."
"I hope it will spread around here."
"Question No 40 by Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen (H-0714/96)"
"Subject: Endotoxin content of breast-milk substitutes"
"According to information published in the last few days, breast-milk substitutes have been found to contain large quantities of endotoxins."
"An international research group has stated that there are a number of brands of breast-milk substitutes - including Nestlé's products - on the European market with toxin contents of up to 700 nanograms per millilitre. This could seriously endanger the health of small children, as even a thousandth of a nanogram can cause symptoms, such as influenza, in adults if it enters the bloodstream."
"A maximum level for the bacteria content of breast-milk substitutes should therefore be set as urgently as possible."
"Is the Commission aware of the findings of this research, and what measures will it take to protect consumers?"
"Mr President, I think that we have now gone right through the food chain: this time it is infant food and, of course, that is a very important element of food policy."
"We are aware of this matter of endotoxins, and of press reports of the study referred to in the question."
"According to the information available to the Commission, the study did not appear in scientific journals, nor was it submitted to other scientists for checking."
"Many foodstuffs, including infant formula, contain endotoxins."
"These are part of bacteria cells which are naturally present in food."
"They are large molecules which, when they have been consumed, do not normally pass through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream, and therefore scientists do not consider it dangerous for adults or infants to consume milk or milk products that contain endotoxins."
"Endotoxins can only cause illnesses if they enter the bloodstream, but obviously they do not do so from food."
"Current scientific opinion is that there is no need to fix limit values for endotoxins in infant formula, or microbiological limit values to keep the level of endotoxins down, but we shall continue to follow developments on this issue, and if new scientific findings change the situation, we will take appropriate action."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Bangemann for his reply."
"I looked into this issue myself after having tabled the question, and obtained similar answers to the one Mr Bangemann has given here."
"However, it has been claimed in the Finnish press that once its packaging has been opened, breast-milk substitute should not be kept for long."
"Powdered products should always be mixed with good-quality water and used without delay."
"It is therefore important that these breast-milk substitutes should be monitored, as in general should the question of what milk is drunk."
"It has also been claimed that these endotoxins were enabled to multiply because poor raw materials were used, hygiene was inadequate and the product was kept for a long time: all indicators of poor quality."
"Is there now any need, in general, to check the quality of milk and breast-milk substitutes better than at present, and has the Commission considered any action in this respect?"
"Of course, if someone is careless with foods of this kind - if they are left open for a long time and standing around unrefrigerated, for example - that is the sort of carelessness which is virtually beyond the reach of legislation."
"What might perhaps be considered - and I myself do not know whether this already happens - would be for infant formula to be required to carry a warning, stating that it must be handled carefully, must not be left standing around open, and so on. We should be glad to check whether there is already such a provision in the Member States, or in our own regulations and directives."
"If there is not, then introducing it is probably the only step that we can take."
"Legislation is, of course, powerless to prevent people from handling these foods carelessly, in spite of all the instructions."
"Question No 41 by Maj Theorin (H-0628/96)"
"Subject: EMU"
"The Trade Union Confederation in Sweden has raised the question whether the democratic basis of monetary policy decisions will be eliminated in future."
"Other major players in the debate in Sweden have asked whether further steps must inevitably be taken towards a common financial policy following the introduction of a common monetary policy."
"Does the Commission consider that the democratic basis of monetary policy decisions will be lost when the power of decision-making is transferred from the Member States' elected representatives to European Central Bank officials?"
"Does the Commission consider that the corollary of introducing a common monetary policy is that further steps must be taken towards a common financial policy and a common fiscal policy?"
"Mr President, just like the honourable Member, the Commission sets great store by respect for democratic principles."
"I would point out, in this context, that the Treaty on European Union was ratified in accordance with the national procedures of every Member State, in other words democratically."
"As regards the content of the Treaty, Article 109a stipulates that the President, the Vice-President and the other members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank are to be appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, after consultation of the European Parliament."
"This appointment procedure therefore ensures complete transparency and democracy."
"Moreover, the protocol on the statute of the European System of Central Banks contains provisions for supervision of the Bank and its operations."
"Hence the European Central Bank is obliged to present an annual report to Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as the European Council."
"The President of the European Central Bank and the other members of the Executive Board may, at the request of this House, be questioned by the committees responsible."
"The smooth operation of the economic and monetary union will be based on two decision-making centres: one monetary, the other economic."
"This will guarantee the credibility of the European currency; it will also underpin the fight against inflation, which has a devastating impact on our economies, and especially on the most disadvantaged sections of the population."
"The Council of Ministers, composed of members of governments and therefore democratically constituted, will form the economic focus."
"It will have a major economic role, since it is to coordinate economic policy."
"It will lay down exchange-rate policy - under Article 109 of the Treaty - and will be competent in the areas of employment and economic cooperation."
"Economic and monetary union is therefore a well-balanced and democratic initiative, in which each institution will have a well-defined and valuable role to play."
"That is also the prerequisite for both its smooth functioning and its acceptance by our citizens."
"Thank you for the answer."
"In Sweden, an overwhelming majority takes a negative view of EMU."
"Certainly, that is for different reasons."
"Two of the Government's foremost representatives, the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, think that EMU and a common monetary policy are not possible without a common financial policy, i.e. a common policy on taxation and expenditure."
"The American economist, Martin Feldstein, writes in the Economist that the economic arguments in favour of EMU are so dubious and the risks so palpable that the project would never have been pursued if there had not been strong subsidiary reasons of a political nature."
"The two arguments he cites are neo-liberalism and federalism."
"In my view, democracy will not increase by taking away from national parliaments and governments the right to take decisions on financial and monetary policy."
"Scrutiny, Commissioner, is not the same thing as democracy and policy decided by democratically elected representatives."
"Monetary union and its corollary, a common financial policy, are the federalists' dream, but a nightmare for democracy."
"I think we need to distinguish between two things: on the one hand, the effects of economic and monetary union, which will be beneficial for the economy in general and for our citizens."
"Indeed, it is a good thing to reduce deficits, above all in terms of employment."
"Introducing the single currency, in other words eliminating monetary fluctuations, is also a good thing in terms of growth and employment."
"On the other hand, there is the question of explaining matters to our citizens, convincing them that EMU is both necessary and a good thing."
"In this respect, I believe that the campaign mounted jointly by the Commission and the European Parliament is an excellent model, and all the Members of Parliament and of the Commission should feel themselves involved."
"Progress towards full monetary union calls for the irrevocable linking of Member State currencies to the single currency."
"I do not know what happens in the rest of the European Union but the principle that the British Parliament operates on is that no Parliament can bind its successors."
"Surely asking for an irrevocable linking of a currency, which means for ever, is asking too much."
"Or is there some way in the future whereby a Member State which thinks the system is not working could pull out?"
"You are raising a theological question here."
"Under the European system, one can enter at any time, but one can never leave, and in this respect the Maastricht Treaty is no different from the Treaty of Rome or the other European treaties."
"Having said that, I believe that the advantages are sufficiently great and sufficiently positive for the population to appreciate the benefits of this Union."
"I would add this, which seems a very important point to me: now that capital movements have been completely liberalized, monetary sovereignty will not be diminished by economic and monetary union."
"EMU will enable our Member States, collectively, to regain the sovereignty over their monetary affairs which - I am afraid - they are losing further every day."
"This is a crucial question which Mrs Theorin has raised."
"I should like to ask Mr de Silguy where he can find any economic theorists who suggest that a country which has oil revenues should respond in the same way as one with an energy deficit if the price of oil is halved or doubled."
"It is not honest to put forward a proposal for a monetary union which deals with exchange-rate and monetary issues without there also being parallel powers in relation to financial policy, incomes policy and the other forms of economic policy."
"One may be in favour of a centrally determined economic policy, but then all the policy instruments must be in place."
"One cannot be in favour of a separation of policy instruments such as that contained in the Maastricht Treaty."
"By referring to oil, you are taking as your example the country - one of the two countries - which does indeed have the possibility of opting out, and it will be up to that country to decide whether or not it wishes to join in the economic and monetary union."
"I note that oil revenue has declined considerably over the past 20 years or so, even in the case of that country, and that we are witnessing a growing convergence between the European economies."
"I believe that in order to make monetary union work, it is important for budgetary policies to be well coordinated and for us all to be pursuing the same objectives."
"Centralized management of economic and budgetary policy is out of the question."
"To my mind, that would conflict with the spirit of the Treaty and with our traditions."
"It will be a matter of ensuring, through the measures which are introduced - I am thinking in particular of the stability pact, on which the House is soon to receive a proposal from the Commission - that our economic and budgetary policies are conducted along similar lines, in other words that we decide on common objectives and ensure that the objectives pursued by all the Member States are complementary and coherent."
"If that were not the case, moreover, the markets would ultimately penalize such divergent approaches."
"That would then result in monetary upheavals and increases in interest rates and, eventually, in slower growth and increased unemployment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this instance the Commission does not share the honourable Member's analysis."
"Unemployment does not date from the ratification of the Treaty on European Union; it began to loom large in Europe at the time of the first oil crisis in 1973."
"I would add that exchange-rate fluctuations have also had an extremely adverse effect on employment in Europe, as we saw in 1992 and 1993, and indeed in 1995."
"What are the causes of unemployment, to put it very simply?"
"There are two, the first being the state of the economy."
"Is it sufficiently well known that the monetary fluctuations of spring 1995 alone cost Europe 2 % in growth and 1.5 million jobs over the two years 1995 and 1996?"
"Only sustainable, non-inflationary growth in the medium term will help to create jobs."
"But the causes are also largely structural, and I am thinking in particular of the over-rigidity of the labour market, which is preventing the Union from making the most of growth to create jobs."
"In order to make substantial inroads into unemployment, the Commission is proposing an overall strategy, which I have already had an opportunity of presenting to the House."
"Even though economic recovery, coinciding with the establishment of economic and monetary union, is now a precondition for job creation in Europe, it is vital that appropriate structural measures should be taken at the same time by the Member States."
"Moreover, this is the thrust of the confidence pact proposed by Mr Santer."
"The Commission is therefore shouldering in full its responsibilities in the field of employment, which, I would remind you, is the main priority of our economic policy, so much so that in its submission to the IGC the Commission asked that, in the Treaty, employment should be regarded by the Member States of the Union as a matter of common interest, on the same footing as economic policy and exchange-rate policy."
"Yes, Commissioner, the two are linked."
"The Maastricht Treaty has after all clearly shown that what is regarded as Europe's biggest problem has not been solved."
"If the intention had been to prioritize employment, the course then taken would not have been instead to prioritize low inflation and price stability and to leave employment outside the Maastricht Treaty."
"That was not regulated."
"Some 18-20 million people are unemployed."
"In Sweden, for example, unemployment was 2 % when we applied to join the EU."
"Today, five years on, it is 14 %."
"It will not do, of course, to say that all this is due to adjustment problems in connection with EMU. The reverse should be happening."
"Unemployment should be coming down."
"My questions have not been answered."
"What proposals does the Commissioner have to bring down unemployment?"
"When will these proposals be put forward, and what constitutional and other political proposals will you be making so that those who are without work can feel reasonably assured that this is what is being prioritized and not budgetary principles?"
"I can no longer call to mind all the figures, but it is interesting to examine the growth in public deficits and in unemployment."
"I note that since 1975, public deficits and the number of persons out of work have risen alongside one another in Europe."
"Consequently, slashing public deficits will not solve the employment problem."
"If public deficits created jobs, then given their level in Europe, we would have surplus employment."
"On the contrary, I believe that only a rigorous budgetary policy and an overhaul of public finances can create better and adequate conditions for achieving stronger growth."
"Let me tell you that if we brought down Europe's public deficits by 1 %, we would release ECU 60 billion per year, which could be used to fund not debt and deficits, but productive investment."
"The first precondition for job creation, therefore, is a return to healthy, stable, noninflationary growth, and this involves an overhaul of public finances."
"Apart from that, the bulk of unemployment is structural in nature."
"The Commission has on several occasions presented to this House, the Council of Ministers and the European Council its global strategies on employment."
"I would point out here that, insofar as unemployment is largely of structural origin, structural measures are the only way to combat it."
"There is no miracle cure, and this cannot be done overnight."
"I would add that in almost all cases, national measures are what is required."
"I am thinking in particular of labour market regulations, rules on working time and reductions in the burden of taxation and social costs weighing down on labour-intensive industries."
"So there is primarily a need for national measures here."
"In a number of areas, however, we can complete and complement at Community level the efforts required at national level, by strengthening the social dialogue and using the budgetary resources at our disposal."
"So let us not reverse the roles in this area."
"And let us also not seek to destroy the principle of subsidiarity; let us hope that the governments and the Member States will shoulder their responsibilities alongside the social partners, to supplement what is being done by the Commission."
"We have seen during the last week the response by labour, by workers, by trade unions in Germany to the proposed cuts in public services and cuts in public benefits as a consequence of the German Government's determination to meet the Maastricht criteria for EMU."
"Can I ask this question, and it is a sincere one: what flexibility do the Maastricht criteria allow and permit?"
"For example, if a particular Member State's government was determined to use its resources to create positive jobs, and that involved what could be considered a breach of the Maastricht criteria, would that kind of determination be regarded as unacceptable by the Commission and the Council itself?"
"Mr President, for us, creating jobs is inevitably a good thing!"
"We should not debate the wrong issues."
"Single currency or not, at present there is no other way for the Member States to reduce their public deficits."
"You quite rightly mention the use of resources to create jobs: well, 50 % of domestic savings are currently being siphoned off to fund the deficits of the Member States and social security institutions."
"These funds would be better used if they were earmarked for job creation, and that is precisely why public deficits must be reduced."
"There is no other solution: if the Member States did not create jobs, the markets would punish them and, ultimately, interest rates in those countries would rise."
"Consequently, growth would fall and it would become even more difficult to create jobs."
"So it is not a matter of making the Treaty more flexible."
"We shall neither add anything to the Treaty, nor delete anything from it."
"We shall apply the Treaty as it stands."
"And I am confident that a significant number of Member States will meet the conditions laid down in the Treaty by the end of next year."
"Let us not set the entrance examination before the student is in the right class to sit it."
"Let us not pre-empt that examination."
"It would be counter-productive and inappropriate to do so, and the effect would be unsettling whilst the macro-economic priority for the Member States today - even if it is not sufficient to create jobs - is to overhaul their finances and not to live beyond their means."
"Although from a legal point of view, economic and monetary union can function with just two Member States, the Commission considers - and it is a simple matter of common sense, to my mind - that without France, Germany and a significant number of other Member States, the benefits and advantages of EMU would obviously be diminished."
"Having said that, there is no predetermined list."
"Given the progress being made on convergence, the Commission is convinced - as I said a moment ago - that a significant number of countries will be ready to participate in EMU from the outset."
"However, in line with the statement by the Heads of State and Government in Madrid last December, the decision to proceed with economic and monetary union will be taken as early as possible in 1998 by the European Council, on the basis of reports from the European Monetary Institute and the Commission, and after consultation of Parliament."
"The evaluation process will therefore take place in late 1997 or early 1998, on the basis of the results for 1997."
"The Commission can do many things, but it has not yet learnt how to gaze into a crystal ball, so I cannot predict next year's results."
"I would point out here that we should not tinker with the timetable; that would be a futile exercise."
"Discussion of this subject now can only hinder the process of convergence."
"A relaxation of the efforts to achieve budgetary consolidation would be unwelcome, since the present situation still calls for the reduction in deficits to be continued, and in certain cases intensified, because - and I would stress the point, since it is crucial - this helps to boost the savings available for job-creating investment, and hence to bring down interest rates."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for the answer."
"The reason why I ask the question is that there is great hesitancy with regard to EMU all across Europe, and that worries me."
"If only a few countries are involved when EMU is launched, I think that hesitancy will be prolonged in Europe."
"On the other hand, if a large number of countries join and only a few stay outside, I think that public opinion in those countries which remain outside and in which hesitancy is perhaps considerable, including my country, Sweden, will eventually turn, and that those countries will participate in EMU, since the advantages and strength of EMU will be the greater the more countries participate in it."
"As regards the relationship between employment and EMU, it is clear that an excessively harsh budgetary policy in a short-range perspective may have a negative effect on employment."
"In the longer term, however, I see no conflict between the fight against inflation and the fight against unemployment."
"As the author is not present, Question No 48 lapses."
"Question No 49 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0624/96)"
"Subject: Environmental rules in the new Member States"
"During their membership negotiations, Sweden, Finland and Austria secured the right to maintain certain more stringent environmental standards for a period of four years."
"During that transitional period, the EU is to review its rules with the aim of tightening them up."
"A DG XI document dated 10 April 1996 reveals that the Commission considers it impossible for the EU to raise its environmental standards to match those which apply in the new Member States and that it is also not clear whether the provisions of Article 100a(4) regarding the possibility of continuing to apply special rules are applicable in this case."
"Can the Commission confirm that it does not consider it possible to tighten up EU rules so as to match the standards which apply in the new Member States?"
"Does it consider that Article 100a(4) is applicable to the transitional arrangements if the EU does not raise its standards during the four-year period?"
"As I have already said on previous occasions, it is very high on the Commission's political agenda to complete the review before the end of the four-year transitional period, with results which are satisfactory for the new Member States."
"As regards the Commission document of 10 April 1996 which is referred to in the question, this document does not correspond to the Commission's official stance."
"As I understand it, the document was an internal discussion paper intended for use by our services."
"It sets out a range of alternative scenarios if the review process is not completed by the end of 1998."
"As for my own views on this matter, I would refer to my speech to Parliament on 3 July 1996, in which I made it clear that my position has always been and continues to be that in my sector, in other words the environment, none of the new Member States should be obliged to reduce their health and environmental standards after the expiry of the transitional period."
"I was somewhat surprised at the press coverage following the debate of 3 July, but that is nonetheless my position."
"I can confirm that the technical side of reviewing many of the provisions involved is making good progress, and that it will probably be possible to complete the review in the course of the transitional period."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer and, especially, for the clarification that this document does not represent the Commission's position."
"But this document is very interesting, so I will ask two supplementary questions about it."
"The document refers to another document from the Legal Service of 13 December 1995, which states that there are problems in applying the so-called environmental guarantee to the new Member States."
"I wonder whether this document is or can be made public, and what kind of problems are there in relation to Article 100a(4), the so-called environmental guarantee?"
"The document also concludes that it would be difficult to get a majority in the Council if the standards which are the highest in Europe were put forward."
"I should like to hear the Commission's views on the matter."
"Clearly, the whole procedure means that it will also be a question of reaching a political agreement among a majority of the Member States, and of course I cannot provide any kind of guarantee in that respect."
"There may be Member States which have a different view from mine and that of the Commission, so problems may arise along the way."
"I would assume that the Member States are fully aware of how the internal procedures operate."
"What I can promise is that we in the Commission will ensure that things are ready so that it is possible to have the political discussions, and my own position is that we should achieve the highest possible limits, so that the countries do not have to reduce their standards."
"That is what we are aiming at."
"Question No 50 by Birgitta Ahlqvist (H-0625/96)"
"Subject: Environmental clean-up operations on the Kola Peninsula"
"The environmental situation on the Kola Peninsula may be described as disastrous, with radiation levels, for instance, 500 times higher than normal European levels."
"The problems this is causing also affect the Member States of the EU."
"Is the Commission investigating the possibilities for the EU to assist with environmental measures on the Kola Peninsula?"
"Are any specific measures planned?"
"The Commission has no information to support the claim that radiation levels on the Kola Peninsula in the north-west of Russia are 500 times higher than normal European levels."
"Large quantities of radioactive waste are being accumulated in the region."
"The Commission has recently completed a study which included the collection of data with a view to compiling a register of radioactive waste."
"The report on this is about to be published."
"In addition, the Commission is currently carrying out a study to assess the radiological effects of the dumping of nuclear reactors in Arctic waters."
"At present, all radioactive waste on the peninsula is kept in medium-term storage facilities either on land or on board ships."
"Most of these facilities are unsuitable for long-term storage and incompatible with modern safety requirements."
"Because of the economic crisis in Russia, the producers of the waste have not been able to build new radioactive waste management facilities."
"In 1995, it was agreed that TACIS should support a number of projects in this region connected with the disposal of radioactive waste."
"A sum of ECU 5 million was earmarked for this work."
"Moreover, a further ECU 1 m was allocated in the 1996 budget for work on removing spent nuclear fuel from the storage vessel 'Lepse' which is berthed in the harbour in Murmansk."
"I have dealt with questions on other occasions here in Parliament, and I would simply emphasize once again that we take the problems which have arisen as regards the Kola Peninsula very seriously."
"Thank you for the answer, Commissioner."
"The situation on the Kola Peninsula is catastrophic."
"Waste storage facilities are leaking, and radiation levels are high."
"According to a document from the Commission, they are 500 times higher than normal in Europe."
"No other country in the world has so many nuclear power reactors in such a small area, and a couple of these are among the ten most dangerous in the world."
"According to the Bellona Foundation, 16 nuclear reactors have been dumped in the Kara Sea."
"Vessels are rusting apart, and their radioactive cargoes are sinking."
"Something must be done."
"It is not just the future of the Kola Peninsula that is at stake, but the future of Europe as a whole."
"We are all threatened."
"In 1995, Norway produced a booklet targeted at the inhabitants."
"What is the EU doing?"
"What resources shall we be devoting to this major problem in the future, and is the EU cooperating with other operators?"
"I share the questioner's concern at these problems, and that is why the Commission is actively tackling the matter."
"Let me make one or two further comments as regards the TACIS projects."
"The largest project involves the disposal of radioactive waste and will be completed with the building of a depository and a safety assessment of this facility and the location chosen."
"This entails expenditure of ECU 3 million."
"Other projects cover medium-term storage of radioactive waste, with an assessment of the existing facilities and preparation for the building of new ones; this will involve ECU 500 000."
"In addition, there are plans for an assessment of the management and storage of spent fuel in the region, including transport facilities, the development of a radioactive waste management policy for the region, and work of a more general kind to train staff in the management of radioactive waste."
"Finally, there is also the 'Lepse' project to which I referred before."
"The Commission is therefore active in this sector, and is naturally also seeking to cooperate with other interested parties in the area."
"Question No 51 by John Iversen (H-0626/96)"
"Subject: Eco-label"
"Does the Commission intend to instruct the environmental organizations to draw up the criteria for the eco-label and thereby restore public confidence in the label?"
"The Commission is currently changing the arrangements for eco-labelling."
"One of the options being considered is the partial privatization of the eco-label by commissioning a European eco-labelling organization to draw up criteria in cooperation with the relevant authorities and other parties concerned."
"In its programme of work for 1996, the Commission announced a proposal to amend Regulation No 880/92 on a Community scheme for eco-labelling."
"The main reason for the change - as I am sure Mr Iversen knows - is the need to improve the arrangements and make them more effective, on the basis of the experience gained so far."
"Under the terms of the current regulation, the Commission itself determines the criteria for the eco-label, with the aid of what seems to me a very complicated procedure."
"The Commission is therefore in the process of looking at ways of transferring this task to an appropriate independent body under an amended regulation."
"We are still reflecting on the form and composition of such a body."
"We believe that independence and impartiality in determining the criteria are crucially important for the credibility and success of the eco-label, and therefore its effectiveness in practice."
"Regardless of what solution we finally propose, the Commission will ensure that the proposal makes provision for appropriate involvement of the environmental organizations in the work on drawing up the criteria for the eco-label."
"And apart from the amendment of the regulation, the Commission is already ensuring that the environmental organizations are consulted when determining the criteria under the present scheme."
"Thank you for that very good answer."
"I think it was intriguing to hear that the Commission still has some vision as regards the eco-label."
"I am also very pleased with the way in which this is to be done."
"I have only one question, which goes a little further."
"I am slightly concerned about the development of the eco-label."
"I have heard that the Danish Government - and it may be that other governments will do the same - now wishes to endorse a different eco-label."
"I really cannot have anything against this, but on the other hand I do not think that the consumer will be better off if there are several different kinds of eco-label."
"So I should like to hear your comments on the fact that the Danish view is clearly that you can have the swan as an eco-label and at the same time the EU eco-label too."
"Do you think that this is possible?"
"Surely the consumer will be the loser in this game with several different kinds of eco-label?"
"There are already several eco-labels that exist today."
"One of the better known is a label which operates extremely well in Germany in particular, and then there is the Scandinavian eco-label with a swan which has been mentioned."
"My impression has been that if we have not become more recognized at European level, it is because our procedures have been so slow."
"It has simply taken too long for any proposals to go through."
"In a way, that is also why we are still using the present eco-label, and we have tried to make the process we have now so effective that we really can put an approval through, while at the same time trying to improve the system."
"It is my hope that when we have these improved arrangements, it will also mean that there is clearer guidance for consumers."
"Until then, we are bound to say that it is better for consumers to have some form of guidance than none at all."
"As the author is not present, Question No 52 lapses."
"Question No 53 by Eva Kjer Hansen (H-0656/96)"
"Subject: Confidential declaration annexed to the Directive on the disposal of PCBs and PCTs"
"Can the Commissioner confirm that it was the Commission which insisted on not making public the declaration on the interpretation of the Directive and that the declaration conflicts with the text of the Directive itself?"
"Does the Commissioner believe that secrecy for such declarations can be reconciled with the 1995 Code of Conduct on openness, and is within democratic principles in general?"
"Does the Commissioner not agree that this secret declaration will lead to unreasonable discrimination among EU citizens, as the interpretation of the legislation will vary from one Member State to the other?"
"The Commission has already had the opportunity of explaining its position on the question of declarations attached to the Council's minutes in an exchange of letters with the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hänsch, and in its answer to the oral question tabled last year in Parliament by Mr Krarup, Mr Cot and Mr Casini."
"I shall therefore briefly restate the Commission's position as it was set out in that context."
"The Commission fully supports greater openness and transparency in the legislative process, and therefore welcomed the code of conduct adopted by the Council in October 1995."
"The code of conduct means that declarations attached to the minutes are published almost automatically."
"In the specific case of the directive on PCBs and PCTs, it emerged from the discussions in connection with the final adoption of the directive by the Council that a declaration which had been drawn up at the start of the negotiations - in January 1995, before the Council adopted the code of conduct later that year and thus during the previous Commission - was unsatisfactory from the point of view of legal certainty."
"In other words, there was a risk that the legal situation would be unclear."
"The text of this declaration was consequently reworded."
"It naturally has to be ensured that the obligations under the directive on PCBs and PCTs are interpreted in a uniform way by the Member States."
"The declaration is now being published with the directive, which is expected to be finally adopted within a few days."
"Personally, I find this solution satisfactory, especially since publication is now taking place."
"The Commission will continue to respect all its commitments to the European Parliament and keep it fully informed, as laid down in the Treaty and in the code of conduct between the Commission of which I am a member and Parliament."
"First of all, I should like to say that I am grateful for that answer, and then I would stress that I am amazed that the Commissioner can now say that she personally is pleased that this is being published."
"Is it not correct that it was the Commissioner herself and the Commission in general who insisted that this declaration should be kept secret?"
"The only reason it is being published is because Denmark blocked a continuation of the secrecy over the declaration."
"I should like to ask what the Commission's position is, generally speaking."
"Can the Commissioner give a guarantee that we shall not see any more secret declarations in the sector for which she is responsible?"
"Does the Commissioner believe that, whatever position she might state now, it would be backed by the Commission as a whole?"
"Can the Commissioner give Parliament a guarantee here that we shall not see any more secret declarations from the Commission?"
"I find it sad that I cannot even get an answer to questions that are put in writing, but I should be glad to have a clear statement here from the Commissioner by way of a follow-up."
"I honestly think that the questioner was given a very clear answer the first time."
"This was a case where there was a lack of legal consistency between the secret declaration and the proposal itself, and so the Commission felt the matter should be taken up again."
"That is what was done."
"This is an amendment of the directive and it is being published, so I do not recognize the interpretation that this is only happening in the light of a response from one particular Member State."
"Moreover, I would entirely stand by what I said in my first answer, namely that we in the Commission naturally wish to adhere to the terms of the code of conduct which we have agreed with Parliament."
"Question No 54 by Alex Smith (H-0658/96)"
"Subject: Hazards of depleted uranium"
"On 19 September 1994, the Commissioner Mr Paleokrassas wrote to me asserting that in the Commission's opinion the health and environmental hazards posed by depleted uranium were minimal."
"More recently, the British newspaper reported on 21 July this year that the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, in a report written in 1993, confirms that there are toxic hazards of depleted uranium and that 'the problem will not go away' ."
"Will the Commission obtain a copy of this report - entitled 'Kuwait depleted uranium contamination' - and reassess its views on the dangers of depleted uranium?"
"The Commission is not in possession of the documents concerning the consequences of the use of depleted uranium in the Gulf War which are quoted in the 'Sunday Times' article referred to in the question."
"I know there has been extensive correspondence between the Commission and the honourable Member on this subject."
"At present, the Commission has no basis for changing the views it has already expressed in that correspondence."
"Commissioner, will you endeavour to get a copy of this report and assess its implications?"
"It seems as if the British Government does not take it seriously and subsidiarity has not worked in this case."
"Would the Commission be prepared to take a more active role?"
"Let me add to the more general information on the risks to health and the environment connected with the use of ammunition containing depleted uranium by saying that when it comes to the question of risks in terms of radiological toxicity, this must be distinguished from the chemical toxicity of the material, which is comparable to that of lead, though it may be much greater."
"It is different when the material is used in ammunition."
"Here, the main risk is associated with the particles which are produced by heat and friction at the moment of impact of a missile."
"Such particles will, for the most part, be insoluble."
"The risk attached to exposure to these particles is therefore determined more by the low radiological toxicity of depleted uranium than by its chemical toxicity."
"One of the possible ways of exposure is by inhaling particles into the lungs, but the resuspension process is very ineffective, and once the particles have settled after an impact, the view is that the risk of inhalation will be much reduced, compared with that in the initial phase."
"I shall not go into further detail on this question, but simply say that we shall of course continue to monitor the issue."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Reduction in working hours (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0207/96) by Mr Rocard on a reduction in working hours."
"Madam President, let me begin by thanking Michel Rocard for his excellent report, even though he is not here for the moment."
"Mass unemployment is Europe's biggest problem today."
"It is an economic cost in terms of passive labour market support and it is a social cost in terms of increased exclusion and the spread of drug abuse and crime."
"In the long term, it is probably a cost to democracy, since those who exist outside the labour market lose their faith in the democratic system."
"Action on unemployment is needed at every level: at local, regional, national and European level."
"No single measure is sufficient on its own; a whole battery of measures is needed."
"Above all, we need an economic policy in which the fight against unemployment is given at least equal priority with the fight against inflation."
"We need growth, and we need increased demand."
"In addition, we need a massive effort of training in order to raise the level of skills across the board in Europe's workforce."
"But we also need a reduction in working hours in order to create jobs for those who are without work today."
"There is no single measure that will solve this problem, it needs a combination of measures."
"In my home country, Sweden, economists, employers and trade unionists are, with few exceptions, vehemently opposed to a reduction in working hours, but I no longer share their view."
"I have been influenced by Michel Rocard and his work in this report. I think that a reduction in working hours, together with other measures, will make a worthwhile contribution to the fight against unemployment."
"We need more exchanges of experience across national frontiers to find out which of the various models have been most successful in experiments that have been conducted and are still ongoing."
"Also needed is an analysis to determine what incentives are required to bring about reductions in working hours."
"Michel Rocard has drawn attention to an approach on incentives that may be successful."
"It is an important contribution, but it is also important for other contributions to be made."
"Apart from the fact that working hours reductions can help to create more jobs, they can of course also improve the quality of life for the individual - for the unemployed person who can get a job, but also for one who already has a job but gains more time for the family and for leisure activities, voluntary service and political work."
"These are the ways in which a reduction in working hours can serve us: by increasing our quality of life, but also by creating more jobs."
"Madam President, I have to recognize one virtue on Mr Rocard's part, which is that, faced with all the statements of good intentions as regards the social disaster of unemployment in the European Union, he has at least managed to submit to Parliament a detailed and specific report which has given rise to a long and intense debate."
"This is therefore an impressive personal achievement on the part of Mr Rocard."
"I also acknowledge the fact that he has made great efforts to unify positions, since, faced with the tragedy of unemployment, we must not and cannot adopt inflexible stances."
"This is an issue which, in one way or another, affects us all."
"Nevertheless, the rapporteur's proposals for a reduction in working hours suffer from a number of shortcomings which must be taken into account."
"Firstly, it is not proven that reducing working hours creates jobs."
"The report contains an inconsistency, since on the one hand, the rapporteur calls for studies and analysis of the experiments carried out in this field, whilst on the other, he proposes that the measures be implemented almost immediately."
"We are in favour of a longer process of reflection, study and analysis."
"I would also remind Mr Rocard that his comrade Felipe González, for example - who, after 13 years of socialist administration, left Spain with the highest unemployment rate in Europe - proposed precisely the same measure during the last electoral campaign. However, the two sides of industry declined to pick up the gauntlet."
"Furthermore, it will be difficult to use public money to compensate for the reduction in wages which a reduction in working hours will bring, as Mr Rocard proposes, since this would mean exchanging one mechanism for redistributing income for another."
"And ultimately, such a measure would still be financed by the taxpayer."
"If the public authorities were to promote the mechanism described in the report, this would lead to trade union and social demands for its introduction across all sectors and businesses."
"If I were to see that my neighbour's working hours were reduced whilst his wages remained the same thanks to public money, I would immediately demand the same treatment for myself."
"And finally, measures to adjust or reduce working hours or make them more flexible cannot be imposed: they must be discussed and, where appropriate, decided on - and the rapporteur also recognizes this - by the two sides of industry and in the workplace."
"A valid instrument for this purpose already exists: the multiannual employment plans which, once they have been discussed by the sectors involved - principally management and labour - must form the vehicle for each Member State to implement the measures to adjust or reduce working hours, with a view to combatting unemployment."
"Madam President, the proposal to use generalized reductions in working hours to try to combat the high levels of unemployment in European Union countries seems to arise from an attitude of surrender."
"The proposal amounts to accepting that it is impossible to widen the employment base."
"The only positive and credible response to unemployment is to create new job opportunities through new entrepreneurial initiatives."
"From this viewpoint there is a need to develop greater flexibility in the labour market."
"The thesis that a generalized reduction in working hours would automatically bring about an increase in jobs simply cannot be accepted, because it has not been proved."
"Countries like the United States and Japan, which have not reduced working hours but actually kept them longer than in Europe, have recorded job increases."
"What is needed is encouragement and incentives to the competitiveness of firms, particularly SMEs and micro-businesses."
"A reduction in working time would involve a serious loss of competitiveness."
"Dreaming up regulations which put constraints on firms' organizational options and production needs would compromise their very existence, not to mention the incentive to take a second job."
"To combat unemployment it is necessary to reorganize working time by using various formulae such as the relationship between full-time and part-time, temporary work, part-time forms of entry designed for young people with little experience and part-time separation for older workers."
"Reducing working time does not mean creating occupational opportunity, it means making existing labour more expensive."
"Madam President, I cannot address myself to all the aspects of the report in one minute."
"I shall therefore confine myself to paragraph 2, which is the crux - and, if I may say so, the jewel - of Mr Rocard's report, because this is the most innovative proposal that we have heard for some years."
"It has the merit of cutting the Gordian knot between competitiveness and reductions in working hours by showing that such reductions can be compatible with businesses being competitive."
"This is the key proposal, because it reopens the debate and is shown to be economically possible and socially appropriate."
"It is in this spirit that I should like to offer the support of the Liberal Group for this intelligent and innovative approach, which could represent the kind of device that was sought by Archimedes to lift the heaviest of weights, namely, in today's terms, the absence of full employment."
"Madam President, one way of attacking unemployment is undoubtedly by reducing working time for those who are in work."
"But that reduction and that aim only makes sense if it is to create more jobs for those who are out of work."
"Rocard had that in mind, in other words, reducing working hours to create jobs. I must compliment him on this initiative."
"However, following all of the negotiations and compromises which have taken place, in our opinion he has lost direction and it would be justified to change the title and not just alter it slightly because he has lost direction and has now gone off in search of a new configuration of working time."
"This new configuration of working time, via flexibility and precarious working, is aimed at making better use of equipment, increasing productivity and competitiveness without making any guarantee to create new jobs, on the contrary, and seeing lower wages for unemployed workers as a foregone conclusion, possibly to be compensated through complicated machinery."
"On the way, the initial aim, the first priority, the only possible aim has been lost, namely that of attacking unemployment and creating new jobs."
"We should like, perhaps naively, to have contributed to the recovery of the initial idea and to have stopped the initiative from getting off track."
"We think that this might have been possible if we had clearly seen the principle of reducing working time with that aim, by adopting limits on the duration of working periods not just in week terms but also in terms of days, months or years."
"By applying this principle and defining practical limits this might have been brought about in each Member State in accordance with the respective situations and industrial relations prevailing there."
"I should emphasize that the report has drifted away from its subject - the reduction of working hours - and from its aim - fighting unemployment - because arrangements have been made to serve economic and entrepreneurial interests."
"Madam President, neither Mr Rocard's statement nor a good dinner has changed my mind."
"The Rocard report starts out from the false premise that Europe exists in isolation and that the jobs available should be shared out amongst all working people."
"That is a fallacy to which the Soviet planning bureaucracy adhered until economic neglect brought about the collapse of the Soviet empire."
"Europe is not an economic 'island of the blest' ; it is under enormous pressure from trade deals, association agreements and WTO criteria, and is lagging well behind in the international competitiveness stakes."
"My own country, Austria, for example, fell back five places in one year from 1994 to 1995, and is now no longer in eleventh but in sixteenth position."
"With its 1722 working hours per year, the youngest pensioners and a foreign trade deficit of 100 billion, Austria is a typical example of how quickly competitiveness can be lost because of shorter working hours - amongst other things - and how quickly the unemployment figures can climb."
"Surely the only thought behind the Rocard report can be: how do we create more jobs?"
"But the proposed system of part-time work will stand a chance of succeeding only if there are adequate incentives to work part-time, if this is voluntary, and if an individual is able to return to full-time work."
"These are enough reasons why only the creativeness and optimism of entrepreneurs, in conjunction with a system of incentives for performance-related work, can improve the prospects of competitiveness and, in turn, the prospect of creating new jobs."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the great merit of this report, in my view, is the fact that it is giving rise to debate at all levels: trade unions, businessmen, politicians, the media, experts and the like are all taking part, in one way or another, in the discussion of how we are to relate a reduction in working hours to the creation of jobs, without losing competitiveness and without provoking a significant erosion of incomes or acquired rights; and how we are to transform the Member States' passive or compensatory policies into active policies on employment."
"This is not an easy subject."
"If it were, then today's debate would be superfluous."
"It is not a question of giving our backing to an across-the-board reduction in working hours through binding legislation."
"This report does not advocate the kind of minimal reductions whose effects are quickly absorbed by increased productivity and which have no impact on employment - reductions of the kind that are usual in collective bargaining."
"Nor does it attempt to conceal the reality or the need for this debate in our societies."
"It does not offer any miracle solutions - since there are no miracle solutions with regard to this issue."
"Mr Rocard puts forward ideas, suggestions and proposals, always with respect for the concepts of voluntary action and agreement between the two sides of industry."
"There is a great potential for job-creation in these proposals for a reduction in working hours."
"The technical formulas for implementing the proposals will remain open to discussion."
"Amongst other things, setting out these formulas is not the main objective of this report."
"I myself have raised doubts and objections - which I have discussed with the rapporteur - regarding certain aspects of the text that we are debating today, and I believe that is normal."
"Mr Rocard's report was drawn up with both rigour and flexibility, and represents, in my view, a significant political contribution, on which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"This debate is not coming to an end today, but is only just beginning in this House."
"The results of the experiments carried out elsewhere must be examined, and the response of the two sides of industry - and, above all, of a society which is frequently overwhelmed by the enormous problem of unemployment, which cannot be accepted with resignation - must be awaited."
"And since it is the most serious problem currently facing us, we must use our imagination, amongst other things, to try to find possible formulas for job creation."
"Now, with the traditional formulas exhausted, and in the knowledge that even growth is unable to absorb the available labour, a rational, serious and rigorous debate on a reduction in working hours may enable us to see how jobs can be created in the near future."
"Madam President, the question raised by Mr Rocard's report is an infinitely simple one: why should public money be used to fund unemployment, when it could be used to fund employment?"
"This question is so simple that one wonders why, in the course of the past 25 years, no government in the European Union, not even that of Mr Rocard - as he discreetly acknowledged earlier on - has appeared able to provide a meaningful answer."
"This diffidence is in fact understandable, because the simplicity of the question conceals a series of very complex issues."
"I shall identify three of these, but there are many others."
"Firstly, there is a question of principle."
"Should we try to reduce working time, or should we attempt to bring down the cost of labour, particularly in the case of low-grade work?"
"Mr Rocard prefers the first scenario."
"We hope that the Commission will help us to make up our minds by clarifying both the advantages of reducing working hours and the potential drawbacks of allowing the best trained, most highly motivated and active part of the labour force to stop producing."
"The second question relates to the method."
"Should it be tit for tat: ' I will reduce your social contributions, but your business must recruit new staff' , or should the method consist only of incentives in the form of lower social costs?"
"Mr Rocard, who is more liberal than many Liberals, is opting for the incentive method; that is courageous of him."
"We welcome his initiative and, here too, we hope that the Commission will help us to assess its effects."
"The third question is that of funding."
"This whole scheme relies on a wave of recruitment which is meant to compensate for the reductions in social charges."
"What if this recruitment failed to materialize, if companies chose to improve their competitiveness rather than create jobs?"
"That is the question."
"We may not all have the same answers as Michel Rocard to these questions, but we all agree with him that they should be put to the Commission."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of unemployment is a crucial one. We cannot accept that the generalised reduction of working hours is the best, the only and the most appropriate response to reducing it and even less to resolving it."
"In many countries, the experiences which have been carried out have not had satisfactory results and have let to far smaller reductions in unemployment than had been expected."
"On the other hand, in countries like Portugal the average working hours are still a long way off the limits referred to in this report."
"What we do see as vital is that the duration of working hours should be made more flexible so that companies can freely negotiate with their workers with the objective of looking after their common interests."
"In the future, if not in the short term, there will be shorter working hours, as history shows."
"But at present we have to be very careful since the costs resulting from applying measures to reduce working hours might not necessarily be sustainable for companies or for workers or even for the States themselves."
"In any case, I would like to congratulate Mr Rocard on his indefatigable work and the readiness to accept to criticism which he has always shown on this subject, which is one of his hobby horses, I know."
"Madam President, it should be recognized that this report contains a number of positive aspects."
"Placing on the agenda the question of the distribution of work, at a time when unemployment is the most serious problem facing us, is to my mind a welcome initiative."
"There are a number of aspects of the report - regarding the reduction of overtime, early retirement, and the call for the Commission to examine the experiments carried out in this field - with which we agree."
"However, there are also a number of fundamental issues on which, regrettably, we are unable to agree."
"One of these is the reduction in wages which would accompany a reduction in working hours."
"In a country such as Spain, and in the countries of southern Europe in general, where minimum wages of PTA 60 000 are common - pitiful wages, that is - the reduction of wages is unthinkable."
"But at the same time other variables, such as the significant increase in productivity, have not been taken into account."
"Over the last ten years, productivity in Spain has risen by 25 %, but wages have risen by only 7 %."
"Why not use the leeway provided by the increase in productivity to reduce working hours? And why not consider other economic solutions?"
"In our view, there are aspects of Mr Rocard's report which the countries of southern Europe - and specifically Spain - will be unable to accept."
"Madam President, the rapporteur has presented a report whose starting-point is a very optimistic one."
"The problem, Mr Rocard, is that no public or local authority in the European Union can create lasting jobs; only businesses can do that. And as for the claim that a reduction in working hours creates more jobs, small and medium-sized enterprises, when rationalizing their operations, have proved unable to do so, and large firms are shifting some of their production to third countries."
"That does not help us either."
"What is not addressed by either the report or today's debate, in my opinion, is the question of what to do about non-wage labour costs in Europe, which are a major element in the cost of labour."
"As long as we have huge discrepancies in Europe - from Iceland, with 31.2 % of net pay to Austria with 102.4 %, and an EU average of 78 % - the question of job creation in some European regions will always remain problematic."
"I think another aspect must be highlighted too: massive subsidies are needed for SMEs."
"There are at least 18 million people out of work now."
"If we encourage the establishment of a few hundred thousand or a few million SMEs, we shall make a major contribution to tackling the scourge of mass unemployment."
"Madam President, Michel Rocard's report on the distribution of work is an important document."
"I sincerely share the hope that it will be acted upon both at EU level and in the Member States."
"Conquering unemployment is our most important task."
"Only if we succeed in it will the preconditions for European integration exist."
"Unemployment causes huge problems to the individual in person."
"In addition, the persistence of a hard core of unemployment and its continuing growth represent a threat to balanced social development."
"I hope nonetheless that, when we consider the importance of sharing work, we will not forget that Europe's industrial base must be bolstered."
"Europe needs to succeed in the global competition for investment."
"In order to do so, we need - inter alia - a consistently low interest rate, efficient transport and data communications, a skilled work-force, investment in research and product development and a sustainable energy policy."
"Since Europe cannot compete with the rest of the world as regards the cost of labour, we should invest in knowhow."
"I would therefore stress the importance of educational leave in the distribution of working time."
"I have also observed that young families want flexible working hours while their children are young."
"It is also justifiable to give employees who are approaching retirement the option of working part-time."
"In addition, there are sectors where it is very convenient to adopt the 6 + 6 hour model."
"Models for distributing work need to be considered seriously, to ensure that our societies are not divided into a section which is permanently excluded from employment and another section which feels exhausted by the burden of work."
"It is also important that organizations representing the two sides of industry should be involved in this development work."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard quite rightly describes mass unemployment as a threat to the social cohesion of every Member State and the Union as a whole."
"I agree with him when he says that there is no miracle cure."
"Generally speaking, however, his suggestions concentrate too much on substantial cuts in working hours."
"Reducing working hours is not in itself a strategy for growth."
"But there are practical examples which show that it has prevented dismissals and distributed the available jobs among a greater number of workers."
"Like others before me, I would refer to the working-time model adopted by Volkswagen, which was admittedly geared to that company's own needs."
"This prevented several thousand lay-offs."
"I would also mention the Commission's confidence pact, the key term in which is flexibility."
"What this means is positive flexibility, and that is what the PPE Group is looking for in its amendments aimed at replacing the term 'reduction in working hours' in certain sections of the report with 'adaptation of working hours' ."
"After all, part-time work and other tailor-made patterns of work organization are relevant here as well."
"In recent years, the 'breathing factory' model has emerged, for example at Opel in Rüsselsheim, with its central band of working time allowing for longer or shorter working hours, depending on the flow of work."
"We should not raise workers' expectations too high, for example with rigid - but mistaken - mathematical formulae such as: 10 % less working time equals 10 % more jobs."
"Nor would it be tolerable in the case of many small businesses if uniform, across-the-board reductions in working time were steamrollered through from Dresden to Porto."
"My comments are spelt out in a number of amendments tabled by my group."
"But these do not bring us into conflict with Mr Rocard's ideas on social policy, as I have come to understand them over the past two years."
"Rather, I am extremely grateful to him for his thought-provoking work."
"After all, the problem of unemployment in Europe can only be solved if we all pull together."
"I would therefore ask for the PPE Group's amendments to be adopted."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, employment represents one of the principal current and future problems of many of the countries in the European Union."
"So it is a categorical imperative for our Parliament to confront the issues and contribute to solving the unemployment emergency."
"But to achieve that aim we must build a more favourable environment for greater competitiveness of European firms, particularly small and medium-sized firms, and hence the entire European economy in comparison with the other world economies."
"This means increasing the wealth produced by the firms and consequently protecting employment effectively, guaranteeing the social security system and allowing social policy to be maintained in the Union countries. All these objectives run the risk of being lost if firms are not helped to grow in terms of competitiveness and efficiency."
"Although Mr Rocard's motion is carefully and capably drafted, it actually tends to reduce those possibilities for firms, because it transforms an important opportunity to make labour relations more flexible into a binding, obligatory, planned proposal, in other words, into a very oppressive direct and indirect burden on European firms."
"That is why our group cannot vote for it."
"Madam President, in this week's European Voice , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is quoted as 'urging Germans to work harder, finish their education earlier and retire later' ."
"So Chancellor Kohl wants people to work harder and longer and Mr Rocard wants them to work for shorter periods and less."
"I fear that neither exhortation will actually achieve as much of an impact as the decisions of workers themselves."
"Although I appreciate that Mr Rocard's report has an incentive structure in it, I fear that it is also not desirable."
"I say this because of the damage which his incentive system would do to the national insurance systems of Member States."
"I believe we are moving towards welfare systems which are based much more on a clear relationship between the contributions and the insurance principle and the eventual payment to citizens."
"A system which arbitrarily reduces contributions on the first 32 hours of work and then increases them for later hours does not seem to me to be in accordance with that new principle of transparency which we are trying to secure."
"My other concern about the Rocard report, which is indeed well argued and full of interesting suggestions, is the suggestion in Recital M which concerns productivity in public services."
"It suggests a compensation system there, which has been referred to earlier, because 'it is not as easy to increase labour productivity there...' - in public services - ' ...as in the private sector' ."
"I must say I am not sure that proposition is correct."
"I think that many of us would feel that in the public services there is often more scope to increase productivity and the evidence suggests that through more competition and liberalization those improvements can be quite quickly achieved."
"I am afraid, therefore, that the British Conservatives will not be able to support this report."
"Madam President, unfortunately abolishing unemployment is not a simple matter of cutting working hours and paying everyone the same as they were earning before."
"A reduction in working hours on those lines would raise production costs and lower competitiveness and employment."
"Particularly serious difficulties would arise for smaller firms."
"To transform the current system of unemployment support into subsidies for firms, so that they can pay compensation for lost earnings to those whose working hours have been reduced and, as well, pay wages to unemployed persons who it is hoped can then be added to the workforce, would give rise to an uncontrolled jungle of contributions and provide new jobs for bureaucrats and inspectors."
"The proposal to investigate how and whether working hours reductions can bring down unemployment may appear, if not commendable, then at least harmless."
"But the proposal suffers from the weakness that it gives politicians in all countries a further excuse to delay real measures to combat unemployment."
"Besides, proper action will be made more difficult by the fact that many voters will be seduced into thinking that there are neat solutions, that less efforts are needed, not more."
"Many in the European Parliament rightly speak of the hostages of unemployment."
"But the real action bears no relation to all the talk."
"Inserting a chapter on employment into the Treaty on European Union and calling for an investigation into shorter working hours are not things of any real substance."
"What action is needed?"
"In a Union created to achieve gains through the deregulation of international markets, it should be natural to deregulate domestic markets too; the most important of these is the labour market."
"High employment also requires an improvement in general education, a higher standard of training at elite level to promote leading-edge technologies in production, better working conditions for small firms and a reduced tax burden to encourage individual effort, which for many will mean longer working hours."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by saying that I am very grateful that Parliament and, in particular, you, Mr Rocard, have devoted an own-initiative report to working time."
"In fact, you have successfully given a very high profile to this important issue."
"You have talked to me many times about it and, generally speaking, I heard a very big response to your initiative."
"It is important to approach the issue from the angle that you have chosen, and you have put the accent on people."
"There is so often a tendency to talk about flexibility, downsizing, efficiency and the like and to ignore the human element."
"I firmly believe that the aim of economic policy should be to raise the quality of life of all of our people."
"I believe I share this aim with the majority of Members of this House and particularly with you, Mr Rocard."
"Another important feature of your approach is the accent which you put on cooperation and dialogue."
"This is one of the tenets which we need to develop as we move towards the 21st century."
"We need to move away from industrial relations that are built on conflict and bickering and towards solutions from which everyone can benefit."
"In other words, we need to move from situations where there are winners and losers, or even no winners, to winwin situations, where everybody can and should be a winner."
"Mr Rocard, the Commission is currently preparing a Green Paper on work organization, including working time, and it is fair to say that this Green Paper is being prepared as a response to your initiative."
"Certainly, in preparing the Green Paper and indeed the Commission's work programme for 1997, we are going to try very much to keep in mind the requests for Commission action as set out in your motion for a resolution."
"Many of the speakers today, and indeed the amendments tabled, have sought to contrast flexibility of working time on the one hand and reduction of working time on the other."
