"Text"
"There has been enough time to establish that, and so I believe that we should vote today."
"To avoid the possibility of our vote being declared invalid, since we do not yet have the opinion of the Committee of the Regions, I suggest that we postpone the vote until tomorrow."
"Parliament agreed to this proposal"
"Mr President, we looked at this report yesterday evening, and Mr Flynn, the Commissioner responsible, told us that the Commission accepted all the amendments."
"This is in yesterday's Minutes."
"So the problem has been solved."
"I do not think the Council needs to approve them, because we will be coming back to them later."
"The rapporteur's position is a very sensible one."
"We shall proceed to the vote."
"The President declared the common position approved as amended"
"Mr President, this amendment seeks to protect citizens from unsolicited e-mail which they have to pay for in the form of telephone charges."
"At the end of the debate this morning Commissioner Liikanen told us that the Commission would not accept this amendment even if it is adopted by this Assembly."
"I wish to put on record that many of us in this House find it unacceptable that the Commission refuses to accept, for technical reasons, an amendment which is a clear expression of the political will of Parliament."
"We must not allow advertisers ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr Watson, that is not correct."
"We are not having a debate now."
"I could give you the floor on a point of order but not to make this kind of speech."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, things are livening up again, and so they should!"
"I am afraid I have to invoke Rule 129 and request that the report be referred back to committee."
"It is not a matter of having no agreement with Mexico, but rather of our perception of our role as a parliament."
"A year ago, we decided to approve an interim agreement so that the overall agreement could be negotiated, and at the time we explicitly said that we would not approve the overall agreement until all of its component parts had been negotiated."
"And that is precisely what has not yet been done."
"If we want to exercise our powers of control, not least on behalf of the European people, we should have absolutely no qualms about putting this agreement on hold and voting on it when all the pieces are in place."
"The Mexican Parliament approved the agreement on the proviso that the government would consult it again at the end when the whole agreement was completed."
"That is how we see our function here in Parliament, and that is why I would ask you to endorse my motion."
"I put to the vote the request for referral back to committee."
"Parliament rejected the request"
"We shall thus move on to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the decision"
"Mr President, a few moments ago, when I requested, as was my right under Rule 129, that the Colom i Naval report be referred back to committee, Mr Samland felt the need to criticise me for my absence from the meeting of the Committee on Budgets on Monday evening."
"That argument is somewhat insubstantial, even more so than the jacket that the chairman is wearing today."
"I just wanted to say that I am obviously very pleased that my absence was noticed, as that proves that something gets done when I am there."
"However, on Monday evening there were several important meetings, including that of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and it was due to the fact that I was sitting on the Committee on Legal Affairs that I was absent from the Committee on Budgets."
"I would also like to add that I had attended the previous meeting on 29 April, the one that is mentioned in the report, and that I voted against the Colom i Naval report, which was not altered very much during the committee's meeting on Monday night."
"On 28 April the European Commission adopted the preliminary draft budget of the European Union for the 2000 financial year, the first year for the new financial perspectives."
"The commitment appropriations proposed for structural measures are in accordance with the European Council decision: EUR 32.678 billion shared between the Structural Funds (EUR 30 billion) and the Cohesion Fund (EUR 2.6 billion), which represents a 7 % decrease compared with 1999, in other words, a large decrease, and to a certain extent, one that is TOO LARGE."
"In order to compensate for this reduction in the budget, we need to increase the efficiency of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"This is the aim of the draft regulations that we are discussing today."
"The Cohesion Fund is a separate consideration, because it is based on funding by project and not by programme."
"It may be separate, but it has a determining role in that its aim is economic and social cohesion, one of the missions of the European Union."
"This is why there was a need to revise its basic regulations, notably by redefining the key terms and in particular the actual concept of the project, as the Commission's proposal suggests."
"I also support the idea of simplifying financial management, and I feel that it is essential to ensure that the Member States take responsibility for the Fund, and to monitor the use that is made of the subsidies granted from it, as otherwise the risk of fraud will be increased."
"With regard to the Structural Funds in general, the Council regulation only envisaged three Community initiatives (Interreg, Leader and EQUAL)."
"The European Parliament managed to reach a compromise with the Council concerning the inclusion of a fourth initiative, URBAN."
"I welcome this."
"This initiative, which began life several years ago, has demonstrated how essential it was in urban areas in crisis."
"More specifically, concerning the ERDF, the rapporteur opted for the reasonable solution by not altering our first reading of the Council proposal."
"For your information, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the extension of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament intends to change its position on 49 first readings under the cooperation procedure and on 15 texts adopted at first reading under the cooperation procedure."
"The European Parliament only intends to uphold its opinion on three regulations resulting from Agenda 2000, including the one that we are debating today."
"In this case this is due to the need to move this forward rapidly."
"With the same aim, the rapporteur has proposed compromise amendments to prevent the reform from being blocked."
"I think that these amendments (measures in favour of island regions, expanding the ERDF's scope of research, support from the ERDF for the URBAN and Interreg Community initiatives) are appropriate, and I support them."
"I hope that the Council will ratify them quickly, as we cannot afford any more delays."
"I did not vote in favour of the final resolutions on the reform of the CAP for the following reasons: 1. it does not guarantee restoration of the internal balance between the different components of the CAP or greater fairness between farmers, types of production and regions; 2. it does not help to further economic and social cohesion in European rural areas; mechanisms for weighting productivity in such a way as to benefit farmers with lower yields have not been created, despite the European Parliament's approval of such mechanisms; 3. there are no special support measures for small farmers, who are most vulnerable and run the greatest risk of abandonment; 4. it does not adequately reinforce rural development policy, as it does not ensure practical application of the European agricultural model and the multifunctionality associated with it; 5. it does not defend European agriculture in the face of the negotiations in the new round of the World Trade Organisation; 6. it does not take into account solutions for the main problems faced by Portuguese farmers: strategic quotas such as irrigation or beef cattle and sheep have not been increased; it has not achieved an increase in productivity in relation to cereals and oilseed; it has not secured Community financing for restructuring the dairy sector; 7. lastly, because this has been a reform of the status quo, lacking in political courage and quite incapable of preparing European farming for the increased challenges of globalisation, and geared chiefly towards more efficient farmers and agricultural sectors."
"In other words, it has been a reform very much at odds with the general principles for reform approved by the European Parliament in its general report of June 1998."
"The determination and perseverance of the members of the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy and of our two rapporteurs have finally paid off."
"I welcome this and I thank our colleagues for their persuasive efforts."
"Following the conclusions of the Berlin European Council, our Committee on Regional Policy had to fight on an important issue for all the people of Europe: establishing a fourth Community initiative, URBAN, which is aimed at the economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods in crisis with a view to promoting sustainable development."
"This was one of the priorities for the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"We managed to have it adopted by the plenary session in Strasbourg on 19 November 1998, and we had to get it accepted by the Commission and the Council."
"Parliament's credibility and our commitment to our constituents were at stake."
"The Union needed to also help those who would not be included in a 'zone' or a regional 'Objective'."
"Our duty of solidarity was at stake, and our concept of Europe was being put to the test."
"It has been recognised that our point of view is correct."
"This is why I will vote in favour of this report and all of the reports that are part of the Agenda 2000 package."
"The 2000-2006 perspectives can now be launched."
"Parliament is therefore ending this legislature by tying up this issue, one which is paramount for the future of Europe and of enlargement."
"It has been a long, arduous and difficult battle, sometimes strewn with obstacles, but it has always been an exciting one, and I am pleased to have been a part of it."
"The reform of the Structural Funds does nothing to make up for the shortcomings of regional policy."
"It will not help to improve economic and social cohesion."
"It will result in a particularly damaging breakdown of regional policy, notably to the detriment of several rural areas of France."
"We will not waste any time on considering and weighing up each of the measures, which are more or less welcome, that are contained in the general regulation."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations intends to question the supposed benefits of costly Structural Funds, which are tools used by the Commission to gain political favour in order to serve a centralist Europe."
"In this respect, the reform of the Structural Funds has resulted in another increase in funding: ECU 195 billion for structural policy, ECU 18 billion for the Cohesion Fund and ECU 49 billion for the pre-accession instruments."
"The Objective 1 regions get the lion's share, with 69.7 % of structural funding, compared with 11.5 % for Objective 2."
"Everyone is competing to be the most eloquent in demanding more funding, but no one is questioning the effectiveness of the money spent."
"What is there to say about a budgetary approach which consists of fixing a spending objective rather than a ceiling for spending, seeking out projects at all costs in order to spend all of the funds that have been approved, rather than allocating funds to existing projects?"
"Spending is becoming an end in itself and the measure of the programme's success."
"It may also seem strange that during the negotiations Objective 2, which is dedicated to industrial and rural regions undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed, to the benefit of Objectives 1 and 3: its budgetary envelope will be ECU 22.5 billion for the 1999-2006 period, which is more or less the same figure as for the 1994-1999 period."
"Rural regions eligible for Objective 5b will be among the main victims of this situation: in France, one third of the population eligible under this Objective will no longer receive structural funding after the transition period."
"The future of rural areas seems to be all the more uncertain given that the Commission and Parliament, always concerned with seizing new fields of competence for themselves, plan to develop an integrated urban policy, in contempt of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Orlando report, which was hastily adopted on Tuesday without even being put to the vote, echoes President Prodi's investiture speech in calling for this European policy for cities."
"Once again, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations would like to reiterate its desire to see the European Union concentrate its efforts on the existing common policies (the CAP, the CFP, etcetera) rather than spreading itself across an ever greater number of sectors, with a danger of worsening the inevitably inefficient scattering of public funds and encouraging an increase in public spending, which is always harmful."
"This is not the only anomaly in the reform of the Structural Funds."
"Many regions are benefiting from special treatment, as a result of political bargaining that has enabled them to escape the rigour of joint decisions."
"Only three countries are left out of this: Luxembourg, Finland ... and France."
"The case of the Belgian Hainaut is significant."
"It is receiving an additional allocation of ECU 15 billion in order to compensate for the loss of its eligibility for Objective 1, while the French Hainaut, which borders on it, is receiving nothing; this discrimination is not justified either by the GNP or by the level of unemployment in the two regions."
"This example is quite a good illustration of France's position at the end of the negotiations on Agenda 2000."
"Having been undermined by Germany with regard to agricultural issues, France's position on regional policy has been manipulated, while it is also unable to maintain the position that it had within the CAP."
"The reform of the Structural Funds is a failure: a failure for Europe and a failure for France."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore had no choice but to reject the McCarthy-Hatzidakis report."
"Structural policy has now developed into one of the main elements of Community policy."
"About a third of the Community budget is spent on structural support measures."
"We all agree that European structural support cannot be spread evenly across all the regions of Europe."
"This implies a reduction in the number of regions considered worthy of support, and hence in the target areas for assistance from the Structural Funds."
"It is a good thing that we have created a phasing-out period for regions, such as many of the Objective 2 areas, which are set to lose their eligibility for support; this will prevent the abrupt termination of programmes that have started well."
"However, the support for rural areas for which we had campaigned was not introduced."
"We do have the Leader initiative, but that is only a drop in the ocean."
"Measuring rural areas in Europe against areas with high population densities is the wrong approach."
"The measures of hardship in rural areas are the absence of particular infrastructural facilities and the disadvantages deriving from the economic and social structure."
"These shortcomings create a vicious circle, because a lack of infrastructure means a lack of jobs."
"People cannot escape from this vicious circle by their own devices alone."
"We have been discussing programmes such as Restruct or Recover, and URBAN is set to become the fourth Community initiative."
"Smaller and medium-sized towns are measured against towns with populations in excess of 50 000."
"This is another way in which smaller structures in Europe, including rural structures, are being sidelined."
"We want to help the poorest regions in Europe to reduce the gap between themselves and the richest regions."
"In our efforts to do this, please do not let us allow the structurally weak rural areas to slip through the safety net."
"The decision-making process which led to the establishment of new Structural Funds regulations has been followed attentively by the European Parliament."
"The final result, although it did not include absolutely all of Parliament's requests, was very much influenced by the latter through the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, the rapporteurs and the group which conducted the negotiations."
"Having participated actively in the entire process, I must say that I am particularly pleased with the decision to renew the URBAN programme."
"This result is particularly important for cities, since it reinforces and boosts the credibility of the Action Plan for sustainable cities submitted by the Commission last November in Vienna, and because it reinforces the instruments already contained in Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds for urban areas."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteurs on the framework regulation for their willingness to tackle the problem of an Italian region particularly close to our hearts."
"This is the Abruzzi region, which was removed from Objective 1 of the Structural Funds in 1994."
"It is the only region in Europe which has not been able to benefit from any flanking measure provided for under the new regulations for former Objective 1 regions."
"The Berlin European Council mentioned this as one of the 'special cases' which are listed as an annex to the report which we are about to approve."
"Nonetheless, paragraph 44 of the Council conclusions does not detail what is meant by the special attention which the Council quite rightly intends to pay to this region."
"I hope that Parliament's requests will lead both the Council and the Commission to quantify the funding and/or population size allowed and clarify the possibility of granting state aid by way of exception to the competition rules under the terms of Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, as has been done in other so-called 'special cases'."
"I voted for the report."
"The European Parliament has significantly improved the Commission proposal."
"The changes will primarily benefit the people in the regions of Europe."
"Their participatory rights have been decisively strengthened."
"It is a great pity that the Council has been reluctant to adopt these wide-ranging rules."
"I will be voting enthusiastically in favour of this report today."
"Building on the work of Labour MEPs, Tony Blair gained a great deal for Britain - and the North-West in particular - at the Berlin Summit."
"As a result, European funds will continue to flow into the North-West to help tackle unemployment, social exclusion and environmental pollution."
"This is just another example of Labour's positive approach to Europe delivering concrete results to the people of Britain."
"Euro funds have already made a lasting improvement to the lives of the people of the North-West."
"In my own part of the world in Manchester, the EU has pumped 13 million pounds into the Metrolink light rail network."
"The EU also helped build the Trafford Park industrial estate, creating over 15, 000 jobs."
"Euro money was a key element in transforming the old Manchester docks at Salford Quays into a vibrant commercial centre, creating over 4, 000 jobs."
"EU funds also helped transform Manchester into a major cultural and tourism centre, by helping build the G Mex Exhibition Centre, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry and the Imperial War Museum (North)."
"The Euro-rabid Tories - the ones led by William Hague, that is - would have us believe that the EU brings us nothing but bureaucracy and interference."
"With a positive approach, however, the EU can make a real contribution to the lives of ordinary people in the North-West."
"While the Tories are taking time off trying to heal their splits, Labour is hard at work making Brussels work for Britain."
"Mr President, we are all aware of the conditions in which the vote took place on Mr Colom i Naval's report."
"Although it did not have my support, I would like to say that, as budget rapporteur - if I am to continue in this role in the future, something which only God and the electorate know - my group and I are fully prepared to be as loyal as possible in the spirit of interinstitutional cooperation."
"Our contempt for the agreement was not a reflection of a contempt for cooperation."
"It reflected our contempt for a risky and excessively restrictive seven-year financial programme."
"I repeat what I said a moment ago: I simply regret the fact that the vote took place under circumstances which mean that this agreement is tainted with uncertainty and which mean that it is at the mercy of any occasional vote from Parliament."
"I still say, Mr President, that on this point you did not help the cause of interinstitutional cooperation by favouring the voting rule that you chose."
"Mr President, I voted against the Colom i Naval report, in particular for the procedural reasons that were mentioned at the time of the vote and which I mentioned myself."
"It is not acceptable for the report as presented by the Committee on Budgets to include an amendment that goes a great deal further than the object of the report itself. This is true to the extent that it has now been placed in an totally ambiguous situation, given that at the time when we considered the report in the Committee on Budgets on 29 April, there was no question of approving the text of the agreement."
"I would like to add to what Mr Bourlanges said a moment ago, that institutional agreements cannot be considered separately."
"It is the entire procedure that is wrong."
"It is wrong, firstly because there is not an absolute majority, something which you yourself insisted on for the interinstitutional agreement of 17 July 1998 on the common foreign and security policy, an agreement that I fought along with my group. Secondly, it is wrong because the national parliaments have not ratified texts which add to, alter and refine the Treaties, sometimes to a considerable degree."
"What Mr Bourlanges has just said concerning the budgetary aspect is therefore particularly true, but he should have extended his comments to all interinstitutional agreements."
"We welcome the idea of a new interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline for the next seven years."
"Experience with the financial perspective over the period 1988 to 1999 has shown that annual budgets can perfectly well be implemented without conflict."
"It was also possible to adopt budgets which fell well below the revenue-based ceiling of own-resources."
"We believe in financial parameters for the annual budgetary procedure, particularly given the pre-accession arrangements and the measures required in that context."
"It is important for the EU to ensure that it has the financial resources necessary for admitting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus."
"We support this proposal for a lower financial ceiling than that established in the CAP guidelines."
"The EU spends far too much money on an over-regulated system of agriculture which is not sufficiently adjusted to today's environmental requirements."
"Reform of the CAP must be pursued."
"We also believe that the best way of funding European policy is by concentrating on those measures that are absolutely vital, rather then creating mini-budgets which swallow up large amounts of the Member States' money."
"We therefore support the Council's endeavour to produce a tight budget covering the whole period."
"Since we seek budgetary restraint as far as the EU is concerned and advocate a lean financial perspective with well-founded priorities, we oppose the suggested increases in the EU's budget for the coming years. We voted in favour of referral back to committee."
"Financial perspectives extending over seven years, with no scope for adaptations in between, make no structural sense; the economy could at any time require alternative parameters."
"Mr President, allow me to ask you just one question concerning the McCarthy report."
"A moment ago, you postponed a report because we did not have the opinion of the Committee on the Regions."
"I think that the same argument is valid for the McCarthy report."
"Could you confirm this for me?"
"If this is the case, why was the vote not postponed?"
"I do not think that we have the opinion of the Committee on the Regions yet on these general provisions concerning the Structural Funds."
"The services tell me that the opinion of the Committee of the Regions on this report was not necessary, and no one requested this opinion during the procedure, as had been the case with the other report you mentioned."
"Now that the vote has taken place, it is rather late to ask whether this opinion was necessary or not."
"The question should have been raised beforehand."
"The Collins report proposes the continuation of the Cohesion Fund for the four beneficiary Member States: Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland."
"The Cohesion Fund was set up in order to encourage certain Member States to join the single currency: Community funds were allocated in order to enable them to cope with the budgetary tightening that was imposed by the Maastricht criteria."
"To ease the burden caused by the four Member States that benefit from the Cohesion Fund, payments were also made to other Member States, including France, to cover the cost of the convergence criteria."
"I could add that the Cohesion Fund contributed to the conjuring trick that made some Member States into miracles of monetary union."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, which fought against the very principle of the single currency, must consequently have reservations about the Fund and the use that is being made of it."
"The policy of redistribution, when taken to such extremes, has overwhelming repercussions for the economy, as it weighs down private initiative with the burden of obligatory deductions."
"Moreover, there are serious faults in the Cohesion Fund: in particular, its efficiency is questionable and there are financial irregularities in the way that funds are used."
"In addition, it is a tool for federalist redistribution, whose aim is more to gain support for the Commission among the beneficiary Member States and their people rather than to enable them to overcome their difficulties."
"The only merit of the Cohesion Fund is that it is allocated to Member States and not to their regions, as is the case with the Structural Funds."
"The launch of the single currency is in danger of worsening the imbalances between Member States and causing an increase in relocations, either towards states or regions that are more competitive than others, or away from regions that are in difficulty towards the dominant economic centres that we are already seeing emerge (north-west Germany, the Benelux countries, Ile-de-France, northern Italy)."
"In this context, the Cohesion Fund will perhaps enable us to limit the damage done by EMU, but it will nevertheless fall very far short of what is needed."
"This is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations could not vote in favour of the Collins report."
"The debate on Agenda 2000 has lasted more than a year, and has taken up the bulk of the work of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"At the end of my mandate, in May 1999, my political positions on social issues such as agriculture, food, rural development and the environment remain the same."
"The reform of the CAP was necessary, but not in the form proposed in Agenda 2000 by the European Commission."
"In our debates we have demonstrated a certain level of consensus on what we now call the 'European agricultural model', which on many points is at odds with the ultra-liberal aims of the countries of the Cairns Group and of the United States."
"I therefore voted against the reports which had not been sufficiently amended by Parliament and which therefore lose their meaning and substance."
"What is more, some rapporteurs share my position."
"1.The Görlach report as it stands, with a budgetary allocation that is far too small, does not allow the implementation of a real policy of rural development, which is more necessary than ever in order to guarantee a worthy and lasting future for the rural areas of the EU (80 % of EU territory).2.The Mulder report mentions in a recital the possibility of cofinancing, which we opposed because in the long term it would mean the destruction of the CAP and of the objectives of the Treaty.3.The Graefe zu Baringdorf report did not allow for a coherent mechanism to reorganise and limit agricultural aid according to social and environmental criteria, and following the amendments adopted in committee, the rapporteur himself will probably not recognise an amended text which is too far removed from his original text.4.With regard to the Goepel report on milk, it did ensure the maintenance of some sort of status quo, but it envisaged the possibility of abolishing milk quotas.However, I voted for the reports in which Parliament's firm position had significantly altered the uncompromising or inadequate nature of the Commission's proposals:"
"5.The Garot report, in which the skill and determination of the rapporteur meant that the beef sector could be partly protected, particularly suckler herds, which maintain the countryside, give structure to rural production, guarantee income for quality production without hormones, and safeguard the environment.6.The Martin report, the text of which my colleagues and I have altered considerably in a manner that favours all of the wine-producing industry - some parts of the industry have already said so - particularly with regard to the definition of wine, the ban on producing European wines with must imported from third countries and the preservation of traditional oenological practices and therefore of the quality that underlies our European cultural identity.7.The Fantuzzi report on COPs, even though the treatment of oil proteins is still far from satisfactory.I am convinced that European farmers and consumers will therefore understand the way in which I have voted and will be aware of the battles that still have to be fought in order that European construction may have a future in this field."
"Several factors have been instrumental in our refraining from voting in favour of Mrs Miranda de Lage's report on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the United Mexican States, on the other part."
"The negotiations between the parties to the agreement will not be concluded until late in the year."
"To accept the Commission's proposal regarding the content of the agreement at this point will therefore be tantamount to giving the Council and the Commission a blank cheque for the negotiations."
"We wish to see the final result before we reach a decision on the extent to which we can support it."
"The Commission's proposal for the agreement is a distinct improvement on the present framework agreement on cooperation, dating from 1991, which it is to replace."
"In particular, the democracy clause (Article 1) is an important step forward."
"What is lacking, however, is a clear specification of the mechanisms that are to be used to monitor the extent to which the parties are respecting human rights."
"Without such mechanisms, the clause is essentially useless."
"Bearing in mind Mexico's continual infringements of human rights, this is wholly unacceptable."
"Moreover, the proposal does not contain any indications as to how the involvement of civil society can be promoted and how respect for workers' rights can be ensured."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations did not vote for the Aglietta report on the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, mainly because the European Parliament is seeking to distort the meaning of certain new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to alter the institutional balance to its benefit."
"Although the Treaty of Amsterdam extended the scope of codecision between the Council and the European Parliament, it certainly did not make it the general rule."
"Above all, it did not modify Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which gives the European Council (and thus the hierarchy of the different Councils) the role of instigating EU policies, nor did it modify Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which gives the Council the sole responsibility for determining the implementing powers that will be conferred on the Commission."
"This being the case, even if Parliament increases its influence, it is clear that the Treaties still place the Council at the centre of the institutional system."
"We therefore think that the Aglietta report, which claims for the European Parliament the right to interfere in implementing measures, particularly through the granting of the right to revoke a decision, contradicts the philosophy of the current institutions of the Union."
"Moreover, it is questionable whether it is actually in the interests of the European Parliament to claim such a right."
"Due to the lack of distinction between a law and a regulation at European level, the European Parliament is already forced to spend a considerable amount of time on trivial issues."
"If it also had to take part in implementing powers, the situation would be even worse."
"Mr President, like many people from France and other European countries, we are appalled by the increase in the exodus of Albanians from Kosovo and by the parallel escalation in NATO bombing."
"This disastrous development of events, which is contrary to all the assurances that we were given at the start of the war, and contrary to the humanitarian objectives of the war itself, can only reinforce the doubts that we had expressed from the start concerning the strategy being used."
"We feel that Europe is adding another error to this initial one, an error that has very serious consequences for the future."
"Both from listening to the speeches made by Members during the debate that has taken place in this House, and from listening to the speeches made by the President of France, I am struck by the fact that analyses of the deterioration of events only implicate Slobodan Milosevic personally, his family and his inner circle."
"Although their responsibility is undeniable, we cannot restrict the causes of the conflict to those people alone."
"On the contrary, it is clear that the conflict was born out of very ancient disagreements that are deeply ingrained in the various peoples that are involved."
"What is even more serious is that this error of judgement is in danger of guiding us towards the wrong solutions."
"Implicating solely Slobodan Milosevic and his entourage insinuates that it would be enough to overthrow them in order for everything to be put right, for the Kosovar Albanians to return to their homes and for everyone to live in harmony in a multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"In our opinion, this would be delusive, or at least it would take a long time and a great deal of effort to achieve it."
"However, if we are willing to recognise that there are deep-seated quarrels involving the people themselves, and that these are difficult to eradicate in a short space of time, we will realise that we need to also consider other solutions, certainly including, for example, the partition of Kosovo."
"We therefore call on the Heads of State and Government of the countries of Europe to rethink their strategy and to stop falling into line with the United States."
"Mr President, I voted against."
"This war is governed by lies, unilateral propaganda, cover-ups and omissions."
"To start with, there is the semantic confusion: the air war against the whole of Yugoslavia is described as the 'situation in Kosovo'."
"The NATO aerial bombing of civilian targets - power stations, television headquarters, schools and buses - is defined as an 'involuntary error' or 'collateral damage'."
"The reciprocal ethnic atrocities are always attributed to just one side and not to the others."
"In the documents approved by the majority in this House, there is no mention of the terrorist activity of the KLA, armed, financed, trained and politically adopted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright."
"And thus, although in the last few days some opportunities for negotiation seem to be emerging, with Ibrahim Rugova travelling freely to Rome and the three American soldiers being released, this Parliament, in its last few hours of work, opts to be led down the humiliating path of NATO propaganda with this vote on Kosovo, and fails in its political role."
"I voted against this resolution because it contains no contribution from the European Parliament to help us get out of an avoidable, terrible, and to cap it all, ineffective war."
"The resolution makes no reference to the glimmers of hope for a negotiated solution which have been appearing in the last few hours."
"There is no assessment of the absolutely trifling role played by Europe."
"Finally, the resolution does not include the call for a targeted suspension of the bombing which emerged from the debate here in the House."
"Our party strongly repudiates the Milosevic regime's practice of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo."
"Milosevic bears a formidable responsibility for the persecution of the Kosovo Albanians."
"NATO's bombardments, however, have merely worsened and aggravated the situation."
"We believe that the bombing must stop immediately, in parallel with a Serb withdrawal from Kosovo."
"All refugees must be granted the right to return home under the protection of UN forces, comprising troops from neutral states and operating on the basis of a peacemaking mandate."
"Subsequently, an international conference on the Balkans will need to be convened under the auspices of the UN and the OSCE, the aim being to stabilise the situation in the region and to guarantee Kosovo a high degree of autonomy within existing borders."
"In the light of our principled stance on this issue, we decided to vote against the resolution, which does not correspond to our position on a number of important counts."
"Mr President, in our opinion, the resolution that the European Parliament has just adopted on the method that should be used to reform the European institutions following the Treaty of Amsterdam does not make any improvements on the past and, as usual, will result in reforms from the top with no initiative or input from the people of Europe."
"The principal idea of this resolution is to give the Commission the role of driving force so that it can, and I quote, 'ensure the consistency of the European political project - a role which it alone can play, '."
"That is a bad start."
"It is a typical reaction from technocrats to think that if they do not intervene, everything is going to dissolve into chaos."
"They do not consider the idea that there could be any other type of consistency than their bureaucratic consistency, for example, democratic consistency."
"On this false basis, the European Parliament's resolution, which is concerned above all with the preparatory work for future reform, proposes that the Commission should launch, and then steer, the process, and that, without relinquishing its supposed political responsibility, it should entrust the task of drawing up an initial document to a group of experts, a formula that was previously used in preparing for Maastricht."
"We are absolutely opposed to this solution."
"These experts, described in the resolution as 'independent', are, as usual, going to be chosen in such a way that their conclusions will inevitably be oriented towards federalism. In any case, the very method of recourse to a group of experts, whether they are federalist or not, is to be criticised, because the document that they have prepared will serve as a basis for the discussions and those who wish to oppose it will be put at an immediate disadvantage."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that the approach should be fully reversed and that the people should be given a say right from the preparation stage of the reform."
"For a start, the national parliaments should all be consulted and all of their proposals together should form the basic document to be discussed by the Member States during the subsequent negotiations."
"The Commission, the supposed experts, and the European Parliament, who will all be colluding from the start in order to strip the national democratic authorities of a little more of their power, have no place in that process."
"Mr Biagio De Giovanni, chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, has succeeded in covering in a few paragraphs the main points that need to be made concerning the forthcoming institutional reform."
"I congratulate him on this achievement, as he did not sacrifice the content in order to achieve the desired level of conciseness."
"I particularly welcome the fact that he starts by pointing out the importance of the investiture of the President of the Commission."
"Between Maastricht and Amsterdam, there have been significant modifications to the Treaties, and Parliament must take as much account of these as possible in order to ensure that their consequences are fully realised."
"During previous debates I had noticed that some of our colleagues had not yet registered Parliament's new role in this investiture."
"This was also the case for a number of members of the national parliaments."
"Fortunately, there has been a gradual raising of awareness during the debates and through contacts."
"This is why I am pleased that the main points are once again being set out here."
"The new role of the President-designate in constituting the College of Commissioners is close to that of what we in Belgium call a 'formateur ': his point of view will count alongside that of the Member States."
"Also, the need for the President-designate to present his political plans to the European Parliament - what Mr Romano Prodi rightly called his 'programme of government' - means that he must achieve a majority in Parliament on which he will base his actions."
"These new practices bring us closer to the situation that operates in our countries, and will be perceived by the people as a move towards democracy."
"With regard to the forthcoming institutional reform, it is highly desirable that Parliament's voice should be better heard, and that, in contrast to the former method, which was extremely inadequate, reform should be based on real interinstitutional dialogue, something which is perfectly expressed in paragraphs 8 and 12 of our resolution."
"It is important that the opinions of the two legislative institutions of the Union should have equal weight, and consequently that the centre of gravity for decision making should be at an equal distance from the Council and from the European Parliament."
"The EU should in my view operate on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation."
"This report advocates giving a strong boost to the supranational dimension."
"It therefore runs counter to my convictions and does not have my backing."
"I voted against the interinstitutional agreement for the following reasons."
"Firstly, the financial perspectives for the next seven years do not provide us with adequate financial resources for the effective social and democratic Europe that we wish to see."
"Secondly, the flexibility instrument that was absolutely central to Juan Colom i Naval's reports has now become only a marginal element and can only be used if there is a qualified majority in the Council."
"Thirdly, the European Parliament is not in a position at the moment to conclude an IIA with an outgoing Commission."
"Finally, the way in which the President changed the vote on Amendment No 27 at the last moment from a qualified majority to a simple majority confirms his reputation as a manipulator."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.31 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Mrs Oddy has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement."
"As you know I have just presented my report which Parliament kindly voted on this morning."
"This evening I will speak on the Malangré report as Socialist Group shadow."
"After the vote, when I returned to my office I found a fax from my Coventry office."
"This was a letter posted yesterday by the General Secretary of the Labour Party informing me that I had been suspended from my party."
"I am totally astonished by this, do not know what the reasons are and do not understand what I am supposed to have done wrong."
"Consequently I need urgent clarification as to my rights and obligations as a Member of this House from the President."
"I wish to reassure the President that, in my view, my first duty is to Parliament and to my constituents and I shall carry on doing that to the best of my ability."
"Applause"
"Mrs Oddy, as you are well aware, Members' duties are individual duties."
"The problems that may exist in each group, or within each group with the parties Members were elected to represent, are not related to the workings of Parliament itself."
"Therefore, I must tell you that your duties here are clearly as an individual and that you will remain in office, as long as you are not considering resigning."
"I must clarify this point as it is established in our Rules of Procedure, Mrs Oddy."
"Mrs Pailler wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, as our debate on topical, urgent and highly important matters is going to be largely dealing with human rights issues, I would like to inform the House about a relatively serious event which took place in Morocco involving a French national, Mrs Danze-Serfaty."
"The events took place after the official deadline for tabling resolutions on urgent subjects, which is why I am informing you of it today."
"Mrs Danze-Serfaty is the wife of Mr Abraham Serfaty, who was imprisoned for 17 years in Tazmamart as a political prisoner, and who was received most honourably here following his release, notably thanks to Parliament's intervention and resolutions; however, Mr Serfaty can no longer return to Morocco, even though he is no longer accused of anything."
"Mrs Danze-Serfaty went to Morocco to request that the authorities allow her husband to return to his country and spend the rest of his days there."
"She was refused entry as soon as she arrived at the airport."
"I ask the President of Parliament to address the Moroccan authorities in order to protest against this refusal to grant entry to a French citizen and to demand that Abraham Serfaty be allowed to return."
"Mrs Pailler, as you know, there are certain deadlines established for the topical and urgent debate."
"For obvious reasons, you were unable to meet these deadlines."
"What you have said will appear in the Minutes, but I cannot take the matter any further at this stage."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0459/99 by Mr Newens and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0467/99 by Mrs Maes and Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0470/99 by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0474/99 by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0478/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0494/99 by Mr Cunha and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0510/99 by Mrs Hautala and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the situation in East Timor."
"Although there were high hopes in the aftermath of the resignation of President Suharto that the way would at last be open to a peaceful resolution of the problems of East Timor, after a quarter of a century of bloodshed in which a third of the population has died as a consequence of the Indonesian invasion of 1975, those hopes have not been fulfilled."
"Anti-independence militias armed by the Indonesian military have created havoc and killed large numbers of people in a desperate bid to frustrate the demand for self rule."
"Far from being a safeguard against violence, the presence of the Indonesian army has continued to be a cause of the problem."
"If the result of the referendum on autonomy for East Timor, planned for 8 August with United Nations backing is to be accepted, the ballot must be held in fair and free conditions which Indonesian forces cannot be relied upon to guarantee."
"Sadly, violence seems to be rising throughout the region and reports of yet another massacre this week by the Indonesian army confirm once again its reputation for ruthless violence."
"An independent United Nations backed force is required to ensure that voting in the East Timor referendum takes place in conditions free from violence and intimidation."
"Political prisoners still have not been released, Mr Xanana Gusmão, one the leaders of the independence movement still under house arrest, should be granted full and unconditional freedom."
"The right of the people of East Timor to reject autonomy and demand full independence must be fully ensured."
"In the European Parliament we have over the years consistently denounced the oppression imposed on the people of East Timor and their suffering at the hands of the Indonesian regime."
"At the end of this Parliament it is important that we should reaffirm our support for these people and their rights and I am proud that in my last speech here I shall be doing precisely this."
"Thank you very much, Mr Newens."
"We are sure that, even though this is your last speech here, your work will continue to be as positive as it has been throughout this parliamentary term, as I have witnessed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Parliament can be proud of the role it has played during this parliamentary term and of its important part in finding a solution to the problems of East Timor."
"This issue has been addressed here many times during this parliamentary term and it has perhaps been one of the international policy and human rights issues most frequently raised in Parliament."
"I believe that Parliament has done itself credit and has aided the Timorese cause. And it is strange that it should be right now, during the final days of this parliamentary term, that a solution for East Timor seems to be appearing at the end of the tunnel."
"The agreement concluded between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York, under the auspices of the United Nations, is a ray of hope for a solution of this martyrised people's problems."
"However, although it has for the first time become clear in this agreement - and Indonesia is to be congratulated on this - that Timor's right to self-determination and independence is recognised, I would like to emphasise, and someone must stress this point because it represents an important change of policy regarding East Timor which I sincerely welcome, that we also need to bear in mind the rather hypocritical behaviour already mentioned here."
"I say hypocritical behaviour because at the same time as this political stance is being adopted, the Indonesian army and the militias and security forces are continuing to arm men who are trying at all costs to prevent self-determination."
"If leaders continue to be killed, if the population has to flee to the mountains and is afraid of voting, if the thousands of pro-Indonesian people who were transferred to Timor last year are to have the right to vote, and if leaders like Xanana Gusmão are still to be kept under arrest, then I believe that it is impossible to hold a free and fair referendum for East Timor."
"And that is the great challenge for the international community."
"In the agreement signed yesterday, Indonesia undertook that the safety of the people and the security of the referendum would be guaranteed by Indonesia itself."
"I have my doubts."
"Indonesia's recent behaviour does not give us great cause for hope here."
"I believe, Commissioner, that the United Nations and the European Union have an important role to play in ensuring that the Timorese problem is resolved justly."
"Mr President, the European Union has unequivocally supported the cause of the Timorese people and their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, and has from the outset made a significant contribution to ensuring that their struggle did not go unnoticed. We can therefore take some pleasure in the fact that we are concluding this parliamentary term by adopting positions which suggest this may actually happen."
"It is particularly felicitous that this is taking place at a critical point in the process, with the signing of the agreement reached under the auspices of the United Nations, which embraces the possibility of the Timorese people being able to freely determine their own future."
"We welcome this victory for the Timorese people and we are delighted that our modest but insistent and solid contribution, which some people have signed up to only recently - be it opportunely or opportunistically - has been of some assistance."
"We are leaving this Parliament with a feeling that in this case at least we have done our duty as elected representatives."
"The cause of the Timorese people demonstrates that it is worthwhile fighting, that it is worthwhile to resist."
"Nevertheless, our satisfaction is somewhat diminished by our lack of confidence in Indonesia's policy and by the alarm it is causing."
"We must not lower our guard. And we must not forget that the referendum is not so much a happy ending as one more step - an important one - on the long road which will enable the people of East Timor finally to be masters of their own destiny, after centuries of Portuguese colonisation and a quarter century of brutal occupation by Indonesia."
"We must carry on demanding that the Indonesian authorities match this diplomatic decision with consistent practical measures."
"The process of disarming and dissolving the pro-integration militias must be started immediately, and it is essential that Indonesia should demilitarise the territory so that the referendum can take place freely and democratically, and the referendum should be monitored and given credibility by the United Nations."
"We should also demand that all members of the Timorese resistance movement under arrest should be freed, in particular Xanana Gusmão, and that their participation in this process should be guaranteed, as should the safe return of those who have been exiled."
"We must also reiterate our condemnation of those countries which hypocritically hail human rights but do not hesitate to carry on selling arms to a regime guilty of genocide."
"That is what we have pledged to do within this Parliament and outside it."
"Mr President, not so long ago we discussed the subject of Indonesia here in the House, and I said that we were very concerned not just about East Timor, but also about various other areas of what is the largest Islamic country in the world."
"I hope that the European Union and the United Nations will lend a helping hand to whatever government is in power in Indonesia."
"East Timor is, of course, in a very special position because of its past, and the situation there is explosive, but the concern that we felt has possibly been slightly alleviated by the New York agreement between Portugal and Indonesia that various people have mentioned."
"The referendum on 8 August is vitally important, and both the European Union and the UN must do everything in their power to ensure that it is fairly and properly organised."
"It would appear to be absolutely vital to send in a UN policing force immediately."
"This would not just bring stability to East Timor, it could also have a positive influence on the entire region, or at least the immediate region of the Sunda islands, of which East Timor forms part."
"Mr President, the signing of the agreement between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York under the auspices of the United Nations, an agreement on holding a referendum in East Timor with a view to self-determination for the Timorese people, is a historic moment that we should welcome."
"This agreement is the culmination of fifteen years of diplomatic efforts and comes 23 years after the forced annexation of this former Portuguese colony where hundreds of thousands of people have died as victims of the civil war and of the brutal repression of the Indonesian army."
"Nevertheless, world history is littered with agreements and treaties that were not respected and led to nothing."
"Because of the obstinate refusal of the Indonesian government, issues relating to security and the achievement of a climate of peace in which the people are free from coercion have not been properly safeguarded."
"The contingent of 600 UN representatives who are to organise and observe the referendum process consists of unarmed civilians, possibly supplemented by 250 police, also unarmed, without any means of defending anyone - including themselves - in the face of the activity of the pro-integrationist militias who are spreading terror in Dili and the rest of the territory with impunity."
"The natural leader of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, has not hesitated to denounce as a historical aberration the suggestion that the Indonesian armed forces can be considered an impartial force."
"All the independent observers are unanimous in accusing the Indonesian army of conniving with the pro-Indonesian armed militias and of being their main source of inspiration and supplier of arms and munitions."
"If an impartial military force cannot be guaranteed in Timor, the real choice in the referendum will not be between autonomy and independence, but between integration and staying alive."
"Furthermore, the intimidatory election campaign has already started: Indonesian flags have recently been flooding into houses in East Timor, and the inhabitants are being forced to wear badges bearing the Indonesian colours and to sign pro-integrationist declarations."
"There is not much choice when you have a pistol pointing at your head."
"The United Nations, the European Union and the international community in general must maintain pressure on Indonesia so as to force it to accept a military presence to guarantee the neutrality of the referendum and to stop this turning into a sham with fairly predictable and bloody consequences."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been my 150th speech in the plenary, and it will also be my last."
"So, in saying farewell, I would like to wish all those of you who, like myself, will not be continuing to sit in the hemicycle of the European Parliament, every personal, professional and political success in the future."
"And to all of you who will be continuing, I hope that you will be in the fortunate position next September of celebrating a great victory for the Timorese people, as a result of their freedom of expression in deciding their own future in a referendum which will take place on 8 August."
"And as you have said that this will be your last speech in this Hemicycle, allow me to wish you the very best for the future. I also hope that we will continue to have a good relationship so that, wherever we may be, we can cooperate as far as possible in the fight to complete the process of European integration and in our solidarity with all those who need our support."
"I wish you the very best of luck, Mr Mendes Bota."
"Mr President, there has been a clear breakthrough, in international terms, in the situation in East Timor this year."
"It is quite correct, as my colleagues have stated here, that resolve on the part of the European Parliament has had its effect on this outcome."
"However, today, it has to be said, the situation is perhaps more explosive than it has been for a long time, as paramilitary activity has jeopardised the forthcoming referendum."
"We would all certainly call on the Commission to do all it can to defuse the situation in East Timor, so that the referendum on 8 August can be held in a peaceful atmosphere."
"For this to happen, the European Union should participate in an international effort to guarantee an international presence in East Timor."
"Australia has made significant proposals to the UN about this, and pledged to provide funding."
"Our task now is to consider what this presence would consist of - police forces operating under UN supervision, or perhaps peace-keeping forces - and I would be very interested to hear the Commissioner's views on this."
"The other important issue is that there are soon to be parliamentary elections in Indonesia, and preparations for the East Timor referendum are under way."
"We also surely need to send observers to monitor these events, not only official observers, but also representatives of voluntary organisations."
"I would like to hear if the Commission has made any preparations for this."
"Finally, I would like to say that there has been a seamless bond of cooperation among the Members of the European Parliament on the question of East Timor."
"Hopefully, that will continue during the next term, and let us hope, meanwhile, that East Timor achieves independence."
"Mr President, East Timor is a typical example of an area where human rights are under threat, and there is daily evidence that the lack of international law and of genuine recognition of the right to self-determination is producing some very dramatic situations."
"I hope that the new agreement will be a breakthrough, but at the same time I would join the previous speaker in urging that practical steps should be taken, including by the European Union, to ensure that appropriate pressure really is brought to bear."
"It is important to send observers, but it is also important for the UN to have a presence operating under appropriate instructions, because this is something else that is lacking and is creating increasing disillusionment."
"I hope that after so many years of suffering, law and order can finally be restored, that the right to self-determination will finally become a reality, and that the forthcoming referendum will give genuine democracy a chance instead of the increasing violence we are currently seeing in so many areas of Indonesia."
"I do not know whether this will be my last term of office and whether this will be my last speech, but wherever I am, I shall continue to work with all those fighting for the right to self-determination and human rights, because East Timor is only one of the many countries where war has been impossible to prevent."
"I hope that East Timor will prove to be an exception and will win its independence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should first of all welcome the agreement reached in New York yesterday between the Portuguese Government and Indonesia concerning East Timor."
"This is very much the culmination of a long process in which Parliament and the European Union have played their part, and in which the struggle of the people of East Timor has certainly played a key role, but at the same time we must pay tribute here to the importance of the diplomatic triumph achieved by the Portuguese Government yesterday in New York."
"This agreement and its implementation should provide us with a basis for achieving the desired results, that is to say enabling the Timorese people to freely exercise their right to self-determination and independence."
"This is why it is essential - despite what some Members might say - for us to recognise the importance of the commitment entered into yesterday that the referendum on 8 August should be held under the auspices of the United Nations and its Security Council. And that is also why in addition to the police force already mentioned here it should be possible to secure the presence of a security force."
"I consider that this case once again confirms the diplomatic force of an argument which has recently arisen on the international political scene, namely that the international community cannot apply double standards. If the international community demands that human rights should be respected in Kosovo, then it has to be consistent and demand that they should also be respected in other parts of the world."
"I know that the Portuguese Government has deployed this argument very effectively and that it will continue to do so, just as we should carry on using it to persuade the European Union to use its full political powers and its scope for financial support to ensure that the process in East Timor goes smoothly."
"This is the umpteenth time that we have discussed the issue of East Timor in the European Parliament. However, I feel that today our discussion is taking place in a climate of special political importance, because we are not just talking about a mere question of human rights but about a political issue."
"I would like to thank my colleague from the Socialist Group, Stanley Newens, whose persistence enabled us to get this point included on today's agenda."
"Mr President, I have to contradict Mr Barros Moura."
"The UN agreement that has been concluded does not talk about security forces, but only a civilian police force."
"The referendum on East Timor on 8 August will be held under a new government, and if people reject autonomy and integration it will bring the prospect of independence closer."
"Xanana Gusmo would like to see this, as would everyone else, and he has already said that he is going to need a great deal of help."
"I wonder who from - perhaps Australia, which is already stripping the territorial waters of minerals."
"It remains to be seen whether this is in the best interests of the Timorese in the long run."
"If it becomes independent, it seems obvious that it will go back to the situation before 1975, with Portugal resuming responsibility for this island which it abandoned to its fate and offering East Timor the status of an overseas territory like Guadeloupe or Martinique."
"Timor could then benefit indirectly from EU assistance."
"There are a number of general points I would like to make."
"After the collapse of Yugoslavia, the aspirations of the Kurds and the distinct revival of minorities and races, we should not be under any illusion about what East Timor's independence will mean for the Indonesian archipelago and the Asiatic region."
"If the new Indonesian Government does not succeed in holding the islands together, there is bound to be instability, with China emerging as the dominant factor in the region and other countries building up their stocks of weapons."
"In short, an independent Timor sounds all very romantic, and I also think that we need to be fair to the people of Timor, but in geopolitical strategic terms it would cause an imbalance."
"Do not forget that the largest Allied cemetery from the Second World War is in Indonesia, on Dili, which only goes to show just how strategically important the island is."
"I too believe that the people must have justice, and above all I think that Parliament must send observers after all the resolutions we have adopted."
"Mr President, thank you for refreshing my memory about the relevant part of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mrs van Bladel did indeed refer to a point in my speech about the kind of force that the United Nations is to send to this territory."
"It is indeed a police force. But I wish to emphasise that placing the entire referendum process under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council will inevitably make it necessary for the appropriate security forces to intervene if Indonesia does not comply with its duty to disarm the militias and to ensure this process takes place without interference from armed terrorist groups."
"That is exactly why I see the agreement that has been signed in such a positive light - as I think we all should - and I wanted to explain that to Mrs van Bladel."
"Mr President, the Commission naturally welcomes the fact that in the final round of tripartite negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations in New York, historic progress was made by the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments on resolving the longstanding, delicate and tragic problem of East Timor."
"The Commission applauds the signing of the agreement in the early hours of this morning, as indeed you all do. This agreement establishes the framework for the territory's autonomy, the methods and organisation of the referendum and also security provisions."
"In this respect, the Commission believes that the decision by President Habibie of Indonesia to approve the presence of United Nations observers is a step forward. These observers will supervise the referendum organised by the Indonesian authorities in East Timor."
"The Commission also believes that the establishment of a trust fund for this referendum by the United Nations is a positive step. And, in relation to this, I must report that this very week, and probably tomorrow, the European Union's financial contribution to this fund will be approved."
"This will provide a sum of EUR 1 million that will be aimed specifically at studying how the European Union can become involved in the process."
"You asked whether or not the European Parliament would participate as an observer during the referendum, as it usually does. In principle, this issue will have to be resolved by the Council of Ministers, which will determine how we should participate under the framework of the United Nations and with respect for the terms of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal."
"In any event, the European Union's financial contribution to the trust fund is guaranteed."
"Also, Mr Mendes Bota - as you and other Members highlighted, particularly Mr Newens - we do of course share your concern over the continued presence of armed militias. These militias are obviously interfering in the political process that is to lead to the referendum."
"As one speaker said, we will have to see how this matter can be resolved, although I would stress that within the agreement itself there are specific provisions on how to ensure and increase security."
"This is the United Nation's responsibility and I imagine that, through dialogue, organisation and the actual political implementation of the agreement, it will be possible to determine how to participate with security."
"But how will this happen?"
"One of the commitments in the United Nations agreement is to disarm the militias, as Mr Barros Moura pointed out."
"Disarming the militias is a promise that must be kept for the sake of security."
"We are convinced that Indonesia will have to make every possible effort to disarm the militias and, clearly, depending on how these efforts are received internationally, we will then be able to decide if corrective measures need to be taken, if there are sufficient police forces or whether more are needed and if we must send more international missions."
"At the end of the day, it is difficult at this stage to predict how the agreement signed in New York in the early hours of this morning will develop between now and 8 August."
"In any event, as far as the European Union is concerned, I have already told you that provisions have already been made and I can tell you that more are to follow. More specifically, at the request of the Portuguese Government, we have already begun work on the need to step up cooperation with the region, irrespective of the outcome, whilst naturally respecting the will of the people."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"Mrs Maes has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I wanted to ask Commissioner Marín whether he made those comments about the budget with a view to possible preparations for independence, if the majority of the people vote in favour of it."
"Mrs Maes, I must tell you that this is not a point of order."
"It is a supplementary question."
"I hope that Mr Marín will respond to your question, since we all know how courteous he is, and I, in turn, will be courteous and allow a point of order to become a supplementary question."
"Mr Marín, I would ask you to respond to Mrs Maes."
"Mr President, I would give up my life for this House."
"Laughter"
"I do not mind."
"There are two decisions."
"The first relates to the trust fund set up by Kofi Annan to carry out the whole referendum process, on the basis of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal."
"The Council of Ministers asked the Commission to draw up an emergency contribution."
"This emergency contribution has been set at EUR 1 million and will be presented next week so that it can be operational immediately."
"I would imagine that there will also be donations from other countries: from the Member States, from the United States and from Japan."
"This trust fund must be used to guarantee security, organise the referendum, prepare the electoral colleges, and allow for international observation."
"If the United Nations believes that European observers are needed, this will be possible thanks to this trust fund."
"However, over the past two years, a programme for humanitarian aid and emergency rehabilitation was established, based on the Council of Ministers' common position. It was carried out through Caritas, because of the importance of the Catholic Church in East Timor and, in particular, of the Nobel Prize winner, Archbishop Belo."
"This was a programme used only for humanitarian aid for emergency rehabilitation."
"Irrespective of the outcome on 8 August, the Commission is already considering a plan that could in theory become a cooperation programme that would enhance our involvement."
"Thank you, Mr Marín, for being as generous as usual."
"Mr Marín, I am very well aware that you are prepared to give up your life for Parliament, but you are not in danger of losing your life; you are in danger of being skinned alive."
"There are parliaments that can sometimes tear a person to shreds."
"Therefore, with my extensive experience, I must warn you to be careful, Mr Marín."
"Be careful."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0460/99 by Mr Colajanni and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0479/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0486/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0488/99 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0495/99 by Mr von Habsburg and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0503/99 by Mr Gahrton and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the Middle East peace process and the 4 May 1999 deadline."
"Mr President, Commissioner Marín, above all I would like to pay tribute to the Palestinian National Council, which has postponed the date of the unilateral declaration of independence scheduled for 4 May."
"It has made a gesture of political far-sightedness and unilateral generosity towards the peace process, it has avoided a period of upheaval and a negative influence on the elections in Israel and a serious crisis in the peace process, with the danger of military conflict flaring up again."
"This is what the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 11 March, in which, while recognising the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to found their own State, it considered it essential for the international guarantors of the Oslo agreements solemnly to reaffirm their commitment to achieving all the objectives of the peace process, thereby giving the Palestinian National Authority the support required to justify an extension of the period of application of the provisional agreement beyond the date of 4 May 1999."
"And this is what the Palestinian National Council has done."
"It did so because - apart from the request made by this House - there was a commitment made by the European Council in Berlin."
"Let me quote what we say in the resolution, that Parliament 'welcomes the statement issued by the Berlin European Council on the peace process, particularly the Palestinians' unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to create a State, which the European Union is prepared to consider recognising in due course, and the undertakings given by the European Union concerning the future settlement of the conflict.'"
"I feel that all this is important;"
"I believe that these commitments are binding and we should remember them."
"We must be faithful to them, and they will require a strong initiative to be taken by the European Union and the United States after the Israeli elections."
"Mr President, the Palestinian authorities are to be praised for their decision to accept an extension of the transitional period beyond 4 May."
"By agreeing to this, they have shown that they still believe in the Oslo accords and the Wye Plantation agreement, and they have also shown their desire to prevent the peace process from becoming bogged down."
"Without it, an escalation in the conflict would have been very likely, but now the Palestinian decision may increase the mutual trust that is needed for a lasting peace."
"We are also pleased with the statement made by the Berlin European Council, as Mr Colajanni said, and these sorts of clear political signals could give the Union greater influence in the Middle East."
"Internal divisions in the past have meant that the Union's political influence has always been too weak."
"It has always been the biggest provider of funds, but giving money is obviously much easier than agreeing a common political line."
"It was significant that the agreement of 23 October 1998 showed that constant external pressure is needed to keep the peace process going."
"Since that interim agreement, there have been too many wrong signals from both sides, most of them from Israel, I have to say, including granting approval for the construction of more houses in Har Homa and Hebron."
"In conclusion, I should like to ask the Commission, and in this case Commissioner Marín, what the situation is with the hospital in Gaza that is being built with European funding."
"During an earlier debate, the Commission told us that a management team had been sent to open the hospital at long last."
"I was just there, Commissioner, but I saw little evidence of it."
"Mr President, I too should like to know what Mr Bertens asked about the hospital, because I have also been there and it has been standing empty for far too long with no one using it."
"This is something we would find hard to justify to our voters."
"I am pleased that the Palestinians have allowed common sense to prevail by refraining from declaring an independent state on 4 May."
"Generally speaking, there has been little violence in the region in recent weeks, and certainly none of the bomb attacks that Hamas was probably responsible for."
"It would appear that the escalating violence in the Balkans has brought the two sides in the Middle East up short, since everyone knows that this kind of escalation can lead to unpredictable situations."
"So for the time being, people on both sides are using their common sense."
"However, the Palestinian position calls for an immediate and positive continuation of the negotiations with the Israelis after the elections."
"I also still think that a final positive outcome can only be achieved after agreements have been concluded with Syria and Lebanon."
"I submitted a written question this week calling for an amnesty for 250 people illegally detained on Palestinian territory, but I have heard from your office that my question is not to be answered or published."
"I only hope that the Palestinian representative in the public gallery has heard my appeal, and that these people will be given access to the judicial process."
"In recent times, we have paid frequent visits to the Palestinian territories under the leadership of Mr Colajanni."
"Progress has been made, but sadly not enough."
"A further initiative must be launched immediately after the elections to move everyone forward."
"Mr President, like my colleagues, I would like to say that, in order to protect the peace process, the Palestinians have demonstrated their good will by agreeing to postpone the date for the declaration of the Palestinian State, which the Oslo Agreement had set for 4 May."
"Meanwhile, the Israeli Government is continuing to violate its commitments and is increasing its provocation of the Palestinians by deciding to close Orient House in east Jerusalem and openly encouraging settlement, particularly in the West Bank."
"Was it not the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself, Ariel Sharon, who called on the settlers to take the hills in order to establish faits accomplis ?"
"His call was heard, as new settlements are constantly being established."
"Knowingly violating the Wye Plantation agreement of October 1998, which forbids any unilateral measures that could complicate negotiations on the final status of the territories, the Israeli Government is pursuing a deliberate strategy of draining the future negotiations of all substance and removing any possibility of the West Bank continuing as a territory, with the aim of preventing a future Palestinian state from being viable."
"The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation."
"Along with my colleagues, I welcome the fact that the Berlin European Council recognised the Palestinian people's right of self-determination and their right to establish a state."
"However, we need to go further than this and use all the political, economic and commercial means at our disposal to put pressure on Israel and to force the government to respect its commitments so that the two states can finally live in peace."
"Mr President, I speak here above all as someone who believes himself to be a true friend of the State of Israel."
"A European who experienced the Second World War and Hitlerism will always have profound sympathy for the persecuted Jews - the more so in my case, because so many of my friends lost their lives in that catastrophe."
"On the other hand, however, I have to say that my political thinking is governed by the principle that there must never be another war in the Middle East; a lasting settlement will never be achieved by force."
"So we must do everything in our power to bring about reconciliation between the Jews and Arabs."
"That is by no means impossible, for there are many Arab states, such as Morocco, where there is perfect understanding between Jews and Arabs."
"I have seen at first hand how the numerous Moroccan Jews in Israel are providing the most reliable bridge between Israel and the Islamic country of Morocco."
"It therefore makes good sense for us to table this sort of resolution at the present time."
"There has been a great deal of talk about the fact that the Palestinian State was to be proclaimed on 4 May, and I am pleased that Mr Arafat, who has shown great statesmanship in this situation, declared his willingness to postpone the proclamation."
"On the other hand, we must not forget that elections are looming in Israel, elections that will be crucially important to the future of the region."
"There are Israeli statesmen who clearly recognise that Israel cannot live without the friendship of the Arabs, that failure to cultivate that friendship will result sooner or later in the destruction of Israel."
"There are those such as Shimon Peres or some of his colleagues in the Labour Party who really do follow a clear political line in that respect, and that is why we should now express the hope that the Israeli side will declare unequivocally that it desires peace and that it will now halt the various repressive measures which have been taking place with regrettable regularity since the seizure of power and since the appointment of Mr Netanyahu as Prime Minister will now stop."
"We hope that the people who come to power in Israel will be totally committed to turning the present situation around and working for reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, since therein lies the future of the region."
"I believe that anyone who knows the Middle East will be aware that successful reconciliation will enable the region to flourish, and the various tensions that exist at the present time will then be no more than a sad memory of past intransigence."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the Palestinians have demonstrated admirable forbearance in not now doing what they have every right in the world to do, namely proclaiming a Palestinian state in accordance with the agreements which have been signed."
"Fifty years have passed since they were subjected to a similar fate to that afflicting the Kosovo Albanians today. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven out of their country, never to be allowed to return."
"The UN decided in 1947 that they should have their own state alongside the Jewish State of Israel, but they never got it."
"For many decades, the Palestinians lived in the illusion that liberation would come either through intervention by foreign armies, or in the wake of their own sustained military struggle."
"This was not to be."
"Not until the Palestinians switched to non-military methods, to civil disobedience through the intifada , to patient negotiations with an enemy perceived by them as fascist and racist - not until this happened did they begin to see signs of success. Now there is a peace process under way and, as a result, much of the world is willing to back their justified claims for an independent state."
"I think that it behoves us to remember these lessons of the past, and I hope that the liberation of small peoples will in future come about according to the Palestinian method. I trust that this will be the norm, and that the Kosovo method will remain a deplorable exception in the history of the world."
"I am a critic of the EU, but the Palestinian question is one which I think that the Union has handled in a constructive and positive fashion."
"I note with satisfaction the statement in principle that a future Palestinian state will be granted recognition."
"I hope that this actually happens once the Palestinians themselves decide to proclaim the State of Palestine."
"Mr President, the Palestinians have taken a courageous decision, and it is my wish that the Israeli Government - the present one and, I hope, its successor too - will take similarly courageous decisions, because we need a sovereign Palestinian State, we need the utmost respect for the sovereignty of Lebanon and Syria and, of course, for the sovereignty and security of Israel on the basis of a reconciliation process, as we heard from Otto von Habsburg, with whom I do not always entirely agree, but I am one hundred per cent behind him today."
"However, the reason I asked leave to speak was to thank, on behalf of my group, two men in this Chamber who have campaigned tirelessly for the rights of the Palestinians in that same spirit."
"The first is Vice-President Marín, whom we in this House have not always given an easy life - and nor has the Council, for that matter."
"Nevertheless, he has taken his decisions clearly and has pursued his aims, and for that I should like to express our very, very sincere thanks."
"I should also like to give our special thanks to Luigi Colajanni, who has done a great deal on behalf of our group for the Palestinians and whom we shall miss, particularly for his commitment to the Palestinian cause."
"On behalf of my group, I wish him all the very best for his future work."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I welcome this decision as an extremely positive one, just as I welcome the decision taken by the Palestinian Government not to unilaterally declare the creation of a state at the beginning of May."
"I believe that this would have seriously interfered in the electoral process taking place in Israel."
"I hope that a democratic government like the one country has had until now will emerge as a result of this process so that the negotiations will continue and arrive at a positive outcome for this peace process."
"I am convinced that the decision by the Berlin European Council on this matter was very positive and that it will help maintain the European Union's influence in this area."
"But elections will also need to be held in Palestine in the very near future. The European Union itself was present at the 1996 elections and soon a period of four years will have elapsed since then."
"Only once elections have taken place will we be able to genuinely talk about real dialogue between democratic states."
"Mr President, the European Commission also believes that the Palestinian leaders have taken the right decision in the interests of the Palestinian people by postponing the 4 May date for proclaiming a state."
"Better still, the Commission believes that this positive move was possible in part due to the courage displayed by the European Council in adopting the so-called Berlin Declaration on the Middle East."
"Our common foreign and security policy has worked properly in this instance as this declaration was important in guaranteeing the peaceful and constructive continuation of the peace process in spite of the fact that the first transitional period established by the Oslo Agreements had come to an end."
"As you know, the Commission already called for an increased political and economic role for the Union in the Middle East in its communication of January 1998."
"Nonetheless, it is clear that the tacit extension of the transitional period does not provide a long-term solution."
"In this respect, the European Union has expressed its belief that the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state that is democratic, viable and peaceful, created on the basis of the existing agreements and through negotiation would be the best guarantee of security for Israel and the best guarantee of success in the region. The European Union has stated that, in due course, it is prepared to recognise a Palestinian state established in this way."
"In the short term - as is also stated in the Berlin declaration - the European Union is still concerned about the stalemate in the peace process and, in this respect, it is vital that after the elections in Israel, the parties urgently turn their attention to fully applying the respective commitments made in the Wye Plantation memorandum."
"This would allow accelerated negotiations on issues relating to the region's permanent status to begin at the same time, with a view to concluding these negotiations within the set period of one year."
"Assuming that the parties involved show the political will needed to make progress, the European Union will continue to help them by facilitating the resolution of all outstanding matters."
"We must take all steps to ensure that the Wye Plantation Agreement does not become another Israeli or Palestinian agreement that is not applied."
"In this context, there should be no attempts to introduce new conditions."
"What is more, we agree with the United States that the Palestinian authorities have fulfilled, and are continuing to fulfil, the majority of their commitments."
"Consequently, we are keenly awaiting the next stages of withdrawals from the West Bank as well as the release of many prisoners."
"In addition, we still recommend that Israel should be flexible over fundamental issues such as safety on the roads between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the development, opening and completion of the port of Gaza itself, as these are issues that have been postponed for a long time."
"In this respect, the Commission is still working closely with Mr Moratinos, the European Union's special envoy responsible for common dialogue."
"We believe that the revitalisation of the Israeli-Palestinian aspect of the peace process would also facilitate the long awaited resumption of multilateral negotiations."
"And although the European Union is aware that this is extremely difficult, it will continue to try to revitalise and initiate cooperation."
"This means that we would also be very interested to see the Syrian and Lebanese parties becoming involved in the peace process."
"As regards the question by Mr Bertens and Mrs van Bladel concerning the hospital, the Gaza hospital is an UNRWA hospital. It is not a European Commission hospital nor is was it built by the European Commission; it is an UNRWA hospital."
"Nonetheless, in the guerrilla warfare of recent months, all the bad things taking place in the world are being blamed on the European Commission."
"The hospital was built by the UNRWA and it has received a contribution from the Community budget."
"Furthermore, there are other contributions from the Danish, German, Austrian, Spanish, Swedish and Belgian national budgets."
"So what happened?"
"There was a twelve-month delay in opening the hospital."
"The problem is now resolved, and as I sure you are informed about what you ask of the Commission, you must remember that we decided not to pay any more running costs."
"The European Commission must do what it can do well."
"The European Commission is not a hospital agent and it cannot run a large hospital thousands of kilometres away."
"Consequently, technical assistance has been given to the Palestinian Authority in the form of an international team that is going to work with the Palestinian authorities for two years. The aim of this is to ensure that the Palestinian Authority takes responsibility for managing the hospital."
"Fortunately, this issue has now been resolved."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0461/99 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0473/99 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0475/99 by Mr Manisco, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0480/99 by Mr Cars, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0496/99 by Mrs Lenz, Mr Soulier and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0502/99 by Mrs Aglietta and Mr Orlando, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the issue of the death penalty and a universal moratorium on capital punishment;"

"Death penalty"
"Mr President, a few days ago I received a letter from a committee set up in support of a campaign to save the life of Greg Sommer, one of so many people condemned to death and awaiting execution."
"Of course I, like many of my colleagues too, I imagine, would respond positively in this case, as in the cases of other people condemned to death in China, Iran and in many other countries as well as the United States."
"But we feel the time has now come to do something out of the ordinary: we would like to use this famous year 2000 - a year of great symbolic value for all the countries of the world, not just those with a particular tradition, history or religion - to make an exceptional gesture."
"If the year 2000 does have great symbolic value, let us seriously and genuinely use it to send out this universal message: let us have a moratorium on all cases where a death sentence has already been handed down, in other words let us suspend capital punishment."
"This is the request we are making in this resolution, which I think will meet with the approval of all the groups in Parliament."
"Our group fully supports it in any case."
"We therefore want to send a clear message to the Cologne Council: the German Presidency should ask for this issue to be put on the agenda for the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly and the Finnish Presidency should be given the task of following this decision through so that, by August, this item is on the United Nations' agenda and can actually be discussed at the next General Assembly."
"If this decision on a moratorium were actually to be taken at the next United Nations General Assembly, I think we would have sent out a positive message to all the countries of the world and we would also have raised a problem in those countries which refuse to tackle this subject in a decisive way."
"The death penalty is not justice but vengeance!"
"This needs to be realised once and for all in all the countries of the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that our colleague Mr Imbeni has summarised the aim of this resolution very well."
"It should be pointed out that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights approved three such resolutions in succession: in 1997, 1998 and 1999."
"As Mr Imbeni has just said, the time has come to use the year 2000 to take that qualitative leap and to present a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly for a universal moratorium."
"There is a majority of 101 countries, out of the total of 190 in the international community, who are in favour of a universal moratorium, and the Treaties that have been adopted and the constitutional changes that have been made by many countries show that it is not simply a theoretical majority."
"The conditions are therefore in place for launching an offensive that will undoubtedly not be the final step, but which could be a decisive move towards the definitive abolition of the death penalty in the world."
"I urge the Council and the Commission to work towards this."
"Allow me to point out an error - which is of a formal rather than a political nature - in the text of the resolution."
"I apologise for this and I will table an oral amendment to delete from recital E the words 'unlike the resolutions already adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, ' because this is not strictly correct."
"If my colleagues have no objection, I will table an oral amendment shortly, when it is put to the vote."
"Mr President, I see it as a great feat of civilisation that the European continent is now virtually rid of capital punishment."
"Such an advance would not have been possible without the unequivocal stance adopted by the European Union, and the world should be aware of that."
"This is a message that Europe can be proud to proclaim."
"There are positive developments outside Europe too, particularly in Latin America."
"In countries where democracy does not exist, however - in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq - the death penalty is often applied."
"Yet we still have one large democracy where ever more people are being executed, ever more people put to death."
"This is a serious issue in itself, and it brings with it certain consequences. China and the other countries I mentioned can say that 'as long as America continues to execute its citizens, why should we care what Europe thinks?'"
"Europeans shy away from criticising America."
"We have our good reasons; yet capital punishment must be combated."
"Let us make our voice heard; let us defend our position more forcefully and powerfully. Not in a spirit of moral superiority - that is not what I mean at all - but because we worry and care as fellow human beings."
"Mr President, on this Thursday, during this afternoon's topical and urgent debate, many of us here will obviously be delivering our final speeches on the subject of human rights."
"We have been making these speeches for 20 years, and our cooperation has been fruitful."
"It is perhaps slightly gratifying, if I may endorse what my colleagues have said, that we have seen some more progress on this very issue of the death penalty."
"It may be that we have played some part in ensuring that a third call is now being made in Geneva for a worldwide moratorium on executions."
"It is the sincere wish of our group, and of others too, that the Council should sponsor a motion to that effect at the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"That may be the only way to make those countries that Mr Cars has just mentioned realise that the death penalty is truly the worst means of restoring people's human dignity, for every person should have the opportunity to atone for the wrong that he or she has done."
"With the death penalty, that opportunity is irretrievably lost - quite apart from the fact that the death penalty is flagrantly abused in some cases."
"If we in the European Parliament have helped to broaden awareness of that, not only through Mr Dupuis reminding us to include the death penalty on every agenda but also simply by highlighting a number of facts time and again in the name of our Parliament, then perhaps we have contributed in some small way to the protection of human rights."
"In conclusion, Mr President, let me say that I fervently wish - and you will see whether this happens - that the next Parliament will continue this discussion, that it will not allow human rights to be squeezed out by economic issues, by the issues relating to enlargement, important though they may be, but that it will regard human rights as a political priority that must be pursued through the policies of the European Union, through its foreign policy and its enlargement policy."
"Abolition of the death penalty is part of that priority."
"There are many others, and I sincerely hope that they will all receive due consideration."
"Applause"
"Thank you very much, Mrs Lenz, for that statement."
"I would also like to thank you on behalf of our colleagues for the commitment and competence with which you have chaired the Subcommittee on Human Rights in the past and have continued to make a major contribution to it."
"I genuinely believe that your experience will be of use to us in all our future work."
"Thank you, Mrs Lenz."
"Mr President, our goal evidently has to be abolition of the death penalty."
"No nation in the world should employ capital punishment."
"We all need to castigate the USA, China and many other countries which so blatantly violate human dignity by persisting in allowing the death penalty to be imposed."
"Many of the EU Member States have an important role to play here."
"We have all been pioneers in fighting for the abolition of capital punishment."
"It would certainly be a step in the right direction if a universal moratorium, heralding an end to this practice, were to be proclaimed"
"I call upon the Council to make provision for this issue to be taken up during the next session of the United Nations General Assembly."
"Action will be required from both the German and the Finnish Presidencies to ensure that this actually happens, and that we can say goodbye once and for all to capital punishment."
"Mr President, I am delighted to make this last speech while you are presiding, and on this subject, as you have also helped us a great deal."
"We must be conscious of the great deal of work that remains to be done in order to civilise mankind, given that in 1999 we are still asking for a universal moratorium on capital punishment."
"I would like to discuss America, that vast country that claims to be the policeman of the world and the model of democracy, freedom and modernity."
"On 21 April, a fortnight ago, I became the first Member of the European Parliament to ever enter death row, in order to meet Mumia Abu Jamal, a political prisoner who has been sentenced to death, and on whose behalf Parliament has passed many resolutions."
"Something of me stayed in that prison in Greene, where 111 prisoners out of 600 were awaiting execution."
"Parts of me stayed in prison."
"It is not an image, it is a very physical experience."
"It hurts."
"I find the idea of his execution unbearable, as I do the execution of thousands who are sentenced to death, some of whom I saw behind Mumia Abu Jamal, wearing their white and blue prison clothes."
"Mumia Abu Jamal talked to me first of all about the tragedy in Denver, which had happened the day before, about Kosovo, and about the culture of death that is consuming American society."
"So today I would like to put a question to America."
"Your children are now killing your children."
"Are you going to educate them by putting them in the electric chair?"
"No."
"This violence is in fact the response to your state violence, which takes the form of the death penalty, but also the racist justice and class justice which Mumia condemned."
"In order to convince the Council and all of my colleagues to never give up on this issue, allow me to tell you a short anecdote."
"In the morning, before I arrived at the prison and death row, I gave a press conference."
"A journalist stood up and said to me that it had just been announced that three names had been given for the death warrants for May."
"He asked me if I took that as a response to what I was doing at the time in America."
"My first reaction was to shed tears, then I recovered myself, but it was unbearable to think about that."
"The reason I am telling you this today is to tell you that although the tears may not return, that emotion will stay with me until we have succeeded in obtaining this moratorium, in abandoning the ways of the past, the barbarity, and moving forward on the path of the future and of civilisation."
"I will finish this last speech, this last cry from the voice of those who have no voice, with the rallying cry of the black people, who are campaigning in large numbers against the death penalty in the United States, along with whites, Indians, Amerindians and Latinos, saying 'On the move!'"
"Kurdish question"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are speaking in this House about Turkey, and once again we do so with mixed feelings, because there are bad signs and there are a few good signs, and we are not sure of the direction in which Turkey is heading."
"First of all, the Öcalan case has come before the courts."
"We do not really have the impression that this is a fair, open and transparent trial."
"We have a feeling of unease, stemming from the fact that the death penalty is once again being made popular and respectable in Turkey, notably through the Öcalan trial."
"Secondly, we are deeply concerned that an extremely nationalistic party experienced a very strong upsurge in support at the last elections and that its manifesto does not call for conciliation with the Kurdish population, but rather the opposite."
"Thirdly, the HADEP party did well in the elections, especially in the Kurdish area, and there are now 41 HADEP members in charge of local administrations."
"We doubt whether these 41 mayors will be allowed to exercise their democratic rights as elected representatives of the people."
"There are already numerous indications that the government would really prefer to deprive the mayors of that right."
"We know that many, many dozens and indeed hundreds of people are still locked up in prisons, some of them officials of that selfsame party, without due process, without trial, without conviction."
"What about them?"
"When will they finally be released?"
"When will they stand trial before a court of law?"
"Why do the authorities hesitate to institute proceedings against these people?"
"There is probably no real evidence against them."
"Fourthly, there is Akin Birdal, whom I was able to visit in Ankara a few days after the attempt on his life and whom all, or at least many of us know as a staunch campaigner for human rights."
"He seems to have recovered enough to be put in prison, and he is to be taken into custody in the next few days."
"We know, however, that the care and treatment and the therapy he needs if he is really to be restored to full health will scarcely be possible in a Turkish prison."
"A serious question mark hangs over this case."
"Fifthly, perhaps the most encouraging feature of the whole situation is that there is a President of the Constitutional Court who said clearly and plainly only a few days ago that many legal provisions in Turkey would have to be amended because they were contrary to human rights, because they were incompatible with the rights that should exist in a democratic state."
"I hope that this school of thought can gradually gain the upper hand."
"It is a hard struggle, and I hope, Commissioner, Mr Vice-President, that you will speak out clearly on behalf of the Commission and the European Union in order to help that school of thought to prevail, because at the moment Turkey is turning away from Europe rather than moving in our direction."
"If we in this House and in this European Union do something to help the Kurds, we shall actually be doing something for Turkey and helping to bring it closer to the rest of Europe."
"Mr President, on 24 February we held a debate in Brussels following the arrest of Mr Öcalan, and I criticised the PKK terrorist organisation and Mr Öcalan himself."
"We have never tried to put a positive spin on his activities or his aims, and we only hope that the Turkish Government will ensure that his trial is open and fair, although we do not feel exactly optimistic about this."
"His lawyers have scarcely been given access to him, the national security court hardly seems the most appropriate place to be holding the trial, and no international observers are to be admitted."
"I hope that the new government in Turkey realises that if it wants to be rid of the Kurdish problem, Öcalan must certainly be given a fair trial."
"Mr President, this is a day - indeed a whole week - of goodbyes, but unfortunately we cannot say goodbye to the problems and issues that we have discussed in the topical and urgent debates."
"I also hope that we will not be saying goodbye to the debates themselves, because in the ten years I have been in Parliament I have heard it said almost every month that this would be the last time we would be having such a debate."
"I can tell you that I have done my calculations and I reckon that I have spoken some 428 times in the topical and urgent debates."
"I do not know whether it has ever achieved anything, but my successors - and your successor and the Commissioner's successor - should all bear in mind that this is the only channel the European Parliament has to show that we also care about people outside this House and outside Europe, and that we care about other things than just our salaries and pensions."
"Thank you and goodbye."
"That is all I wished to say."
"Applause"
"Mr Bertens, you are normally very calm and composed when you take the floor, even when commenting on the most sensitive of matters."
"I feel I share your state of mind and can understand the reasons why you raised your voice a little in making a demand which I am sure is endorsed by all colleagues, or at least those who are present in the Chamber at the moment."
"Mr President, Mr Öcalan will not have the open and fair trial we call for in our resolutions."
"I have here the press release of the public prosecutor's office of the Ankara State Security Court, signed by the public prosecutor, Tjerdet Volkan, which rules out the participation in the trial of 'observers from any institution or organisation whatsoever'."
"It provides for the participation of the general public, insofar as the capacity of the court room allows, with the authorisation of the special office of the Court and then not for all the days of the trial."
"Of course, Mr President, Turkey has not been put under any serious pressure - and I do not mean the outrageous bombing that others are suffering - to comply with the standards of a modern European rule of law, for reasons which the Council, so sensitive and so rigorous in other circumstances, has not managed to explain!"
"This weakness does not simply concern Mr Öcalan, but the more important issue of the human rights of all Turks and, more especially, the large Kurdish minority in Turkey, whose identity, language, education and political expression is not recognised."
"The HADEP Party is savagely persecuted, Leyla Zana, the recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for the defence of human rights is in prison, and we do nothing."
"Could the Council, as it does in other circumstances, perhaps express its condemnation of this suppression of the political and cultural rights of the Kurds?"
"How does the Council - and, what is more, the Commission - plan to exert its influence to reform and improve the regime that is being enforced against the Kurds?"
"The bottom line is that Turkey and its people, of whatever national and linguistic origin, belong to the European horizon, and the 'humanitarian' and 'liberal' declarations which most governments in the European Union - also members of NATO - allegedly want to implement within a wider Europe relate to them."
"Is there anyone in the Council or the Commission who has something convincing to say on these matters, Mr President?"
"Mr President, this morning Mr Öcalan's lawyers told the House that they are totally unable to work and that they have even come under threat."
"Parliament is right to continue to call for Mr Öcalan to be given a fair trial."
"But we must not forget that we have pushed this man from one country to another because we ourselves were unable to try him - and there was a warrant out for his arrest - under our own legal systems."
"In addition to this, however, if we look at the situation since we concluded the Customs Union with Turkey, it has actually turned its back on us, and the recent elections showed that it is turning inwards and becoming increasingly nationalistic, and with the events nearby in the Balkans there will be little scope for the fundamental aspirations and rights of the Kurds. Or perhaps there will be."
"Perhaps there is a sensible man in Ankara who thinks the time to negotiate with the Kurds and to forge a new relationship with them is now or never."
"But this would require an international confidence-building plan with a fixed timetable, and there is still no mention of that."
"I hope there is a politician or perhaps a former Commissioner somewhere who could draw up such a plan so that, having left office, he can help to bring the Turks and the Kurds closer together."
"But it would have to be a plan with a fixed timetable that can restore confidence, because having to receive Kurds every day in your office is no joke, believe me."
"I am perfectly happy to do it, but it is not helping them."
"Mr President, this is not only about Mr Öcalan or about whether or not he is to be put on trial."
"I come from Germany, and in my country Mr Öcalan would have received a trial."
"This is about the fact that we rightly expect Turkey to ensure in the next few days or months that the procedure and outcome of this trial are in accordance with the rule of law."
"That is what Europe legitimately expects of Turkey, a country with a great interest in becoming a member of the European Union."
"If Turkey really does want to become a member of the European Union, it must show us how the rule of law applies to the treatment of a defendant in its trials."
"That is the substance of this motion which we are discussing today and which we shall probably adopt tomorrow."
"This expectation of ours must not be misinterpreted in Turkey."
"The Turkish judicial authorities and the other Turkish authorities involved in this trial ultimately have a very important task."
"If they genuinely want to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem, they must now treat Mr Öcalan properly as a defendant."
"There can be no talk of his being guilty before the prosecution has proved its case in court."
"He must be treated fairly at all costs, and his lawyers must not suffer harassment because they are representing him."
"If Turkey maintains it is a European country, a country fit for the European Union, these European values, these Western standards, must be applied there."
"We want no more than that, which is why we ask Turkey not to misunderstand these efforts that the European Parliament is making."
"Malaysia"
"Mr President, the justice system in Malaysia is clearly rotten to the core."
"No self-respecting democracy would allow the flagrant infringements of human rights that are occurring there."
"Malaysia claims to be democratic; yet it arrests and imprisons individuals who seek peacefully to express political or religious views, denying them due legal process. This is no way to behave."
"It is incumbent upon us to take these matters up with the Malaysian authorities and make them understand."
"The treatment of homosexuals in the country is another issue which needs to be raised."
"It is disgraceful - and a crime against fundamental human rights - that people can be sentenced to up to 20 years in gaol for having engaged in homosexual relations."
"Provided two individuals have consented to have such contact, there are no grounds for condemning them."
"We must continue to argue along these lines in order to ensure that homosexuals are not treated in such a way."
"Against this background, it is a pity that we did not demonstrate greater understanding of homosexuality by showing the renowned exhibition entitled Ecce homo in Parliament's premises."
"Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in support of the joint resolution on the political misuse of trials in Malaysia, I have to say to the Malaysian authorities that it is very difficult for any of us to have any sympathy with their recent actions."
"Firstly they continue to maintain their internal security act which, against any normal conception of human rights, allows those peacefully expressing both religious and political opinions at odds with those of the government to be arrested, denied proper legal representation or even a fair trial."
"Secondly, they have a penal code which - as Mr Holm said earlier - condemns homosexual acts between consenting adults with a punishment of whipping and up to 20 years' imprisonment."
"Thirdly, all the evidence is that the trials of both Anwar Ibrahim and Lim Guan Eng were politically motivated."
"We know that Anwar Ibrahim was physically abused prior to his trial."
"He received six years in jail for corruption, following what most outside observers considered to be farcical proceedings which were a travesty of any notion of justice."
"And yet they continue to pursue him with threats of yet more trials."
"In conclusion, we have to urge the Malaysian authorities to recognise that the development of further political and economic cooperation between the European Union and Malaysia will largely depend on the opening of a serious dialogue that will lead to moves in Malaysia for the observation of basic human rights in that country."
"Djibouti"
"Mr President, as in December 1997, unfortunately we are again having to turn our attention to human rights violations in Djibouti and in particular to the situation of political prisoners, who are not only subjected to unlawful imprisonment, which is unacceptable in our eyes, but also to every kind of ill-treatment, which in some cases has caused the deaths of some of them."
"Unfortunately this is just one aspect of the ethnic and political oppression which has deprived most of this country's people of their basic rights."
"Through our resolution we therefore intend to call upon the authorities of Djibouti, and first and foremost President Guelleh, to rectify this unacceptable situation."
"I would point out that the Horn of Africa is devastated by conflicts of every type; it is up to the Djibouti authorities to decide whether to let their country plunge into violence, instability and lawlessness or, on the other hand, to rebuild the conditions necessary for coexistence on new foundations."
"We feel that this partly depends on the revival of a peace and stability process for the entire region."
"Therefore we urge that there should be a stop to all ill-treatment of political prisoners, and that they should be given access to any care and treatment required, allowed a fair trial and be released."
"Respect for human rights must also be restored and guaranteed for all and, above all, any discrimination based on ethnic origin must cease."
"The government of Djibouti also undertook to respect this principle when it signed up to the Lomé Convention, Article 5 of which states that each signatory shall be guided by the principles of respect for human rights and democratisation of their own country."
"I think Article 5 should be borne in mind because if, first and foremost, the specific situation of political prisoners and, more generally, the human rights situation are not improved, the application of this article and the measures which derive from it is an option worth considering."
"Thank you for those words, Mr Vecchi, and for the commitment which you have shown to the problems of the ACP countries and also demonstrated in the committee which has been responsible for all aspects of cooperation and development."
"Mr President, ten years ago Parliament was discussing human rights violations in Kosovo and now there is a war there."
"Today we are talking about Djibouti and other countries, and I am firmly convinced that if we take the right measures now we can help these countries to develop peacefully and to avoid war."
"A new president has been elected in Djibouti, so this is a good time to point out that there must be an end to the human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of political prisoners, who are left languishing in prison untended and without rights."
"We are not trying to deny that there is armed opposition in Djibouti, but even unarmed political opponents are thrown into prison anyway, and that is unacceptable."
"Djibouti is one of the countries covered by the Lomé Convention, and we should regard this as a contract between us and point this out to the other countries involved."
"We should make it clear to them that we cannot provide any financial assistance whatsoever if they spend it on arms which they then use to wage war and even to oppress their own people, particularly the Afar tribe."
"We know the enormous suffering that war brings, and just because Djibouti is a little further away we must not forget this, otherwise it will be too late there as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several colleagues who have taken the floor before me have mentioned Article 5 of the Lomé Convention, to which Djibouti is also a signatory, which establishes a genuine interrelation and operational interplay between respect for and enjoyment of political and civil rights and fundamental human freedoms and development aid."
"I think we should press this point very strongly."
"We cannot be satisfied with the answer that a country's straitened economic circumstances are an obstacle to the establishment of a fully-fledged democracy."
"I think it would be more true to say precisely the opposite!"
"Indeed in the developing countries, those which have signed the Lomé Convention, we see many good examples of countries which have got under way with economic development as a consequence of the re-establishment of democratic rules, and for precisely this reason we should put more pressure on Djibouti to comply with this genuine contractual agreement it has entered into with its European partners."
"Mr President, it is sometimes difficult to find different or new words to say what we think of the violations of human rights that we discuss during every sitting in this House."
"We agree with everything that has been said by the previous speakers from all groups."
"As Mrs Maes said, I think that we should indeed take advantage of the recent election of the new President, Mr Guelleh, in order to define the Union's position very clearly and firmly and to indicate that we will see to it that the famous Article 5 is applied very soon."
"The arrest of a number of leaders of the opposition outside the borders of Djibouti, notably in Ethiopia and Yemen, their extradition to Djibouti and their imprisonment, the conditions in which they are being detained, the absence of a trial and of lawyers, the particularly difficult and distressing conditions of their imprisonment: we are aware of all these things and it is clear that we cannot allow this to happen."
"The Djibouti authorities must know that we are going to act swiftly and that we are going to make use of the texts to which their country is a signatory."
"Mr President, I think that if we delay we are in danger of being faced with an even more distressing and even more difficult situation in a few months' time, if that is possible given the fate of those whom we are discussing."
"Therefore, on behalf of my group, I call upon the Commission and the Council to take firm and immediate action as quickly as possible, so that our intentions will be made known without delay."
"International Criminal Court"
"Mr President, I think we would all recognise that the Rome Conference on 18 July 1998 on the Statute of the permanent International Criminal Court represented a step forward in terms of international institutions and in the international legal order concerning human rights."
"Nevertheless, before this Court can actually become effective in practice, its Statute has to be ratified by at least 60 countries."
"And up to now, with the honourable exceptions of Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago and San Marino, no other country in the international community has ratified it yet, although some have started the ratification process."
"So the objective of the resolution we have submitted is to get the Statute ratified by at least 60 countries by the end of the year 2000, so that the International Criminal Court can start to function in that year. The resolution further calls upon the Council to include this objective on the agenda of the European Council in Cologne."
"Now, I believe that at a time when we are discussing the right to humanitarian intervention, and at a time when it is recognised that the international community requires instruments enabling it to defend fundamental human rights where they are being violated in a serious and flagrant manner, it is clearly perverse that there should be delays in creating what might be viewed as a legal forum governing the right of intervention, which is precisely what this would be. It is equally paradoxical that it should be precisely a number of those countries that are practising so-called 'humanitarian intervention' which have the most reservations about approving the Statute of the International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that this Statute contains an unacceptable exclusion clause."
"That is why I believe that it is important for us to appeal to those countries, and above all our Member States and the larger countries, to ratify the Statute and to specifically reject the exclusion clause on war crimes, so as to create a genuine legal body with compulsory jurisdiction, through which we can legitimise the right of intervention."
"Mr President, the current difficulties in punishing those who have committed crimes such as genocide, war crimes and, in general, crimes against humanity have more than demonstrated the need to establish an International Criminal Court. It must be operational as soon as possible and be able to effectively try those responsible for such crimes so that they do not go unpunished."
"In this context, it is disappointing that no Member State of the European Union has ratified the Statute for this Court. This is all the more disappointing when we take account of the fact that the Union claims to be not only an area of pluralism and diversity but, in particular, a Community of law."
"The ratification of the Statute of the Court, with no exclusions in terms of its remit, would demonstrate our commitment to complying with the law and to defending freedoms and human life. These objectives of the Union are at least as important as our commercial objectives."
"For this reason, I am calling on the Council and the Commission today to establish the ratification of the Statute of the Criminal Court as a political objective for the Union."
"When we talk about the right to intervene, this House believes that the right to intervene is valid when it refers to military situations but not when it refers to other matters."
"Mr President, the purpose of this resolution is to underline the importance attached by Parliament to speedy ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. We want to see the court operational as soon as possible."
"Nothing that has occurred in Kosovo or anywhere else has diminished the significance of this."
"The Liberal Group unanimously endorses the call for such a court to be set up."
"This week - in the course of my three final speeches in the European Parliament - it has given me great satisfaction to be able to speak out in favour of peace and freedom in Kosovo, to support the EU's fight for the abolition of the death penalty, and to argue for an international tribunal to judge war crimes."
"These three issues reflect some of the basic values underpinning our Union: freedom for the oppressed, the rule of law, democracy and common humanity."
"As a student from a country which did not take part in the Second World War, I was horrified by what that conflict produced."
"For me too, European integration came to figure as the key to overcoming hatred and building a new and better order for a healed and whole Europe."
"I have met many people in this Parliament who feel the same way and have as a result become my friends."
"Much more than I could ever even have dreamed of as a young man has come about, but a great deal still remains to be achieved."
"I like to believe that there will always be people with dreams and expectations of a better Europe and a better world - people with the strength and determination to make their dreams a reality."
"Mr President, I believe it is really very significant that this Parliament, which has concerned itself so much with human rights issues, should conclude its topical and urgent debates on human rights for this term by turning its attention once again to the question of the International Criminal Court."
"I think that Parliament has done a great deal of work in that direction through its intergroup, which bears the significant name 'No peace without justice'."
"I believe one thing must be clear to us here, namely that this intergroup which deals with the subject of the International Criminal Court, and of which my colleague Mr Dell'Alba is one of the leaders, is saying quite plainly that there must be justice with a legal basis."
"Sad to say, we usually have a legal basis for various operations, as we are witnessing in Kosovo at the present time; we have it at international level through the United Nations or through an organisation such as NATO, we have it at national level and at regional level, where such legal provisions can be effectively enforced."
"One area in which we are regrettably without such a legal basis is that of ethnic groups and minorities."
"I believe that is the reason why many conflicts of the past ten to fifteen years have been pursued by force of arms rather than before a tribunal or a criminal court."
"I therefore consider it especially important that we in the European Union should act with the utmost vigour and tell our Member States that they should be among the first to ratify the Statute of this International Criminal Court and that they should press for the establishment of the Court and not leave it to other states, such as San Marino and Senegal, which have devoted themselves to this cause with admirable zeal."
"We should set an example here."
"The European Parliament, with its tradition of commitment to human rights, certainly possesses excellent credentials in this area."
"Mr President, we now need this International Criminal Court more urgently than ever before."
"The turn taken by events in recent years has borne out what we have been repeating all along in this House."
"What is needed is an international forum in which - before there is recourse to military means - issues can be managed and resolved in a dignified way."
"It was a major step forward when the Statute was adopted last July, but I deplore the fact that not one of the EU's Member States has yet ratified it."
"The procedures ought to have been set in train much more swiftly."
"I am pleased to see that as many as 82 countries have in fact signed the Statute, but it is regrettable that only three have ratified."
"Let us all go back home to our Member States and ensure that our governments sign and ratify this Statute as soon as possible."
"We owe this service to the next millennium."
"Mr President, I am particularly glad that the last time I take the floor during this parliamentary term should be to speak on the subject of the International Criminal Court."
"I would like to thank Karl Habsburg very much indeed for mentioning the role of the intergroup we set up with so many colleagues."
"The 'No peace without justice' campaign by the international radical movement has helped to promote what I feel amounts to one of the most important messages we can pass on at the end of a century which has been the bloodiest in history."
"Just three countries have already ratified the Statute of the Court but others are about to do so."
"Our country, Mr President, will probably do so at the end of May, and France is well on the way."
"A strong signal needs to come from Cologne so that the fifteen Member States, whose role was decisive for the success of the Rome Conference, should set the tone for the other countries and be the first to ratify the Statute."
"It is not by chance that the very first countries to do so were an African country, a Caribbean country and San Marino."
"Europe is lagging behind somewhat: it should pass on this message!"
"I hope that Parliament will state this clearly afterwards."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk today about justice and security, we can begin with an example close to home."
"A few weeks ago in front of the Parliament building in Brussels, a woman was murdered."
"The important thing is that the culprit should be quickly arrested, brought to trial and fairly sentenced."
"It is exactly the same with international human rights."
"We cannot simply tolerate and accept the violation of human rights."
"What we need is a system whereby offenders are extradited and made to face the consequences of their actions."
"Justice and security, after all, are among the main pillars on which our European Union is built, and not only our European Union but also the applicant countries and the rest of the world."
"We must campaign to ensure that our 15 Member States recognise the International Criminal Court and also that the rest of the world acknowledges these principles of justice and security."
"Mr President, I should like to pass on the European Commission's reactions to the different points that have been raised in this urgent debate on human rights."
"As regards the death penalty and the establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, as you are all aware, on 28 April, the European Union did in fact take the initiative of submitting a draft resolution on the death penalty to the Commission on Human Rights."
"This resolution was approved by 30 of the 53 member countries of this Commission and was sponsored by 72 states, seven more than in the previous session."
"In other words, awareness of this situation is being raised at international level. We must not give up hope as this type of battle, just like the battle you highlighted, and as is usually the case with all problems that affect human beings, is won on the basis of a persistent day-to-day fight."
"Consequently, in relation to previous situations, there is no doubt that we are making progress."
"Of course, whether or not the United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution is in the hands of its members."
"If it were up to the Commission, we would have no trouble promoting it."
"As regards the Kurdish issue and the Öcalan case, I would point out that, as you all know, the European Union adopted a declaration on the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan and the trial that is to take place in the near future."
"And, of course, the Commission fully supports the declaration made by the Union."
"More specifically, the Commission stresses that the trial must be public, it must comply with the rule of law, it must take place before an independent court, Mr Öcalan must have access to a defence lawyer of his choice and international observers must be allowed to attend."
"The Commission is disappointed with the response from the Turkish Government stating that they will not admit international observers and it takes note of the fact that it has been assured that the trial will be a public one."
"We also deeply regret the request for the death penalty from the private prosecution."
"The Commission will pay close attention to the trial and the procedures followed."
"As regards Malaysia, the Commission shares your view that the Malaysian Government must ensure that its legal system is not misused for political reasons."
"In line with this view, and given that Mr Anwar Ibrahim has already spent almost seven months in prison without bail being set, the Commission considers that the trial and the appeal the defence lawyers have already announced, must be concluded in accordance with the internationally accepted criteria on guaranteeing a fair trial."
"The Commission also trusts that the necessary legal measures will be taken to determine who is responsible for the verbal and physical assaults on Mr Anwar Ibrahim."
"This also shows that the incident is linked to the current debate in Malaysia on the reform of the police."
"The Commission is still concerned that if fundamental human rights continue to be restricted, such as the right to peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, this may give rise to a climate of instability and social unrest in Malaysia."
"As for Djibouti, the Commission is aware that some political figures are being held in the Gabode prison and fully shares your concerns over the fate of these political prisoners."
"In all its contacts with the country's authorities, the Commission has reiterated its position on the respect for fundamental human freedoms and the rule of law."
"The Commission has also taken note of the recent proposals made by the Government of Djibouti which seek to allow the Red Cross or any other independent bodies to carry out inspection visits of the prisons."
"And, of course, we warmly welcome this position from the new government."
"Contact has been made with the International Committee of the Red Cross and with the Member States so that they can begin helping displaced persons and refugees to return home, thus respecting their right to return to their place of origin."
"As regards the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, I naturally believe that you have pointed out something that is mere common sense: the sooner this Court is up and running, the easier it will be to address and begin to resolve problems such as those in the Balkans - with Kosovo as the most recent example - as well as other problems throughout the world."
"But of course we also believe, in particular, that our Member States should set an example and speed up the ratification procedures in the various national parliaments."
"I should also like to draw to your attention to the fact that the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has been receiving financial support from the Community for several years."
"The Commission intends to continue to provide this support within the terms of the regulation adopted by the Council, which creates the legal basis that allows us to carry out and develop actions in the field of human rights."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0487/99 by Mr Pasty, Mr Andrews and Mr Girão Pereira, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0507/99 by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0508/99 by Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Allianceon the situation in the Comoros."
"Mr President, I would like to make a couple of comments on the joint motion for a resolution on the Comoros, which obviously begins by condemning the recent coup d'état. I should say 'the most recent' coup d'état, because goodness knows the Comoros have experienced a considerable number of them since gaining independence in 1975: this is the eighteenth one to be recorded!"
"Several comments have been made concerning the responsibility that could be attributed to those responsible for the secession of the island of Anjouan in the current crisis."
"To a certain extent the problem is like that of the chicken and the egg."
"In other words, the question is who first caused the problems."
"The fact that some of the problems in the Comoros have worsened and have been repeated is very probably because the existence of some populations with their own crises and their own problems, particularly on the island of Anjouan but also on the island of Mohéli, was not taken sufficiently into account."
"Mr President, some people here - I know that Mr Hory is going to take the floor in a moment - know this area and the problems that it faces infinitely better than I do. What we can hope is that we are able to find a solution - and the Union must take part in this - that will be capable of stabilising relations between the three islands, if this is possible."
"In any case, this is what we want to see. This solution must also take account of the specific and particular needs of the people of each of these islands, needs which are specific even though the various populations are not very far from each other."
"Personally, Mr President, I must say that I regret that recital G of this joint motion for a resolution casts some doubt on Parliament's opinion concerning the initiatives taken by the chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Mr Michel Rocard."
"Personally, I approved and supported them."
"Mr President, having observed the political collapse of the Comoros, we could well think that they are the victims of some sort of bad luck."
"In fact bad luck has nothing to do with it, and if we consider the situation objectively, we can clearly see three levels of responsibility."
"Firstly - and even though it is not at all fashionable here to say such things - there is the responsibility of the Comoran people, or more precisely, of their leaders."
"In the 19th century the Comoros were called the islands of the battling sultans, because Grande Comore and Anjouan were dominated by a few supposedly noble families who had been fighting for power for centuries, and who forced the vast majority of the population to bear the weight of their privileges by enforcing vast social inequalities, unjustifiable financial monopolies and a truly medieval structure of society."
"This is the first level of responsibility."
"In the current crisis - and this is not a fashionable thing to say either - the responsibility of the Organisation of African Unity must be underlined. It is theoretically in charge of reconciling the people of Grande Comore with those of Anjouan after the secession of the island of Anjouan."
"The sole activity of the OAU, if not its sole raison d'tre , seems to be to defend the old colonial borders, against everything, against everyone, and even against obvious facts."
"The OAU is therefore very understandably accused of partiality, as it has shown itself to be indifferent to even the most legitimate claims made by Anjouan and Mohéli."
"Finally, and I will not dwell very long on this point, there is the responsibility of France, which has been caricatured by the fact that the eighteenth coup d'état in the Comoros coincides with the opening of the trial in Paris of the mercenary, Bob Denard, who in 1975, 1978, 1989 and 1995 was himself responsible for four coups d'état in Moroni and who is suspected of murdering two Comoran heads of state."
"Today we have learnt that a former French Minister for Cooperation and Development will attend the trial to testify in his favour."
"I think that is all that need be said."
"Having established these responsibilities, it seems that the European Union has a duty to make up for the inability of the usual key players on the Comoran stage by mounting a political initiative for inter-island reconciliation, a considerable degree of humanitarian aid, particularly for Anjouan, and a fresh emergency economic aid programme for the Comoros."
"Personally - and I will now conclude - I would like to stress this urgency from a particular point of view."
"As Mr Lehideux was kind enough to say, I am fortunate to have a last chance to speak in this House on a subject which concerns me personally."
"Since 1997, in Mayotte, which has fortunately remained French territory, there has been a massive and artificial influx of refugees as a result of the crisis in the Comoros that neither the public services, the local economy nor the people of Mayotte can withstand for much longer."
"The stabilisation of the Comoros is therefore the condition necessary for peace in the entire region."
"Mr President, it is with some emotion that I am making my last speech in this Parliament."
"The Islamic Republic of Comoros is a state which for many years now, virtually ever since independence, has been living through a serious institutional crisis, as previous speakers recalled."
"And it is the very unity of the country, or rather of the three islands making it up, that is constantly being called into question."
"A few days ago a framework agreement was reached - helped on its way by the unobtrusive but extremely important work of President Michel Rocard, to whom we pay tribute - which did and still does provide a good basis on which to re-establish conditions enabling coexistence between the various islands and the very survival of a state in the Comoros."
"The military coup d'état, which we of course condemn, followed in the wake of a number of serious incidents on Grande Comore against people from the island of Anjouan and was also due to the civil authorities' inability to uphold the process of state reunification and reconciliation."
"I believe that two things need to be done: the first is surely to re-establish constitutional and civil order and put an end to the coup d'état, which - as colleagues have pointed out - is the eighteenth one since the mid-seventies; and secondly, and at the same time, the process of seeking a national agreement needs to continue and should also deal with those forces, not just military forces, wishing to maintain the supremacy of the people in one island over the others."
"For that reason it is important that the representatives of the island of Anjouan be allowed to consult the people and to sign up to the agreement which all the others had endorsed before the coup."
"Furthermore, the international community, working inter alia through the Organisation of African Unity, but with the European Union playing an active role, should back this agreement and get to work preparing an economic assistance programme of both emergency and long-term aid, to allow the country to recover in economic terms as well."
"This agreement would moreover, if it were successful, set a positive example for other African countries experiencing crises of a similar order and complexion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as pointed out in the first paragraph of the preamble to the resolution and by Mr Lehideux, this is the eighteenth coup d'état in the Comoros in the last twenty-four years, making one every sixteen months."
"This statistic is sufficient to convey the difficult situation of a region which would otherwise have every likelihood of taking the right path towards democracy and development."
"We need only think of the example of Mauritius, which has many similar cultural and geopolitical characteristics."
"Therefore, in my own humble opinion and in that of the group I represent, the European Union must deliver a clear, specific and united response from."
"Actions by individual politicians and countries are important, but only a collective effort on the part of the Union can bring something good out of this difficult and troubled time."
"And having expressed this hope, Mr President, I would like to thank you in your capacity as President for the achievements of these last five years, and I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly those taking part in meetings on human rights and matters of urgency, for all the work they have done here and for all that I have learned from them."
"Mr President, the European Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns over the situation in the Comoros following the coup d'état which took place on 30 April 1999."
"As you are well aware, the Commission reacted immediately and stressed the European Union's disapproval to the chief of staff, Colonel Azali Assoumani, drawing his attention to the principles on which our cooperation is based, the main elements of which are the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"Furthermore, the European Commission has suggested to the Member States that they should apply the procedure set out in Article 366 of the Lomé Convention, which allows them to suspend cooperation with the Comoros."
"In addition, the Commission is examining with the Member States the possibility of a diplomatic initiative aimed at applying the agreement signed in Madagascar on 29 April 1999 under the auspices of the OAU."
"Since 1998, the Commission has financed humanitarian aid programmes to the order of EUR 1 million to improve the situation of the people of Anjouan in terms of nutrition and health care, and the Commission has just approved a new programme to the value of EUR 730 000 which is aimed at providing primary health care. It is also examining whether or not it would be appropriate to approve an additional humanitarian aid programme in view of the requirements on the three islands as a result of the political instability."
"The Commission's office in the Comoros is paying close attention to how the situation develops and, according to our latest information, the situation is calm and the army has established the initial contact needed to establish a transitional government in accordance with the agreement reached in Madagascar."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"Mr President, I would like to make a point of order, to clarify, although everyone will have guessed it, that the former French Minister for Cooperation and Development, who is testifying in favour of the mercenary Bob Denard, is not Mr Jean-Pierre Cot."
"Thank you for that clarification."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0457/99 by Mrs Stenzel and others-B4-0458/99 by Mr Pompidou, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0464/99 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0484/99 by Mr Frischenschlager and Mr Eisma, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0489/99 by Mr Manisco and Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0499/99 by Mr Chichester and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0500/99 by Mr Weber and Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0505/99 by Mr Voggenhuber and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the nuclear power plant in Temelin."
"Mr President, in a few days' time, the Czech Government will make its decision on the completion of the nuclear power station in Temelin."
"Let me quote the report by the International Commission on Temelin, which said that there is currently an excess productive capacity and that power from the Temelin plant can only marginalise the use of other resources for power production."
"The stage has already been reached when any solution to the Temelin project will have more adverse than beneficial effects."
"Completion may bring even greater financial losses than discontinuing the construction work would cause."
"Economically, then, the situation is very tricky to downright crazy."
"And yet Western industries are still trying to make money there and have no compunction about possibly creating economic difficulties for a young democracy which, I hope, will very soon be a member of the European Union."
"The International Atomic Energy Agency formulates minimum technical safety standards for nuclear plants which even nuclear power stations in the third world could satisfy."
"That is well known."
"This assessment does not come from me, but from very high-ranking diplomats and scientists."
"I consider that to be an insult to the Czech Government and an affront to the Czech people."
"In its conclusion of 7 December 1998 on nuclear safety, the Council, distancing itself from the IAEA, speaks of a 'high level of nuclear safety'."
"That is quite a different matter!"
"If I may quote the Temelin report again, it says that the release of radioactive substances will be prevented by a simple concrete shell in the event of a nuclear accident. How simple, I wonder!"
"So when and where will it be stored? Whatever the answers to these questions, I should like to thank all of my colleagues, particularly those from my own group, who intend to vote in favour of this resolution today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety has always been a very important subject in this House, since we are all aware that an accident in a nuclear power station affects not only the people who live and work nearby but also everyone else in Europe, and that we must therefore devote very special attention to safety."
"As the previous speaker said, the government of the Czech Republic has been faced in these past few weeks with a decision as to whether or not the construction of the Temelin nuclear power station is to be completed."
"Ever since the borders between the Czech Republic and my own country were opened, this nuclear plant has been a source of endless amazement, since it was supposed to have been completed several years ago."
"Time and again they said the work would be done, but time and again it failed to materialise."
"I believe that all these points have to be considered very carefully; the fact that money has been spent on it already is no reason to finish building something that is neither safe nor economical."
"However, I should like to highlight another point here."
"My group is not only anxious to voice our concerns about public safety in the European Union and in the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries; it also wishes to see aid being offered to promote change, to promote another form of energy production, another source of energy, a different type of energy efficiency to that which can be achieved with a nuclear power station, with the accompanying wastage of electrical energy."
"What we are interested in is being able to offer ecologically as well as economically acceptable ways of obtaining sustainable energy to meet people's needs."
"Since this is my last speech in this House, allow me to mention that I myself have launched an initiative to that end. Under the scheme, known as 'Building with the sun in Upper Austria and Southern Bohemia', mayors, administrators, engineers and architects are invited to work together on projects in which greater use is made of solar power, for the sun, after all, is a source of energy for all of us, and it is better to harness that energy than to construct our buildings in such a way that we need a great deal of nuclear power in order to heat them."
"Mr President, in most Central and Eastern European countries, nuclear power is routinely accepted as a way of meeting energy requirements."
"We know this, but we also know that we in western Europe tend to differentiate more."
"It is clear that the obsolete Russian nuclear plants need to be shut down, but the sort of plant we are discussing now, at Temelin, is a modern Russian power station, although it still needs to be brought up to international safety standards."
"I actually think that we need to consider which option is best for each country."
"Sometimes alternatives to nuclear power are possible, and if there is an option that is just as cost-effective, then that is the one to go for."
"But if it appears that upgrading the obsolete plants is the only option, then the European Union must work with the applicant country, in this case the Czech Republic, to achieve this."
"Because there are question marks about the economic feasibility of Temelin, I do not think that we can take a decision yet, but we must work with the Czech Government to find the right solution."
"I hope that the Commission will concentrate its efforts on this over the next few months."
"Mr President, it is the sovereign right of every state, including the Czech Republic, to decide which primary sources of energy it uses."
"But the European Parliament must focus on the following point: all these matters have a bearing on the Community too and affect every one of us."
"In the case of power plants, this applies to safety standards, especially those governing the construction and operation of nuclear power stations, their fuel cycle and the disposal of their waste, and all of these things are important in the context of future accession treaties, because we cannot admit any new Member States which maintain lower safety standards than those which obtain in Western Europe by virtue of political decisions."
"Secondly, this is about the free energy market and future participants in that market."
"We shall naturally be unable to tolerate a situation in which customers can freely obtain electricity from producers who do not apply the common safety standards and thereby secure competitive advantages in an unacceptable way."
"These are the two Community aspects that we in Parliament must discuss."
"That is why it is right to adopt this resolution."
"That is why it is right that the Commission should deliver its opinion on the present reports too, because we have a duty to the European people to create transparency publicly here on this important issue."
"So it is certainly not a matter of the Czech Republic and Austria alone but rather about the European public, and we must remember that if we are to fulfil the mandate from our electorate."
"Mr President, I visited the Temelin power station that is under construction."
"I visited it as a national of a country that has four large nuclear power stations on its borders, notably the Cattenom station that is on French territory."
"French engineers have always tried to convince us that the French power stations were entirely safe with a high level of security."
"It has now been demonstrated that this is not the case."
"There is always a risk, one which the people of Luxembourg do not want."
"I do not think that the Austrians, who are neighbours of the Czechs, should be exposed to the risks of a power station that is even more vulnerable to accidents."
"I think that the European Union should help the Czech Republic to equip itself with an alternative system for producing energy, that uses soft energy, but should not release funds for a Soviet-designed type VVER 1000 power station which, in my opinion, presents a great many risks."
"Mr President, the most significant Austrian contribution to the common future of Europe in recent decades was the referendum in which the population rejected nuclear energy."
"What some of you dismissed at that time as the reaction of Luddites has long since proved to be a recognition of the insoluble nature of the problems of nuclear power, of the security issue, the waste disposal issue and the cost issue."
"Over the past few years, the European Parliament has been increasingly supportive of the quest for new, sustainable forms of energy."
"It has recognised that the risks emanating from nuclear energy production in Central and Eastern Europe have assumed an entirely new dimension, but it has also recognised that the accession talks present us with a new opportunity."
"The Temelin nuclear power station is a yardstick of the credibility of this House."
"But the parliamentary groups remain split."
"The influence of the nuclear lobby in this House is still intolerably powerful."
"I wish we had received more decisive support in the past from some of those who have tabled this resolution today, particularly the European People's Party, and I wish that some of the signatories had been more effective advocates within their own party."
"Had that been the case, today's debate would not have exuded this faint odour of electioneering."
"Unfortunately, however, this Parliament of ours is still unable to act on its own judgement by making the abandonment of nuclear power in Europe one of its top priorities."
"But there is one responsibility that this House cannot evade today, namely its responsibility for enabling the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to switch to alternative energy policies, instead of helping them to pursue the dangerous and senseless upgrading and conversion of their nuclear plants."
"Mr President, along with many others, I am delighted about the forthcoming accession of the new Member States, and particularly the Czech Republic."
"At the same time, I think we need to adopt a sober and even strict approach when it comes to meeting the agreed political and economic criteria, since the successful operation of the enlarged Union is at stake here."
"However, this sensibly cautious approach must not mean that solutions to bilateral problems are forced on the applicant countries under the pressure of the accession process or by subtle references to it."
"The applicant countries are the weaker party in relations with the Union, and I do not think I need to remind anyone here that it is one of the most difficult tasks in politics to ensure that justice is done to the weaker party."
"As for the objections that Austria especially has against nuclear power stations in general and the one at Temelin in particular, I would point out that there are a number of recently built power stations in Central and Eastern Europe, many of which are considerably more dangerous than the one at Temelin."
"Furthermore, Temelin at least meets the internationally recognised minimum requirements, which definitely cannot be said of various other plants."
"This is why many in my group feel that it would not be right to single out the Czech Republic, particularly when this issue has already been covered in much greater depth and in a more appropriate context in the Adam report."
"There is no reason to pick on the Czech Republic, and certainly not on Temelin."
"This would simply be underestimating the dangers presented by many others."
"We need to show some understanding for the Czech Government, which has few alternatives for meeting its energy needs."
"I hardly think that brown coal can be seen as a viable option, because of the huge environmental damage that it causes."
"So we need to adopt a more positive approach towards the Czech Government."
"Mr President, the safety of existing nuclear plants and those under construction, as accession approaches, is a primordial objective, as has been underlined on many occasions by Parliament, by the Commission with regard to the Agenda 2000 package, and by the Council in the context of nuclear safety in connection with the future enlargement of the European Union."
"In the case of the Czech power station, Temelín, it seems highly unlikely that the maximum safety levels for power stations which is required of applicants for accession will be achieved, particularly in the light of the Czech authorities' plan to use Soviet-type VVER 1000 reactors, which are presented as latest generation plants but have actually proved not to be very reliable at all."
"These reactors do not appear to meet the maximum safety levels we should now be demanding and there are doubts about their viability insofar as their much vaunted energy efficiency is concerned."
"Considering that the Adam report on nuclear safety, which was approved by this House last March, called among other things for restrictions on the use of RBMK reactors and also VVER Soviet-built models, which the Czech authorities are now planning to use in Temelin, let us reaffirm the conclusions submitted by Alleanza Nazionale's head of delegation and the draftsman of the opinion on the Adam report: first, safety is the key element of the pre-accession strategy; secondly, international legislation on safety systems must be strengthened; and thirdly, the application of such legislation should be supervised by an independent body."
"We can therefore approve the common resolution submitted today, paying particular attention to environmental protection standards, which are, moreover, the only way of guaranteeing that public health is protected."
"Mr President, we welcome this joint motion for a resolution, and we shall support it too, even though the broad support for this motion does remind us, as one of the previous speakers said, that we are in the midst of an election campaign."
"As immediate neighbours of the Czech Republic, we in Austria are particularly affected by the planned high-risk reactor."
"Looking beyond the present motion, however, we take the view that, in the context of its enlargement to the East, the European Union must spell out clearly that accession would be inconceivable unless the applicant countries completely change their dangerous nuclear policy."
"Let me point out, for example, that reactors built to the same specifications in the former German Democratic Republic were decommissioned after the reunification of Germany."
"We believe that the financing of this reactor by means of a grant or loan from EU funds would be tantamount to misappropriation on both economic and ecological grounds."
"Heckling"
"Is that all you can say about the nuclear power station?"
"Is that all the importance you attach to this subject?"
"It is certainly legitimate to support these countries financially in the establishment of a sustainable energy system."
"I thank you, Mr President, and I thank the gentleman who felt he had to shout out his statement on this important subject in order to book his place in tomorrow's newspaper."
"I will be brief, Mr President."
"The Commission understands that the Temelin reactors are, in principle, among those that can be improved to meet acceptable safety levels. And, as indicated in Agenda 2000 and in the communication of March 1998, the Commission's overall objective in relation to this type of reactor is to ensure that the improvements undertaken by the respective countries are carried out in a rapid and efficient manner and produce satisfactory results."
"However, two elements must be taken into account."
"The authorities in the country where the nuclear power plants are situated are responsible for their nuclear safety."
"A high level of nuclear safety is a priority in the accession process and the Commission is prepared to cooperate with all the applicant countries to help improve nuclear safety. The Commission is also prepared to help guarantee that the levels of technological and operational safety are brought into line with the safety practices currently in force in the Union."
"In the Czech Republic, aid has been granted under the framework of the PHARE programme to the authorities responsible for nuclear safety and to improve the safety of the Duckovani nuclear power plant."
"As regards the specific case of Temelin, the Commission does not have sufficient information on the current state of progress."
"At the moment, there is no formal agreement with the Czech authorities under the PHARE framework to allow the European Union's technical safety bodies to carry out an overall safety assessment."
"The Commission has taken careful note of the opinion on Temelin set out in the report published by the WENRA regulators."
"This report does not provide sufficient information to allow us to reach a definitive conclusion on the level of safety that has been reached."
"As regards the economic aspects of the Temelin project, the Commission supports the development of an energy strategy that gives due consideration to energy production and the diversification of sources. The PHARE programme has supported this approach in various projects."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken in a moment."
"Mr President, perhaps you will forgive me."
"This is not strictly a point of order, but it concerns events that have occurred since the morning."
"I ask that we somehow take them into account."
"You may know that there has been an announcement by the G8 ministers which offers terms for a Kosovo solution which are much less intransigent than the five conditions that have been insisted upon until now and significantly re-involves the Security Council."
"In view of that, the resolutions that we have tabled this week are very much out of step with events and give the impression that Parliament is out of touch with what is happening."
"Mr President, I do not know procedurally what should be done, but I ask you with your superior knowledge of procedure to invent some way in which we can take account of this event and show that we do follow the live process rather than sticking to dogmatic positions that bring nothing new and contribute nothing to the solution of this tragedy."
"I am afraid there are no procedures that would allow us to come back to this issue."
"If events have changed before we come to the vote there is nothing we can do about it."
"VOTES (continuation)"
"I have to agree with the rapporteur that the results of collective bargaining to date reveal such serious shortcomings that they cast very serious doubts on the democratic credentials of legislation based on the outcome of dialogue between management and labour."
"Failure to enforce the principle of non-discrimination, the application of laws to a highly restricted circle of persons and activities and a lack of binding obligations are reasons enough to question whether the European Parliament can serve employees and employers as a guarantor of minimum standards and minimum obligations when negotiations between their representatives break down."
"This is no reason to opt for nothing at all rather than the little something that has been scraped together here."
"And it certainly must not encourage those Member States which regard even this as far too heavily binding."
"The Commission and Parliament must close the loopholes in basic European social legislation which allow people to be employed in atypical jobs without proper social cover and must hasten to address the democratic deficit in this area by concluding an interinstitutional agreement pending the next amendment of the Treaty."
"Moreover, it is also high time the European trade unions learned how to represent the interests of their female members more effectively and more vigorously."
"Recognition of qualifications for liberalised professional activities"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt (A4-0253/99) for the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (3612/99 - C4-0209/99-96/0031(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that my last speech of this parliamentary term contains some good news."
"The directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in commercial, craft-related and industrial trades is out of the woods."
"We can approve the outcome of the detailed conciliation discussions between Parliament and the Council with a clear conscience."
"Even though the European Parliament has not entirely succeeded in securing acceptance of the decisions it had adopted by large majorities at the first and second readings, we have nevertheless achieved our main objective."
"This primary objective was to ensure that a vocational qualification obtained in one Member State of the EU is equally valid in the others."
"That will be the case in future, even though our proposal on aptitude testing suffered a few knocks."
"The important point, however, is that we have done something for the freedom of those in commercial, craft-related and industrial trades in the European Union to obtain employment and set up businesses in any Member State."
"The directive will not trigger a flood tide of new migrants, but it is a particularly valuable mechanism for young people."
"In a situation in which high unemployment weighs more heavily on us than almost any other problem, fair distribution of the existing work assumes enormous importance."
"In the third directive on the recognition of qualifications, we are contributing to the fair distribution of work."
"Newly qualified people in particular, who have no family ties to impede their mobility, can go where their labour is required."
"They need not stay in the place where they have learned their trade if their skills are not currently in demand there."
"I believe that, for the sake of strengthening the civil rights of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, we can endure a tinge of disappointment."
"The slight disappointment is that, in the host countries, migrants will not always be free to choose between an aptitude test and an adaptation period as a means of proving their knowledge and occupational skills."
"As a parliament, we wanted this freedom to be granted unreservedly to those qualified in commercial, craft-related and industrial trades."
"We took the view - and we stand by it - that all migrants will know how they can best prove their aptitude."
"Any restrictive set of rules is a superfluous bureaucratic obstacle, in our eyes."
"The Council sees the matter differently, and we had great difficulty in moving it towards the ultimate compromise during the long and arduous negotiations."
"It was quite obviously under heavy pressure from representatives of craft and trade federations, which would evidently prefer to revive the medieval guild system."
"That, at least, we were able to prevent, but we did not achieve our aim."
"The parliamentary delegation followed a consistent line at the negotiations but showed itself willing to compromise when the need arose, and this approach was successful in saving our Council interlocutors from a headlong rush into the past."
"I do not suppose that the Council will show its gratitude at the next opportunity by adopting a more flexible approach, but I am certain that this Parliament will accept what we have done for young people and their vocational development."
"A large majority would serve as a signal to those young people that we intend to act quickly to improve their vocational prospects through this third directive on the recognition of qualifications."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and, more specifically, our colleague Mrs Gebhardt, for the excellent work that they have all done and the determination they showed during the conciliation procedure."
"The negotiations with the Council were certainly not easy, but despite this they ended in a compromise which I personally think is quite satisfactory."
"In this area it must be recognised that, although progress has been made over the last thirty years in moving from sectorial directives to more general horizontal directives - in particular the key directives of 1989 and 1992 - there was, and there still is, a great deal of work to be done."
"I therefore obviously support the proposals aimed at repealing the sectorial directives, which were supposed to be temporary and have often continued longer than necessary, resulting in serious restrictions to the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment of European citizens across the Union."
"With regard to the more general system of recognition of qualifications, I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the system, because although in theory the level of recognition of qualifications is satisfactory, it is not exercised sufficiently in practice."
"European citizens are too often faced with problems when they try to have their qualifications recognised, and they are often refused employment because of supposedly insufficient qualifications."
"As a Member representing a border region, I am in a position of having to deal with these problems almost daily, in Belgium and in France."
"To conclude, I would like to say that these are serious problems, because they are damaging to the very idea of citizenship."
"It is impossible to convince Europeans that European citizenship exists if they are daily being denied a fundamental right, the right to employment."
"This is why, Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again, and to take note of the progress that has been made, but to say that in this area too, our battle is far from over."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of what I should like to say, let me also express my thanks to the rapporteur and my respect and appreciation for her work."
"Cooperating very harmoniously, not least with Mrs Fontaine, who chaired the conciliation meetings, she managed through a very astute approach, a firm hand and indefatigable persistence to make this compromise possible."
"That was indeed a fine piece of work."
"Everyone who attended those meetings was able to see at first hand how difficult it is to move the Council even a fraction of an inch."
"Our rapporteur's achievement was truly prodigious."
"As has already been emphasised, the crux of the matter is freedom of movement in the Community."
"This freedom would effectively be a joke if migrants could not practise their trade or profession in the country to which they have chosen to move."
"At the same time, it is a matter of ensuring that freedom of movement is not restricted to unskilled labour; on the contrary, the success of the common market and the people who work in it depends on a high standard of exchange among the Member States."
"That is the core of the directive now before us."
"Qualifications should be obtainable and usable."
"The way that this should happen was what we ultimately managed to find. What we found was not a perfect solution, but, as has rightly been said, a tenable compromise that provides a common path for all to follow."
"My group is therefore happy to endorse the report and will vote for it."
"Thank you once again for all your work."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Conciliation Committee's adoption of a joint text on the recognition of qualification. And, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank Mrs Gebhardt in particular, as well as the chairman and members of Parliament's delegation to this Conciliation Committee, for all the work they have done over the past four months to obtain this joint text."
"Congratulations and well done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 am."
"Statistics on trade between Member States"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lulling (A4-0226/99) to the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on a European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States with a view to reducing the data to be provided (3608/99 - C4-0172/99-97/0155(COD))."
"Mr President, in 1993, the entry into force of the single market and the removal of border controls resulted in the withdrawal from VAT returns of statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, the reliability of which was guaranteed by the customs services."
"As we still have a need for statistics on trade in goods within the Community, Intrastat was established, and firms were obliged to supply the necessary information to enable this body to establish the statistics."
"Firms, and particularly SMEs, were of course not enchanted with the idea."
"In June 1997, the Commission presented us with two proposals to simplify the 1991 regulation, with the aim of reducing the obligations for firms, and particularly SMEs, in terms of tax returns, and to reduce costs for those liable to pay tax."
"Even during the first reading, it was clear that in the Council the Member States were not even prepared to support these proposals, even though they had been toned down in relation to the results of the first study carried out within the framework of the SLIM initiative."
"Despite this, at first reading we tabled amendments to limit the tax return burden, to remove non-relevant information, for example means of transport and optional information, in order to limit the number of SMEs obliged to provided detailed statistical information. Their aim was also to simplify the use of combined nomenclature, while preserving a single nomenclature for intra-Community trade and trade with third countries."
"We pointed out that this was only a first step in the right direction, while awaiting a more fundamental simplification, especially as the reliability of the Intrastat statistics is unfortunately inversely proportional to the costs that are borne by the 450 000 firms that have to supply the data."
"With the exception of one detail, we had the Commission's blessing on the amendments that were unanimously adopted at first reading."
"However, the Council then forwarded to us a common position that further weakened the original Commission proposal, which had already been weakened in relation to the results of the SLIM studies, and which we wished to strengthen by means of our amendments."
"Moreover, that common position would have resulted in an increase in the tax return burden for firms."
"The Council even went so far as to simply refuse to adopt a common position on the proposal for a regulation concerning nomenclature."
"In the face of such a negative attitude from the Council, we refused to give in."
"We retained our amendments at second reading, and we went to a Conciliation Committee."
"We reached the following compromise: as there is no common position on nomenclature, we were able to obtain a declaration from the Council promising to consider the position on nomenclature, taking account of Parliament's amendments and of the results of the discussions currently taking place within the framework of a second SLIM initiative."
"We achieved this result because, in the Conciliation Committee, I was able to confront the Council delegation with the decisions of the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999, which state, ironically, that the current Intrastat system holds more details than is necessary, that it should be simplified, that costs should be limited and that the 1991 regulations should be modified."
"I thought I must be dreaming when I read that, as the Council had presented us in July last year with a 'decaffeinated' common position on the proposal to modify the 1991 regulation."
"In December 1998 we maintained our amendments against the common position, and then in January 1999, the Council discovered that there was a need to modify Regulation (EEC) No 330/91. Meanwhile, the Commission proposal had been on the table since 2 June 1997 and there had been two readings in this House."
"Is it that in the Council, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing?"
"Is this an illustration of the obvious political malfunctioning of the Council?"
"How is it possible that in January 1999 the Council can demand a much greater simplification of the Intrastat regulation, which it had refused in July 1998, forcing us to go to a Conciliation Committee?"
"Make of it what you will!"
"In any case, I am pleased to have persevered at second reading, and I also welcome the Commission declaration promising to submit a report to us on the Intrastat system."
"If I had to estimate the cost of the work that has been done since 1997, it would certainly be inversely proportional to the results, which are even more meagre when compared to the ambitions of the first SLIM study and to our ambitions for reducing the burden on firms."
"However, at least the Council's contradictions have enabled us to make a new start, which we hope is more promising than what we have had to go through on this issue over the last few years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a very successfully drafted report."
"It is a most pleasurable opportunity to say this on a day like today, the penultimate day of this parliamentary term."
"I believe that through conciliation we have achieved a compromise, which indicates that both the codecision procedure works well and that Parliament has demonstrated its strength."
"The directive which went to conciliation is important for small companies, and, hence, the issue of employment."
"In the European Union there are approximately 18 million SMEs, and almost 17 million unemployed."
"This comparison of figures already suggests that we must do our utmost to ensure that the SME sector is able to remove the burden of bureaucracy and complexity from its shoulders."
"By reducing the amount of data that has to be provided on statistics on trade, we are making an important difference to those SMEs which do not have the resources to produce and maintain complicated sets of statistics."
"The compromise that was reached in conciliation will ease the burden for SMEs, which hopefully will then mean that those companies can put this part of their expenditure and endeavour to better use, thus boosting employment."
"In the European Union and Member States the role of labour-intensive SMEs in particular has been considered central to improved levels of employment."
"If we can continue to simplify matters for them in the areas of thresholds and obstacles, that will be a good thing."
"The euro is an important factor for small companies, as it removes the need to exchange foreign currencies in the single market area."
"Small companies do not generally have the means or skills to monitor currency situations to keep them completely up-to-date on how exchange rates are behaving."
"This being the case, the single currency will be of great benefit to SMEs, lowering, as it will, the degree of risk they encounter in the single market."
"During the conciliation process Parliament also had the opportunity to send a political message to the Commission on another matter that was being dealt with."
"This too demonstrates the strength of the codecision procedure."
"Now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has been in force for just under a week and the role of the codecision procedure is growing in importance, perhaps we have reason to congratulate ourselves, Parliament, and the triumph of democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Lulling for her very committed efforts on behalf of SMEs and other businesses."
"She rightly recognised that firms need less red tape so that they have more time for their customers, and that this also provides an opportunity to create new jobs."
"I would also like to thank Mr Paasilinna, who has always given this initiative his strongest support and who has shown us the way in this field."
"I would also very much like to thank the Commission, because the research we were promised as part of the SLIM-Intrastat initiative, looking particularly at the issues of quality and the burden on the economy, is extremely important."
"Commissioner, this research is very important for us in Europe."
"We are always talking about relieving the burden of bureaucracy and supporting firms in order to create new jobs."
"This is a real opportunity to find a new approach."
"I think it is very important that we have decided to cut down on the number of people required to provide information, as well as reducing the amount of information to be given, although we do, of course, want to have an acceptable level of information."
"What we want, in other words, is a good cost-benefit ratio, so that the exercise is a profitable one."
"In Austria we are shortly to hive off the Central Statistical Office, making it into an independent profit-making operation."
"People using the data will have to pay for doing so, because if the data are worth anything, then there should be a price to pay."
"I would also stress that we have made great efforts to use a single nomenclature for internal and external trade, and we are reducing the number of sections from eight to six, which I think is very important."
"We need to have data that are manageable."
"They will not be broken down so finely, but they should still provide a clear overview of the market."
"We should also welcome the fact that the transport sector and supply conditions have been dropped."
"What we want is to be able to obtain really efficient data rapidly."
"They should be collected in computerised form as far as possible, and we should encourage firms to supply them voluntarily, using systems of incentives rather than fines. We must see to it that the most up-to-date statistical methods are used, such as random sampling, market research and opinion surveys."
"I think that this will bring us much closer to the people, and we will then be more readily accepted by businesses, have greater room for manoeuvre on the world market and thereby create new jobs."
"In the framework of the SLIM initiative, the Commission presented two proposals for a regulation on 30 May 1997 with the aim of simplifying the basic legislation on the Intrastat system."
"Their objective is to relieve the burden on those who have to provide statistics."
"In the first proposal, the number of compulsory variables to be provided in declarations was reduced, and in the second, the nomenclature of products used to classify traded goods was simplified."
"As regards the first proposal on reducing the number of variables covered, the conciliation procedure allowed us to reach a satisfactory result on the Commission's initial proposal."
"This result was obtained through the combined efforts of our two institutions - Parliament and the Commission - and we are very pleased about that."
"The joint text agreed in this way represents an important step in the work to relieve the burden on businesses, and particularly SMEs."
"To be specific, from 1 January 2001, small and medium-sized enterprises will no longer have to provide five variables. However, the Member States will retain their option to request the 'delivery terms', 'mode of transport' and 'statistical procedure' variables for businesses that are above a certain threshold."
"As regards the proposal on simplifying the nomenclature, the Commission notes with satisfaction that all the institutions acknowledge the importance of simplifying the combined nomenclature."
"Its importance is highlighted in the joint text through a specific recital to this end."
"Moreover, the Commission would like to point out that the Council is willing to examine the proposal for a regulation on this matter."
"In conclusion, the European Commission is satisfied with these specific simplifications, which businesses will soon benefit from, and would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on her excellent report."
"However, this is only the first step."
"The Commission is committed to continuing with the SLIM/Intrastat initiative and the EDICOM actions for businesses, in accordance with the Council's position on the need for information in the framework of economic and monetary union."
"I understand the point you are making, but it is not our Rules but the Treaty that sets down that we require a simple majority for third reading."
"I accept what you say about Friday, but in terms of the parliamentary calendar, it is a normal working day."
"Mr President, I hope that next time a very controversial conciliation report is being discussed, we will also vote on Friday morning, with 20 votes to 18, or something of the kind!"
"I am just a servant of this House."
"I merely follow the agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Insolvency practices"
"The next item is the report by Mr Malangré (A4-0234/99) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on insolvency practices."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is Parliament's contribution towards closing a very sensitive loophole in internal market legislation."
"Much of this single market legislation is, as we know, very well advanced, I am glad to say."
"However, despite three attempts we have still not succeeded in finding a solution to the problem of Community insolvency law."
"This is the unavoidable downside to the great success of the single market."
"As we know and are extremely happy to see, many businesses are taking advantage of the single market to operate in other countries and now have sizeable assets in various Member States of the Union."
"When insolvencies occur, however, the confusing legal situation with, at present, 15 different bankruptcy systems creates great scope for manipulation, generates enormous costs in complicated proceedings and makes it extremely difficult to ensure that the assets are fairly distributed among the creditors."
"Here too - and this is something we would stress - the idea of introducing remedial measures through an intergovernmental agreement, thereby excluding Parliament, came to nothing."
"However, I will not deny that I have great sympathy with what the Commission has been trying to do since the early 1980s, or at least with the substance, but not with the idea of using an intergovernmental agreement."
"This Commission draft was an outstanding and extremely knowledgeable legal text, but it was not accepted."
"The subsequent attempts - the Istanbul Convention and the last one that failed in 1995 - tried other routes, but they too missed the mark."
"Nevertheless, we need a Community solution, which is why I call in my report for a draft directive or regulation to be put forward as soon as possible."
"We urgently need to have this on the table, and most of the preliminary work was done in the three earlier drafts."
"If we take the approach of demanding directives or regulations, we are ensuring that Parliament will be involved and that there will be a majority decision, which experience has shown to be clearly what is needed here."
"My report contains a number of proposals which improve on the agreement that failed in 1995, and we would ask you to consider them."
"I think they are essential improvements which can be incorporated."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for all its hard work."
"We held a hearing that produced a very clear outcome, and we were unanimous in demanding an urgent solution to this insolvency problem."
"I would just mention that four amendments were tabled in committee which were all positive and supported the line taken in the report."
"I was therefore happy to include them and can now put before you a proposal that was approved by the entire committee."
"I would urge you to vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"Thank you Mr President."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important report and I agree with his suggestions."
"I regret, too, that the convention has not been ratified by all Member States and would stress that we need to find a solution to this very serious problem."
"I agree with the demand of the rapporteur to draft a regulation or a directive on crossborder insolvency."
"I want to flag up though that we need a solution which finds a fair balance for creditors and employers and employees alike."
"Employees need some protection for accrued salaries and creditors need a sensible solution which will give them the best possible repayments of debts under the circumstances."
"I would also flag up a point made by my colleague, Mr Falconer: I am sure he will not mind me saying this."
"He is particularly concerned that, in insolvency situations where someone later develops an industrial disease, a solution is found whereby they can be recompensed for industrial disease problems."
"I agree that this is an urgent report and that it is crucial to find a solution swiftly."
"Indeed, to show how urgent it is, I was lobbied about this at an international banking meeting in Paris in spring 1994."
"That shows how longstanding the issue is."
"I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"My Socialist Group will be supporting the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work."
"It has been extremely nice working with Mr Malangré over the years that we have both been in Parliament."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I should like to begin where the previous speaker left off, by expressing my great admiration for Mr Malangré."
"He has produced a report that is as sound as a bell."
"I myself have a personal connection with this subject, since my very first report, on an amendment to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, dealt with the bankruptcy of the Ferrovie San'Anna, which was very unusual at the time, a steel company going bankrupt."
"The High Authority, which was responsible for the social side of things, seemed to come last in the queue, while first the State, then the social services, the suppliers, the banks and anyone else you cared to mention all helped themselves to whatever was left over from the liquidation."
"So I said to Commissioner Cristoffersen that the situation could not be allowed to continue, because there were so many different bankruptcy systems in the European Union, and it was high time that we had the possibility of creating European limited companies whose creation and termination would both be jointly regulated."
"Now, in my last speech at the last sitting I shall attend as a Member of this Parliament, bankruptcy is on the agenda again and it has still not been regulated."
"As Mr Malangré described in his explanatory statement, which as I said is absolutely first-class, it is high time that we did something about bankruptcy in the Community at European level."
"There are twelve different systems for suspension of payment in Italy, and in Denmark all creditors are treated equally, even the State and the social security authorities."
"We need harmonisation here, otherwise any attempts to create European transfrontier companies will be doomed to failure."
"I support the Malangré report, to which I have been able to make a small contribution through my amendments in the Legal Affairs Committee, which have been included."
"I and my group wholeheartedly endorse it."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's initiative to support the adoption at Community level of legislation that allows us to determine the legal and economic effects of the bankruptcy of companies operating within the internal market."
"Such legislation does not currently exist."
"The effects of insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State upon goods and people situated in another Member State depend on national legislation and on bilateral agreements between the Member States."
"The Community has always attempted to compensate for this shortcoming in the context of the smooth running of the internal market and, to this end, it launched two types of initiative in the 1980s."
"Firstly, the Member States began to negotiate an agreement on the basis of ex Article 220 of the EC Treaty. This agreement aimed to regulate in a horizontal manner the intra-Community effects of bankruptcy by determining the legal competences and the law to be applied in declaring a business insolvent."
"These negotiations culminated in the signing of the 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings, on the basis of which we are debating today."
"Secondly, the Commission presented two directives on the liquidation of insurance companies and credit bodies."
"These proposals are based on the principle of the authorities' powers in the country of origin where these companies are authorised to operate."
"The Commission hopes that the two directives will be adopted as soon as possible."
"Until now, however, neither of these two initiatives have been successful."
"We are awaiting their adoption with bated breath."
"The 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings had still not been signed by all the Member States before the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force and, as a result, it cannot be implemented."
"Retaining its use of the right of initiative, the Commission is assessing how the text agreed by the Member States in 1995 and could be brought into effect within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Mr President, I am sorry that the Commissioner must be feeling that he is getting the third degree here."
"He said that the 1995 Convention has not been signed by all the Member States and the Commission is now considering doing something about this."
"Will the Commissioner promise that the Commission will come up with either a directive or a regulation here - we leave that to the Commission to decide - so that we no longer need to wait for these countries to make up their minds?"
"Mr Wijsenbeek, I have been very tolerant but I cannot allow the dialogue to continue."
"We have to conclude the debate."
"I would like to add my own personal thanks to Mr Malangré for all the work that he has done in this House and to wish him every success in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Lawful interception of telecommunications"
"The next item is the report by Mr Schmid (A4-0234/99) on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs for a Motion for a Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications in relation to new technologies (10951/2/98 - C4-0052/99-99/0906(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I move on to the subject of this debate, there is something I would like to say to Mr Malangré, who is leaving this House after 20 years as a Member."
"You know that there are personal reasons why I am addressing these words to you."
"We are, if you like, opponents and competitors in politics, since we both come from the Aachen region."
"You were mayor of that important European city for 16 years and alongside that a Member of the European Parliament for 20 years."
"I was mayor of Aachen's smaller neighbour for just a few years, and we did our best to get our hands on your trade tax by stealing your biggest factories."
"However, this has not affected our friendship or the work we have done together for Europe."
"I think I can say on behalf of many in my group that you have been one of the most honourable and reliable Europeans in this House."
"Many thanks for all your work!"
"Applause"
"The Schmid report deals with an extremely sensitive subject - the modern communications society on the threshold of the 21st century."
"People value their privacy, and every democratic country has legislation which protects its citizens against arbitrary State interference in their private lives."
"This is why the police are only allowed to tap telephones or intercept faxes and letters under lawful conditions, and then only in certain strictly limited cases and only with a court order."
"The conditions for such activities are regulated under national law, and rightly so."
"This draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of telecommunications does not interfere with national law here, since whether we like it or not, resolutions under the third pillar have this somewhat circumscribed nature."
"In future, under the Amsterdam Treaty, it will be more accurate to call them 'common positions', but they will still have no binding legal force."
"They simply indicate that the Member States have agreed on a common course of action."
"A resolution was used in 1995 to agree what interception meant in the technical sense, such as whether only the content of a telephone conversation should be recorded, or the time and the recipient's telephone number as well."
"There are two reasons for having these telephone and fax agreements between the Member States."
"Setting up interception facilities involves costs for the system operator, but in the single market the level of costs must be similar everywhere if distortions of competition are to be avoided."
"So one country cannot impose costs on its operators which are not charged in other countries."
"Secondly, in the case of cross-border requests for legal assistance, we need to be clear about what interception actually means."
"The draft resolution before us extends the scope of the agreement to include mobile telephones and Internet communications."
"This is an extremely sensitive area."
"It is a logical extension because it will protect people's privacy, but it does not mean that we are protecting a particular technical communication medium."
"The two must be clearly distinguished."
"There is opposition to these agreements and the planned procedures, which is very interesting and is worth looking at more closely."
"There are some Internet freaks who are very concerned that we are trying to interfere with their freedom to communicate and think that free communication is under threat."
"They need to realise that the Internet is not outside the law, and that in a democratic society there cannot be any areas where people can just do what they like."
"I was Parliament's rapporteur for the establishment of joint measures to combat child pornography, and I can tell you that what is happening on the Internet cries out for some form of regulation, however hard it might be to put into practice."
"The Internet service providers also have some misgivings because of the costs involved."
"We have included an amendment in the report to answer these concerns."
"There is also no fixed timetable for implementation, which is a weak point."
"There is opposition too from those with an interest in money laundering and tax evasion."
"The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, Mr Florio, has expressed such misgivings."
"He has been good enough to air the concern that regulations on interception might also be applied to bank transactions on the Internet."
"The 'Handelsblatt ', which is hardly what you would call a Socialist newspaper, wrote last December, and I quote, 'The Internet is the ideal medium for tax evasion."
"A firm called Privacy Solutions is openly advertising itself on the Internet with the following words: 'Your office is in cyberspace, the tax authorities will never find you!'"
"Anyone who totally rejects the lawful interception of modern communications, which we have heard many speakers do, is simply aiding and abetting criminals, albeit unintentionally."
"However difficult it may be to translate joint agreements into practical action, it is absolutely essential that we should recognise that the freedom which the new telecommunications give us is still something that is open to abuse."
"This is an appeal to the sense of responsibility of those able to take advantage of this freedom, but it is also a challenge to the national authorities to find intelligent ways of stopping these freedoms from being abused, which is harmful to the public interest and creates particular problems for the tax system and the collection of taxes."
"My colleague Mr Schmid has tried to contribute to these efforts in this report."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the interception of telecommunications is a sensitive matter, since it touches upon the personal integrity of ordinary people."
"We are engaged in the eternal process of finding the right balance between safeguarding that integrity and combating crime."
"Nobody wishes to see Orwell's Big Brother take over, but nor do we want to expose the public to uncontrollable levels of crime."
"The current exercise is simply a matter of updating an existing resolution on telecommunications interception, bringing it into line with modem technology."
"This is a very low-key text from the legislative point of view."
"National legislation is not infringed upon; Member States implement the provisions only if they so wish, and in the way they choose."
"The State has a duty to fight crime committed within its borders."
"It bears responsibility for anti-crime measures and supports the cost."
"This applies in the United States as well."
"Costs arising in connection with the interception of telecommunications are currently borne by the State, and should continue to be so."
"This is especially relevant at a time like now when telephony markets are being privatised."
"Increased costs would make life harder for small Internet providers, undermining Europe's competitive edge."
"Internet providers can, after all, set up anywhere in the world; we do not want rising costs to drive them out of the European Union."
"Success on the advanced technology front is vital for Europe's development."
"We cannot afford any deterioration in the growth potential of the IT industry."
"There is currently scope for expansion in the sector, particularly for small and medium-sized companies."
"They are the ones that would suffer if they had to bear the costs of generalised data storage."
"Personal integrity must be at the forefront of any debate on anti-crime measures. Sophisticated data inspection requirements offer one solution."
"Equally, we will need a preventive strategy to stop the Internet from becoming a playground for criminals."
"Across-the-board storage of information naturally puts us in mind of Orwell. If the State takes charge of the costs, however, we will have some degree of assurance that only such information as is absolutely necessary will be saved."
"There must be a decision from a court; the exact nature of the information required will need to be specified; this data must of course only be used if there is suspicion that a very serious crime has been committed; and no action should be taken on statements from informers."
"This whole area is rightly regulated in an extremely strict way in almost all countries."
"I can therefore see no reason why Parliament should seek to block this move."
"On the contrary, we in this House need to demonstrate that we can perform the balancing act required and contribute towards an unfettered information society, without allowing the Internet to become a vehicle for crime. Mr Schulz has warned us about that."
"So, in the interest of combating crime, I would commend this proposal."
"The EU FBI telecommunications surveillance system is developing rapidly through two separate but very linked initiatives."
"First, the Council has proposed a new draft Council resolution to extend the 1995 requirements resolution to cover new technologies, the Internet and satellite-based telecommunications."
"And, second, the Council is on the verge of agreeing a formula to provide a legal base for remote access to a satellite ground station in Italy through a new clause in the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters."
"This draft convention will provide the legal framework for the interception of all forms of telecommunications in the EU which is required to put into effect the EU FBI surveillance system."
"Both measures are expected to be agreed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 to 28 May."
"What we are discussing here today, in the version discussed in the European Parliament, amends the 1995 requirements to include data on Internet users such as IP address, electronic address assigned to a party, account number and e-mail address (ENFOPOL 10951/98 REV2)."
"That has actually been changed."
"What we are discussing now is not the actual wording, because what it says instead is: 'IP address' and instead of 'account number' it says 'credit card number and e-mail address'."
"It is very disturbing that an issue like this is being discussed on a Thursday evening when there are very few people here, the vote will be tomorrow morning, and there has been no proper debate within national parliaments on this issue."
"There has definitely been no debate within the Irish Parliament and I do not think there has been debate within many of the other parliaments."
"If it is possible to monitor communications in such a manner you will be able to tell where a person is, when they are there, what sites they are consulting, what electronic messages they are sending, what electronic payments they are making, basically you will know everything about a person's private life."
"The Greens believe that this is a serious attack on privacy and there are not sufficient safeguards regarding data protection and democratic control."
"This is something that was actually brought up by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was very critical of this."
"It is unfortunate that the draftsperson of the opinion is not here because it is extremely important that this point is stressed."
"Rules on telephone tapping are controlled, for example, at national level."
"That follows very proper procedures and authorisation."
"This proposal here basically ignores the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the provision on the protection of private life in Article 8."
"These are being overwritten here and interference by a public authority should be subject to extremely strict conditions."
"The view of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken on board."
"The other point I wanted to make is that this whole issue was discussed in a procedure which was a written procedure, not in a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers."
"This issue has not, as far as I am concerned, followed the proper democratic procedures."
"It has not been discussed in national parliaments."
"I also feel it is very sinister that this issue is put on the agenda on the Thursday night when everyone is going back to campaign for the election."
"There is absolutely nobody here to listen to what is going on."
"This is a grave step against people's right to privacy and right to freedom."
"It has always been the case in Member States throughout the European Union and right around the world that oppressive legislation is brought in using the argument that we have to combat serious crime."
"For example one of the speakers mentioned paedophilia and things like that on the Internet."
"That does not mean that you overwrite people's basic right to privacy."
"That is what is going on here."
"There needs to be a lot more debate about this, not just here in the European Parliament but in national parliaments."
"I would like to know why these issues have been railroaded through in such a fashion without proper democratic control and proper public debate."
"Madam President, lades and gentlemen, the mere mention of the idea of telephone tapping is enough to get the relevant circles talking about a police state and 'Big Brother', just like Pavlov's dogs."
"What the Legal Affairs Committee has given us here is the sort of arrant nonsense that you might expect to hear from a first-year student, but from the second year onwards you would have to call it out-and-out troublemaking."
"Mr Schulz pointed out quite rightly, and Mr Schmid wrote, that this Council recommendation makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to the legal situation in the Member States."
"The legal conditions for telephone tapping and for monitoring Internet access will still, even after this resolution, lie solely in the hands of the national legislator."
"The resolution simply aims to harmonise the technical standards, which we need to do in order to use telephone tapping to prevent organised crime."
"Let me give you an example."
"Virtual bank accounts can be used to collect extortion money: a blackmailer sets up a virtual bank account and has the money paid into it, and if access cannot be monitored, he cannot be held responsible or brought to account."
"This is why it is absolutely vital that these measures are taken now."
"The Council has made a recommendation, and we have a resolution before us that is essential if we are to combat organised crime."
"The Member States will certainly introduce all the constitutional requirements that are needed to register something as sensitive as telephone tapping or Internet monitoring."
"But we need to make provision for ways of combating organised crime."
"Madam President, I do not want to take up too much time unnecessarily, but Mrs McKenna made two points that I feel I have to take issue with."
"Mr Schmid, for whom I am deputising, has not stayed away deliberately."
"His report was actually on the agenda for this morning, and this afternoon he had a private appointment, not a political one, that he could not put off."
"I apologise on his behalf, and I would assume that Mrs McKenna criticised his absence simply because she did not know the reasons for it."
"The second point is one that I simply have to reject."
"The committee responsible here in the House is called the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"No other parliament in the world, I think, devotes as much care and attention as ours does to basic and human rights if there is any question of interference with civil liberties in the construction of a European legal area. You know, Mrs McKenna, that as well as being the spokesman on internal affairs for my group I am also the vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"I categorically reject the claim that the careful work which we are doing - whether it is Mr Nassauer, myself or Mr Schmid - is designed to railroad something through that goes against the guarantees of basic rights enjoyed by individuals in the European Union."
"I have to say that I think these are rather harsh allegations, and because I value you as a colleague I would ask you to consider carefully in future whether you can substantiate them."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I was not criticising Mr Schmid for not being here."
"I did not mention his name."
"I was talking about Mr Florio because he was the draftsman of the opinion in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has the opposite view to the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"Madam President, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his excellent report on the lawful interception of telecommunications."
"The Commission shares Parliament's opinion of the importance of this issue, particularly since in Europe the telecommunications world is constantly undergoing rapid and revolutionary changes."
"On the one hand, we must take into account the logical concerns of the police authorities."
"The development of Internet telecommunications must not affect the Member States' ability to fight crime and maintain national security."
"On the other hand, we are seeing a significant increase in telecommunications services and, in particular, Internet services."
"Information technology companies already account for more than 5 % of the European Union's gross domestic product."
"They provide employment for more than four million people and they create more new jobs than any other sector of the European Union's economy."
"As a result, the Union is obviously extremely keen to remain at the forefront in this age of information."
"Moreover, if this sector is to continue to expand, it is essential that we are able to ensure that users trust the telecommunication services."
"The European Commission therefore believes that it is vital to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests at stake."
"In our opinion, this can only be achieved through open dialogue between the police authorities, the operators and the industry."
"As highlighted in both Mr Schmid's report and the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, there is a series of aspects that must be addressed in more detail. We thus need to clarify issues such as operators' liability as well as privacy in telecommunications."
"The Commission should like to begin a broad debate on the necessary requirements and on the way in which these can be met in as beneficial a way as possible."
"This debate could lead to the Commission making full use of the new opportunities provided by the Amsterdam Treaty and submitting proposals on this issue."
"Only in this way will we be able to protect the development of the information society."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 7 p.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 7 May 1999, and I declare open the sitting provided for in Article 10(3) of the Act concerning the election of the representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage and Rule 10(3) of the Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"Before the start of the proceedings, Mr Crowley asked to take the floor."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address the House."
"I want to register my protest at the lack of facilities for me, as a Deputy within this Chamber."
"Two and a half years ago, I went to the authorities who were dealing with the building of this new structure and informed them of my requirements as a person with a disability within the Chamber."
"I was assured at that stage that every facility would be made available."
"I arrived here last month and spoke with the architects and builders with regard to the seating arrangements within the hemicycle."
"I also wrote a letter to the former President, informing him of the difficulties that would arise."
"I arrived here today, after being re-elected to this Parliament, to discover, firstly, that I cannot get from the '0' level of the building to the first level without getting a security card from one of the security services."
"I was delayed for 24 minutes this morning and 38 minutes last night waiting for someone to come along with a card."
"Secondly, I cannot sit with my political group within this House because there are no facilities for me to sit with them."
"Thirdly, it is an absolute disgrace when so much public money has been spent on this new building that we could not give a proper example for the 21st century - for the new millennium - of what kind of an inclusive society the European Parliament wants to see in the future."
"Loud and sustained applause"
"I should like to finish with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: 'To hate your fellow man is not the ultimate sin but to be apathetic towards him, that is the essence of inhumanity' ."
"We have seen it here today."
"I want to register this protest."
"I will be taking part in the proceedings."
"But I want my heartfelt objections to be heard by everybody within this Chamber and around Europe when it is being televised today."
"Loud and sustained applause"
"Mr Crowley, your complaint will certainly be recorded in the Minutes."
"I would like to express my own personal deepest regret at the occurrence."
"I can assure you, as I am being assured at this moment, that the services will carry out the necessary technical alterations you have requested in time for the September part-session."
"I am sure that the President-elect will personally ensure that this undertaking is made good within the deadline."
"Oldest Member"
"I would like to announce that, pursuant to Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the duties of oldest Member should fall to Mário Soares."
"However, he considered it appropriate not to carry out these duties as he is standing for President of the Parliament."
"Under these circumstances, the duties fall to myself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief."
"It is not the first time that I have had to perform the duties of President of a Parliamentary Assembly, but it is the first time that this has been in the capacity of oldest Member, even standing in for an illustrious, older colleague, and I cannot disguise a certain feeling of embarrassment."
"I am, nevertheless, very grateful for the opportunity that this occasion affords me to welcome each of you very warmly to this Assembly, of which I have had the honour of being a Member for several years now, although most of my experience comes from my many years as a Member of the national parliament of my country, Italy."
"I believe strongly in the parliamentary institution, and I am especially convinced that the democratic legitimisation of the whole of the process of European integration rests on this Parliament, on the full recognition of its role, and also on its ability to collaborate with the national parliaments."
"We are aware of the fact that our Parliament has acquired wider powers and must acquire more. We must now make a decisive contribution to the reform of the institutions of the Union, to building an authentic European democracy."
"This is the task which unites us, beyond the substantial political differences which characterise us, and which will certainly be expressed in heated debates."
"In this hemicycle, our lovely new home, there will be brilliant reasoned debate and there will be competition, but we will never allow ourselves to forget the cause to which great personalities of European life have devoted themselves."
"Please allow me to mention, of all of them, a man from whom I have personally learned a great deal, calling to mind the ten years of battles he fought in this hemicycle, our beloved Altiero Spinelli."
"Applause"
"The cause which unites us, ladies and gentlemen, as we face difficult and exacting challenges, is that of building a more united, wider, stronger Europe, in order to ensure peace, freedom and justice throughout the continent."
"I wish you all every success in your work during the fifth legislative term."
"As I recall, the Rules of Procedure prohibit any discussion while the oldest Member is in the Chair, which is not strictly related to the procedures for the election of the President or to the verification of his credentials."
"Mr President, I would like to take the floor in order to invoke the Rules of Procedure, for future reference, of course."
"Rule 14(2) reminds us that only the President-elect can give an inaugural address."
"Thank you for clarifying that point. However, you don't know how long this would have lasted had it been an address!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, before moving to the election of a President of this House, I should like to ask you to confirm that Annex I of our Rules of Procedure is being abided by."
"Annex I of our Rules of Procedure, Article 1, paragraph 2, states that before a Member may be validly nominated as an office-holder of Parliament, he or she must have duly completed the declaration of financial interests."
"I would ask you to confirm that this has indeed been carried out."
"On behalf of the departments of the Parliament, I confirm that this has been carried out."
"Election of the President"
"Let us proceed this morning, ladies and gentlemen, in observance of the Rules of Procedure, to the election of the President."
"Pursuant to Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure, nominations for President of the European Parliament must be made, with the consent of those concerned, by a political group or by at least thirty-two Members."
"Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure, the following nominations were made for the Presidency of the European Parliament:"
"Mrs Nicole Fontaine Mrs Laura González Álvarez Mrs Heidi Hautala Mr Mário Soares"
"Subsequently, the GUE/NGL Group declared that it was withdrawing the nomination of Mrs González Álvarez from the election."
"With regard to this, Mr Wurtz has asked to take the floor."
"Mr President, for the first time in ten years, we shall actually be voting for the President of the European Parliament without any of those prior agreements between social-democratic and socialist groups which always seemed to represent, to my mind, a kind of condominium, stifling democratic debate."
"Today, more by chance than political will on the part of the two principal groups, we have a Left and Right at loggerheads with one another."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left..."
"Please restrict yourself exclusively to the statement regarding the withdrawal of Mrs González Álvarez from the election, without expounding political considerations on the issue of the election of the President."
"Applause"
"I agree, Mr President, but as you know, here it is all politics."
"I shall nevertheless bear your words in mind."
"In the first ballot, when it was inconceivable that the election of President of Parliament could be resolved, we took the decision to put forward Mrs Laura González as our candidate to affirm our place at the very heart of the Left."
"The latest developments in this situation, particularly the signing of a formal agreement between the two main groups of the Right, mean that we can no longer ignore the fact that everything is still to play for, from the first ballot onwards."
"We want to contribute from the outset, to opposing a united and self-confident Right with a Left which is rallying together and on the offensive..."
"I am sorry, Mr Wurtz, but I am afraid that I must cut you short."
"Everything is political. We will have five years in which to discuss political issues, but this is not the time."
"Applause"
"Therefore, three effective candidates remain, not four: Mrs Nicole Fontaine, Mrs Heidi Hautala and Mr Mário Soares, the nomination for Mrs González Álvarez having been withdrawn, according to the intervention of Mr Wurtz."
"I would remind you that, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure, a candidate must obtain the absolute majority of the votes cast in order to be elected in the first three ballots."
"Blank or void ballot papers will not be taken into consideration in the counting of the votes."
"I shall now draw lots to appoint the six tellers."
"The President drew lots to appoint the tellers"
"The following representatives have been appointed tellers:"
"Mr BaltasMrs O'TooleMr Ortuondo LarreaMr KatiforisMrs SandersMrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco"
"The vote was taken"
"I declare the ballot closed."
"I invite the tellers to count the ballot papers."
"The sitting was suspended at 11.15 a.m. to allow the tellers to count the votes and was resumed at 12.20 p.m."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have just given me one of the most wonderful surprises of my life."
"I must tell you that I am extremely moved."
"I am not going to make a speech, as I shall be doing that tomorrow."
"I would just like to say a few words to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the confidence you have just shown in me."
"This confidence is rather overwhelming, but I would like you to know that I shall do all that I can to prove worthy of it and also in order for us to work wonderfully together, as we have done until now."
"If you will allow me, I would like to say a few words in particular - I think my male colleagues may forgive me for this - to my fellow women MEPs, who have always given me wonderful support, as have others."
"I would like to say that this vote is also, to some extent, a vote for you because, for twenty years, since Simone Weil in 1979, no woman has been President of the European Parliament, and so this makes me very proud."
"Loud applause"
"I would also like to dedicate this election to those colleagues who, until yesterday, were still our colleagues."
"I know that many of them are still here but there are many others who told us how much they would have liked to take part in this election, which has been a very happy one, and I would like to offer them all my thanks."
"And now, I would like to say to Mario Soares that we have competed against each other in a very democratic and good-natured way, and as for the election result - well, that's life in politics - it certainly doesn't diminish the enormous respect I have for him, which is shared by our whole Assembly."
"Loud applause"
"I shall immediately grant Mario Soares' request to have the floor."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Please allow me to use my first words to congratulate you."
"You have conducted a fine campaign, you have acted with great dignity and have always behaved impeccably in all the dealings that I have had with you."
"I would therefore like to congratulate you most sincerely and to wish you an excellent Presidency, which I am sure it will be."
"I would also like to thank, if you don't mind, everyone who voted for me."
"Through my nomination, we have unleashed a new dynamism, and I would like to thank not only those belonging to my own group, but also those from other groups who voted for me too."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr Soares"
"Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate you on behalf of the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance in the European Parliament."
"We know you to be a very fair and experienced President, and we want to continue to work with you in accomplishing internal reform."
"The question of rules for Members, for example, is a very important issue."
"On a more personal note, I would also like to congratulate you on being the first woman to lead this House in a long time."
"I have had the pleasure of working together with you on the Conciliation Committees and we know that you come to your duties as an exceptionally able President."
"It is now our mutual task to represent the nations of Europe here, so that they too can have a say in the affairs of the European Union."
"Congratulations once again."
"Honoured Madam President, I should like to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"I am also very pleased to do this on a personal level, for we have been working together here in the European Parliament since 1984, in a spirit of friendship and trust."
"Madam President, I wish you all the success that you would expect and wish for yourself, and which all of us here would wish for this Parliament."
"When you relinquished the Chair in May, during the last session here in Strasbourg, you said: 'I am now closing this session."
"That was my last time in the Chair as Vice-President' . You then received loud applause, something that neither I nor any of those present had experienced before, and everyone stood up, something which is generally only reserved for Presidents."
"That is why we are able to say today, wherever we happen to be sitting or standing here in this Chamber, that if there is such a thing as political justice, right here in this European Parliament too, then this political justice has become reality with the election of Nicole Fontaine as President of the European Parliament."
"Jean Monnet once said: 'Nothing can be achieved without people, nothing endures without institutions' ."
"I wish Nicole Fontaine the best of luck and every success, and she will always be able to count on the largest party in this House, which made this proposal from a sense of political duty and for the sake of democracy."
"But I should also like to pay a few words of tribute to Mario Soares."
"He is one of Portugal's great characters and, Mr President Soares, during the Seventies it was you that prevented Portugal from exchanging one dictatorship for another."
"You are a great statesman and a great European, and although we could not elect you as well, we still have great respect for you."
"Loud applause"
"Heidi Hautala, we have worked very well together over the last few days, and, indeed, this finds expression in the fact that as leader of the Green Party you are sitting here in the first row, as is the leader of the Liberals, Pat Cox."
"Let us continue to work within this spirit of openness and culture of fairness and, notwithstanding our personal political differences, which is to be expected in a democracy, let us get down to business today and drive European integration forward."
"Madam President, these are my wishes for you and for us all."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I hope you do not mind if I speak first in your language in order to congratulate you, to wish you the best of luck, and also to assure you of the friendship of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and of its desire to work with you."
"We have worked together for several years now, in different roles."
"I know very well what your responsibilities are because, ten years ago, one July day, I too went up to occupy the Presidential seat."
"You have worked as Vice-President under my Presidency and under subsequent ones. You have also earned enormous respect in the House for your work, firstly as Vice-President, especially on days of difficult votes, and also for your long-standing involvement with Europe which has enabled us to work together on other projects and other platforms."
"I would like to point out, Madam President, that although until now you have represented one political grouping, you are now President of all the MEPs in the European Parliament and I am sure that you will prove equal to the task."
"As far as the Group of the Party of European Socialists is concerned, you will have all the support necessary, not only to bring about reforms which are essential for working within this Institution, primarily the status of MEPs and their assistants, but also to open the windows of this Institution to our fellow citizens throughout the Member States and beyond, for we are building not only a House of Parliament, but also a more united Europe."
"In this, you can count on our loyal support and friendship, and I hope that in the Bureau too, given the commitments which await us, we will be able to do our best, not only to make Parliament work, but also to take Europe forwards."
"I would like to conclude by saying how much respect and friendship I have for an old comrade, Mario Soares, whom I have known since the anti-fascist struggle in my own country and in Portugal."
"He is a model not only of a staunch fighter for democracy but also of a great man who helped in the process of decolonialisation and in creating a world which is a little more just and more open. Above all though, I would say that he personifies admirably the attitude of fair play so essential to democracy."
"I would also like to offer my greetings to Mrs Hautala and I hope that together, we will all be able to advance the cause of democracy and of a united Europe."
"Applause"
"Bravo, Nicole, and congratulations, Madam President."
"This morning, I asked Nicole beforehand for some clarification and advice in case she did indeed occupy the Presidential seat today."
"In the language of Molière, what is the rule when a woman is elected President?"
"She informed me that according to the Académie Française , one can say either 'Madame le Président ' or 'Madame la Présidente ' ."
"Well, Madame la Présidente , and this is perfectly correct according to the Académie Française , I would like to congratulate you not only for just having been elected President of our Assembly for the next few years, but also for having become the first woman in twenty years, as you have pointed out, to succeed my former colleague Simone Weil, as President."
"I congratulate you as well, not only for becoming President and a woman President, but also for having been an excellent colleague over the years. I hope that your work for the Parliament and for the internal reforms goes well, and especially your work for the Assembly and for Europe, because I know how much Europe and our common vision of it mean to you personally."
"I would also like to say to our Portuguese colleague, Mario Soares, that I congratulate him because, by taking part in this election, he gave Assembly the chance to contest the seat, which is a sign of true politics and true democracy."
"Within the Liberal Group, we chose to support your nomination, not with a view to forming a political coalition, but as a political statement, for the duration of the opening meeting, because some form of political counterbalance is needed from time to time amongst the great European political groupings."
"Having been elected President of our Assembly today, you also hold this political balance between institutions which is necessary for a clearly-defined future, for a shared undertaking on Europe, for internal reform and for the whole Assembly."
"Congratulations and bravo, dear colleague."
"Thank you so much, Mr Pat Cox."
"Mr Wurtz has the floor."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate you, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"You are now the President of all of us, men and women.I would like to repeat something that I said to you when you visited our group a few days ago, which was that everyone knows that our politics are quite different, and I have not pretended otherwise to you, even considering the implications that this might have today, but political differences do not preclude having great respect for someone on a personal level."
"We hope that, as President, you will show the same qualities of loyalty and impartiality which won you many friends in this House when you were first Vice-President of the last Assembly."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I extend my congratulations and good wishes on your election as President of the European Parliament."
"I am quite satisfied that Parliament has acquired an excellent President and I am equally certain that you will conduct your duties with dignity and fair play at all times."
"You have won the respect of this Parliament during the period of time that you served as Vice-President and the many roles that you had to fulfil."
"I want to wish you every success, on behalf of Parliament, during your term of office."
"Parliament has a wonderful President."
"We all wish you well."
"Applause"
"Madam President, the Alleanza Nazionale knows that you will lead this Parliament with that same spirit of democracy and equilibrium which we experienced during the last legislative term."
"Your strong drive for a free and politically united Europe, your respect for the democratic institutions and your belief in a Parliament with, at long last, a strong, informed and transparent relationship with the Commission give us real hope that the years to come will be a time in which the consociativismo (tacit tolerance of corruption) of the past will truly be a thing of the past and real collaboration between all the groups of this Parliament will begin."
"Europe is embarking upon this legislative term at a time of great difficulties, due both to the events taking place just beyond our borders and also to the fact that the process of political union and the economic policy project are still far from being completed."
"A strong, kind and capable Presidency which is well-balanced and just, such as you have already shown yourself capable of providing, will give us the hope and faith to work together, all of us together, to meet the needs of those European citizens who are still looking to us to give them a clear answer regarding their future."
"Madam President, dear Nicole, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is also pleased to congratulate you on your election today."
"I am sure that you will be the President to safeguard the interests of all Members."
"It is a matter of great importance to us that things should now be put in order in Parliament, so that a journey costing EUR 300 is not reimbursed with EUR 1000, and remuneration is completely upfront and not hidden in perks slipped in through the back door."
"My group is critical of centralism and a lack of transparency within the EU."
"I am certain that we will be able to work constructively together to open up the decision-making process within the EU."
"There are other areas where we are unable to offer constructive co-operation but we can offer constructive opposition, and that is, of course, because you want greater integration in areas where we want less."
"But we can offer constructive opposition."
"Now some comments on a personal note to Mário Soares."
"Around this time, twenty five years ago, I visited you at a flat in Paris, where you were in exile."
"I was a great admirer of your fight for democracy in Portugal and helped you by getting your speeches printed in Scandinavian newspapers and by broadcasting your messages."
"But I have been unable to support you today, for, although we may agree on democracy in Portugal, my group does not support your ideas on integration within Europe."
"That is why we have been unable to vote for Mário Soares, even though his past life and background strike a chord with me."
"Again, on a personal note and speaking as one of the ten veterans to have sat here in Parliament since 1979, Nicole Fontaine is the best President we have ever had."
"When we closed the session last May, there was unanimous support and loud applause from the entire Chamber because she had presided over meetings with such outstanding success during the last election period."
"On no account is it for political reasons that I voted for you today, but because I hope that you will continue to represent all Members."
"And on that note, I am pleased to welcome you as the new President of the Parliament for the next two and a half years."
"Applause"
"Election of Vice-Presidents"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item on the agenda is the election for Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament."
"You should have the list of candidates in front of you."
"I shall read it out to you."
"Ballot papers are being handed out as we decided, once again, to hold a manual vote, given that there were fourteen candidates for fourteen posts."
"We shall take advantage of the benefits that electronics can offer later."
"I have received the following nominations:"
"Mr Joan Colom I Naval, Mr Ingo Friedrich, Mr Renzo Imbeni, Mrs Marie-Noëlle Lienemann, Mr Luis Marinho, Mr David Martin, Mr Gérard Onesta, Mr José Pacheco Pereira, Mr Guido Podestà, Mr James Provan, Mr Alonso José Puerta, Mr Gerhard Schmid, Mr Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca and Mr Jan Wiebenga."
"The candidates have informed me that they accept their respective nominations."
"I would like to draw your attention to something that I mentioned a moment ago, which is that, as the number of candidates does not exceed the number of seats to be filled, I propose that in the first instance, we elect these fourteen candidates to the posts of Vice-President and that we do it unanimously."
"We will then hold a ballot in order to establish the precedence between the various Vice-Presidents you will have elected in this way."
"Applause"
"The fourteen Vice-Presidents are elected unanimously."
"I hereby declare the ballot open."
"The vote took place"
"(The sitting was suspended at 3.40 p.m. and resumed at 6.05 p.m.)"
"Election of Quaestors"
"With regard to the election of Quaestors, which will take place tomorrow morning, I propose that we set the deadline for the registration of nominations for eight o'clock this evening."
"The registration of these nominations must be done in the same place as those for the Vice-Presidencies, which is the small room next to our Chamber."
"Madam President, the deadline you have set can easily be adhered to by those parties that only have one good candidate for the election of the Quaestors."
"Unfortunately, our party has several good candidates and we must first make a selection."
"Indeed, since the election will not take place first thing tomorrow morning, I would ask you to defer the deadline to ten o'clock this evening for example, or as far as I am concerned, even to midnight, but to make it no earlier than ten o'clock this evening."
"I urge you to do this on behalf of my party."
"Mr Swoboda, I think that we can be even more accommodating and I suggest, if you have no objection, the time of nine o'clock tomorrow morning."
"This way, you will have the whole night in which to hold consultations."
"Madam President, if you continue to be this generous then we shall be very satisfied with you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the order of business."
"The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m."
"Address by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again, I should like to convey my heartfelt thanks for the trust you showed in me by electing me President of the European Parliament yesterday."
"To follow the various Presidents who have left their mark on the history of our Parliament ever since it was first elected by direct universal suffrage, and to follow you, José Maria Gil-Robles, who so successfully led Parliament along the path of democratic progress"
"Applause"
"calls for modesty rather than pride, in that the honour which I feel gives way immediately to an awareness of the burden which we must bear together and I can assure you, as far as I am concerned, that it will be exciting but also demanding."
"To those colleagues who voted differently, I must say, in all sincerity, that once he or she has been elected, the President must be everyone's President."
"A first among equals."
"The President is merely the instrument of the smooth operation of parliamentary democracy."
"To remain faithful to my convictions and to the group which nominated me as President, but also to take up the task with rectitude and impartiality, whilst respecting our political or national differences, is how I see my role and its moral code."
"As Vice-President during the last few years, that was how I always tried to behave."
"I shall continue in the same spirit."
"The conditions under which the election was held marked a step forward in the democratic workings of the European Parliament."
"It allowed all Members, whatever the size of their group, to participate openly; it took account of the balance of power established by the citizens who elected us on 13 June; in addition, it allowed each person to express his or her preference, as dictated by conscience."
"As I said yesterday, I am grateful to Parliament for taking into account another aspect of this democratic equilibrium."
"During the life of the previous Parliament, 23 % of Members were women."
"Today, the figure is nearly 30 %."
"Applause"
"Since Simone Veil, who was the first President of the new Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage in 1979, the efforts made over the last 20 years to achieve fairer representation have resulted in the election which has just taken place."
"I am, of course, happy and proud, but setting myself aside I should like to say to the other women Members of the European Parliament that my promotion is also theirs."
"Our constituent part-session coincides with the handover of the new building which, after and together with those in Luxembourg and Brussels, will be the location for our parliamentary deliberations."
"It appropriately bears the name of a great European, Louise Weiss."
"The official inauguration will take place at a later date, but this coincidence is symbolic of the fact that our Parliament has now acquired deep foundations, both literally and metaphorically."
"Architecture has always glorified mankind's projects and it has remained, down the centuries, the tangible and preferred memorial to civilisations."
"It has great significance here and now."
"The fact that we now have premises separate from those of the Council of Europe - grateful though we are for the hospitality it afforded us for so many years - marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one."
"The Gordian knot which bound the European Parliament when it was merely a consultative assembly has now been definitively cut."
"Alas, this building is not without its teething troubles, towards which we and the media must show indulgence."
"We are bearing the brunt of these but I can assure you that at the end of this week we will compile a detailed list of all the functional problems which have come to our attention and we will do everything possible to remedy the situation before the next part-session."
"I am aware of the daunting task which awaits us during the two and a half years of my Presidency."
"Our first duty, as I see it today, will be to demand full recognition of the new responsibilities which the Amsterdam Treaty has assigned to the European Parliament and which must, without delay or hesitation on the part of the other institutions, be translated into deeds."
"Undoubtedly, interinstitutional co-operation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is essential and we hope it will be harmonious, but a better balance still needs to be established between the two forms of democratic legitimacy on which the adoption of Community legislation is based: that of the Member States, embodied by the Council, and that of the Assembly which is the product of the direct universal suffrage of all the citizens of the Union."
"Applause"
"A new era is beginning on the threshold of this parliamentary term - the European Parliament is now a parliament in the true sense of the word."
"Since the Treaty of Maastricht, our prerogatives and influence have continued to grow."
"They have now been strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This is the outcome of the efforts which Parliament has unceasingly made at each stage in the process, with a view to making the Union more democratic."
"This is what happened after the ratification of the Single European Act in 1986, when it took maximum advantage of the new, albeit modest, powers inherent in the co-operation procedure."
"It is also what happened after the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, when it monitored in minute detail the implementation of the co-decision procedure, which was considerably more far-reaching."
"All those among us, and there are many, who took part in the various delegations to the Conciliation Committee, which brought Parliament and the Council together face to face, accompanied and assisted by the Commission, saw for themselves how far this new procedure increased Parliament's influence during the last parliamentary term."
"Thus, almost all the disputes which were submitted to it were settled successfully, with all Parliament's major concerns being taken into account."
"The positive outcome is largely due to the cohesion which I always observed in Parliament's successive delegations to the Conciliation Committees which I had the honour of co-chairing together with Renzo Imbeni and Mr Verde."
"Adherence to the outcome of parliamentary votes, the internal settling of any differences of opinion, the sense of reasonable compromise and responsibility, the thorough knowledge of the various issues displayed by rapporteurs and committee chairmen were of decisive importance and commanded the Council's respect."
"I pay tribute to all the colleagues who took part."
"To make the most of the powers which we have acquired whilst moving towards new democratic achievements has been our constant aim."
"In this connection, I should like to pay special and sincere tribute to the last four Presidents - Enrique Baron Crespo, Egon Klepsch, Klaus Hänsch and José María Gil-Robles - irrespective of their political allegiance - for their considerable powers of persuasion when dealing with the Heads of State and Government in the European Council meetings in which they took part."
"It is to a great extent thanks to their diplomacy and moral authority that the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam introduced the new powers for Parliament which we today are able to implement."
"In future, in fact, there is almost no legislative act in any of the fields covered by the Community's sphere of competence that can be adopted without Parliament's formal agreement."
"In this connection, I would like to say to the Council that I am convinced that Parliament is determined to do its utmost to ensure that the Council and Parliament reach agreement, whenever possible at the first reading."
"But I must also say that the Council will have Parliament to reckon with if the concerns of the citizens whom we represent do not find their proper place in the draft Community legislation submitted to us."
"Applause"
"As far as the Commission is concerned, Parliament now first of all approves the appointment of the President proposed by the Heads of State and Government and then all the Commissioners as a body, whilst retaining its subsequent power of censure."
"I am well aware that this procedure is a very delicate mechanism."
"The outgoing Commission's last few months in office were marked by the serious crisis which everyone remembers."
"The climax came in December 1998 when Parliament dared for the first time to refuse to grant the Commission discharge for the budget."
"The subsequent sequence of events led to the Commission's resignation."
"In the coming weeks, Parliament will hear and then appoint the new Commissioners."
"This will be the first opportunity for the new Parliament to exercise its responsibilities."
"In this connection, I must tell you how I feel. It would be inconceivable for us to appoint the Commission without first having read the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"Applause"
"I would like to say to whom it may concern, in other words the chairman of that Committee, that the European Parliament absolutely must have this document before the hearings of the Commission nominees are held."
"Applause"
"I should like to tell the President, Romano Prodi, that we do not want a weakened Commission."
"On the contrary, we want a strong and creative Commission capable of tackling the great challenges which we have to face together."
"We hope that the means made available to it will be equal to the responsibilities it has to bear."
"But, quite apart from its powers, we expect it to be transparent on the basis of a new Code of Conduct and to respect the political and democratic equilibrium desired by the electorate, we expect the procedures for assigning tasks to external bodies to obviate the risk of conflicts of interest and we expect it to be willing to work in close synergy with Parliament."
"With this in mind, we already appreciate the fact that the Commissioner responsible for relations with Parliament will be one of the Vice-Presidents of the Commission."
"Despite some substantial advances, we all know that the Amsterdam Treaty has not achieved all the objectives attributed to it at the outset, the main one being the institutional reform, an essential precondition for enlargement."
"Our Assembly will therefore need to use all its influence to enhance the Union's institutional equilibrium, and this in several directions."
"The scope of co-decision must be extended so that it becomes the Community legal procedure to be applied to all items of Union legislation."
"The European Parliament must be involved in the common external and security policy as regards the operational pillar thereof, the WEU which must be integrated in the Union's institutional structure, as indeed was decided, in principle, in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The European Parliament must be totally involved in the preparatory work of the Intergovernmental Conference on the reform of the European institutions."
"The citizens who have given us our mandate would find it incomprehensible if the European Parliament were to play only a minor role in a reform as sweeping and necessary as that which is to be undertaken."
"It must be involved at a very early stage, so as to be able to make an active contribution as soon as the preparatory work commences."
"And we shall be asking the Council to heed the request expressed by the Assembly in approving the reports by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsasos, which were adopted by a very large majority, that the method used should be the Community approach, namely a proposal from the Commission to both Council and Parliament."
"Finally, the Council must be aware that Parliament would not content itself with a minimalist reform, if that were to be the case."
"Applause"
"This entire enterprise must, of course, be carried out while stepping up our co-operation with the national parliaments, as indeed we have been doing in the last few years."
"Parliament must also be closely involved in the negotiations leading up to Union enlargement, which remains the priority of priorities in the coming years."
"And it must exercise greater influence over the major budgetary decisions and the defining of the relevant priorities, within the parameters of the Agenda 2000 guidelines."
"Finally, I strongly believe that our Assembly must ensure that the voice of the European citizens it represents is heard more clearly on the international trade scene."
"What has just happened in the World Trade Organisation in connection with hormone-treated cattle is not acceptable."
"Applause"
"We all remember the contaminated blood tragedy and the dangers to human health posed by mad cow disease."
"The problem is not to oppose the progress of biotechnology, but to make sure that the demands of public health prevail. We shall endeavour to do so."
"Applause"
"My experience in our Assembly leads me to think that in the course of this Presidency, we must make progress in a number of directions."
"I shall briefly mention those which seem to me to be worthy of priority, without anticipating the outcome of discussions already under way and which I shall be intent on encouraging."
"First and foremost, we must draw the political conclusions from the low turnout at the recent European elections and gear our internal reforms to the need to bring ourselves closer to the citizens who elected us."
"In this connection, we shall also be at pains to press ahead with the proposed uniform procedure for the European elections."
"Contrary to the image that is being portrayed, the European Parliament works very hard."
"But it may be that we do not work as rationally as we could or should."
"Modernising our working methods and procedures is becoming essential if we want to be more efficient and have enough time at our disposal to make ourselves available to our fellow citizens and voters locally."
"Applause"
"Whilst showing due deference to the Treaties, which are our supreme source of law, we must tackle every issue unflinchingly."
"Our efficiency, both in Brussels and here in Strasbourg, depends upon it."
"Various avenues of reflection have already been opened up concerning, for example, ways in which voting time in the House could be reduced so as to enable more Members to speak in important debates,"
"Applause"
"freeing up more time between meetings to enable Members to meet their constituents during the week or on Fridays,"
"Applause"
"clarification of the respective roles of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, with regard to preparation of plenary sittings - in this connection, I propose that the notification of agendas should be improved and that a list of decisions taken should be sent to Members by electronic mail - the problems raised by the diversity of working languages, which will, of course, become even more numerous with the next enlargement of the Union, enhancing the efficiency of Parliament's administrative departments, responding to the increasing volume of requests to visit Parliament from groups of visitors."
"I do not wish to anticipate the decisions which the Assembly, in its wisdom, will take democratically after weighing up their possible consequences or hazards."
"I should merely like to say this morning that I personally will do everything in my power to foster an open debate and to encourage efforts to make our parliamentary work more efficient."
"My second point is that we must carry through to its conclusion the work already begun on establishing a common statute for Members and, additionally, on clarifying the terms and conditions of employment of our parliamentary assistants, on a basis of transparency and equity and having regard to the dignity of the parliamentary function."
"Today this clarification is essential in a political environment which has changed a great deal since the Treaty of Amsterdam at last accepted it in principle."
"Our Assembly has already made great strides on this issue, on the basis of the report submitted by Mr Rothley."
"This work now has to be finished off by seeking the widest possible consensus in Parliament, and as its President I shall be making every effort to achieve this."
"Finally, it is absolutely essential that we improve our communication strategy, especially in terms of greater decentralisation."
"The information we send out must go far beyond the inner circles within which it is regrettably often confined and reach out as closely as possible to our citizens."
"In politics it is not enough to do things, they must be seen to have been done. And there is a huge deficit in this area."
"'Europe is boring' was a phrase used recently by one of the quality dailies."
"This is the challenge we have to meet and, insofar as I am able to do so in the office that has been conferred upon me, I shall endeavour to meet it, with the assistance of Parliament and that of the journalists, of whom greater numbers will, I hope, take an interest in our work if we succeed in raising our political profile."
"Our failure to inform cannot be remedied by improvisation. It requires an in-depth political debate."
"The current situation is somewhat paradoxical. The results of all the surveys show that European integration is gaining favour in people's minds."
"At the same time, however, the steadily increasing number of people who fail to turn out at the European elections is a reminder of the fact that, for many, Europe remains an abstract concept far removed from their everyday concerns."
"The life of a democracy, however, cannot be reduced to a mere succession of elections and parliamentary procedures, otherwise, as Churchill famously quipped, it would be 'the worst form of government except for all the others'."
"We shall have to accept the political implications of the fact that, for too long, the European Community has been seen by the public, albeit wrongly, as a sort of coldly efficient bureaucratic machine trying to impose standards where there was variety, compromise where there was divergence and uniformity where there were differences."
"It has been one of the Commission's historic achievements that it created the conditions for the single market."
"But people cannot be won over to an ideal by Directives and Regulations."
"If Europe is to be viewed as anything but a constraint, it must give birth to an enterprise which involves much more than setting up an economic and monetary area, even if the necessary social and environmental dimensions are added."
"Applause"
"There is an urgent need today to give new meaning to the Union."
"I believe that our Assembly, using the appropriate means, a matter which we shall have to debate, should set itself the objective of reversing the dangerous trend towards abstentionism by the time of the next European elections and thus ensure that the European Parliament, in the minds of our fellow citizens, retains to a high degree the democratic legitimacy it derives from the ballot box."
"Beyond the confines of the European Union, the international influence of our Parliament is considerable, particularly in all of the countries which have applied for accession and in those which have signed co-operation agreements with the Union."
"This positive image derives not only from the expectation that the European Parliament will provide support in terms of financial aid to development projects or the conclusion of economic agreements with the Union."
"The predominant factor is of a spiritual nature."
"The European Parliament is identified with the success of a civilised democracy on the scale of a large multi-national region of the globe."
"In all of the international agreements for which Parliament's assent is required, our Assembly has unfailingly insisted, even under the pressure of reasons of State, that its approval was conditional on the partner countries showing respect for a more authentic democracy which respects freedom and human rights."
"Thus, for all those peoples who throughout the world are afflicted by dictatorship, civil war or underdevelopment, Europe represents an immense source of hope for peace, freedom and progress."
"I believe that our Assembly should keep sending out signals which mobilise global awareness of the universal nature of the fundamental values of human society."
"In this context the most burning issue, and that closest to us, is of course the tragedy which has torn Kosovo apart."
"Today the guns have fallen silent, the horror has ceased, but peace still remains to be built."
"We each of us somehow sense that this war was about the future of a democratic model which affords protection to all minorities."
"The war also witnessed the emergence of the European continent as a kind of humanitarian sanctuary. It was not acceptable, and indeed we refused to accept, that in the very heart of Europe human rights should once more be flouted in such a barbaric manner."
"The united intervention of the 15 Member States of the Union will, I believe, come to be seen as the founding act of a political Europe, and a fitting response to our citizens' expectation that we should be establishing not just a single market, but a humanitarian ideal."
"A new Europe was born in Pristina, and that Europe has seen the light of day on the threshold of a new century."
"Now that the arms have been held in check, the country is being rebuilt and one day perhaps reconciliation will come, I think it would be a highly symbolic act if my first external initiative as President were to visit Kosovo on your behalf, as soon as that is feasible."
"Applause"
"I know, of course, that many prominent persons have already been there."
"But such an initiative, now that peace has returned, will have special significance: to go to the two communities, Albanian and Serbian, to the United Nations High Representative, to the political and religious authorities, to the international peace-keeping force, and convey the message of our determination."
"The European Parliament will play a full role in the reconstruction of Kosovo and stabilisation of the Balkans."
"It will do so in particular by exercising its budgetary power, but in many other ways too, of course."
"Naturally, I shall be counting on you all to play an active part in attaining all these ambitious objectives."
"The task that awaits us is a tough one, so rather than wishing you a good holiday, I wish you all, I wish us all, good heart."
"Thank you."
"Loud applause"
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate you on your being elected to your challenging post."
"As you yourself mentioned in your excellent speech, immense challenges await us all."
"You said you prized interinstitutional co-operation highly."
"Madam President, I can assure you here and now, and I shall say it again this evening when, in this same Chamber I officially present the programme that Finland intends to adopt while it holds the presidency, that our goal is a closer system of co-operation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Madam President, I have come here today in token of my respect for the power bestowed on Parliament by the citizens of Europe and to offer my sincerest co-operation in building a better future for our citizens, bearing in mind all the while that we are part of a common world."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here on this occasion."
"Applause"
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Madam President, I will be very brief."
"I must congratulate you, on behalf of the outgoing Commission, on your election to the Presidency of the Parliament."
"What can I say about your personal qualities and your already long record in the quest for European integration?"
"We know, because we know you very well, that you are a demanding character, but we also know that you have a profound sense of balance which will no doubt help us in the future to form a new approach with regard to the relationship between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"As you have indicated, I believe - and why hide it? - that this is one of the fundamental issues to be resolved."
"We are convinced that, under your authority, the next Commission will be capable of re-establishing that trust which has always been a fundamental asset as far as European integration is concerned."
"May I reiterate, Mrs Fontaine, my warm congratulations on behalf of the Commission."
"Thank you very much."
"Applause"
"I am truly grateful, Mr Commissioner Marín."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, with regard to the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, I would like to provide all the Members with some information relating to the introductory intervention of our Irish colleague yesterday morning."
"I would like to make it known to all the Members that the issues concerning the means of access, for people with reduced mobility, from the public car parks to all the buildings, is entirely effective."
"I tested it myself this morning, using all the paths provided and signposted by means of all the symbols normally used for this sort of information."
"I want to point this out so that we can stop the circulation of inaccurate facts."
"Everything is in order so that people with reduced mobility may have effective access to the buildings."
"I believe that what still needs to be resolved is the problem of the chamber itself."
"Thank you for that very optimistic intervention."
"I must tell you that I do not share your view totally."
"I believe there is still an enormous amount to do to improve the efficient functioning of this Parliament building."
"Everybody is aware of this and we will do everything we can to resolve these issues."
"Madam President, speaking both for myself and, of course, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I wish to concur with your demand that the second report of the Wise Men be made available to all MEPs before 30 August, i.e. before the hearings with the new Commission begin."
"However, I have learnt from an extremely well-informed source that a kind of preliminary draft report is already in circulation in this House, between the Committee of Wise Men, the services of the European Parliament and the services of the European Commission."
"We know what happens with preliminary draft reports: they are leaked, they get into the newspapers."
"I think we are all entitled to demand that when such a preliminary draft is in circulation, it be made available to the MEPs."
"I know it probably is not possible for it to go to all 626 Members, but would it not then be sensible, if such a report exists and if you can confirm this, for this preliminary draft report to be given to the President and the bureau of the Committee on Budgetary Control for example, and to the co-ordinators of all the groups that are represented in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Mr Staes, that was not exactly a procedural motion, but I have listened to you with interest and, as I told you earlier, I will very quickly make the necessary contacts to that end."
"Madam President, I would like to say something in relation to the Minutes. Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents and the political groups jointly registered an objection to the establishment of the so-called 'Technical Group of Independent Members' and I believe that the said objection should be explicitly recorded in the Minutes."
"I assume that the chairman of the PPE, who currently holds the presidency of the Conference, will have forwarded that letter to the Presidency of the Parliament."
"In any event, I would like to place my group's objection on record."
"Furthermore, since I have the floor, Madam President, I would like to add that it is not appropriate to open a debate, based on rumours, on a subject which we will have to consider in turn on the agenda, for which I believe amendments have been tabled, and on which the political groups are still to give their opinion."
"It seems to me that we should debate each issue in its turn."
"Madam President, I am able to confirm the comments made by my colleague, Mr Barón Crespo."
"However, I wish to draw attention to another item, that of the name of our group."
"Under item 5, it says 'formation of political groups' ."
"I should like to inform you that in future our group is to be known as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)/European Democrats and would ask that note be taken of this."
"I would also ask that note be taken, on the monitors and the other technical installations, of the fact that our group is now the largest group in the Parliament, something of which many people are already aware."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I would simply like to react to the intervention of Mr Barón Crespo."
"We are speaking here of the Minutes."
"When you made the announcement yesterday, no reaction was registered."
"I believe that the Conference of Presidents will subsequently receive a document concerning the constitution of this group."
"We have taken note of this, but I do not believe that it was mentioned yesterday during the discussion."
"I therefore think that the two things are different."
"On the one hand, there is the possible response and, on the other hand, a reflection of what was said yesterday in the plenary session."
"It does not seem to me - and there are witnesses - that any objection was expressed at that time."
"Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba."
"There is no reason to rectify the Minutes."
"Madam President, I know you, like me, will share the concern that this week offers no opportunity to express our interest at what is occurring in Burma and, in particular, the sacrifice and suffering of Aung San Suu Kyi who is our Sakharov Prize winner."
"There has been a troika visit to Burma."
"I would urge you, President, as one of your first acts, to support the proposal that a political dialogue takes place urgently with Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party."
"Thank you, Mrs Kinnock, for that intervention, which I will very much bear in mind."
"Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Poettering a simple question."
"Madam President, a brief question for Mr Poettering."
"Mr Poettering, what is the difference between a Christian Democrat and a European Democrat?"
"Madam President, may I say that I fully endorse your speech earlier in which you said that one of our jobs is to provide the public with information about the work of the institutions."
"Can I invite you therefore under Rule 38 (Statements explaining Commission decisions) to ask the Commission at the end of today's agenda to come to this House and explain the decision that was taken yesterday to fine the French football authorities a derisory £650.00 for a clear breach of Community rules."
"It is very difficult for anyone to understand what that message was from the Commission, apart from to say that it is good news for ticket touts and bad news for football fans to suggest that people can actually get away with breaking the law providing they are prepared to throw a few coppers towards the European Commission later in the process."
"So, may I ask you to invite the Commission, at the end of today's proceedings, to come and explain that decision so that ordinary people can actually try and understand the thought processes which, I have to say, completely confound me."
"We will happily forward your question to the Commission."
"European Council of 3 and 4 June/ German Presidency"
"The next item on the agenda is a joint debate on"
"the report of the European Council and the declaration of the Commission on the Cologne European Council meeting of 3 and 4 June, -the declaration of the Council concerning the six months of the German Presidency."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be able to meet the newly-elected European Parliament today and extend my congratulations to you all, and particularly you, Madam President Fontaine, on your election."
"At the beginning of the German Presidency, the European Union took a historic step when it introduced the single currency, i.e. the euro."
"In January, I declared here in the European Parliament that the Federal Government considered the rationale behind the introduction of the euro to represent further steps towards achieving full integration, and that Germany would spare no effort in attempting to bring this about."
"I said that we considered it important to make the structural and procedural preparations needed to transform a union of Western European countries into a truly pan-European Union which would, at the same time, have power to act in matters of foreign policy and security, and which must therefore be more democratic too."
"Today, six months on, we can see that the progress made in these three main areas relating to integration has fulfilled our expectations."
"This progress is closely associated with the two crises that the European Union has had to contend with over the last six months."
"The resignation of the Commission, the outbreak of war in Kosovo and the European Council in Berlin all coincided, putting the EU's power to act to the test in a dramatic way at a particularly critical moment in time."
"The EU Member States maintained not only unity and their power to act during this extremely difficult period, but also displayed considerable creative genius."
"They turned the crisis to good account as an incentive to achieve further integration."
"The reason for this is that the war in Kosovo served to highlight again that the essence of European integration is to establish a lasting framework for peace on our continent."
"This insight resulted in an awareness of the degree to which the national interests of individual Member States are interconnected, and in a readiness throughout Europe to take a decisive step forward in the historic task of bringing European integration to fruition."
"In this way, the crisis has accelerated the process of integration."
"The step forward we have taken in the course of the last few months is above all a success shared by all Member States and European Union institutions."
"I should therefore like to thank the European Parliament today for fulfilling its responsibility to extraordinarily good effect during this difficult period."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should now like to take a few moments to sum up the main events of the German Presidency and then look at the prospects for the future."
"Firstly, there has been an increase in the ability of the EU to act in matters of foreign and security policy."
"The EU is now an international player holding considerable sway."
"Nothing rendered this more apparent than the Belgrade mission undertaken by President Ahtisaari and the Russian envoy to Kosovo, Mr Chernomyrdin."
"The contribution they made towards bringing the Kosovo conflict to a peaceful conclusion has enabled the civil might of the EU to take a major step in the direction of a common foreign policy."
"Unlike 1991/92, the EU pursued a common line in the Balkans this time, which can be explained by the fact that the European States had at last recognised that it was not just about moral duty or the future of a region on the periphery of Europe, but about their own security, indeed our collective security."
"In Europe, there is just one single, indivisible kind of security; that is, the logical conclusion we can draw from our experience of the tragedy in Kosovo."
"If we had stood idly by in the face of bloodthirsty, aggressive nationalism on our continent, then ultimately the fate of European integration itself, the greatest achievement in recent European history, would have been placed in jeopardy."
"We could not and would not allow this to happen."
"Applause"
"The Kosovo conflict has propagated two important ideas in the EU."
"Firstly, South-Eastern Europe is now widely and unreservedly accepted as being part of Europe."
"This led to the Stability Pact being adopted, a subject I shall return to later."
"Secondly, the Member States have hardened in their resolve finally to give shape to a Common Foreign and Security policy."
"Against this background it has been possible to present a united front to China and the Near East in terms of human rights policy and many other difficult foreign policy issues, and ultimately to reach a number of important decisions in Cologne, which included adopting the first common strategy towards Russia and a timetable for achieving a European security and defence policy, as well as nominating Javier Solana as the best possible candidate for the post of Mr CFSP."
"The European Union's importance as an international player has also become evident at the numerous Interregional Conferences such as the Latin American Summit in Rio, the Mediterranean Conference held in Stuttgart, a platform which can now gain considerably in importance against the background of a new peace dynamic, the ASEM in Berlin and many other meetings."
"Secondly, the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 have secured the European Union the power to act for the next few years."
"If we had failed to reach agreement there, and consider what it would have meant, if the Berlin meeting had finished with no compromise having been reached at a time when the Kosovo war was just beginning and the Commission was in a state of crisis, then Europe would have been plunged into a serious, historic crisis."
"Agenda 2000 contained a sheaf of reform initiatives and huge national interests of a kind unknown hitherto in the history of European integration."
"The fact that it proved possible to reconcile these issues in one great compromise was because major Member States, not least of which Germany, refrained from pushing to achieve the most they could for their own countries, come what may, and instead made the further development of Europe a priority."
"Certainly, the Federal German Government would have liked to have seen more progress in many areas, for example in agricultural policy, where, following the WTO Round, it will be soon be essential to take further reform measures. But, all in all, the compromise is still an excellent foundation on which to lead the Union into the 21st century."
"Thirdly, Agenda 2000 will also foster opportunities for the enlargement of the European Union."
"The success of the Berlin compromise can in fact be measured in terms of the extremely positive reactions displayed by the Applicant States."
"The negotiations for Accession have also made good progress over the last six months."
"We now undertake negotiations in more than half of all the capital cities."
"Moreover, when we decided in Cologne to have a new Intergovernmental Conference on institutional affairs, we seized the opportunity that will enable us to soon overcome the second large internal hurdle facing the enlargement process."
"As a result, the historic project of enlargement has made considerable progress in terms of pace and quality."
"Fourthly, at the time of the dispute that led to the resignation of the Commission, the European Parliament fulfilled the responsible role expected of it by the people of Europe."
"I regard this as the beginning of a process that will lead to more a pronounced democratisation of the Union."
"The nomination of Romano Prodi as the new President of the Commission was a very rapid reaction on the part of the EU States to the resignation of the Commission."
"I should like, at this juncture, to wish Romano Prodi and the new Commission a great deal of luck and every success as they embark on the great tasks ahead of them."
"In adopting the Code of Conduct the new Commission has already sent out an important signal intended to regain the citizens' trust, a good start."
"However, I should also like today to again address particular thanks to the old Commission and all its staff for their work."
"Despite any criticism levied at certain individuals, we should not forget one thing, and that is that without the Commission's hard work and commitment, we would not have been able to solve the numerous and difficult problems, and not least those encountered during the German Presidency."
"Applause"
"My fifth point is that the Employment Pact agreed in Cologne makes it possible, at the European level, to pursue our goal of supplementing and strengthening national efforts to create more employment."
"The Pact improves the conditions necessary to achieve an active employment policy in both a national and European context."
"The macro-economic dialogue agreed on in Cologne, with the involvement of the two sides of industry and the European Central Bank, will make an important contribution to this process."
"We should therefore take stock of the situation for the first time at the Employment Summit to be held during the Portuguese Presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the period that lies before us we should use the dynamic that has emerged over the last six months from the tension between the exigencies of crisis and those of reform, to take further steps towards integration."
"We must make progress in five key areas."
"The first of these is that our experience of the Kosovo conflict must lead to a speeding-up of the enlargement process."
"The agenda for the European Council in Helsinki includes decisions that will point the way."
"Two questions of central importance will be discussed, the first being which additional Applicant States the EU is to enter into negotiations with. It has been evident for a long time now that several of the States not yet at the negotiating stage have made considerable progress in terms of reform and this should be shown due appreciation in Helsinki."
"It should also be made clear that any candidate fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria is entitled to enter into accession negotiations."
"The second question which will need to be addressed is that of a target date for concluding negotiations with the first candidates."
"Numerous idealistic proposals have been made, but as yet we have no foundation worthy of consideration on which to base a realistic date."
"However, a foundation of this kind will be created for the first time in Helsinki, when the full results of the screening and the Commission's new progress reports are made known."
"It is therefore my fervent hope that it will be possible to fix a date in December."
"Personally, I feel that we must fix the date in December."
"This would send out a signal of enormous importance in terms of the future dynamics of the reform process as well as those of the accession negotiations."
"Unfortunately, it has not been possible, over the last six months, to bring about any substantial improvement in Turkey's status vis-a-vis the European Union."
"Germany's proposal to designate Turkey an Applicant State and to assess it in accordance with the same Copenhagen Criteria as applied to the other candidates, did not meet with agreement in Cologne, but this issue remains on the agenda."
"It is important that Turkey should draw up a timetable for implementing the Copenhagen Criteria."
"It is essential that Turkey fulfil these criteria if it is to enter into accession negotiations."
"My second point is that if an enlarged Union is to retain its ability to negotiate then it is essential that the three institutional questions that remained open in Amsterdam, namely the size and composition of the Commission, vote weighting in the Council, and extending majority voting, are clarified in good time and comprehensively before enlargement takes place."
"In any case, this is in the interests of the Applicant States."
"We should therefore make every available effort to adhere to the timetable for institutional reform agreed on in Cologne and to complete the package of reforms in the year 2000 under the French Presidency."
"However this will require the will and support of all Member States."
"Thirdly, the end of the fourth, and hopefully last, Yugoslavian war of succession in Kosovo and the agreement of the Stability Pact mean that for the first time in its history, South-Eastern Europe now has a real opportunity to break with nationalism and violence forever and draw closer to an integrated Europe."
"Reconciliation was able to take place in Western Europe after 1945 and so it can in the Balkans today, provided that it is possible to root out the hatred and violence of nationalism there too."
"For this to be achieved, it is important that the European Union should make the securing of peace in South-Eastern Europe a priority in peacetime too."
"Reconstruction in Kosovo and the EU's central role in giving impetus to the Stability Pact mean that it carries more responsibility, also in material terms."
"Equally though, in the long-term this represents a major and exceptional opportunity for the Union and its national economies which we should embrace with determination."
"Economic co-operation will be a decisive factor in the stabilisation of South-Eastern Europe."
"Germany supports additional proposals for creating a regional Trade and Customs Union with the aim of forming a free-trade zone which ought, if possible, to be linked with the European Union."
"A stable economic framework of this kind would also be of great benefit to outside investment."
"However, the most important goal is to create stable conditions for democracy and rule of law throughout the Balkans."
"The key to the lasting stabilisation of the region will be the democratisation of Serbia."
"Applause"
"This is a question which the Serbian people must decide for themselves."
"Nevertheless, as far as the European Union and its Member States are concerned, we must do everything to strengthen democracy in Serbia and weaken Milosevic."
"It is precisely at this time, when courageous demonstrations are taking place throughout the country, that we must show the Serbian people that they can count on the full support of the European Union when it comes to the democratisation of their country."
"Applause"
"Our experiences over the past few months show that Europe also needs to be better organised in terms of security and defence policy if it wishes to be able to manage future crises effectively by itself."
"The Cologne decisions on the creation of a European Security and Defence Union have far-reaching implications."
"This area of policy must be the European Union's next large project for integration, after the Internal Market and Economic and Monetary Union."
"Consequently, the development of common options for action and the creation of the infrastructure necessary to achieve this will, in time, be the very first item on Europe's agenda for the future."
"But in fact, this is not about militarisation of the European Union at all, but about developing it into an effective force for peace which has the ability to act, and which is able, as in Kosovo, to uphold the power of justice and the renunciation of violence, thus ensuring that war as a political instrument in Europe is forever a thing of the past."
"Applause"
"The future viability of the European Union depends on its being strengthened in terms of its legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the citizens."
"The draft for a European Charter of Fundamental Rights agreed in Cologne should ensure that the fundamental rights of the citizens are accorded the same status at the European level as they are at the national level."
"This is a new process."
"The Charter should be based on a wide-ranging dialogue involving representatives of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the government and the Commission."
"This Committee should present its report to the European Council under the French Presidency."
"I hope that the European Parliament will play a leading role in this process, building on the preparatory work that has already been underway in the Parliament for some time."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress that has been made in terms of political integration and enlargement raises an issue of central importance to the future of the European Union."
"How can a Union of 27, or with South-Eastern Europe in mind, in the long-term even 30 Member States, continue to work and have the power to act?"
"How is the enlarged Europe of the future both to retain its cohesion and fulfil its obligations internally and externally?"
"This question, which in terms of far-reaching implications goes well beyond the next Intergovernmental Conference, is very soon to have a considerable impact on the debate on reform within Europe, indeed it must impact on it."
"Democratisation and, ultimately, development of the parliamentary process within the European Union, must be central to this debate: the creation of a true union of citizens."
"It is only by following this path that we will gradually be able to overcome the decline in interest which manifested itself in the alarmingly low turnout at the European elections. Indeed, it was to the alarm of us all."
"The democratic imperative has become evident from the conflict surrounding the resignation of the Commission, during which the fundamental issues of transparency, democratic control and the legitimacy of European dealings have been raised."
"However, this imperative is also a consequence of the European Union's growing power to act, not least in terms of foreign and security policy."
"A Union that wants to have the power to act in crises and conflicts urgently needs its own chain of democratic legitimacy."
"It will therefore be essential, in the future, for the rights of the European Parliament to be extended beyond the new stipulations of the Amsterdam Treaty, but also for the national parliaments to have greater involvement."
"At the beginning of the German Presidency, Madam President, I initiated a debate on the idea of a European Constitution."
"This debate will further strengthen the citizens' consciousness of their identity as European citizens."
"However, we should detach ourselves from a strictly legal understanding of the term Constitution and instead understand it to mean a combination of values and fundamental principles, the functioning mechanisms of European co-existence, and the way in which the European Union functions as a political construct sui generis."
"The two crises experienced over the last six months will have a long-lasting effect on the progress of European integration."
"The Kosovo conflict has caused us to focus again on the point of departure for integration; the setting up of a European framework for peace."
"The resignation of the Commission, on the other hand, has shown that we will need in the future to create a truly democratic Union with as many checks as there are balances."
"I feel that these two insights serve as a good basis for the Finnish Presidency, which I wish the best of luck for the responsible task that lies ahead of it."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Loud Applause"
"Madam President, I am also going to be very brief this time for reasons which I am sure you will understand perfectly."
"I simply wish to point out that, as mentioned by Mr Fischer, the President of the Council, during the German Presidency - which has been a complicated and difficult Presidency - some of the great issues and challenges which were facing us have been resolved."
"I refer, of course, to the approval of Agenda 2000, which was an enormously difficult exercise in terms of politics, diplomacy and the balance of interests within the Union, and to all the consequences resulting from perhaps the greatest contemporary problem, given its repercussions within the European Union itself, by which I mean the Kosovo conflict and all the circumstances surrounding it as well as its resultant consequences for the future."
"European security and defence have taken a step forward with the appointment of the person responsible for the CFSP."
"These steps perhaps demonstrate that foreign and security policy, in the aftermath of the Kosovo affair, continue to be the 'Achilles heel' of Community construction and still have a long way to go."
"Finally, the European Employment Pact has also been given a great boost - with the implementation of the conclusions of the European Council of Luxembourg."
"The outgoing Commission therefore congratulates the German Presidency."
"We believe it has been a very good Presidency."
"Very difficult problems have been resolved."
"This is all due, with no doubt whatsoever, to the talent, efficiency and intelligence of Mr Fischer, the Foreign Minister, with whom I have been very impressed, and I promise him that, in my new life, when I return to Spain, I will go jogging and eat bananas."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr Foreign Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I concur fully with your speech, Mr Foreign Minister, but unfortunately the German Presidency cannot be assessed in a purely positive light."
"That is why my words will be less genial in tone than those of the President-elect of the Commission."
"The German Presidency was one of peaks and troughs, and whilst we have recognised its successes, there were also serious shortcomings, failures and blunders."
"The German Presidency had to contend with the tragic situation in Kosovo, and the Berlin Declaration left nothing to be desired in terms of clarity."
"The German Council Presidency, together with the countries of the European Union of the Western Alliance took resolute action in order to oppose the Yugoslavian tyrant and dictator Milosevic."
"Such action was necessary and just."
"Our message on the threshold of the year 2000 must be: never again are people in Europe to be driven from their homes, from their homeland."
"Human rights, human dignity, the right to a homeland are the foundation of our European civilisation."
"On behalf of our group, I should like, Mr Foreign Minister, to address a word of thanks and recognition to you on an expressly personal note, for having championed human rights with such dedication and commitment, even to the point of sustaining physical injury."
"Applause"
"But we in our group have often asked ourselves: what would have happened if our political friends had had your political responsibility?"
"Had you been a member of the Opposition, would you have shown the same solidarity towards the Federal Government?"
"That is why we want to say a word of thanks to our political friends in the CDU and CSU, and also to the Liberals, for showing such pronounced solidarity in their support of the Council Presidency."
"It filled us with horror, and we are as critical of this as you are, that the chairman of the post-communist PDS shook hands with Milosevic in Belgrade."
"What is more, this individual's supporters are represented here in the European Parliament."
"Kosovo must now be reconstructed; that is one of the European Union's main tasks."
"We must not repeat the mistakes made in Bosnia, when there was so much red tape and everything took so long, but rather the European Union must take rapid action that is free of red tape."
"In this respect, the Council of Ministers, Commission and European Parliament are called upon to take concerted action that will give the sorely afflicted people in Kosovo, in former Yugoslavia and the Balkans, hope for the future."
"Agenda 2000 was decided on in Berlin and it must now constitute the basis on which the first applicant countries will be able to join the European Union during this legislative period of the European Parliament, hence by 2004."
"The crux of the matter here is to anchor the European family in the principled society bequeathed by European civilisation, the expression of which is the European Union."
"This will promote stability and safety, democracy and peace."
"But we also say, and I know that we agree on this, that there are prerequisites to enlargement, namely the reform of the European Union."
"We welcome your endeavours towards a European Charter and we welcome your endeavours as regards a conference on the reform of the European Union."
"At the heart of this reform process must lie the long overdue acceptance of the majority system in the Council of Ministers as the fundamental decision-making instrument for this Parliament."
"For we want this to be a Union which has the power to act and which is rooted in the principles of democracy and the parliamentary system."
"The Cologne Summit reached a decision on the Secretary-General, also known as the High Representative."
"We consider Javier Solana to be an excellent choice."
"But it is now a case of ensuring that this High Representative is given the authority he needs and that he works constructively with the appropriate Member of the Commission."
"Furthermore, we must prevent those areas of foreign policy where a common line is already being pursued, from degenerating into mere co-operation between the States of the European Union."
"We must take great care to ensure that the correct steps are taken in this respect."
"The Western European Union must be integrated into the European Union, which would be a welcome move."
"Should the Assembly of the Western European Union ultimately disappear, then, of course, in addition to the national parliaments, there must be parliamentary accountability at the European level. For this reason, authority in foreign, security and defence policy must accrue even more to the European Parliament, so that there is no sphere within the European Union escaping the influence of parliament and democracy."
"Applause"
"I should now like to turn to less pleasant matters associated with the German Council Presidency."
"Firstly there is the appointment of the new Commission."
"At the beginning of the year, the Council Presidency advised us to issue the discharge for the 1996 and 1997 budgets, thereby giving us advice that was actually long out of date."
"The Federal Government was still at a stage of development which we were unable to fully comprehend."
"Then it came to the nomination and appointment of the two German Members of the Commission."
"Mr Foreign Minister, it is scandalous how this process has developed."
"It is scandalous how the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany has handled this issue."
"The Treaty provides for the Members of the Commission to be nominated on the basis of agreement between the President-elect and the national governments."
"We now know that an individual nominated by the Federal Government did not even have the opportunity to meet up with the Chancellor before the Chancellor's discussion with Mr Prodi, which means that the Chancellor had no conversation whatsoever beforehand with the individual that he proposed."
"He then, as it were, imposed these two people on the President of the Commission, the President-elect of the Commission, which did Romano Prodi, the European institutions and the Federal Republic no service."
"The list of mistakes of this kind goes on."
"Even before the German Council Presidency the Environment Minister travelled to London and Paris with the intention of breaking off Treaties."
"It was to be the first time since the War that Germany would breach international law in the French National Assembly."
"This was inappropriate behaviour of the worst kind on the part of the Environment Minister."
"The failure of the German President-in-Office of the Council and the Finance Minister to attend the launch of the euro is another case in point."
"The disappearance from office of the President-in-Office of the Finance Council is an event that has never before taken place in the history of the European Union."
"The Chancellor's order to drop the Directive on end-of-life cars from the Council of Ministers sitting is something unknown and unheard of hitherto in the European Union, and the order given by the Chancellor that the German Minister of Trade and Commerce should not attend the Council of Ministers sitting in Finland is also without precedent in the recent history of the European Union."
"Mr Foreign Minister, I am sure that none of this was intentional, but from Konrad Adenauer, through Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt to Helmut Kohl the strength of German politics always resided in the fact that Germany's partners trusted her."
"I hope, Mr Foreign Minister, that you will be able to safeguard this trust in the constancy and reliability of German European policy in the future, for it is of importance to progress within the European Union and to the future of our European continent."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that Mr Poettering is keen to use the European Parliament as something of a platform for parading his national Opposition in Germany."
"But the performance you give here, Mr Poettering, cannot, nor will it ever match the real-life drama facing our Foreign Minister."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union has passed the acid test during difficult times under your Presidency."
"You have quoted the important points here and I will not hesitate to say that in so doing a number of shortcomings and weaknesses have been glossed over."
"There is no doubt of that."
"But the decisions taken under the German Presidency over the last six months will shape the future of the European Union far into the next decade."
"Mr Poettering asked what would have happened if the decisions taken under the German Presidency had been taken under a Presidency of his political persuasion."
"I can tell you what would have happened, Mr Poettering."
"You would have rung all the bells here, lit a thousand candles and had the Te Deum strike up."
"Incidentally, that is the difference between Christian Democrats and European Democrats."
"We are not going to start singing here but would simply like to thank the German Presidency for a successful period in office."
"Applause"
"We welcome the fact that the European Council, under the German Presidency, has concluded the work on a European Employment Pact."
"We know that a European Employment Pact cannot replace national endeavours to create employment, but it can and must co-ordinate, focus and stimulate these endeavours."
"We also know that a European Employment Pact does not, at this stage, constitute European employment policy."
"The governments of all the Member States must succeed in progressing from non-binding joint declarations to binding common policy with clear guidelines and agreed terms of reference."
"We don't just need a Pact to stabilise the euro but also one which will create employment in Europe."
"Secondly, the decisions the European Council had to take in the area of common foreign and security policy will alter the European Union more profoundly than it is possible to envisage at present."
"For the first time in history, the European Union employed armed troops in Europe on a joint basis, showing remarkable resolve in the process."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we want you to show the governments of the Member States the same determination when it comes to promoting peace in the Balkans."
"NATO won the war, the European Union must now win peace."
"The Stability Pact for the Balkans is a just and necessary step but it is not yet a Balkans policy."
"The creation of offices and agencies should not be the sum total of EU policy in the Balkans."
"If you continue in this vein then very soon you will need an office to co-ordinate the co-ordinators, and that is not a Balkans policy."
"My third point concerns the reform of the EU institutions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in January, you made a fine speech here which was very forward-looking."
"However, the decisions taken by the Cologne European Council on institutional reform barely scratched the surface."
"We consider it too fainthearted to restrict ourselves to the reforms contained in the Amsterdam Protocol."
"It is certainly a good thing that you set the reform process in motion in Cologne, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have an answer to the questions you raised here regarding the future prospects for enlargement of the European Union and the shape of our European Union in institutional terms, and our answer to these questions is clear: we want major institutional reform to be undertaken prior to enlargement."
"The price of a larger Europe must not be a lesser Europe."
"Lastly, a few words on the new Commission."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the new Commission."
"May I remind you that there will only be a new Commission when the European Parliament inaugurates it by vote of confidence....."
"Applause"
".... but if Mr Poettering is going to shout it about that the Chancellor did not speak to a Commissioner-designate before the nomination was made, then in fact I must inform you, Mr Poettering, that former Chancellor Kohl often spoke to Mr Bangemann and you can see how successful that proved to be, i.e. not at all."
"Talk serves no purpose whatsoever."
"Nevertheless, again on the address from the other side of the House as regards the inauguration of the new Commission, we refuse, and on this matter I now speak on behalf of the Group of the Social Democrats, to make the procedure and timetable of Parliament dependent on the presentation of a report by a non-parliamentary group or a non-parliamentary committee."
"We will not accept any delay in the inauguration of the Commission."
"You may well bring this about if you have the support of the majority, Mr Poettering, but then you will also have to explain to the public why a Commission that resigned in March is still in office six months after its resignation."
"My group will not support these obvious delaying tactics."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I have no desire to involve myself in a private German dispute."
"Applause"
"I would like to congratulate Germany on a broadly successful Presidency though I would venture to suggest that it might have been perceived as more successful had it been trumpeted rather less."
"Recent presidencies - Austria and Luxembourg with their low key presentation - can teach larger Member States such as Germany and the United Kingdom that the impact of a Presidency is sometimes in directly inverse proportion to its fanfare."
"This has been a difficult Presidency."
"The Kosovo conflict started during the European Council in March."
"The news that Belgrade had accepted the peace terms came during your Cologne Summit in June; and the resignation of the Commission ten weeks into your Presidency cannot have made life any easier."
"I would like to concentrate my remarks on three areas - employment, enlargement and citizenship."
"Employment, Mr President, is a constant reminder of the failure of Western democracies to be inclusive and I would welcome some very good new ideas that came up during this Presidency."
"Allowing Member States to reduce VAT on labour-intensive services where there are no cross-border implications; a renewed emphasis on research and development and a more imaginative use of European Investment Bank money such as in the creation of the European technology facility; changes in work organisation and working time to share out better the work available."
"These are all ideas that came up and they deserve to be pursued."
"I regret that less progress was made on Agenda 2000."
"The Presidency claims to have created the financial framework for enlargement to the east."
"I hope that is the case but I believe that the reality is that we backed away from the tough decisions on agricultural reform."
"That will lead to problems in transatlantic relations and to further delay in the integration of Central and Eastern European applicant countries into the European Union."
"But the most important progress has been in the area of citizens' rights."
"If we are to get this right, we need a new approach from the Member States."
"If we are to create an area of freedom, security and justice - promised to us at Amsterdam - then we will need transparency."
"It is a disgrace that important documents regarding the Third Pillar have still not been made public, but I would pay homage to the role of Mr Fischer himself in this particular area and thank him for his help."
"Amsterdam heralds a new dawn in the rights of European citizens."
"It was a brave decision of the German Presidency to table and to advance the idea of a charter of fundamental rights."
"Your pluralistic approach, your attempt to involve the European Parliament and national parliaments can only add to the likelihood of success."
"We as a Parliament, Mr President-in-Office, look forward to working with the Council and the Commission in securing the anchoring of fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms for the citizen in European law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Foreign Minister, it would be politically short-sighted if a representative of the Greens were to praise the German Presidency with no ifs or buts."
"For example, is it not the case that the conduct of the red-green Federal Government regarding the Regulation on end-of-life cars has caused it to lose credibility and sacrifice an environmentally-friendly, sustainable policy to short-term opportunism?"
"A rather different attitude can therefore be expected from a member of the Greens, when speaking of the German Council Presidency, not that we would wish to compete with the Opposition for their role, Mr Poettering."
"The German Presidency faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances and we believe that it passed the acid test well; a faltering European Commission which had at last to face facts and which resigned, but which in so doing also afforded a clear view of Europe's major institutional shortcomings."
"The staffing implications were quickly dealt with under the German Presidency with the appointment of Prodi, which was an important start."
"Unfortunately, the Council has failed to speed the progress of the institutional decisions with the same determination, but we wish to extend our particular thanks to Foreign Minister Fischer for his important initiatives, for his important work, in precisely this area."
"Agenda 2000, an ambitious reform project, was to be put into action under the German Presidency in order to deepen European integration and to make the EU fit for enlargement towards the East by means of substantial reforms."
"Not all the decisions reached at the Berlin Summit were as forward-looking as we had expected."
"For example, whilst good compromises were reached in the area of finance, which will provide reserves for enlargement of the EU towards the East, only faltering steps have been taken in terms of agricultural reform."
"It was here that the opportunity to pursue a policy of environmental sustainability, which strengthens regional structures, was thrown away."
"The German Presidency was marked not least by the escalation of events in Kosovo."
"The decision to undertake military intervention, in order to oppose a policy of racism, nationalism and ethnic expulsions in a 21st Century Europe, met, as you know, with a variety of reactions in the Green Party."
"However, the German Presidency demonstrated great commitment to driving forward a solution, what is known as the Fischer-Plan, with the participation of Russia, Finland, and not least the UN."
"We must now strengthen the region by providing well-directed reconstruction aid in order to prevent renewed destabilisation."
"The German Presidency played its part in strengthening this Europe of common interests."
"We hope that the learning processes experienced by all parties at this time will contribute towards the strengthening, democratic development and enlargement of Europe."
"However, the European Parliament also has its part to play now and must carry on the work in precisely this area, which involves strengthening the EU institutions and consolidating the democratic structures of Europe."
"It remains for me to address a final word to Mr Poettering, without wishing to make reference to decisions on domestic policy, for I feel that as this is a European Parliament, there are other matters besides Germany that we should be discussing But I can assure you of one thing, Mr Poettering, which is that the Green Party did learn from Bosnia, and has now learnt from Kosovo, and we would have taken account of this responsibility today, even had we been at a different Assembly."
"It was not without reason that we had a great many discussions within the Party, and I think we have made enormous progress in this respect."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to begin with, allow me to address a few words to my colleague, Mr Poettering."
"A little while ago, you made reference to the fact that your group is called the Christian Democrats and European Democrats."
"Unification of Germany took place almost nine years ago, and it would please me greatly if, after such a long time, you could at last bring yourself to respect the fact that there is a Democratic-Socialist Left in Germany which is now also represented in the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, instead of an Employment Union we're getting a Defence Union."
"That is the uninspiring outcome of the German Presidency and the inauspicious message it sent out."
"The hastily adopted Agenda 2000, which is to secure the financing of the Community and its enlargement, is a half-baked piece of work."
"Agricultural reform failed to open the door any further to the Applicant States of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Immediately after the Berlin Summit the Federal Government itself commented that agricultural policy would need to be reformed again in view of enlargement."
"Not even the nomination of Romano Prodi as President of the Commission was able to camouflage the poor results produced by this Summit."
"The German EU Presidency took no action to at least put a brake on the euro's continued decline in value on foreign exchange markets."
"The crisis facing the European Single Currency was not even on the agenda in Cologne."
"Not a single decision was taken on the taxation of international speculative movements of capital or the fight against tax dumping and tax havens within the Union."
"As a German MEP, it saddened me greatly that national egotism was to become the hallmark of the German Presidency."
"The crass way in which the European Directive on end-of-life cars was blocked solely to serve the interests of a German car company caused dismay, as did the overdue appointment of ex-Minister to the Chancellery, Hombach, as envoy to the Balkans and the lack of understanding of the goals and nature of French politics."
"It became clear that in many Member States, people felt they had been duped by this lord of the manor approach to European policy."
"Our group is as emphatic in its appreciation of the Cologne Summit Decision, which it intends to actively support, so as to further strengthen the fundamental rights of the citizens in the future, as it is resolute in its criticism of the Employment Pact."
"Since unemployment continues to languish at a high level, this Pact does not merit its name."
"Indeed, that is one of the reasons why such a shockingly large amount of people stayed away from the European elections."
"The people of Europe do not understand why European employment policy should degenerate into sound bites."
"Binding and verifiable, quantitative goals must at last be agreed for economic growth and the fight against unemployment."
"We vigorously declare our support for a socially responsible Europe and that is why we will not tolerate people lightly putting the social cohesion of the Union at risk, preaching restraint in matters of pay and calling the social security systems into question."
"During the German Presidency, the NATO war in the Balkans, which transgressed international law and dispensed with the authority of the UN, was actively supported by the European Union and its Member States, and at the same time the Community's conversion to a so-called defence union was sealed."
"War as an instrument of politics was rendered socially acceptable again and the progress of this fatal course will be speeded further still by the incorporation of the WEU military pact into the European Union and by the build-up of armed forces for intervention."
"Disarmament, crisis prevention and the settlement of conflict by non-military means, in particular by strengthening the role of the OSCE, risk falling by the wayside."
"It was this kind of reasoning that led to NATO General Secretary Solana being nominated as the future Mr CFSP."
"Our group rejects this nomination."
"The German EU Commissioner-designate Mr Verheugen said after the Cologne Summit that it would scarcely have been possible to achieve rapid agreement on the strengthening of a Common Foreign and Security Policy for the Union without the pressure of the Kosovo war."
"Put another way, war became the driving force and catalyst for European integration."
"That is disastrous, and looking ahead to the year 2000, a dangerous and misguided path to go down."
"Those who are now hailing the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe a great success would have done better to have refrained from squandering the money on bombs, rockets and soldiers and instead to have presented the Pact a few months earlier as part of a comprehensive political and non-military plan drawn up by the European Union for the region, and to have provided the OSCE with the necessary means."
"We give our staunch support to a policy that outlaws war and military violence, banishing it from the lives of all peoples."
"Applause"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would first like to briefly mention the lessons which can be drawn from the recent European elections."
"It seems to me that the massive and increasing abstention recorded in all of the European countries indicates the emergence and confirmation of a virtual Europe which is distancing itself more and more from European citizens."
"Another apparent sign of the increasing disinterest of the Europeans in European construction is the lack of interest in the euro, barely six months after its launch."
"It seems to me - and this is the second lesson to be drawn from the European elections - that an increasing euroscepticism amongst voters in numerous countries has been demonstrated, particularly in the United Kingdom and France, and I believe that by voting for the opposition parties in the large European countries, it is the Europe in which their governments participate that the citizens wanted to reject."
"I see an enormous paradox in yesterday's election, on the part of the Right in this hemicycle, of a candidate who, however admirable, is a known federalist, when this does not apparently reflect the view expressed by the voters - particularly those of the Right - in the countries of Europe."
"I do not believe that the legitimacy mentioned by the German Foreign Minister can be achieved by reproducing, on a European scale, the party systems to be found in the European countries."
"This legitimacy can only stem from a Europe which has been 'reforged' on the basis of national democracies rather than trying to create a virtual Europe which is ever more distant from the concerns of its citizens."
"To return to the Cologne Summit and the consequences of the German Presidency, I will make three points."
"First of all, the Employment Pact which has been Europe's old chestnut for a very long time."
"I believe that a certain German Chancellor whom we have still not forgotten, Helmut Kohl, used a phrase which seems to me to sum the situation up exactly."
"He said, 'employment - in other words, unemployment - is and shall remain a national prerogative' . This is precisely the definition of this Europe which is seen to make plans but leaves the problems to the Member Nations."
"The second point concerning the German Presidency and the six months that have just passed is the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"It is clear that this reform has been and still is a precondition to the negotiations to be held with the World Trade Organisation, which, as we well know, is an instrument of the dominant economy, that is, the American economy."
"The recent developments that we have seen with regard to the WTO, the way in which the new negotiations will be carried out and, particularly, the appointment of the Director General preferred by the Americans for the first round of the WTO, are very bad omens with regard to European interests."
"It seems to me that this Europe, which was born of the idea of the Common Market, has become a Single Market and will end up as nothing more than a part of a great global market."
"That will effectively mean the defeat of the Treaty of Rome project."
"Lastly, the Kosovo affair has also demonstrated the impotence of the European Union and its total diplomatic and military dependence on the dominant military power of NATO."
"Furthermore, the appointment of the Secretary General of NATO as a representative of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy, appears to complete the picture, and brings to mind that phrase of a French diplomat who said that it is illusory to try to develop a European defence policy while building the European Central Bank in Fort Knox."
"I believe that the Kosovo affair and its favourable outcome have eclipsed the six months which have just passed."
"It is very important - for our group at least - that, in the course of the coming institutional reforms, a far greater importance is afforded to national democracies and national parliaments, instead of allowing Europe to sink deeper and distance itself even further from the citizens by creating the kind of democracy that I have described as virtual."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the Presidency of the European Union has now passed from German into Finnish hands. It is now time to review the last six months and as well as assess the German Presidency."
"We now face a situation in which the German Presidency has in fact already assessed its own performance."
"According to a recent statement by the German Minister of State Mr Verheugen, it has been a very successful six months."
"We find these sentiments repeated in the speech by Minister Fischer."
"I think some questions are in order here at the very least."
"Firstly, the negotiations for Agenda 2000 produced an agreement that was only a watered-down version of the original ambitious proposals placed on the table by Germany."
"There is still the danger that whilst the agricultural sector is being reformed, there is no increase in opportunities for enlargement of the Union with countries from Central and Eastern Europe."
"The nomination of Prodi as President of the European Commission and the recent events in Kosovo have also left their mark on the German Presidency."
"The rapidity with which Prodi was nominated was good, although it is certainly taking a very long time for the new European Commission to get up and running."
"Consequently, the European Commission's work has been at a standstill for far too long."
"In addition, the war in Kosovo has greatly influenced the way in which the German Presidency has developed."
"Chancellor Schröder also deserves praise for his work in this area, although of course the work of the United States and President Ahtisaari of Finland should not be forgotten."
"It has highlighted the fact that it is not easy to achieve one common European policy, but I've spoken on that subject before."
"What really concerns us is the way in which the German Presidency in the Environment Council dealt with the draft Directive for the handling of end-of-life cars."
"Of all governments, we might have expected a green/red coalition to have taken the initiative here, rather than prove obstructive."
"After all, the German car industry doesn't pull the German government's strings."
"The private chats between Germany, France and Great Britain also give cause for concern."
"For example, the posts of Prodi, Solana and Boisieur have recently been allocated during discussions entered into by these three big powers."
"If this is a sign of the way in which future posts are to be allocated, then this does not augur well for the small Member States."
"The Council of Ministers will have to become aware of this and adapt its policy so that it is possible to achieve an even distribution of positions across all Member States."
"As far as that is concerned, one of these small Member States, Finland, can endeavour to bring about change in the coming months."
"We shall just have to wait and see."
"Preparations for the forthcoming IGC fall to the new Finnish Presidency."
"There are important items on the agenda for this and our group hopes that they will receive due attention."
"Mr President, the Presidencies of the Council of the European Union are not isolated entities and cannot be judged without taking into account the sequence of past events."
"The German Presidency was established within the context of the British leadership and the creation of the single currency."
"Thus, no judgment can be made regarding the outgoing Presidency without taking into consideration the low profile of the previous one and the hopes raised by the appearance of the euro, which were then dashed and now remain on the drawing board."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam had not resolved the issue of the functioning of the institutions, and in the field of foreign policy the only step forward was the appointment of Mr CFSP who, however, was not yet in office during the Kosovo crisis, which, without waiting for the delays and continued absence of Europe, broke out like a scourge and set off a new spate of the crime of ethnic cleansing which had infected Bosnia."
"The German Presidency was therefore left without sufficient tools at its disposal and the Atlantic Alliance was the only support suitable to confront Milosevic's policy."
"Notwithstanding the ambiguous waverings of certain governments, the weight of the European Union was irrelevant for the purposes of military action and Europe was seen to have no autonomous will, even with respect to the Alliances."
"Was the Cologne European Council meeting a step forward?"
"Perhaps, with regard to the intentions declared, but it all seems very hazy to contemplate setting a date by which the Union will be able to be an autonomous political entity with foreign and security policies."
"The responsibility of the national governments regarding the excessively delayed implementation of political union is huge and the German Presidency really does not seem to have changed the rhythm."
"The only positive point is that it included the common defence issue on the Cologne agenda."
"Another issue on which the Presidency failed to make progress was that of employment."
"Having shouted from the roof-tops during the German election campaign that with the socialist rise to power everything would change and a shining path would be embarked on leading to the creation of large numbers of jobs and thereby reversing the negative trend evident in Europe for over ten years, no initiative was taken in this direction and no proposal was discussed with regard to the development of the European economy."
"Without a concerted economic policy aimed at development it will be difficult to fight unemployment or create conditions adequate to stop the fall of the euro."
"Since the German Presidency did not do this, how is the Finnish Presidency going to manage it?"
"And how are we going to be able to deal seriously with unemployment with the date for enlargement ever nearer?"
"Political union, foreign policy, defence policy, common economic policy, the fight against unemployment - these seem to be the priorities that no Presidency can ignore."
"But the Presidencies talk about these issues, pass them, yet fail to implement them. The European Union loses momentum and the citizens continue to call for less talking and more action."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has, of course, been overshadowed by the war in Kosovo, but that is all the more reason for keeping in mind that the Presidency of the Council, for which the German Federal Government was answerable, was only able to maintain its position in this matter because it had the unqualified support of the Parties of the Union, whilst your own supporters, Mr Fischer, would have taken pleasure in knocking your trainers from under you, had you still been wearing them of course."
"The Council Presidency's track record is questionable, and it is in fact only the Council Presidency itself which disputes this."
"Let us have a look at the outcome of Agenda 2000 for example."
"This is not a decent compromise, but a shaky foundation."
"It will not even withstand the onslaught of the first WTO negotiations."
"This holds true for the problems associated with agriculture as well, which are far from being resolved, and which have not provided any scope for enlargement whatsoever."
"All that was achieved was a worsening of the situation in terms of farmers' income."
"The promising attempt at a solution in the form of co-financing was allowed to slip out of sight at the very beginning, which was an amateurish way to proceed."
"At first, the German Chancellor stirred up the question of net contributions and the overhaul of the financial framework, particularly in the German public arena, and then, when it came to solving these problems, he failed miserably."
"Institutional progress? Wrong!"
"Everything has been postponed for the future and for future conferences."
"The single currency, Minister Fischer, which you have rightly claimed to be one of Europe's great achievements, obviously wasn't even important enough in the eyes of the Finance Minister, who had responsibility for this matter at the time, for him to attend the first important session."
"That is also something which should not be forgotten."
"And where exactly did the gossip concerning the independence of the European Central Bank come from, which was to contribute not least towards the weakening of the euro against foreign currencies, and to the fact that only now, much to our relief, is it beginning to pick up again."
"This Council Presidency's track record is problematic due, in particular, to the fact that like few before it, it failed to act in a way which was beneficial to the Community."
"A particular instance of this can be seen in the case of the withdrawn Regulation on end-of-life cars."
"This was not dealt with in a way which was beneficial to the Community, and it was left to Mr Trittin to play the role of the fanatic, a role which obviously comes very naturally to him."
"No, this Presidency of the Council has forfeited the trust built up by many previous Chancellors over the years, and therefore it is particularly appropriate that we should examine the events of the last six months with a critical eye."
"We cannot talk in terms of success."
"Applause"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to offer my warmest congratulations on yesterday's splendid election result."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the challenges of the German Presidency showed very clearly just how difficult and complex the world we live in is."
"The news of tragic events in Kosovo held our attention in the spring, and it came as a great relief when the Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, informed the Cologne Summit that the Yugoslav authorities would approve a peace plan for Kosovo."
"It is now very much the responsibility of the EU to start to rebuild the region and stabilise the situation there."
"The situation in the Western Balkans clearly shows that Europe needs a more effective course of action to ensure stability in this continent."
"A vital part of that process is the Union's enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The indisputable achievement of the German Presidency was the ultimate agreement that Agenda 2000 was vital for the issue of enlargement."
"It is important during the Finnish presidential term to get a clear indication of just how determined the EU is to make headway in the enlargement process."
"For that reason we must make a serious effort to introduce inter alia much-needed institutional reforms."
"The German Presidency, and now the Finnish Presidency, which has just begun, have been overshadowed by an administrative crisis which culminated in the resignation of the Commission."
"We all certainly hope the crisis is a prelude to a genuine series of reforms in respect of the way things are done, not only in the Commission, but in the Council and in Parliament also."
"However, we have to remember that no headway can be made without a new Commission which is functioning successfully."
"Obviously, Parliament must make full use of its consultative and monitoring rights in respect of the institutions, including the Commission, but it also has to be aware of its responsibility in this important situation to ensure that the new Commission may begin its work as soon as possible."
"We must be particularly careful that national political passions do not predominate over the common European interest."
"Unfortunately, I think there have been signs of this in this debate."
"The citizens of the European Union, our own citizens, who were disturbingly passive in the European parliamentary elections, hope, above all, that the Union will improve the situation regarding employment."
"A healthy rate of employment is also essential for the equitable development of our societies."
"For that reason, we must embark on the practical implementation of the European Employment Pact, which was concluded at Cologne."
"It is also important to pay close attention to ensuring that the economic policies of the EU Member States are compatible, and to developing courses of action in order to bring this about."
"That will be vital in ensuring that the employment rate rises."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the German Presidency has had to assert itself within a particularly dramatic context."
"The first six months of this year have demonstrated, once more, the need for European integration on the one hand and the need to continue the process of enlargement on the other."
"With regard to the latter, the war in Kosovo reminds us of the wisdom of the Copenhagen criteria which stipulate, amongst other things, respect for human rights on the part of all applicant countries as a precondition for their accession to the European Union."
"The Cologne European Council, which unquestionably confirmed this double ambition, shows us the enormity of the task still to be undertaken and the additional efforts which are required in this area."
"The European Council meeting in Cologne, despite all the efforts of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council - to which I would like to pay particular tribute - still nevertheless raises some major questions."
"I would like to highlight two of them."
"The first relates to point 53 of the conclusions of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to ask the German Foreign minister how we should interpret the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference and particularly - and I quote - the possible use of qualified majority voting in the Council - end of quote - in view of the declaration of Belgium, France and Italy, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I would like to ask you whether these three Member States who, in Amsterdam, made the reinforcement of the institutions an essential condition, and therefore a prerequisite, for the conclusion of preliminary accession negotiations, still maintain the reservations annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, or whether they have moderated their position in the meantime."
"My second question concerns the common security policy, particularly with regard to defence."
"In my opinion, any European Union defence policy will overlook the basic problem for as long as the Member States do not accept the indivisible nature of security in the territory of the European Union."
"We are still not there."
"To this end, I would like to ask Minister Fischer if he envisages, apart from the conclusions of Cologne, a short or medium-term perspective on allowing accession to those countries which have not signed up to Article 5 of the amended Treaty of Brussels, that is, the mutual assistance clause which binds countries which are currently Members of the Western European Union."
"I believe that the subsequent and essential stages will depend on this question if we want to realise the contents of the provisions of Chapter J IV of the Treaty of Maastricht."
"Mr President, the Greens believe that non-violent methods of solving conflicts must play a much greater role than military intervention during the 21st century, and that any force which could , under exceptional circumstances, become necessary should only be applied following a UN mandate."
"We envisage an important role for the EU as a non-violent civilian peace maker."
"For this reason, we regret that the German presidency did not follow the European Parliament's recommendation to the Council to carry out a pilot study for a European civilian peace corps."
"We are also worried about the resolutions of the meeting in Cologne which have been interpreted around the world as important steps towards militarising the EU."
"The Swedish government has been forced to say that if more steps are taken in the same direction, a veto would have to be lodged."
"The Finnish presidency has requested clarification as to whether the Cologne resolution means that the EU would only be able to intervene following a UN mandate, or whether the EU, like NATO, would be entitled to take the law into its own hands."
"Joschka Fischer now states that the resolutions taken in Cologne do not imply a militarisation of the EU, which all sounds very nice."
"But why then are Poettering and Goerens, who are now in the vanguard for a militarisation of the EU, so satisfied?"
"Why is the WEU military alliance integrated into the EU?"
"Why, according to the resolutions taken in Cologne, is the EU to create a military commission, a military council and other military institutions?"
"I really do hope that Joschka Fischer is serious when he says that the EU will not be militarised, which would reunite him with the Greens' fundamental principles of non-violence."
"As a non-violent civilian body, the EU is indeed able to play a very important positive role."
"Were we, however, to become a military superpower competing with other superpowers for world hegemony, the EU would only contribute to power struggles, chaos and warfare, which I sincerely hope will not be the case."
"Mr President, with the passage of time, I believe that it will be seen that the German Presidency has had some successes."
"With the approval of Agenda 2000, I believe we have produced an agreement between those people whose unfair and selfish motto is 'I want my money back' and all those who, led by the government of my country, believe that the European Union is a political project with cohesion and solidarity as its cornerstones."
"I also believe that the Presidency reacted quickly in the face of the resignation of the Santer Commission and found that 'one in a million' which Mr Prodi appears to be."
"It also seems to me that the appointment of Mr CFSP, after the image which we projected in Kosovo, demonstrates at least that the Presidency wanted to shake up the European Union's lethargic foreign policy and give it a new impulse."
"And this new stability plan for the Balkans seems to me to be a positive thing."
"However, Mr President, there is one thing which has reflected badly, very badly, on this Presidency."
"I refer to the reform of institutions."
"Mr Fischer, if there is one thing which all this morning's speakers have agreed upon, it is the fact that the Cologne Summit does not form a basis for the reform of the Union's institutions."
"We want the European Union to work, we want to maintain the principle of integration and we want it to be effective."
"The proposal of the German Presidency in Cologne, that is, to change the number of Commissioners, reconsider votes, perhaps to move in some areas from a unanimous vote to a qualified majority vote, is quite clearly insufficient."
"I will go further."
"You do not understand the protocol of the Union's institutions."
"If you believe that there will be enlargement to more than 21 Members, profound institutional reform is required."
"What you proposed to us in Cologne was a limited reform."
"And not only I myself, on behalf of my group, but also all the other groups in this Parliament, say that this will only achieve one thing: it will obstruct the European Union."
"I therefore believe, Mr Fischer, that we in this Parliament are bored of so much verbiage."
"You came to us and said, and I quote, 'I praise the role of the European Parliament and the revision of the institutions' ."
"Let me ask you not to praise so much and not to laugh so much."
"Take note of what we do."
"We have a resolution dated 19 November 1997 in which we propose a method for the reform of the institutions."
"We told you of it and you have not taken it into account."
"Well, we will meet again in this Parliament, Mr Fischer, and you will see that this Parliament will be unanimous in its rejection of any reform which does not guarantee the effectiveness of the Union and guarantee that it really serves the interests of the citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think very highly of my colleague Mr Poettering, the new Chairman of the new, hard to pronounce group in this House."
"I am nevertheless extremely concerned by his speech, concerned because it expressed more than the fact that he represents the largest group and forged an alliance with the Liberals for the election of the President of this House."
"But if this pact is supposed to be one which is somehow intended to strike terror into the hearts of, or rather, create difficulties for, the governments led by Social Democrats, then Mr Poettering and his group should be made aware that this doesn't just create difficulties for Social Democrat-led governments, nor does it only create difficulties for governments like that of Austria, which also includes a Conservative party and a Christian People's party, but it causes difficulties for the process of European unification."
"On behalf of my group I would also like to make very clear at this point that we will not be judging the Commission and the new Commissioners on their party political affiliations, but on the skill, clarity and correctness of their past and present stances, and we believe that these must be the only criteria by which to judge them."
"I now come to the fundamental aspects of the Presidency."
"In many respects, it was a successful Presidency, I would like to acknowledge that quite clearly, certainly as far as Agenda 2000 is concerned and the furthering of the enlargement process, and also concerning the difficult decisions relating to the Balkans and security policy."
"I would especially like to give my personal thanks not only to the Chancellor, but also to the Foreign Minister, to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fischer, who is present today, for doing everything in his power to bring us out of this difficult state of armed conflict."
"Opinions on whether the war was justified, or whether it could have been prevented, vary throughout this House, but the German Presidency, and I would like to make particular mention of the Foreign Minister at this point, managed to act on the basis of a clear position with regard to the crimes of Milosevic's regime, but also on the basis of a clear position whose most ardent wish was for peace in the Balkans."
"It was handled well and properly, and that deserves distinct recognition."
"In this respect, and since security policy comes up for discussion here again and again, I would like to clearly emphasise the following: security policy is not about militarisation of the European Union."
"It is about employing all the instruments of security policy to take whatever preventative measures can be taken, and I have said repeatedly that many opportunities for taking preventative action have been missed in past years, and no group, nor any Presidency can claim here that they did everything possible to prevent this war."
"Therefore, we must now support all the forces in Serbia and Yugoslavia which are striving for a new political system, which are standing up for democracy, for human rights, for respect for minorities."
"This is the only chance of success."
"The second thing, and this is extremely important, is that we must enable all of those who are returning - and thank God there are so many returning, it was also the right decision to keep the refugees in the region where possible - to get through the winter in conditions which are acceptable for human beings."
"That is why the money for this must quickly be made available, and the appropriate organisation must be established, so that the largest part of our work does not go on ensuring that there is co-ordination between one organisation and another, but is devoted to giving substantial help to the Balkans, so that the Balkans will finally become a peaceful region in Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to comment briefly on what has been said here before I leave on a trip to Turkey."
"I would like to thank all those who sang our praises and who gave us their support, and I would also like to answer some criticisms."
"Something that we never promised, and there was no way on earth that this could be done, was that in these last six months we could resolve every problem facing the European Union, problems which I too have dearly wanted to see resolved for some time."
"On criticism of the institutional reforms; we tried to make progress with the institutional reforms, and when I made my maiden speech as Germany took over the Council Presidency, it was still not at all clear whether we would actually receive support for an Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am glad that it was possible to push this through."
"I see this as an important step forwards."
"But this is where the critics got themselves into a terrible muddle, and sometimes, all logic went out of the window."
"To my colleague in the PDS who, on the one hand, criticised us for ignoring French sensibilities and also the aims of French politics and yet, at the same time, heavily criticised the inadequacy of the compromise on the agricultural commodities market that was worked out at the Berlin Summit, I can only say that these things go hand in hand, and you should look more closely at whether you have not, as it were, ended up getting yourself entangled in a knot of contradictions."
"It will become clear to you in the weeks and months to come that these things are very closely linked."
"I would like to say to those of you who are talking of the militarisation of the European Union, and this is an important point, keep your illusions."
"This would mean that in the areas of security and foreign policy, Europe would not be in a position to determine its own fate, that is, to follow its own path."
"During the war in Kosovo, I experienced just how much weight Europe can bring to bear in terms of possibilities for shaping situation by political means, and in terms of possibilities for pursuing a preventative foreign policy, a preventative peace policy, and for resolving a conflict when the conflict has worsened."
"I can only say that Europe must come together, also in terms of its security and foreign policy, otherwise decisions will be taken elsewhere."
"Here in the European Parliament or perhaps in any one of the Member States, it may be easy to sit back and allow oneself the illusion that we are not affected by such decisions."
"The reality is that these decisions are taken under completely different conditions and in a completely different place."
"This is exactly what I do not want, and I believe it to be a development in the wrong direction."
"Applause"
"The euro is showing that there are differing views on Europe, and we should not pretend otherwise."
"It is quite obvious that there are."
"My view is that of a convinced integrationist and I would like to see Europe become an entity which has the power to act politically, because there are two reasons which convince me that it will not work in any other way."
"The first reason is that in this age of globalisation, it will only be possible to maintain the European nation-state and that which we value and wish to preserve about the European nation-state, if Europe unites, because the magnitude of the traditional nation-state will only be able, in the conditions created by globalisation, to guarantee peace, security, prosperity and democracy for its citizens as part of an integrated Europe, in other words, if we have a European entity, a European Union which has the power to act."
"The second reason though, and this was clearly demonstrated again by the war in Kosovo, and perhaps the various lessons history has taught us also have a role to play here, particularly in central Europe, is that there can only be one form of security for this continent. We cannot permit nationalism, racism, and what amounts to a primitive and crude form of fascism, to take hold on this continent."
"Since 1992, we have tried everything in order to convince Milosevic to abandon this policy."
"I took part in the final stages of the talks at Rambouillet right through to the beginning of the military action and I did not meet anyone on the Western side, even amongst the Americans, who was behaving like a war-monger, but rather everyone was striving for compromise up to the proverbial last minute."
"The only party not interested in a compromise was Milosevic and the government in Belgrade."
"I personally had a two and a half hour long discussion with Milosevic, and for one of those hours there was no one else present."
"Should we have sat back?"
"Should we have said that we would like to help, but we cannot, as it would offend our pacifist principles and we have no resolution from the UN Security Council?"
"The UN is stronger today as a result of this conflict, and this is one of the effects of Europe's role during this conflict."
"The Security Council is stronger today, unlike after Bosnia, which weakened it."
"I think that we should acknowledge that..."
"Applause"
"....., that this is a result of the concerted efforts of the European Member States, of the European Union."
"We should not forget this."
"Let me tell you, I was in Bosnia, I saw the mass graves and I will not forget them as long as I live."
"It is our duty to complete the process of European integration, and this means peace, security and democracy for everyone on this continent."
"This requires our determination to oppose those who seek to carry out nationalist policies through violence, murder, terror and expulsion, and when all other means fail, to resort to military means if necessary."
"This integrated Europe must not accept nationalism."
"Applause"
"That is the most important point, although it was not included in the plans for our Presidency of the Council, because it gives a very strong message about the future of the European Union."
"I am firmly convinced that in essence, this must go hand in hand with progress towards integration, and above all with the process for further democratisation."
"This will be a very complex and complicated debate, but we must start this debate, which in France is summed up under the heading 'Culmination of European Union' , and it will continue for a long time. Where do the outer borders of the European Union lie?"
"What is the relationship between the European Union and its Member States, and the relationship between the institutions themselves? What will the future role of the Parliament be and how can its powers be strengthened?"
"These are all questions which will relate directly to enlargement, because we can already see what heavy weather a Union of fifteen Members makes of things."
"If enlargement occurs, the question of the Union's ability to act will be absolutely central."
"This is the essence of the next great challenge; common security and foreign policy, deepening and, ultimately, enlargement."
"I have a message for all those who speak in favour of a preventative peace policy, and there is a broad consensus in the national parliaments as well as in the European Parliament, in spite of all the things Dayton failed to deliver, and that is not a criticism of Dayton as presumably it couldn't have been any other way at the time, and that message is that a strategy which will be effective in the long-term for bringing South-Eastern Europe up to the level of an integrated Europe and then bringing it into an integrated Europe, has now become a functioning policy."
"Life must now be breathed into the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe."
"Money is not the first and foremost issue here, for the issue is one of decisions about structures."
"We must bring about confidence there and we must establish a free trade area there."
"Trade and change must replace national aggressions and the necessary means must be put in place to achieve this."
"So I appeal to all of you who have spoken here in favour of a preventative peace policy, to fight for the long-term success of the Stability Pact, because that would indeed be drawing the right conclusions from the war in Kosovo, the Yugoslavian wars of succession."
"I would like once again to thank everyone, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for your support during the German Presidency, and I wish you, the new Parliament, all the best, as I do the coming new Commission, once they have survived the difficult hearings. These are the Commissioners who have yet to be appointed in the torture chambers, and I mean this ironically and, of course, only in a rhetorical sense, of the freely-elected European Parliament."
"All the best!"
"I would also like, if you would permit me to, to make a parting request of you, and in particular of the new majority: we should discuss national politics at a national level and argue intensely about them, and come to blows, but it is European politics that should be discussed at the European level, and this House should always uphold the subtle differences!"
"Applause"
"Thank you, President Fischer."
"In addition to the opinions which have been expressed, on behalf of the Parliament as a whole, may I thank you for your work, as you have put in six months of extraordinary hard work."
"Mr President, it is a shame that Mr President-in-Office of the Council is now leaving the hall as I was going to begin by offering a word of praise."
"I was going to say that he has been one of the few, if not the only, shining lights under this Presidency."
"Mr Swoboda mentioned the new majority, yes the new majority gives the profile and views of this Parliament clarity, and that is good for Europe, Mr Swoboda."
"Applause"
"Unfortunately, I have no option but to grade the German Presidency as overall 'unsatisfactory' for the first six months of this year."
"The grandiose announcement of a new Employment Pact turned out in reality to be a castle in the air."
"When analysing the Cologne Decisions in detail, it is possible to see that not one new idea was added to the Luxembourg guidelines of the previous year."
"Secondly, the language and style adopted by the German Government over the last six months have at times caused me to feel ashamed in the European Parliament."
"This style has been of no use to Europe and it has certainly been of no use to the German Presidency."
"Mr Trittin's loutish conduct in terminating the nuclear Treaties led of course to the German Presidency's proposals being regarded with great scepticism."
"The shameful withdrawal of the sound proposal for co-financing in agricultural policy was also the consequence of a similarly ill-advised policy."
"And to cap it all, I might add that Chancellor Schröder said Helmut Kohl's cheque book diplomacy must at last be brought to an end!"
"I do not wish to say any more at all on the nomination of the German candidate, which in view of the choice, was a resounding slap in the face, and so to conclude I shall express a wish. As long as the dictator Milosevic is at the helm in Serbia, neither a penny nor a euro of the European taxpayer's money should go to Serbia."
"Democracy must first be restored there."
"That is the message the Council Presidency should take away with it."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the Berlin Agreement has enabled the European Union's main issues to be opened up, but it has not done anything to secure the future of the European Union in the long or even medium-term, because the Agenda 2000 Agreement went far beyond what was necessary."
"I say this because in the first place, it has been unable to achieve any reform of countries' own resources, which should be based solely on the Gross National Product, the only fair, equitable and transparent basis for contribution."
"Secondly, it has not reformed the Common Agricultural Policy, which was imposed in order to make us adopt an offensive position in the next round of GATT negotiations."
"Without wishing to denigrate the efforts of Commissioner Fischler, it was almost a reform which maintained the status quo which had never secured the sought-after balance between farmers, regions and their cultures, in which farming in the Mediterranean was once again badly treated by the CAP."
"It did not guarantee, in any practical sense, the completion of the European Farm Model, almost nothing was done in this area to help small farmers and very little progress was made on the issue of rural development."
"Thirdly, this Agenda 2000 runs the risk of leading us towards a Europe which is less evenly-balanced and less united."
"I shall give you two examples from the country I know best, which is my own."
"Firstly, all the studies have shown that the Portuguese economy is the one which will be most affected by competition from the new Member States from Eastern Europe, but nothing has been done to support Portugal in this area."
"Secondly, nothing has been done to improve the situation of Portuguese farming, the one which is the most debt-ridden, backward and least-favoured by the CAP."
"Apart from the durum wheat quota, Portugal has gained nothing specific from this CAP unlike some countries such as Spain or Italy which have benefited from arrangements made specifically for them."
"It is true that we in Portugal suffer from a government which is incompetent and unable to negotiate successfully, but this does not justify all the treatment we have received."
"We need a more united Europe in order to move forwards."
"Mr President, the serious and negative effects of the financial crisis and the slowing down of economic growth within the European Union, at a time of Economic and Monetary Union, have clearly underlined the need for the Cologne Employment Pact."
"It is no castle in the air, but a long overdue, concrete attempt to go beyond employment guidelines and achieve co-ordination of economic policy within the European Union, particularly with a view to promoting growth."
"We need structural reform in the European Economic and Monetary Union, in the European Union."
"However, it is equally important to achieve increased and more rapid growth."
"That is our aim."
"In this respect, the national governments are right, as far as the European Employment Pact is concerned, not to delegate responsibility for employment policy to the European Union."
"However, they are aware that in this age of globalisation a common solution must be found, and that is right."
"There should simply be more concrete terms of reference and guidelines."
"But I should like to ask something of the forthcoming Presidencies."
"We also failed under the German Presidency to improve the democratic legitimacy of Economic and Monetary Union dealings."
"We urgently need there to be inter-institutional agreement between the Council, Commission and European Parliament on the essential features of economic policy."
"In addition, we need the guidelines on employment and economic policy to be integrated, and we need the institutional framework for the European Employment Pact to be modified, something which is of great importance."
"In other words, it is more democracy that we need and not for the European Employment Pact to increase the democratic deficit, and this is what this Parliament demanded during the previous legislative period."
"As regards this demand, we must also..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr President, I believe that overall the German Presidency was a very positive period."
"In particular I should like to thank them on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, and indeed the Socialist Members, for the very good work that was done throughout that period on the reform of the structural fund process."
"We believe that we have a fair and just deal for Member States."
"In particular I would like to thank the Germans for not only pushing ahead for progress in peace concerning Kosovo, but peace on the issues concerning Northern Ireland."
"This House will know that we have entered yet again a critical phase in the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"Successive Presidencies have backed that peace process."
"What I should like to say today at this inaugural session is that we hope to be able to count on our new Commission President, on the Finnish President-in-Office of the Council and indeed on Madam Fontaine to continue that good work in supporting the peace process and making a priority of peace in her visits to Northern Ireland."
"I would like to announce that I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament"
"The next item is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, you have had a declaration distributed to us and a trial vote has subsequently taken place."
"The name of the candidate selected is visible and is also emphasised by the asterisk."
"I should be grateful if you could explain to us how, under the circumstances, we are to vote in secret."
"I regard it as being anything but a secret ballot and wish to contest its legitimacy before we go any further."
"It is illegal."
"We vote in secret here, and not in such a way that everyone can see how people cast their votes, and that includes the cameras present in this house."
"I do not consider that a secret ballot."
"Applause"
"It is true, colleagues that unless you put a piece of paper over your machines, the people around you can see how you are voting."
"What we mean by 'secret ballot' is that no record is kept."
"Of course, when you fill in a piece of paper, someone can look over your shoulder and see where you put your cross."
"However, we can vote on whether to have a written vote instead."
"Parliament decided to hold an electronic vote"
"(In successive ballots the following were elected Quaestors of the European Parliament:"
"Mr BalfeMrs BanottiMr DucarmeMr PoosMrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to express my grave disappointment with the manner in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has handled this matter."
"I believe it is morally wrong that the representative of the Greens/European Free Alliance was not selected, and I hope that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will consider this matter among themselves."
"Your comment is noted."
"The sitting was suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Statement by Mr Prodi, President-elect of the Commission"
"The next item on the agenda is the declaration of Mr Prodi, President-elect of the European Commission, and it is my great pleasure to offer him the floor immediately."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the new President of the European Parliament and all of you most warmly on your recent election."
"I am very happy to be here today to introduce to you a new team of European Commissioners."
"In the last two addresses I gave before the European Parliament, in April and May, I promised to inaugurate a new era of change within the Commission."
"The new College of Commissioners which I am going to introduce to you today is the team which will implement these changes."
"I do not intend to introduce each member of the College to you individually."
"They are sitting here in front of you and their names are well known to you."
"This is a well-balanced team of the highest quality, and is the result of my constructive debates with the Heads of State and Government, which have fully respected the new powers which the Treaty of Amsterdam conferred on the President-elect."
"Each member of the team has proven experience."
"Almost all have been members of the parliaments of their own countries, three quarters of them have been Ministers, many have been leaders of political parties and others have accumulated a wealth of experience in diplomacy, business, economic policy making and the legal sphere."
"Right from the beginning, I have made no bones about the fact that I would not accept a lower female representation than that of the outgoing Commission."
"I have succeeded in this although I had hoped to do better."
"Therefore, throughout its term of office, the Commission will promote equality of opportunities between the sexes in all sectors."
"The new College is also characterised by the right balance between the political complexity of national governments and the European Parliament."
"I am happy that this is so, but it should be specified that the Commission does not operate according to the same procedures as political parties."
"The Commission is a College and the Commissioners are neither delegates from political groups nor representatives of their national governments."
"Applause"
"In our first informal meeting last weekend, we set a few clear ground rules."
"Each Commissioner will, at all times, discharge his duties in such a way as to reflect the interest of Europe as a whole."
"If at any point I am not satisfied with the situation, I will not hesitate to use the powers conferred on me by the Treaty and change competences and portfolios or ask individual Commissioners to resign."
"With regard to this, although it is not laid down by the Treaty, each Commissioner has given me his personal assurance that he will stand down if and when I ask him to."
"Obviously, this is not a step to be taken lightly, but the existence of these agreements is a transparent guarantee of the sense of responsibility of each individual Commissioner."
"We also found we were in agreement regarding the need for the new College to abide by the highest standards of public life."
"One of the first actions of the new Commission will therefore be to adopt formally the new Code of Conduct for Commissioners, including also new, stringent rules for avoiding conflicts of interest when the Commissioners leave their office."
"We are looking forward to getting down to work and we hope that dialogue with the Parliament will be frank and open during our team's hearings, and that we will receive firm support from you in September."
"I will now move on to the other main subject of my address today: the reform of the Commission."
"The need for reform is indisputable, as recent events have shown that European institutions as a whole are no longer adequately equipped to deal with the wide range of tasks incumbent upon them."
"This is why I have promised a revolution in the Commission's operating procedures."
"This does not mean that I want to undermine the Commission's achievement as an institution: that would be extremely unjust."
"The Commission has many strong points, including committed, experienced personnel and a great capacity for innovation and foresight."
"Over the years, it has given proof of its considerable capacities to adapt, repeatedly taking on new tasks and responsibilities."
"Practically every major development in the process of European integration can be traced back to the commitment and dedication of the personnel in the Commission."
"However, as is the case in numerous public administrations, the world has moved on and the Commission has failed to keep up."
"Too little has been done to modernise the institution itself and no alterations of substance have been made to the structure of the Commission in forty years."
"This is why an in-depth examination of the institution's working procedures needs to be carried out now."
"The challenge to be taken up consists of redesigning, adapting and improving the organisation in order to make it more efficient, to fight fraud at all levels and place the institution at the service of the citizens of Europe."
"Let us not be under any illusions!"
"This whole process of change will take time, but an initial reorganisation of the Commission is already underway."
"The bureaucratic machine will be simplified and rationalised, with fewer Directorates-General."
"The Commissioner's offices, that is, their private offices, will be in the same building as their respective Directorates-General."
"Both offices and Commissioners will be more streamlined and more multinational - I have tried to ensure that each head or second in command of an office is the citizen of a different country from that of the Commissioner, and each office contains people from at least three different Member States."
"The rules for appointing higher civil servants will be more stringent and transparent, and mobility within the Commission of higher civil servants will increase."
"The Directorates of the Commission will be identified by short, clear names instead of by numbers, and a larger department will be established in the mass media and communications sector to ensure that the Commission's policies are communicated professionally and that they reach all the citizens of Europe."
"Naturally, this is only the beginning and further, more important changes will follow."
"Presumably, the Committee of Independent Experts will present its second report in September, although I share Mrs Fontaine's hope that it will be ready for publication as soon as possible, within a time frame which the five wise men will be able to sustain."
"We will study this report with the utmost attention, and I hope that it will contain elements which will be useful for the reform process."
"In this respect, the new Vice-President responsible for reform will submit a detailed plan at the beginning of the year 2000."
"All this will have to be discussed in depth with the European Parliament."
"In particular, we will have to find a suitable mechanism for ensuring that the Parliament is kept constantly and exhaustively informed of the progress of the reform, while at the same time respecting the Commission's autonomy in managing its own competences."
"My intention is to transform the Commission into a world class administration which will lead by example."
"Our watchwords at all times will be transparency, accountability and efficiency."
"Now is not the time to dwell on the programme for the new Commission."
"I gave a broad overview of our future priorities in my addresses to this Parliament in April and May, and we will have the opportunity to examine these issues in more detail in September."
"I am here today to introduce the new Commission, not its programme, but I can promise you that the central theme of our entire programme will be to make the European Union more relevant to the citizens of Europe."
"In fact, it cannot be denied that the European institutions are suffering from a collective loss of confidence on the part of our citizen and in order to win this back, we must act decisively."
"However, we will only succeed if we confront the issues which have genuine importance in the daily life of the citizens, such as unemployment, economic growth and the challenge represented by sustainable development to ensure a balance between the creation of riches, social justice and quality of life."
"This must be the new Commission's genuine priority."
"As I have just said, this is not the time for a detailed examination of the programme, but I would like to put forward just three examples of what I mean by renewal."
"First of all, let us consider the issue of health and food safety."
"The European public has lost confidence in the national and European authorities responsible for controlling drugs and foodstuffs: it no longer has faith in this government, or any other governments, or scientists."
"I consider it our duty to take the initiative and make provision for an independent European Food and Drugs Agency, which will help to win back consumer confidence."
"Applause"
"Air traffic is another matter for concern."
"Our European airports are in a semi-permanent state of chaos, due to ever-increasing traffic and lack of co-ordination between air traffic controllers."
"I think we can all testify to this."
"The problem transcends national boundaries in this case as well, and we must seek solutions at a European level - solutions that really work."
"A third example is the doping which is taking place in the sporting world - a question which may seem banal to some but which for many is a cause of deep concern."
"This is a problem which obviously requires the different nations to co-ordinate and take decisive action."
"I do not pretend that Europe has all the answers to these problems."
"What I mean is that we must show our commitment to contributing to the resolution of these issues at a European level, as by their very nature, they go well beyond purely national boundaries."
"I have no hesitation in suggesting that in some cases - or, rather, in many cases - the answer to the concerns of disillusioned European citizens lies not in reducing but in increasing the European dimension."
"The vast majority of European citizens are not sceptical about action on a European scale, but they are becoming increasingly disillusioned and are fast losing interest in the interminable, impenetrable wrangles over who should do what at a European level."
"What the citizens persist in demanding are clear answers to the important problems in their everyday lives."
"The bottom line is, what interests them is not who solves their problems but the fact that the problems are finally being dealt with. They want consumers to be able to trust the food they buy, travellers to be able to take a plane without worrying about their safety and the sporting world to be above board."
"I have already stated that I do not intend to dwell on the policies as the time for that will be in September."
"However, I would like to touch briefly on two issues which are especially important in the new Commission: Kosovo and the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"Let us first take the situation in Kosovo and the Balkans."
"The war in the Balkans has left the whole of Europe deeply scarred."
"What we must do now is make sure that peace brings something positive."
"As time goes on, my concern grows that our capacity to make war far exceeds our ability to co-ordinate the reconstruction after the devastation suffered by the populations involved."
"More time than necessary has been wasted in diplomatic disputes over who should co-ordinate the reconstruction work."
"It is now a question of focusing our energy on the really important tasks: rebuilding houses left without roofs, putting back together shattered communities, and, even more importantly, providing the Balkans with a clear political and economic future, which will put an end to all the centuries of continual conflict."
"Only the European Union can do this."
"In order to restore peace, a clear, long-term strategy is needed, based on reconstruction, reconciliation and rapprochement : construction to repair the damage done by the war, reconciliation between all the parties involved, including the Serbian people, and the rapprochement of this region to the European Union, including the prospect of future accession to the European Union for all the countries of the region, if and when they show themselves to be politically and economically ready."
"I am sure that the best way of pursuing such a goal is the method already successfully employed by the Community in the past: firstly, to ask the various parties to co-operate with each other, to start to work together on issues of everyday relevance, to establish customs unions, to set up common institutions and to consolidate peace through common interests."
"This is how lasting peace was achieved within the European Union, reconciling opposed nations by co-operation."
"When the Second World War was still a recent event, the signatories to the Treaty of Rome were people of great courage and farsightedness."
"Are the men and women of our generation unable to display the same farsightedness and courage over the Balkans issue?"
"Is it that Europe is not ready to take the risk?"
"Does Europe not have the ambition to bring about successful change?"
"When we start to take up this challenge, we find before us a paradox. The European Union may be first in line with its contribution, but the risk is that the impact of its aid will be lost in a complicated network of competing structures: the United Nations Mission to Kosovo, the Stability Pact, the G-7 High Level Group for economic relations, the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia, the special envoy for the Republic of Yugoslavia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
"This multitude of decisions undermines the central function which should be carried out by the European Union."
"There is a desperate need to simplify things."
"In particular, we must ensure that the European Union's huge financial contribution is spent on reconstruction and not on bureaucracy."
"I believe this is the reason the Commission has refused, for example, to draw upon the budget made available by the OBNOVA reconstruction programme, approximately EUR 45 million to pay the salaries of the seven hundred people working for the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia. This is the equivalent of a sum of about EUR 17 million out of a total of forty-five."
"As a priority, our financial aid must be used to benefit the population and reconstruction work directly."
"We must focus exclusively on sustaining the economic growth of the region and reinforcing its democratic structures."
"Moreover, with regard to the structures to be created, we must pay particular attention to the specific value added in each case."
"We must at all costs avoid things being done in Brussels when it would be better to do them in Thessaloniki, and doing things in Thessaloniki when it would make more sense to do them in Pristina."
"Applause"
"The second point which I want to touch on today is the new Intergovernmental Conference which will be announced at the Summit in Helsinki."
"Some people think that the Intergovernmental Conference will be a simple job of fine-tuning after the Amsterdam Summit, the object of which will be to speed through the individual issues on which it was not possible to reach agreement in Amsterdam."
"I do not share this view."
"For me, the Intergovernmental Conference will be crucial for European institutions."
"It is our opportunity, possibly the last opportunity, to prepare ourselves for the potential doubling of the number of the Union's Member Countries."
"In my opinion, an Intergovernmental Conference which only has limited goals could not deal with a similar challenge."
"I am well aware that some people will object that it is better to make rapid progress in a limited field than to line up a whole series of issues in several fields, which are too complex to be resolved quickly."
"To me, this means not going to the heart of the matter."
"If the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is too limited to allow us to prepare adequately for enlargement, the only thing to do is to enlarge its scope."
"Applause"
"It will serve no purpose to patch up the borders."
"For enlargement to work, an in-depth, thorough examination of the institutions is essential."
"To this end, I intend to build a small, high level working party - and I do hope that it will be of a high level - which, during the next three months, will prepare a report on the subjects to be covered at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The report will contribute to the preparation of the official position of the new Commission on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Even though much of the political demand of the European Union is currently opposed to a clear refusal on this matter, I will not be shaken in my resolve to present, at least in an official way, the possible options."
"Applause"
"In my opinion, it would be an error of mammoth proportions to organise an Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki which is too limited, simply because of the collective fear of confronting the real challenges of future enlargement head on."
"We will naturally see to it that the European Parliament plays a greater role in the work carried out in Helsinki."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and the institutions of the Community have been through a very difficult period."
"The European public is now looking to us to draw a line under the past and move on towards the future."
"The challenge facing all of us is that of restoring the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens and ensuring that they understand the benefits that the European Union provides for their personal, everyday lives."
"I cannot insist enough on this point."
"As I speak, the whole of the European public is watching us, and is waiting with bated breath to see what is about to happen in the great history of the Commission and the Parliament."
"I would like to propose that we disappoint those spectators who have come here to watch a confrontation."
"None of us will act in the interest of the people of Europe if we allow the European institutions to be in a state of permanent confrontation and deadlock."
"Now we have a new Parliament and a new Commission, and this is our opportunity to start afresh."
"The Commission and this Parliament are the only two institutions whose leaning is exclusively and genuinely towards Europe."
"There should be a solid alliance between them."
"We have to deal with the same tasks. Who else, if not the Commission and this Parliament working together, can take this project forwards?"
"The Commission has suffered greatly from the recent events, but I believe that this Parliament has also been affected, considering the poor turn-out at the recent elections."
"The task we face is that of restoring deep, mutual confidence between the two institutions, which has traditionally been the driving force of European integration."
"This means working together, while at the same time acknowledging the diversity of our functions."
"I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the Parliament for there to be a strong, autonomous, independent, trusted Commission."
"I hope that the new College which you see before you today will receive your full support in September."
"The go-ahead is not, however, a carte blanche for the future."
"This Parliament, which is the voice of the citizens of Europe, is the supreme judge of the Commission's work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with many challenges and Europe needs a powerful sign of renewal and leadership."
"I have done all I can to prepare the new team and we are all impatient to get started."
"However, only you can give us the signal to start work."
"I am confident that you will use the great powers and responsibilities conferred on you by the Treaties wisely and in the best interests of the Union."
"Applause"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time that a debate of this kind has taken place in this form."
"That is progress and we welcome it."
"Today's debate is part of a longer process and the Hearings, which are to start on 30 August and run throughout the first week of September, also form part of this process."
"All those who say that they endorse the Commission or say 'No' to it today, be they within or outside this Parliament, are disregarding Parliament, because the Hearings are an important part of the whole process, at the end of which we will be free to reach a decision on whether or not we will endorse the Commission."
"Applause"
"Mr President, you said again just now that the Commission is balanced."
"I don't know which criteria you would cite in support of its being balanced, but I want to make it crystal clear to you that we, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats do not consider this Commission to be politically balanced."
"Loud applause"
"And that is why we must not allow the myth to develop in Europe that this Commission is balanced."
"If you were to repeat that it is politically balanced then under no circumstances would you be increasing the likelihood of your team being endorsed, although it may well be thoroughly competent."
"Applause, heckling"
"Consequently, Mr President, I should be grateful if you could enlarge a little on the criteria used to judge balance."
"This team has a weak point."
"You said that you were wholly responsible for putting the new team together."
"I am bound to inform you that the preceding Council Presidency under the Federal Republic of Germany certainly did not speak in terms of a process in which you as President-designate of the European Commission were involved."
"What happened to you in Bonn was a diktat from the German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder"
"Applause, heckling"
"The Treaty states: the governments of the Member States shall nominate the other individuals they intend to appoint in agreement with the President-designate."
"As far as we are aware, you had no involvement in the nomination of the two German Members of the Commission. I am bound to tell you that I find this regrettable."
"The vociferousness of your arguments does nothing to improve them, Mr Cohn-Bendit, neither does it improve the arguments of the others now kicking up a fuss behind me. We consider it unacceptable that whilst Great Britain, Italy, Spain and France nominate two Commissioners, one of them belonging to the Opposition, this example is not followed in the Federal Republic of Germany."
"I consider it unacceptable."
"Loud applause"
"It shows presumptuousness and arrogance on the part of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Applause"
"Our President, whom we elected to Office yesterday, spoke of how important it is for us to receive the Report by the Wise Men as quickly as possible."
"It is my wish for us all that we should work together to see that this report by the Wise Men is made available before the Hearings begin."
"Applause"
"We, or at least my group, will also do all that is necessary to ensure that an adequate period of time is allowed for each applicant during the Hearings, for the one and a half hours which have been allowed for hitherto are not sufficient. We need at least three hours to hold a discussion which is to our complete satisfaction."
"Applause"
"I would also recommend, Professor Prodi, that we, as a Parliament, are given the opportunity to enter into probing discussion with you in the appropriate committee."
"I speak on behalf of my group when I say that the Hearings are conducted on a fair basis and without any form of personal discrimination."
"This means that as far as the individuals are concerned, we treat everyone equally at the Hearings."
"There is no prejudice."
"We are fair and shall also behave accordingly."
"Applause, heckling"
"To close, a remark concerning the role of our institutions."
"Mr President, I support your contention that we the European Parliament and the Commission have equal responsibility for this European Union."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and you used the term 'government' , a term I personally very much approve of, because it implies that this government must also bear parliamentary responsibility and be accountable to Parliament."
"That is why, Mr President of the Commission, I should be grateful if you would provide me with an answer to the following question. You have said that you have asked every Member of what is potentially your new Commission whether they would actually comply with your request in the event that you were to ask them to resign."
"That is why I want to ask you the following: if a Committee of Parliament was not to endorse an individual a majority, if the Committee was to say 'no' , what then would be the question that you would put to your team?"
"Would you then urge the Member to comply with the vote taken by this committee of the European Parliament?"
"I would be pleased to hear you answer this question."
"Applause"
"A final remark: As the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, we know that we have responsibility for Europe and when the Hearings have taken place we will make our own decision, remaining true to our consciences, and I hope it will be a decision that serves the interests of us all."
"Loud applause"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to welcome Mr Prodi and thank him for his speech and also to welcome the candidates for the Commission."
"I think we should remember now that we are having this debate on this side of the Rhine and not on the other side."
"On the other side, there are domestic issues which can very well be resolved in Germany, but this is not the place to bring them up."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I hope we are capable of overcoming this first great crisis which is currently facing us in the European Union."
"According to the opinion polls, the citizens are still in favour of the European Union. However they do not participate in great numbers in the elections."
"We have the responsibility, as elected representatives, for construction rather than destruction."
"This means that we have to respond to the problems which are worrying our fellow citizens: unemployment, Kosovo, consumer problems, the management of the euro."
"This must be done as soon as possible."
"We can neither carry on with a Commission in total ruin, nor delay its investiture until next year."
"How could we explain such a thing?"
"Mr Prodi, you have spoken of the Commission as the government of Europe."
"I will offer you a more sporting simile: a team."
"We are playing here a European league."
"The German, Italian, Spanish and Danish leagues each play against each other in their own countries, but not here."
"Here we have to take the lead as Members of the European Union."
"I therefore believe that there is a basic truth in your talk of this team and this government."
"Your Commission must be invested in a democratic fashion."
"You have begun to take steps."
"You have announced reforms."
"I agree with you that it is impossible to make known the list of Directorates General, and I am grateful that the change is going ahead."
"We cannot subordinate the work which must be done by the Commission - and I say this, Madam President, with all respect for what you have demonstrated this morning - to this report by the Committee of Experts."
"The report of the Committee of Experts is a useful instrument, not a basis for law."
"We must show political judgment and responsibility in order to understand what we can ask of the new Commission and in order to await and support the reform process proposed by President Prodi."
"Applause"
"With regard to such a critical matter as the hearings - which for us are fundamental - we believe that these must be directed at Commissioners regardless of the political persuasion of the particular Commissioner."
"Questions should be asked of the Commissioners - first in writing and then orally - in order to discover whether they are in a position to fulfil their responsibilities and also to identify their political criteria with regard to Europe."
"This is absolutely legitimate, but we must not turn this into a sort of fairground shooting-gallery where we blast away and see how many candidate Commissioners remain standing."
"It seems to me that this would be enormously dangerous and, of course, my group intends to ask questions, responsibly and on our own terms - without waiting for third parties to tell us what to do - and we will ask them in a way which will deliver us, as soon as possible, a Commission which is in a position to carry out its duties."
"Applause"
"Secondly, Mr President Prodi, we have listened attentively to what you have said in relation to the individual responsibility of the Commissioners."
"In politics, responsibilities may be accepted, above all, when they are taken up."
"But I believe that you have touched upon a constitutional matter which is tremendously important and the standards which can and should be adopted by the Parliament, which has already expressed its view on this question, must be taken into account."
"I think this should be discussed with a little more calm."
"With regard to the European Union reform process - which is absolutely necessary, not only in terms of enlargement but also in terms of making the Union more democratic and efficient - Madam President, I believe that we cannot have another Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors."
"It should be done in the way that we carry out reforms in our own States: transparently and on record, in Parliament and before our co-citizens."
"Applause"
"How can we explain that we have the euro - a common currency which is not common to all - but at the same time we are implementing reforms which not even we are able to comprehend or justify."
"In this respect, we believe this to be an absolutely critical matter."
"Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we do not participate in the threats made by some political groups in this Parliament, who want to take the Commission, which presents itself to our scrutiny, hostage."
"We do not believe we should take it hostage."
"Our future is genuinely at stake with this Commission."
"Furthermore, we should remember that if we go along the route of concessions we will never know where we will end up and we must act responsibly."
"For some people, the principal objective is not to achieve institutional equilibrium but to undermine it and destroy it."
"We do not share that opinion; we believe that the European Union, our fellow citizens, deserve better, they deserve a Parliament which acts responsibly and with an approach which looks to the future, with hope and towards the construction of a united Europe."
"Madam President, may I conclude my intervention - if President Prodi will allow me - with a quote in my own language, written by an immortal Italian, by Manzoni, who says in I promessi sposi : 'Adelante, Romano, con juicio ' ( ""Go ahead, Romano, wisely' )."
"Applause"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, President-designate of the Commission and nominee Commissioners, you are very welcome to our Chamber this afternoon and we look forward to our hearings and our various communications over the next few weeks and eventually months and years."
"I want to make a few things clear here at the outset."
"Firstly, the ELDR Group in this House comes here in terms of a European vocation."
"We will not judge Commissioners on the basis of the national preferences of one or other party or group inside this Chamber."
"Applause"
"I wish to say, Madame President, in respect of your helpful suggestion this morning that we should incorporate, as we prepare for the hearings, an understanding of the work and insight of the Committee of Experts that we, as an Institution, must say to the Experts 'speed up what you do and deliver it in time'. If necessary, 'speed up the report' but by no means should we slow down the process of hearings as anticipated."
"Applause"
"My group's essential and fundamental starting point in this debate is very clear."
"The outgoing Commission resigned last March and since I can hardly explain to myself why the rump part of that Commission is still there, how can we expect the citizens of Europe to understand that fact?"
"It is therefore our overwhelming duty in this House to decouple Europe from this institutional embarrassment at the earliest available date and the only means to do that is to take the available Commission - and I do not prejudge how the hearings may go - and do our utmost to make sure that it takes up office at the earliest available date."
"By this means we should begin to decouple ourselves from what has been a very difficult, but useful experience, but one that remains, unfinished as it is, deeply embarrassing and complicated as we have seen recently by the deplorable choices of Dr Martin Bangemann."
"Could I say also in regard to the hearings process which will be in two parts, i.e. written and oral, that we in the Liberal Group will want to know from each of the candidate Commissioners: 'What is the perspective that you will bring to Europe for Europe?'"
"This will be important to us."
"We want to be able to talk to you and engage with you on the question of suitability for the portfolios and to understand the capacities that you bring to this prospect."
"We want to ask you about your willingness, your personal willingness, to accept that you are accountable and responsible to the public of Europe in whatever you do with your President and before this House and in clear and full public understanding that this is the public forum for European democracy to which you are accountable and have a public responsibility."
"I wish to say on behalf of my group that when the IGC comes we will continue to press for Treaty reform on the question of individual accountability."
"We recognise that within the current constraints Professor Prodi is taking some steps to improve the dreadful situation of the past, but we may need Professor Prodi to take some more steps."
"We propose that the hearings should be tough because we have learned from the lessons of the past five years that it is better to be tough at the outset than to regret it later."
"Our hearings also will be fair. There is one point I would ask the Commission President-designate to respond to."
"We have been so busy reconstituting ourselves we have not yet had the capacity to do our homework and our research, so if the hearings bring to light issues of substance and public concern about which we as yet know nothing, we in this House would have a duty to Europe to act and we will act - certainly, my group will."
"If such difficulties present themselves, I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission, Professor Prodi, please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises."
"We need a respectful dialogue between our institutions."
"This Parliament has matured in recent months and we have learned one basic lesson for the years ahead: we are no longer the junior partner in the European political institutions."
"We do not claim the status of 'primus inter pares' but we expect and demand to be treated as an equal among equals in the European institutions."
"Applause"
"Madam President, in September we have the hearings and, as I said, I do not wish to anticipate how they should proceed, but my group's strong preference is that in September - subject always to the reservations that we must see what emerges - we should take a decision and rid ourselves of a sense of crisis."
"If we have to have some difficult debates, for God's sake, let us have them in September and let us have it out in September so that we do not have some form of institutional guerilla warfare right through to December or January."
"Let us do the business early and let us do the business well!"
"A final comment, Madam President; before he had this high office thrust on him some months ago, rather I think to his surprise, Mr Prodi had sought to contest the European elections in Italy."
"He had chosen as the symbol of his party the donkey."
"Well, the donkey has various traits - one of which we know is stubbornness."
"I wish to say to Professor Prodi, if he uses his stubbornness in this Parliament as a reliable partner for Europe, that is the kind of stubbornness we welcome."
"And if he uses his stubbornness to refuse to dialogue with us, if we have difficulties in the hearings, that is a stubbornness we will oppose."
"That is the message of my group today."
"We want to work with you as a reliable partner for Europe now and in the future and that requires respectful dialogue."
"We will give it."
"We believe in a strong Europe, we believe in a strong Commission and we believe we should be natural allies - let us work to that end."
"Applause"
"Mr President of the Commission, I would like to welcome you on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to welcome the promising declarations which you have just made."
"Your team, Mr Prodi, faces a double challenge of which the first, which you have mentioned at length, is the restoration of the trust of the citizens and parliamentarians."
"The institution that you will be presiding over must achieve this trust."
"We can only have trust in an institution if it is run rigorously and transparently."
"I believe that you have the necessary qualities to restore that trust, and I have no reason, at first sight, to believe that the various applicant Commissioners are not also up to the job, whatever their political allegiance."
"I therefore greet your team positively."
"It goes without saying that we are impatiently awaiting the second report of the Wise Men, which is constantly being promised us, and your reaction to its contents, before expressing a definitive opinion."
"But I would like straightaway to deal with the second challenge, which has already been widely discussed."
"In my opinion, this challenge which you are going to have to face is more political and just as fundamental."
"Certain recent events, such as the war in Kosovo and the new crisis in the field of food safety which has occurred in Belgium, but which clearly has repercussions for the whole of Europe, are particularly significant, and I believe that the necessary responses to them - and you have said some interesting things in this respect - must be ambitious responses."
"There are also important deadlines and I think there is one deadline that nobody has mentioned until now and that is the opening of the new negotiations of the World Trade Organisation in Seattle at the end of this year."
"I believe that this is a major problem and when we talk of transparency we find ourselves faced with a significant problem. I do not wish to criticise you though, for ideas which you may not hold."
"I want to mention the relationships, which have sometimes been difficult, between the Commission and the Parliament."
"It has often been said that there is a natural alliance between the Commission and the Parliament."
"In the past, the facts have unfortunately often shown that this alliance is more frequently evoked than realised."
"The rejection by the Commission of the Parliament's position - even when passed with an overwhelming majority - does not show a good attitude and I would like to point out that it is the previous Commission which is responsible for it."
"Likewise, I could speak of the numerous resolutions voted for by the Parliament - with just as big a majority - involving requests for initiatives which have not been responded to or acted upon for years."
"We await from you, Mr President, a change of attitude in this respect."
"Some moments ago, I mentioned the start of the new round of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation, and I would like to dedicate my remaining two minutes of speaking time to this subject."
"The Commission has obtained from the Council the mandate for negotiations proposed by the last Commission - in fact by Mr Leon Brittan."
"This mandate has not been debated by the European Parliament nor by national parliaments."
"There is, however, a fundamental problem which we find totally unacceptable; that is, the broadening of the competencies of the World Trade Organisation without a serious and exacting evaluation of its workings having been carried out."
"Applause"
"In fact the World Trade Organisation, as it currently functions, plays an extremely arguable role in European politics."
"In this respect, I could mention the decisions regarding the issue of bananas and that of hormones in cattle rearing."
"Applause"
"The adoption of concrete measures aimed at respecting multi-national agreements on the environment - in particular on climate and biodiversity - and the implementation of the decisions of the Copenhagen Summit with regard to the fight against poverty, have been put on hold."
"Meanwhile, the Committees of the WTO are imposing their law on democracies - in particular the European Union - and are giving priority to free trade over all other issues, whether they concern public health, the environment, human rights or social rights."
"Applause"
"The precautionary principle, which forms the basis of European legislation relating to the environment, is, if not ignored, then interpreted in a very restrictive manner by that organisation."
"Your Commission, Mr President, must express its view on this subject in a clear and rapid manner, at least before the negotiations start."
"We are ready to open a debate on this subject and I hope that this goes for the other political groups."
"It is even more important that the dioxin affair in Belgium, which will be the subject of heated debates, is clearly connected to the problem of food safety which is itself clearly directly related to the functioning of the World Trade Organisation."
"Transparency, Mr President, must not only be applied to management, including financial and administrative management, but also to political decisions."
"And on this point, it should be noted that there are serious deficiencies."
"We therefore expect ambitious initiatives from you and your team."
"I hope you do not disappoint us and I insist once again that we are prepared to work loyally with you and to listen attentively to the arguments of the nominee Commissioners in the forthcoming hearings."
"Applause"
"Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group is set to assess the Commission on the basis of the tasks before us, the hearings and the presentation of the whole programme announced for September."
"We will carry out this assessment with great care and, naturally, try to be constructive."
"The President of the Commission has pointed out the need for a clear rapport between the composition of the Commission itself and its programme."
"We will assess the proposed choice on the basis of this rapport."
"At the moment, the composition appears to us to be rather neocentralist, and the representation of women still inadequate, but in any case, it is a question of assessing the overall success of the operations as they happen."
"The decisive factor will essentially be the relationship between the Commission and its programme, and we are preparing for this comparison with great enthusiasm."
"The President of the Commission has touched on some of the issues such as public health, doping in the sporting world and air traffic, to give a token semblance of adherence to the programme, but his attention seems rather to me to be focused on two other issues: the reconstruction of Kosovo and the Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki."
"I would like to comment on these two issues."
"Firstly, with regard to Kosovo, it is right to be thinking of reconstruction and reconciliation and treating the Balkans as a region with a special relationship with Europe."
"However, it is also essential to be aware, in addition to the damage in the Balkans, of the devastation wreaked by the war both on international order, with international legislation ripped to shreds and on the UN, which has been razed to the ground, and to bear in mind the substantial loss of autonomy for Europe with regard to the Atlantic Alliance and the United States of America."
"Now, of course we must reconstruct the Balkans, but in order to do so, Europe needs to regain its autonomy and authority, which requires democratic construction as well."
"President Prodi is giving thought to the Intergovernmental Conference, but he seems not to be giving enough heed to the fact that the critical state of the institutions and the citizens' lack of confidence in them is neither politically nor socially neutral."
"Although it is exacerbated by the confidence crisis produced by the défaillance of the Commission, this Parliament does have a democratic deficit. It is far removed from the everyday problems of the people of Europe."
"The only Governmental body seems to be the Central European Bank, and that has less control than the United States' Central Bank."
"However, we await what will be said in the hearings with great interest and especially in the September programme."
"We would like you to know, Mr President, that our attitude will nevertheless depend on the correction we request from you regarding the content of your previous speeches, which displayed a change of direction which we did not appreciate."
"It is not for me to remind you that there are twenty million unemployed in Europe at the moment - and unemployment is a problem which undermines Europe's social cohesion - and that the achievements of this Europe in areas such as the welfare state are being undermined by neo-free trade policies, which are those same neo-free trade policies in which you exalted the need for flexibility in previous speeches and which, however, brought a reduction in the quality of work and life, in contrast to your proposals for the future."
"We suggest that you reflect on the need for a change of direction."
"Even this debate seems to point to two testing grounds: one concerns the relationship between Europe and the world, and the other concerns European construction and the individual situations in the different countries."
"The negotiations on the WTO and world trade will be the testing ground for Europe, to see whether it will be able to temper the first principle of the free trading of goods, which dominates today, with the need to protect working conditions throughout the world, environmental conditions and the health of the world's populations and Europeans in particular."
"The other testing ground is that of Europe."
"Here we have a Stability Pact which is making it increasingly difficult to respond to the problems of unemployment."
"Even the costs of the war are by now placing strain upon the Stability Pact, which was already being challenged by a growth rate so slow as to be completely inadequate for the problems of Europe. Here you are right, Mr President."
"There is a need for flexibility, not in the labour market, but regarding the Stability Pact. Maybe it should be suspended, but in any case, growth investments need to be considered outside of this context and a qualified enlargement policy put forward."
"Without these, there will be no possibility of either making good the democratic deficit or reducing the lack of confidence of the people of Europe in their current institutions."
"It is in this spirit that we are preparing for a constructive debate on the work that awaits you."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission Romano Prodi, I have just heard your intervention, and I must say that I am none the wiser: politically speaking, nobody knows for sure where you stand."
"To some, you appear to be a Socialist, others would call you a Christian-Democrat and the latest news paints you as a Liberal."
"The Italian view is that you are sustaining a left-wing government; the view in Europe is that you are associating yourself with political groupings to the centre and to the right."
"This ambiguity does nothing to bring clarity and credibility into the political debate in Europe."
"In any case, Professor Prodi is a Southerner and from a Portuguese point of view, this is something in his favour."
"I hope therefore that he will understand my questions, which are frank, direct and of a practical nature."
"They will probably be of no interest to the federalist parties of this House, but they will certainly interest the citizens who voted for me; that is, the workers."
"Mr President, the Commission's attitude towards Portuguese farming has been one of real persecution."
"I will deal with the Portuguese government's inability to protect us when I am in Portugal, but it is my duty to deal here with the profound injustice of the Commission's decisions."
"The first proof of this is mad cow disease."
"The Commission has just extended the embargo on Portugal by another six months. At the same time, it has partially lifted the embargo on the United Kingdom."
"Just think about the scientific dishonesty in their decision. Portugal has fewer than two hundred cases per thousand animals whereas the United Kingdom has more than six hundred cases per thousand animals."
"Since the first outbreak of the disease, there have been no more than five hundred cases in total in Portugal. In the United Kingdom, more than one hundred and seventy thousand cases have occurred."
"Given these facts, the Commission is punishing Portugal and is seriously threatening the livelihood of one hundred thousand farmers across the country."
"There is an even more serious side to this!"
"The Commission's decisions have been nothing but political wheeling and dealing between big States and have no basis in any kind of scientific logic."
"This is how mad cow disease in a Europe without borders mysteriously disappears at the border with Spain."
"It is pathetic, Mr President Prodi."
"The second proof of our persecution is the crisis in pig-farming."
"We all know about it, because it hit pig-breeders hard in several European countries, and drove them to ruin."
"My country's government set up a programme of national assistance, as did others."
"To our surprise, and probably in order to take revenge for some other matter, the Commission is now saying that this assistance is illegal, and goes even further by saying that pig-breeders are running the risk of having to repay the sums and pay interest on them, which means that those in real difficulty are going to end up bankrupt."
"In one word, Mr President Prodi, it is pathetic."
"If I am directing these remarks to you, it is because you decided to keep Commissioner Fischler in the agricultural domain."
"My question is very simple. Are you prepared to look into the matter of why Commissioner Fischler acts systematically against the interests of the Portuguese state?"
"You see, Mr President, to my mind, the Commission is not a government, and here we have a difference of opinion: a government is what each of us has in his own State."
"Above all Mr President, I will only accept a Commission made up of impartial scientists, not of biased bureaucrats."
"I will only accept a Commission which treats big States, medium-sized States and small States equally."
"Mr President Prodi, we have listened to you attentively and we are concerned."
"On 13 April last, you stated your desire for reform aimed at greater efficiency, absolute transparency and full responsibility."
"Since then you have frequently restated your laudable intentions in this respect."
"But what exactly does this reform consist of?"
"Where is this promised revolution when you are bringing back those same commissioners who were forced to resign following the damning report of the Committee of Independent Experts?"
"The ultimate mystery is why you entrust administrative reform, which must be based on the said report, to one of the four returning Commissioners."
"Not all of the new Commissioners seem to us to have the necessary credibility to satisfy this desire for reform."
"Our group will therefore be particularly attentive during the coming hearings, and as far as we are concerned there is no question of Parliament being content to be a mere registration chamber."
"This disastrous management of the Commission must come to an end."
"It must never happen again, otherwise it will be the citizens who, justifiably, turn their backs on Europe."
"The high level of abstention in the recent European Elections is a genuine cry of alarm. It is a sign of a profound crisis of confidence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are open to dialogue and debate, but can only pass judgment on actions rather than fine speeches."
"Firstly, we need to know what spirit the Commissioners are going to be working in and what approach they intend to take with regard to working with all Members of this Parliament, regardless of whether they belong to a small group or large group."
"Last January, Jacques Santer asked for the political trust of this Parliament, under threat of a vote of no confidence, stating that we should stop looking to the past."
"Today, you are asking almost the same thing."
"How much confidence can we show in you?"
"At best, we can give you the benefit of the doubt."
"If your changes only consist of technical improvements, while preserving the same culture, they will not be acceptable to us."
"We expect Commissioners to open dialogue with the elected representatives in the European Parliament as early as possible before decisions are taken, but above all we expect them to respect the principles of transparency and subsidiarity as well as our democracies and traditions."
"In that way you will provide us with the means to work with you effectively and we will all gain from our differences."
"Applause"
"Madam President, President of the Commission, in January this year, Parliament adopted Mr Brok's report recommending that the majority of the new Commissioners be Members of the European Parliament, people with experience in the European institutions. It requested sufficiently equal numbers of men and women representatives and an adequate balance of political trends."
"I leave it to you and to this Parliament to assess to what extent you have complied, or been able to comply with this Parliamentary resolution."
"Mr President, you went so far as to announce an era of change, a revolution - in which I wish you every success - and mentioned an internal restructuring which maybe Mr Kinnock will elaborate upon; the fifth, I may add, in seven years!"
"I assure you, however, that it will not be a change in the number of Directorates-General, the fact they are called by name instead of by number, the fact that the homes of the Commissioners are scattered all over Brussels or that the use of a spokesman is consolidated which will bring the institutions closer to the great European public, the objective you referred to."
"What is currently lacking in Europe and our institutions is a fresh vision of the Europe of the beginning of the next millennium."
"Today, we live in a situation which is post Berlin wall, post Kohl, post Mitterand, post single currency, post initiation of enlargement, and pre-hardly anything."
"This is the vision, the challenge. For us radicals, the Federalist compass of Altiero Spinelli will remain an appreciation gauge, a very clear compass, which will show us whether our institutions are moving towards the consolidation of the Union, towards a more European Europe and towards political union."
"This, I believe, is the challenge which must unite us in the diversity of our roles, in the knowledge that those who have brought us thus far, Mr President, present and past colleagues, may deserve greater respect and perhaps even a little more generosity of spirit."
"Applause from the left"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, President Prodi, the representatives of the Alleanza Nazionale have taken note of your declared intention to renew and revolutionise the Commission."
"We will, of course, see whether your deeds measure up to your words and we will be keeping a check on concrete achievements, but I would like to say that right from the word go that we will base our assessments purely on facts, disregarding our respective positions in national politics."
"I know that we are politically opposed in our own country, but we are nevertheless united in our desire to build a Europe in which the peoples of the old continent are increasingly ready to place their trust."
"We appreciate your unequivocal statement regarding the urgent need to restore the faith of the citizens of Europe in the Commission."
"Their faith has been damaged, as we have seen from the fact that the number of voters at the European Parliament elections is ever-decreasing."
"It has been damaged, to our way of thinking, not only by the events which caused the resignation of the last Commission but also, and I would say above all, because of the fact that too often the citizens of Europe see the Commission as a source of bureaucratic obligations which are sometimes costly, sometimes neither indispensable nor urgent, sometimes stupid and even dangerous."
"These obligations seem to have nothing to do with the process of building a united Europe and, unfortunately, in many circumstances, undermine European ideals."
"Faith will be regained, therefore, when there is greater transparency, but especially when greater consideration is given to national and cultural differences when Directives are issued and there is greater and more frequent recourse to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Greater attention on the part of the Commission to the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe will also be essential."
"We were particularly pleased to hear you express the intention to concentrate more on both workers' rights and the right to health, including the quality of food products. The damage caused by incidents such as dioxin in poultry or mad cow disease to the overall credibility of the Community institutions is huge and cannot be repaired by words."
"Unfortunately, these situations often take a great deal of time to remedy, and time is not always available in the institutions."
"In conclusion, I believe that in circumstances such as these it is essential not only to adhere to the facts, but to do so without bringing the dynamics of national controversies into this House. Above all, there must be a closer relationship between the institution of which you are President and the Parliament."
"This attitude must be mutual, and I hope that one effect will be to inspire the Commission of which you are President with greater respect for the work of Parliament, and therefore to greater diligence and to produce a higher quality of responses to questions than that of the recent past."
"Applause"
"Mr President-elect of the Commission, I would first like to reiterate the sense of esteem, respect and personal trust which some of us expressed when we voted for your investiture."
"We are still faithful to this fundamental choice and we would like to let you know that, in your difficult task, you will always find us to be speakers who are sometimes demanding but always anxious to help you and not to hinder you."
"I have found grounds for reassurance, if that be needed, in the fundamental approach which you have laid out, particularly - if you do not mind me saying so - with regard to institutional matters and I therefore have confidence in the action you intend to take and the approach you have indicated for the Commission."
"I would like to take advantage of this brief intervention to attempt to clear up a kind of misunderstanding."
"I do not want you to think, neither you nor your potential, possible or future colleagues - who can say - that concerns about you are dictated by national or partisan considerations."
"Let us not speak of national considerations."
"As for partisan considerations, it is clear that your Commission must represent the great political forces of the European Union, and on a Parliamentary level we must continue to work with all the large groups - and that does not mean just two groups - according to a policy of co-operation necessary for the success of our legislative work."
"What we are defending here - and what concerns us - are the rights of Parliament in relation to the European Council."
"We hope that the Commission that you embody is fully representative of that difficult balance between the European Council and the European Parliament."
"In conclusion, and I will finish here Mr President, we do not want to be, as if in a new version of Plato's myth, the shadows in a cave where the true life is the European Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Prodi, we expect from you not only fresh political determination in the Commission which you will be leading, but also a strong commitment to initiating a great period of reform and change in Europe."
"This is why we, on the Left, view your programme with confidence."
"We are not here to preserve, we are here to reform: we are here to reform European institutions and European politics and economics, because we want the Institutions to become ever closer to the people, even to those of the electorate who did not believe in our mission in the recent elections; we want a political climate which is capable of resolving issues and providing government, and an economy which is geared to building foundations for cohabitation which are fair, compatible, and mutually agreed on."
"From this point of view, the project for institutional innovation of which you have spoken may, I believe, be the subject of dialogue, as Mr Bourlanges just said, between the different forces within this Parliament."
"The goal we must set ourselves is a process which will take us to greater and more marked political, economic and social cohesion."
"This is the direction in which we must move."
"I am sure that you and your team - and I would like to draw attention to the balance achieved in your team - are starting off in the most favourable conditions for the successful completion of this operation."
"You have been appointed President of the European Commission because of the ability you displayed in governing Italy wisely and competently, because of your professional experience, which is internationally acknowledged, and because you represent a trustworthy, powerful response to the crisis which afflicted the previous Commission."
"May I recall with pride the years President Prodi and I worked together in our national government, the difficult challenges we faced and those in which we succeeded, including that most difficult challenge for Italy - the euro."
"Today, you are at Europe's helm: you face another challenge, another wager which will be taken up by the Commission as it looks to the interests of all Member States."
"Today, Europe needs hope and confidence in herself and her qualities."
"We have only just emerged from a painful conflict which forced the international community to intervene to defend the right to exist of a people excluded from their own territory; the Kosovo crisis."
"We entered this conflict thanks purely to Milosevic; we came out of it thanks to European cohesion, solidarity between allies and a new political climate between Europe, the USA and Russia."
"We are asking ourselves, what could Europe become today with a stronger and more determined political profile?"
"We must do all that we can, and become all that we can as Europeans, taking Kosovo as a starting point, with the obligations which fall to us to set reconstruction in motion, to bring to life a policy of peace and stability for the whole of the Balkans and to bring about a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which is democratic and multi-ethnic."
"For us, therefore, to be Europeans means in this case to support all those forces which are fighting in Serbia at this time for a pluralist and democratic system."
"We expect a great deal from you. We expect a great deal from this new European Commission, from the Council and from this new Parliament which is anxious to hear the position of the Commissioners."
"In particular, much is expected by Europe's young people, who are waiting for concrete results regarding the fight against unemployment."
"Therefore, above all, we must focus our attention on the excessive burden of unemployment which is weighing heavily on our territories and on the whole of Europe."
"Young people, in particular, are expecting, as are we ourselves, a major new policy from the Commission for training, research, culture and the environment, and then also for economic growth and freedom - freedom from bureaucracy and petty regulations."
"This freeing-up of society, together with the capacity to guarantee rights, which the authorities must be able to express, can indeed create that society of equal opportunities which is the motive for our political commitment."
"We are at a delicate stage: practically all Member States are going to have to face national reform of the welfare state."
"The social state is coming into being in Europe, driven by the organised movement of workers, to help those who are weakest and most vulnerable."
"The task before us today is to build a new welfare state; one which will provide opportunities, which will help those who are weakest once again, but which, at the same time, will be capable of mobilising both human and material resources to promote growth, development and long-term training."
"In other words, this task will be able to regenerate hope and trust in Europe and in its own resources: a Europe of opportunities, as Jacques Delors would say, a Europe of growth and development, a Europe of peace and stability, not a closed fortress but an area of openness which is able to benefit growth and development in other parts of the world as well."
"This is the Europe we want, and we are fully confident that with you and your Commission, President Prodi, we will be able to achieve it."
"Applause"
"Madam President, Mr President-elect, I represent the EDD Group, a small group in this Parliament, but extremely democratic."
"I share the platform this afternoon with my French colleague and I share his concerns for the future role of this Parliament."
"Parliament, at the moment, does not appear to be very democratic."
"It appears also that Members of Parliament are not very concerned as the auditorium is now half empty."
"To get a democratic structure we have to change over the years so that Parliament is not the servant of the Commission but the Commission is the servant of the elected representatives of the electorate of Europe."
"Until that happens there will be extremely low turn-outs at all future European elections."
"It would be better if the future of Europe was entrusted to elected representatives who can be dismissed from office at elections and not to nominated bureaucrats in the form of Commissioners."
"Turning to Mr Prodi, I believe that half this Parliament at least is disenfranchised because he was endorsed by the previous Parliament and just over 50 % of us were not in that Parliament."
"I would seriously suggest that he should put himself up again for reselection with his other Commissioners in September."
"Applause"
"In the long-term, I am convinced that, while the cart is in front of the horse - and that is the Commission exercising greater policy-making influence than the elected Members of this Parliament - throughout Europe people will remain apathetic toward this institution."
"In the United Kingdom, we already have a very Euro-sceptic electorate."
"We probably are the most Euro-sceptic according to a survey conducted on behalf of the European Union published two weeks ago."
"If Mr Prodi and his colleagues wish to remedy Euro-scepticism and Euro-apathy, I am calling for true democracy and for the elected representatives to have much more authority over the programme and policies of this institution."
"Mr President, as a Member of the Italian national Parliament for the Lega Nord per l'indipendenza della Padania (The Northern League for the Independence of Padania), I did not vote for Professor Prodi in Rome as I considered he would be completely useless as head of government."
"I was then proved right as he lost the vote of confidence of the Italian Parliament. Reckoning also that a Roman idiot would still be that stupid wherever he was, which, incidently, is reflected in the symbol on the list which bears his name for the election of this Parliament, I cannot for consistency's sake express my faith in the President of the Commission."
"As a native of the Po valley who is Italian only by passport, I am fortunately immune from the national Christian Democrat type of opportunism which brings Berlusconi together with Mastella and De Mita and sees in Prodi not the impartial President of the Commissioners uninfluenced by the States, but the lavish dispenser of favours to a wide and varied assortment of Southern Italian profiteers."
"Although I hold some of the Commissioners in high esteem, I recall the old mafioso Neapolitan saying: 'A fish rots from the head downwards' and I therefore have to express my negative opinion of the Prodi Presidency."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Prodi on his presentation here in the Parliament and to concentrate on two issues which he mentioned."
"Firstly, the situation in Kosovo."
"I appreciate, as does Mr Prodi and as do we all, that the rebuilding of Kosovo is a very important matter."
"However, it is an issue which goes beyond quantitative criteria. Rebuilding is not just about construction."
"It is of much greater significance, involving the regeneration of the societies which existed there before the catastrophe."
"I want to believe, therefore, that the new Commission will put in place procedures to incorporate basic political, social and, of course, economic factors into the reconstruction programme."
"On those grounds, the question of where to locate the seat of those organisations involved in the rebuilding programme is a very important one and I would like to believe that Thessaloniki will remain the choice to serve as the main decision-making centre for the whole reconstruction project."
"The second issue I would like to consider is the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is a matter of great importance, so much so that, at the last Intergovernmental Conference, we examined and reached decisions on many issues which were simply brushed aside when it came to the actual signing."
"It is not advisable, in my view, to start off with sweeping statements and far-ranging plans at this stage."
"It is, however, imperative before we begin work on specific plans for specific sectors, to clarify once again what exactly we want, where we want to go and just how far we can go."
"Finally, I should like to express my delight in what Mr Prodi expressed regarding relations between the Parliament and the new Commission."
"It is clear that better progress in the advancement of the European ideal can be made when the institutions are on an equal footing and when the Commission and the European Parliament work in harmony."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would first of all like to remind Parliament that we generally judge a tree by the fruit that it produces."
"The tree that you have described to us has strong and healthy branches which appear to us to be a good omen for the future of Europe."
"Certain people have obviously expressed - is this not the case, Mr Cox? - a degree of regret at seeing former Commissioners present in your Commission, but this perhaps proves that Mr Cox, driven by a desire for polemic, had not properly read the report of the Experts which fully exonerated those Commissioners."
"Of course, some people, such as Mr Poettering, have been carried away, and we are not surprised, by partisan spirit, to the point of turning this Parliament into an annex of the Bundestag, but a 'stage left' annex, of course."
"Our attitude in the Socialist Group is clearly extremely different."
"We are going to take care of your Commission and to those who doubt your independence, Mr President, because you will have too many socialist Commissioners, I will reply by saying that, while you have been nominated by a majority of socialist and social democratic governments, it is the Socialist Group which has been most surprised by your first public statements."
"This will be a good demonstration from the outset of your desire for independence and your desire to see to it that the Commission is what the Treaty wants it to be; that is, a Commission beyond countries, beyond national sentiments and also beyond the ideological preferences that we hold here within this Parliament."
"Of course, we have raised the spectre of the hearings."
"Certain people, no doubt through historical atavism, would like to turn them into an inquisition process."
"As for us, we would like to take the hearings for what they are, that is, as an opportunity to listen to the Commissioners, to question them, to ask them questions so that we might better understand their objective and above all to find out to what extent their expertise, competence and motivation are appropriate to their positions."
"It is on these bases that we will come to a certain number of conclusions, but it is not our job to treat you as if we were the judges at the final judgment."
"What is important for the Commission, apart from the hearings which your team will doubtlessly pass successfully, is to see what you are going to do, in other words the works which you are going to undertake."
"You have mentioned some of them today."
"From the outset, I would like to take up that of reforming the Commission."
"You have rightfully stressed the fact that the Commission must modernise its structures, its spirit and its working methods and I believe you have been given the means to effectively carry out that reform."
"I would, however, urge that, by acting in that way, the baby is not thrown out with the bath water, and that it is well understood that one of the causes of failure on the part of the previous Commission has sometimes been the loss of the notion of public service."
"It is important that the Commission is offered the means to take on, with its new structure, its officials, whose spirit will no doubt have changed, is offered the means to take on its tasks and that it shows no hesitation in saying to the Parliament or the Council, 'you ask us to achieve these objectives, we ask you for the means' ."
"Otherwise the fear is that you will re-live the difficulties of your predecessor."
"Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I must confess that, of the decisions taken during the Summits of the German Presidency, the idea of establishing an Intergovernmental Conference has both pleased us and worried us."
"We are pleased by the desire for reform; we are worried by the fact that we are returning to an old method."
"I was therefore very happy to hear you say that now you are going to return to what I would call the Delors method, which stimulated the 1985 Intergovernmental Conference in Luxembourg, leading to that wonderful reform of the Single Market."
"Finally, since I am running out of time, I would simply like to make an appeal by saying that the Commission is not only an executor for the decisions of the Council and the European Parliament, and that we have now perhaps lost the taste for the discreet charm of standards for lift springs and we would prefer more initiatives from the Commission in the area of social problems."
"In that way you will truly be the European government that we all hope and pray for and which deserves our trust."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Professor Prodi, you are presenting us with your ideas of a political 'dream team' ."
"Our fair yet strict interrogations in the Parliament will be the test of competence which each part of your team must be able to pass."
"However, when seen in context, Europe's Heads of State and Government have made things unnecessarily difficult for you at the outset."
"This is a proposal which has an unnecessary bias."
"I share the agitation of my German friends, while I would also like to state that in the three countries of Northern Europe approximately one third of the votes go to the Social Democrats."
"Today, however, we have a proposal for a Commission comprising 100 percent Social Democrat candidates."
"The lack of balance may result in tensions which risk giving your team less leeway if things go wrong."
"Professor Prodi, the trust of the PPE Group in you is based on the civic spirit and the political orientation you have expressed: a policy of renewal for Europe, the ability to compete, liberalisation and free trade, co-operation and peace, an open and trustworthy administration and an EU which devotes itself to matters of common relevance in order to gain the trust of the citizens of the EU during the next century."
"You wish to create a 'dream team' Good luck!"
"I believe you will need it, but most of all Europe will need it."
"The challenges and possibilities for us all are great."
"I wish you luck and welcome you to this Parliament."
"The coming weeks of questions by the committees promise to be interesting."
"These will be fair but, as has been said before, tough."
"President Prodi, this is your third meeting with this Parliament, a Parliament which is greatly changed but which has an institutional continuity which we must all respect."
"We know the areas in which you intend the Commission to work, and today you have completed and spoken in greater detail of your intentions for the reform of the Institution, and you are aware of the orientation and also of the political concerns of the European Parliament."
"I will make three very brief points."
"The first is that we agree with your objective of accelerating economic union by means of a political Europe."
"This objective requires close collaboration between the Commission and Parliament, whose composition democratically represents the citizens of Europe and must therefore contribute fundamentally to the reform of European Institutions."
"This is where we must search for that European soul which is essential for the future of the continent."
"But although we need first of all to reestablish trust between the Institutions and the people of Europe, we consider that it will be necessary to establish a relationship of close, loyal collaboration between the European Institutions, and therefore between Parliament and the Commission."
"The second point concerns the objections and the debate which we will resume in September."
"I think that the primary reason for the objections is to verify the compatibility between the selections that you have made in putting together the team which you introduced to us today, and the general themes which you have presented to this Parliament."
"We fully support a strategy which is motivated by the conviction that it is essential to respect the Stability Pact, and we are in agreement with the idea that today the fundamental issue is to make Europe into a more competitive unit, in order that it can resume the path of development, and also in order to combat unemployment."
"However, we also consider it necessary to emphasise the opportunity to highlight the reasons why there has been recent talk of an Employment Pact as well, and the need to devote great attention to the regional imbalances which still exist in Europe."
"Without a European strategy from this point of view, we will run the risk that an economy such as ours will tend to concentrate its resources on the strongest areas and leave the weakest by the wayside, even though some of these have recently shown signs of great progress."
"The third and last thought refers to President Martens' address on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party in this Parliament during the debate on political agendas."
"He expressed strong support for your candidacy, and I invite him to deal with a few issues which are holding back the activity of the Commission."
"I believe, however, that notwithstanding the peculiarity of the constitutional nature of relations between the Commission and the Parliament, the concerns voiced regarding the political balance which exists in this Parliament but which is not reflected in the Commission are well founded."
"We hope that the hearings will help us to resolve this point as well."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-elect of the Commission, rarely has the formation of a new Commission been accompanied by such high hopes and expectations as has this one."
"The distrust between citizens and Commission, clearly caused by the inappropriate behaviour of individual Commissioners, is deeply entrenched."
"However, your appointment to the post of President-elect of the Commission, Professor Prodi, and the appointment of your team, which has now taken place, give cause for great hope."
"You are the first President of the Commission who will be able to transfer a Commissioner's individual area of responsibility if he or she behaves inappropriately, and to dismiss the person concerned."
"This is a major step in the process of rebuilding trust."
"Even if the Commission does not reflect the majorities gained in the European elections, the reappointment of reliable Commissioners gives cause for satisfaction."
"The restructuring of areas of competence should also open up the way for greater efficiency and transparency."
"We will, though, in the interests of our citizens, be looking at each individual Commissioner extremely thoroughly."
"This will be a hearing though and not an interrogation."
"We need credible representatives for it to be a strong Commission."
"This is why we urgently need the relevant information though."
"It is necessary that the findings of the Committee of the Wise Men's second report be distributed suitably in advance of the hearings."
"Otherwise, the seeds of a new crisis between Parliament and the Commission will have been sown."
"Any delay in the appointment of the Commission would not be in the interests of our citizens either."
"In view of the great tasks ahead, whether it is enlargement, the Intergovernmental Conference or reconstruction in Kosovo, the European Union must be able to act at all levels as soon as possible."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate, which has been in-depth, clear and in many cases, extremely comprehensive and which has mostly demonstrated open confidence in our future work."
"I say open confidence because all those who spoke, even those who criticised the composition of the Commission, acknowledged the need to work closely together in a major, intense undertaking and recognised the fact that the future of the European Union lies in collaboration between the Parliament and the Commission."
"It is we and our collaboration which will form the basis for the way out of the current crisis, a crisis so serious as to reduce the number of voters who turned out at the last elections to among the lowest proportions in European political history."
"I believe that, at the end of this mandate, one gauge of our success will be the numbers who vote in the next elections. That will show whether we have managed to restore the faith of the citizens of Europe in the Institutions for which we are responsible."
"This means transparency, a whole cleaning up operation which will not be easy to conduct. It is easy to promise - and I have committed myself fully on this matter - but I also know very well that it is not an easy promise to keep."
"A little while ago the electoral symbol for my candidacy - a little donkey - was invoked with charming irony, and I was invited to be stubborn, an invitation which was unnecessary as I am pig-headed by nature."
"However, I would like remind you that I was prompted to choose the donkey while reading a passage from Leonardo da Vinci, in which, while he is describing the donkey - although I cannot vouch for the truth of the statement for lack of proof - he said that the donkey is a strange animal because rather than drink dirty water it will die of thirst."
"Applause"
"It is important for us to take the donkey as the symbol of our politics because, in this five-year term, we must try to do likewise."
"I am perfectly aware that it is easy to make these resolutions but that it is not so easy to keep them, but the method we used to build the Commission, Mr Poettering, was a very open one."
"There was no night of long knives, no investiture struggle and no border fighting."
"It was not an easy task to bring together fifteen countries, north and south, and diverse political situations."
"As for the result, when I say 'balanced' we know full well that there is discontent in some countries, but that is politics: balanced means that the major forces present in the European Parliament are very well represented in terms of personality and portfolio size in the Commission."
"You can analyse the composition of the Commission in as much detail as you like."
"I repeat, within the bounds of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I have taken full advantage of all the power conferred on me, and I believe that one improvement at the end of this mandate may be more advanced ways of forming the Commission."
"Nevertheless, please consider the progress made with regard to other areas."
"Please consider the fact that we have arrived here with a Commission which will work hard - well or not so well, we will see - whatever the case, which is able to agree on common programmes and the Members of which are ready to face their responsibilities, individually and collectively."
"I reiterate this point because there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the manner in which we will conduct the audiences, hearings and inquiries."
"I attach very great importance to this aspect of things, as I attach very great importance to the Wise Men's report, but I also believe that these inquiries must be made into the history of the Commissioners and their programmes, and must be carried out in great depth and with political serenity as, in my opinion, they cannot be the tool to regulate problems which occurred in the past."
"Having said this, I believe that they must be explored in more depth and that there must be hearings which go right to the bottom of the Commission's problems, because, and I am right to do so, I have taken on board the warning that prevention is preferable to the Commission being subsequently thrown into crisis."
"Earlier today, in my address, I said that I have asked all the Commissioners to give me their word of honour that they would resign should any new event take place or should there be any hidden fact."
"I believe that this tool will not be used lightly, but with the sense, however, that the problem in question involves not only individual responsibility but also the efficiency and responsibility of the entire Commission team which must present itself to you as capable of governing for the next five years."
"Clearly, we have to present ourselves as individuals, but we must also present ourselves as an organically composed group, not as distinct individuals which are separate from each other."
"This has been the endeavour of the past few months and this is the type of Commission which has been introduced to you."
"Please assess it in this way. Therefore, I consider that the vote on 15 September will be enormously important."
"I believe that you have the right to reject the entire Commission and consider it inadequate for the great task of leading Europe in the next five year period and making its contribution to the great task before us."
"Well then, I invite you to perform this task according to the vision of European common interest, and not in a context, although absolutely legitimate in politics, of individual interest."
"I will conclude by returning to a couple of points which have been recalled and raised today."
"Firstly, the Wise Men's report."
"I believe that it is very important for us to have read the first of these carefully and to have measured against it many of the thoughts which I have expounded to the Parliament on the three occasions in which I have come here."
"This report does exert an influence, but we have to understand that the political responsibility of the future is our own."
"The Wise Men's report is a wonderful instrument, and we must read it and reflect upon it, but the decision is ours alone to make and its consequences ours to bear, and it is in this sense that the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission takes on a completely different dimension."
"Secondly, several speakers have invoked the question of international trade, which I did not bring up because it will be discussed in September."
"I can assure you that it will be very important to maintain a balance between the need for free trade, which is one of the foundation stones of Europe, and the protection of important rights, including the fundamental health rights."
"This is the reason why I have highlighted the example of health with regard to food and medicine as one of the benchmarks for the our future Commission."
"This is the path we have to follow. As Mr Barón Crespo said, quoting Manzoni: 'Adelante ' but 'con juicio ' , 'Go on, carefully' ."
"The quotation is not complete, however, because there is another sentence."
"In fact, Manzoni says: 'Adelante, Pedro, si puedes ' , that is 'Go on, Pedro, if you can' , and this power to move forward is in your hands."
"Applause"
"Mr Prodi, you have just portrayed very colourfully, how the little donkey would rather go thirsty than drink dirty water."
"I ask you now though, if you can assure us that the little donkey would also say no to watered-down wine."
"This is the aim of the proposed Commission and this is the reason why we have made health a priority, to be consistent."
"In this case, to protect humans rather than donkeys."
"Applause"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the agenda now provides for time for a further ballot for the Quaestors, which we do not need because we voted electronically."
"I therefore declare the sitting adjourned until 5.30 p.m."
"The sitting was adjourned at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m."
"Programme of the Finnish Presidency"
"The next item on the agenda is the declaration of the President-in-Office of the Council concerning the programme of activities of the Finnish Presidency, economic and social reconstruction in Kosovo as well as the draft Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and the death sentence passed on Mr Öçalan."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate all the newly elected members of the European Parliament."
"In addition, I would like to congratulate you once more, Madam President, on being elected."
"I am glad to have the opportunity to start working together with you."
"In response to the wishes of Parliament, shall now outline the main points of the programme that has been drawn up in respect of the Finnish presidential term."
"As requested by yourselves, I shall deal in particular with the situation in the Western Balkans and the death sentence passed on the Kurdish leader Öçalan."
"Firstly, however, a few words on developments in the Union in general."
"The Commission's President-elect, Romano Prodi, drew attention in his speech to the fact that the institutions of the European Union have failed to keep up with the changes that are going on in the world around us."
"I completely agree with him."
"Not just the Commission, but the whole European Union, must undergo reform."
"It is not a matter of a one-off dramatic upheaval nor does this concern just one institution in particular, but of an on-going, unremitting process."
"We have to remember that its ability to grow, enlarge and face up to ever newer challenges has made the Union both unique and long-lasting."
"Today, as we embark on our work together, we have the chance to make a clean sweep of matters, in a manner of speaking."
"The new Parliament has now started and the appointment of the new Commission is under way."
"We Finns now hold the Presidency of the Council for the first time."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam, which recently came into force, will provide us with a good basis for developing closer co-operation than has existed before between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"We now have a splendid opportunity to reform old ways of working."
"For my own part, I would like to emphasise the fact that the work of the Council also has to be advanced."
"It is a paradox that, as the Union's importance grows, co-operation among its governments in the Council is being threatened as powers are fragmented and compartmentalised."
"The Council, like the Union as a whole, has to focus on the essential."
"The Council is expected to provide political leadership to give real added value to the lives of our citizens."
"During its Presidency, Finland intends to embark on new projects to improve the work of the Council."
"We will attempt to make the work of the Council significantly more transparent and efficient; we consider greater transparency to be a vital precondition of the public's approval of the Union as a whole."
"We would also like the General Affairs Council to assume a relevant role in managing the work of the Council."
"We must do all we can to ensure the Union is one, and is regarded as such: the Union must have a common will, a common policy and a common voice."
"President-elect Prodi said the key words in the work of the new Commission will be transparency, accountability and efficiency."
"I am very happy to see that the new Commission's policy corresponds word for word with the key aims of the Finnish Presidency."
"The Finnish Presidency begins at a time when there is exceptional pressure on the Union's ability to function in external affairs."
"The war that has raged in the Western Balkans has caused an inconceivable amount of human suffering and damage to property."
"The European Union must be ready both politically and financially to invest in developing the Western Balkan region, so that democracy and stability can take root there."
"During the Finnish presidential term, we will be paying special attention to how efficiently and consistently the Union functions in external matters."
"Dealing with the situation in Kosovo now that the crisis is over, and ensuring the stability of the Western Balkans, will be, for us, the most crucial acid test."
"On Monday, the European Union's General Affairs Council stressed that the Union furthermore intends to help the Serbian people, who are suffering from the disastrous policies their leaders have pursued."
"When we finally start to put an end to the sanctions we imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia we will realise that the government in Belgrade and the Yugoslavian people are two different things."
"Applause"
"The Yugoslav government must implement Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council, work in co-operation with the International Court of Justice, and progress towards establishing democracy."
"We agreed on Monday that first we would remove the sanctions that were imposed on the people, such as the flight ban and the avoidance of sporting links."
"We emphasised the need to remove immediately the sanctions on imports of oil and other sanctions imposed on Kosovo and Montenegro."
"We also consider it important to provide support for all those players in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who are committed to the values of democracy."
"Next, we should be defining the ways and means by which we can make their situation easier."
"This would include, for example, shipments of raw materials and the supply of electricity."
"We asked the Commission and the competent bodies to make recommendations on the matter without delay."
"Furthermore, we confirmed the decision taken by the Heads of Member States and Governments in the General Affairs Council to set up an agency responsible for the rebuilding of the region, and we decided to hold a South-Eastern Europe Stability Pact Summit in Sarajevo."
"The crisis in Kosovo may mark a turning point in the Union's external actions which should now be conducted purposefully and with a common cause."
"We need to broaden our scope when it comes to the Union's external relations, we must improve our ability to foresee crises, and we must become more adept at coping with the aftermath of crises."
"We discussed this at length on Monday in an open sitting of the General Affairs Council."
"We were all unanimous on the subject of developing this area, and adhering to a tight schedule."
"The European Union has the perfect opportunity to assist in stabilising the region in a coherent and determined fashion."
"However, I hope we will remember that the Union is by no means solely responsible for the restructuring programme in Kosovo."
"We are working in close co-operation with other countries and international organisations."
"There is a vital need for further development and expansion of co-operation with the United Nations, the CSCE and the Council of Europe."
"MEPs have, in many different connections, stressed the great importance of the Union as a driving force behind, and a guarantor of, peace and stability in our continent."
"It is precisely this that lies at the heart of the next phase of enlargement."
"Gradually, the European Union will become a entirely pan-European Union."
"In one respect at least the next phase of enlargement will differ from all those that went before: co-operation within the Union itself has reached a level that will place very great demands on all applicant countries."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that these demands are for the good of both the applicant countries and the Union."
"Meeting the criteria will strengthen social and economic development in the applicant countries concerned, and this has also been observed in the applicant countries themselves."
"Enlargement is a process which must move forward constantly and which cannot be allowed to be compromised with empty promises."
"During the Finnish presidential term, accession negotiations will continue in a spirit of determination."
"We aim to reach a decision on as many points of negotiation as possible, and initiate new ones."
"The European Council in Helsinki intends to reach a decision, on the basis of a report by the Commission, to include new applicant countries in accession negotiations."
"At the same time, we are discussing the development of relations with European countries and long-term aspects of enlargement."
"Enlargement will require the countries involved to adapt to the Union's institutional framework."
"We have already begun preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference, and we intend to draft a chairmans' report on it for the European Council in Helsinki."
"The views of Parliament will be vitally important while these reforms are under way, and I realise, with a sense of satisfaction, that our opinions are similar on many issues."
"We cannot neglect Turkey in the enlargement process."
"Turkey is an important partner for the Union."
"It is involved in the enlargement process, and a separate strategy has been created for it."
"Opinion on Turkey's membership of the Union is affected by the progress the country is making in the areas of democratic reform and human rights, and, above all, the rights of minority groups."
"In this connection, I would like to stress the fact that the Union opposes the death penalty everywhere and in each and every case."
"It is a common aim of the European Union to do away with capital punishment."
"Finland, as holder of the Presidency, will be monitoring the situation."
"If the sentence passed on the Kurdish leader, Öçalan, were to be carried out, it would be an unfortunate turn of events in Turkish policy."
"Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and thus endorses the aim to abolish the death penalty."
"The death penalty has not been carried out in the country since 1984."
"It is to be hoped that Turkey will continue to postpone the implementation of the death penalty until it is abolished entirely."
"It is hoped that the Turkish parliament will use its powers to reverse the judgment."
"Turkey has expressed its desire to join the European Union."
"One of the common values of the Union is to refrain from carrying out the death penalty."
"Madam President, I shall not go through the entire Presidency programme with regard to this matter."
"My committee visit in September will be an opportunity for me to continue the discussion on external relations."
"Many matters of current interest, including Russia and the northern dimension, are thus certainly on the agenda, but I would still like to raise one question that is of topical interest: the outlook for the peace process in the middle East since Barak's government came to power is brighter than it has been for years."
"The European Union is actively promoting the peace process in both political and economic terms."
"I myself will be travelling to the region in early August to meet key players in the process and to convey the views of the union on how best to promote it."
"Regardless of whether we speak of the proliferation or the prevention of conflict, there is one thing we can be sure of: we can only assist others if our own wealth is assured."
"Knowledge and ability are fundamental preconditions for our well-being and ability to compete, as they are for the Member States and for the whole Union."
"The information society offers new opportunities to citizens, to enterprises and to the administrative sector."
"During the coming months, we will scrutinise how the information society can be utilised in order to enhance our ability to compete."
"At the same time we have to ensure that the development does not lead to wider gulfs between different groups within society."
"We have not yet completely exploited the opportunities which monetary union and the internal market offer us."
"We can only create new employment opportunities if our economy is doing well."
"The increase in the employment level indicates that we are going in the right direction."
"We are going to continue our work in the areas of gender equality, socially and ecologically sustainable development, the problems affecting our youth and the well-being of our fellow citizens."
"I know that all these problems are important to this House, and that the European Parliament has carried out important work in promoting them."
"I was talking before about how the Union can have an impact on strengthening security in Europe and the world in general."
"People's security does not only stem from the avoidance of war, but also has to do with economic security, the realisation of human rights, and the protection afforded by a constitution."
"At the Tampere European Council, there will be an attempt to create a more uniform, more united policy on immigration and asylum-seeking and increased efforts to prevent cross-border criminality."
"Legislation in the Member States in this area should be harmonised and aligned, judgments should be more effectively carried out, and administrative and legal barriers to co-operation should be removed."
"My ideas are based on the principle that the Union can only succeed through close and open co-operation between its various agencies, and with the active support of the citizens of Europe."
"The European Parliament will play a crucial role in the process."
"Madam President, may you and all the members find the energy, perseverance and will you need as this session begins, and I would like to assure you that Finland, as holder of the Presidency, expects much from our mutual co-operation."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I would like to thank Finland's Foreign Minister, Ms Halonen, for her excellent account of the Finnish Presidency programme."
"As the Member State to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland is piloting the European Union into a new millennium with an extremely well-balanced programme."
"It is important to point out, as the Foreign minister made clear in her speech, that together, the internal reform of the Union and the strengthening of civil societies all over Europe will form the cornerstone of EU development in the future."
"Emphasis on these goals can be seen very clearly in the Finnish Presidency programme."
"The hallmark of the Finnish Presidency, a strong and open Europe for a new millennium, reflects the Union's vital need for reforms."
"The people's Europe must be built with the emphasis on the serious importance of transparency among the EU institutions and on the principle of subsidiarity."
"The enormous challenges of the future, such as the economic changes associated with the single currency, the Union's enlargement to the east, and the prevention of international crime, require the support of more viable EU institutions than is the case today."
"It is a positive sign that Finland has started off with concrete proposals."
"Wordy proclamations will not produce the changes we now need."
"Tragedies such as the crisis in Kosovo, and, more generally, in the whole of the former Yugoslavia, show that the peace and stability afforded by European integration do not as yet extend very far beyond the Union's external borders."
"The inevitable conclusions must be made regarding this point, so that the Union's crisis management skills may be strengthened as promptly as possible."
"The EU must ensure that it has in future an effective non-military range of options at its disposal both to prevent a crisis and to put out fires that have already started."
"The fact that these goals are high up on the agenda is a very positive sign."
"The economic, social and political rebuilding of the Western Balkans must proceed at a brisk pace while Finland holds the Presidency."
"It is such an immense challenge that the Finnish Presidency will be required to show it has the special ability to keep all the interwoven threads tightly in its hands."
"Finland has to ensure that all allocated funds are used effectively."
"Not a single bridge can be rebuilt nor a single school constructed if the costs of administering the reconstruction projects are inflated."
"The reconstruction programme should be funded in a way that takes account of the use of local resources."
"In this way, the region's business community, ravaged as it has been by war, can be revived, jobs can be created, and trade with the surrounding areas and the Union can be developed."
"The Union's employment problems cannot be solved by making official appointments at Kosovo's expense."
"Aid must go to where it is most needed."
"The enlargement of the Union to the East will require the unflagging support of its citizens."
"The Union must make absolutely sure no bottlenecks in the enlargement process arise through its inability to function properly."
"Ensuring the single market functions effectively and strengthening the Union's internal security are the important keys to successful enlargement."
"We must expect the Tampere Council meeting, which will focus inter alia on questions relating to asylum-seekers and refugees as well as the fight against organised crime, to provide concrete proposals for action to improve internal security."
"The Union's northern dimension concept, about to come into the limelight, features many aspects of EU internal security, such as nuclear and environmental safety and co-operation with neighbouring regions."
"Furthermore, the ideas expressed concerning the Union's northern dimension need to be made into more concrete programmes of action."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Members of the Council, Ms Halonen, the start of Finland's first presidential term in the European Union marks a time of great change."
"Parliament, in its new assembly, will start newly invigorated by its recently acquired constitutional rights as bestowed on it under the Treaty of Amsterdam; in place of the former Commission that resigned before its term was over we await the appointment of the new Commission, and Council is preparing for reforms in its working practices."
"The undeniable fact is that we shall be unable to restore the confidence of the people in the Union to take decisions, without reforming the way we do things and this concerns all institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"One of the most pressing matters we are expecting Parliament and the Council to resolve is a proper arrangement relating to members' pay and expenses."
"The reform of the Union's institutions is a crucial part of the Finnish presidential programme, as Ms Halonen mentioned in her speech."
"We note with particular satisfaction that the programme includes an aim to reform working practices in the Council."
"The principle of transparency will be promoted in a very real sense with the development of open sessions of the Council, better accessibility to documents, and the general availability of Council and working party agendas and meeting schedules."
"In acknowledgement of decisions taken by the Cologne European Council, Finland will oversee preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference."
"The aim must be for a conference which leads to a new agreement to make enlargement possible and create the right conditions for more effective action on the part of the Union after enlargement has taken place."
"It must be said, however, that the efficient functioning of the Union has already met with obstacles during this session."
"I cannot help wondering why the right-wing group in the Parliament is attempting to postpone the appointment of the Commission using the report by the Committee of Independent Experts as an excuse."
"I shall be frank and say that tactics like these will make it difficult for the Finnish Presidency to succeed."
"We must speed up the drawing up of the report and the proper debate on it in Parliament in every way possible, but we cannot surrender the legal rights of the Parliament to an unofficial investigative body and give in to the timetable it imposes."
"We also need to strengthen the Union's credibility, to enable us to become fully involved in serious problems that are our responsibility, the most pressing of which is the drawing up of the timetable for the rebuilding programme in Kosovo."
"That will be the start of our task to strengthen stability in the whole Balkan region."
"The Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, made a sound contribution to the achievement of a solution for Kosovo, showing that a non-aligned state can also successfully represent the common view of the Union as a whole."
"A properly functioning Union is a pre-condition of a successful conclusion to the enlargement process that is under way in respect of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The starting point must be insistence on uniform membership criteria, which also means an attempt at the truth when discussing a timetable for enlargement."
"Finland has quite rightly pointed out that it is necessary to connect the enlargement process with Europe's influence on developments in the areas of environmental protection and social welfare."
"The aim must be sustainable development and the inclusion of the issue of environmental protection in all community policy, which means obligations not only for future members but for the present members also."
"The enlargement process can make headway if co-operation with the Union's neighbouring regions is strengthened."
"The northern dimension policy, which has been approved by the Union, covers inter alia co-operation in the Baltic region, but it also supports the implementation of the approved strategy on Russia."
"The main issue in need of reform is genuine cross-border co-operation, which needs to be strengthened."
"Another current challenge for the Union also is the realisation of economic and monetary union in a way that will generate jobs."
"So there are various challenges."
"Finally, I would sincerely like to wish the Finnish Presidency luck in the implementation of its programme, favourably inclined as it is, to reform."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Madam Minister, just as the Minister did in a part of his speech, I am also going to use the second Finnish national language."
"The agenda of the Finnish Presidency does not contain any great surprises; it is balanced, and is focused on the most important challenges to the Union."
"The agenda actually emphasises those problems which earlier Summit Meetings have agreed that we should solve in Helsinki."
"I am very glad that the minister tackled the problems concerning the work of the Council of Ministers so frankly for I am of the opinion that they have not been discussed sufficiently, and there remain for us many tricky problems to be solved."
"Precisely for this reason, many issues have also been delayed until Finland's Presidency."
"We emphasise in the agenda a strong and open Europe, which is correct."
"A strong Europe is a Europe in which the institutions are strong, not where some strongmen solve Europe's problems."
"Unfortunately we have witnessed the tendency that some problems have not been solved in the institutions, but by individual persons."
"This is not in the spirit of Monnet."
"I hope that the Finnish presidency will succeed in its aim of making the EU act unanimously for a common policy and with common will."
"A strong Union is also a Union which is able to create stability in its neighbouring regions."
"For this reason, it is important to also build up a comprehensive and clear strategy of involvement, which includes countries such as Albania and Macedonia, by means of successful expansion and through credible crisis management."
"Regardless of all the work carried out with a view to stabilisation, there are nevertheless risks that the streams of refugees might increase."
"In this regard, I think that the Finnish agenda could have been more ambitious, in particular in light of the Kosovo crisis."
"We certainly must not find ourselves once again in a situation of unreadiness as was the case when we had to find a solution to the distribution of payments."
"I finally wish to stress that I sincerely hope that Minister Halonen, who knows the situation in Slovakia personally, is going to fight for an end to the discrimination, for instance against the Roma population, which exists there as well as elsewhere."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to welcome you here to the European Parliament."
"I promise that the Greens/European Free Alliance will do all it can to achieve close and effective co-operation with your institution."
"It really cannot be stressed enough that Finland is embarking on its Presidency in quite problematic circumstances."
"We have to see that a properly functioning Commission is appointed in September, and the Green Group must do all within its power to ensure that the procedures here in Parliament are as realistic as possible, though at the same time thorough."
"That is something we surely all want to see."
"Foreign Minister, you said that the Kosovo crisis might prove to be a sort of turning point in EU common foreign and security policy."
"My group's position is that the European Union must strengthen its common foreign and security policy, but we would hope that Finland, which is a militarily non-aligned State, will emphasise the importance of the non-military aspect of crisis management."
"It is quite obvious that occasionally human rights in the modern world have to be defended with weapons, but if we want to act wisely and avoid large-scale human and economic suffering and destruction we have to work on a long-term basis and use specifically non-military means to solve future crises."
"Our group would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament this Spring approved a report recommending the establishment of non-military peacekeeping bodies for the European Union."
"We are surprised how little the non-military options were spoken of at the Cologne Council meeting, and we hope that during the Finnish presidential term they will be energetically addressed."
"The European Union is large enough to be able to have an influence on global developments."
"During the Finnish Presidency, we will be involved in preparations for future world trade talks."
"It is absolutely vital that this is undertaken in a spirit of openness."
"We have already seen how civil society is eager to participate in this debate."
"I am now referring to what happened with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment."
"I believe you all want to work in such a way that civil society is able to interact openly with the decision makers, when the topic of debate is the relationship between free trade, people's health and the protection of the environment."
"Our group would like to point out that, during its presidential term, Finland will have ample opportunity to lead Europe towards social and ecological union."
"We will give you all our support, so that the Directive on an energy tax can finally be issued."
"We have been preparing it for seven years now."
"I would imagine we are all starting to become rather impatient with regard to this matter, as it has been so difficult to move the decision-making process along."
"At the same time it is obviously necessary to strengthen the marketability of labour."
"Throughout the entire European Union it is possible, for example, to reduce the figures for non-waged labour enabling us to create new jobs once more and thus induce a more vigorous degree of economic activity."
"Finally I would like to state firmly that the Tampere Council meeting must not simply prove to be a chance to increase police activity and the surveillance of the public."
"It also has to promote civil rights, as well as improve the status of third country citizens legally resident in the Member States of the European Union."
"All this must take place in a spirit of openness."
"We also expect the Commission to start to ease the task of the Finnish Presidency to increase transparency as soon as possible by furnishing Parliament and the Council with information on the public availability of documents."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Finland's goal is the right one: there has to be more transparency within the EU."
"Right at the start, the EU's Finance Ministers, under the leadership of Finland, reached the conclusion that it is only possible to speak of EMU within the EU if it is with one voice."
"As a result, we have now fallen silent in eleven languages over the subject of monetary policy in the EU."
"Under Finland's leadership, transparency and public accountability should extend to the secret and secretive work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Finland is a non-aligned country, and not a member of NATO."
"Nevertheless, she should show more credibility in her opposition to an EU common defence force."
"We should not give in to the former Social Democrats and the Green pacifists, to Schröder, Fischer, Blair, D'Alema or Solana, who want more arms for Europe, and to expand NATO."
"NATO is also now an organisation on the offensive."
"It will be Finland's task to see to it that EU Member States are free to remain non-aligned."
"This goal is being undermined by the principle that the EU should have a common will, a common policy and a common voice, a goal the 70 per cent of Finns who did not vote in the European Parliamentary elections were opposed to."
"Mr President, the Finnish Government assumes the Presidency of the European Union at a very challenging time."
"This year has seen the implementation of some very wide-ranging and aggressive policies which are all going to play a role in developing the economies within the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"The launch of the new euro currency will certainly help to reduce business costs for small and medium-sized enterprises as foreign exchange transactions in eleven countries become an event of the past."
"I know that the euro currency has experienced some trading problems at times during this year."
"The instability within the EU institutions and the war in Kosovo have certainly not encouraged a climate of investor confidence."
"However, in recent times, the value of the euro currency has substantially increased as political and economic stability within the European landscape has re-emerged."
"There are eleven participating countries within the new euro currency zone encompassing over 291 million people."
"It is of the utmost importance that consumer information campaigns about the timetable and effects of the new euro currency continue in the run-up to the introduction of euro notes and coins in the year 2002."
"The Finnish Presidency of the EU, together with the Commission, should review progress that is being made on this important issue across the EU so that consumer concerns about the new euro currency are fully addressed."
"The increased interdependence between the Member States and EMU demands the strengthening of economic co-ordination."
"In order to boost competitiveness, growth and employment, the Finnish Government rightly intends to promote the co-ordination of economic, employment and structural policies and to complete the internal market."
"The ageing nature of our population, globalisation and technological advances present real challenges for European economic and social development."
"European employment strategies must be put in place in accordance with the new powers contained within the Amsterdam Treaty as well as within revised European social fund regulations."
"Unemployment still remains at over 9 % within the European Union which is unacceptably high."
"It is not right that one in four people below the age of 25 have difficulty in getting a decent start in life."
"The Finnish Government is certainly laying a great emphasis on the need to promote the enlargement process to a greater extent."
"The Finnish Presidency will direct preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the decisions taken at the recent Cologne European Council."
"An IGC is very important as institutional reform must take place before the practical process of enlargement can succeed and much work needs to be done to prepare EU Institutions for this intergovernmental phase."
"I am very satisfied that the Finnish Government intends to pursue this matter vigorously over the next six months."
"Enlargement of the Union is essential for the stability of Europe."
"The opening-up of larger markets will assist in the process of economic growth."
"The Union itself must be prepared to take up the challenges posed by enlargement by improving its decision-making capacity and improving the functioning of its institutions."
"National interests must be protected during this phase of negotiations as an overburdened bureaucracy at EU level is not the desired outcome from these IGC talks."
"In conclusion, as a result of the Cologne Summit of March of last year, it has been agreed that the EU budget will be worth over £506 billion during the seven-year period, i.e. 2000-2006."
"The conclusion of the Agenda 2000 discussion has ensured that the European Union can move forward and discuss and implement new policy objectives and goals. The Finnish Government has certainly started this process."
"The EU certainly now has a golden opportunity to put in place new policies in the fields of consumer rights, food safety and assistance to the elderly, as well as areas of environmental protection."
"I would like first of all to thank Madam President-in-Office for her comments regarding the abolition of the death penalty."
"I believe that, on the Finnish initiative, the European Union is preparing to implement other initiatives on an international level, and I am grateful for that."
"The point I would like to highlight here concerns Kosovo."
"Nobody has spoken about it until now, but there is a problem which has not been confronted, or has not been confronted with the determination expected by the European Union."
"It is that of the three thousand Kosovan prisoners who were literally kidnapped by Mr Milosevic and his henchmen during the latter days of the international intervention in Kosovo and transferred by force to Serbian prisons. Nobody knows anything about these three thousand people."
"They are Mr Kurti, the former leader of the student movement in Pristina, Professor Oti, and three thousand other people who have literally disappeared."
"I would like to know whether, on the initiative of the Finnish Presidency, we may finally take determined action, with the support of the Red Cross and other international organisations, to oblige the war criminal Milosevic not to do what he has done so many times before: to use blackmail, to use these people who are now in his hands and about whom nothing is known, to once again oblige the European Union to drop the evidence."
"I believe that, before even talking about lifting the embargo, Mr Milosevic should be forced to release all of these people unconditionally."
"Applause"
"Madam President, the work of developing the Amsterdam Treaty for even greater union is commencing under the Finnish Presidency."
"As things stand, the next treaty will be even worse than the one we already have."
"It will provide for more majority decisions whereby ministers and civil servants are able to tone down the democracy in our Member States."
"Decisions which today are taken in publicly elected open assemblies will pass to secret committees within the Commission and the Council."
"We will have much more Brussels and less democracy."
"That the new treaty is to be called the Paris Treaty is unfair on the city of cities."
"The power which we as voters are losing is mainly being transferred to the Commission and the Council, although the Parliament is taking over the right of veto from the parliaments of the Member States."
"The individual States may no longer prevent the adoption of a law or recommend that a law be amended."
"A democratic era is being superseded by a bureaucratic era in which the voters are being driven into a siding."
"It is to prevent this watering down of democracy that we have created a new group: the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities."
"Democracy, because power must lie with the publicly elected in our Member States and because the necessary common legislation must also be controlled democratically."
"Plurality, because we wish to maintain diverse identities and cultures and to counter euro-nationalism and its euro-anthems and common passports, currency, policing and defence."
"We no longer want centralism and unification, but decentralisation and freedom."
"We do not want the EU to be a new state, but rather a practical collaboration on problems which we cannot solve individually."
"The EU must be a help and not a hindrance."
"Mr President, when speaking of Kosovo in the address she gave this morning, President Fontaine said: 'The guns have fallen silent, the horrors have ceased, but peace still remains to be built' ."
"The guns may well have fallen silent, Mr President, but the anti-personnel mines continue their butchery; the horror of war is over but not the horror of the discovery of mass graves day after day, a tragic, heart-rending testimony to a contempt for the right to live of individuals and populations, a right which is no less than respect for the diversity and identity of a people for whose affirmation we will fight both here and in our national parliaments."
"' It is not acceptable that in the very heart of Europe, human rights should once more be flouted in such a barbaric manner, ' declared Mrs Fontaine once again."
"We are in agreement on this point as well, reaching forward as we are to be part of the process of solidarity between nations through a common foreign and security policy for which my group has fought right from the start of its representation in the European Parliament."
"Starting with the Balkans, with the urgency and determination which today's situation demands, the Common Foreign and Security Policy will allow us to achieve the objectives of peace, economic stability and the certainty that human rights are being respected."
"NATO has won the war and Europe must build the peace: this is the challenge which we must take up immediately, in the loud and clear definition of the role that Europe will assume in the construction of the peace process, in political wisdom, in the quality of the steps that it will take in order to prevent the migration flows which it is currently suffering and will continue to do so in the years to come, from causing religious, economic and social conflict, especially in areas in which unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate."
"Of course, the establishment of an agency will not in itself solve the problem. However, all remains to be seen."
"How will this body, which we hope will guarantee rapid, efficient, useful, rational and fair measures, be structured and made operative, with the appropriate participation in the reconstruction, above all, of all those areas such as Italy and, in particular, Puglia, whose tourist trades have suffered extensive economic damage from the war and the effects of migration. It is true that the war has left deep wounds: they are clearly visible."
"They can be clearly seen on territories and on the people who lost their lives in or were driven from those territories; but it has also harmed certain governments, which are left without a clear foreign policy."
"In any case, it has displayed the failure of ten years of diplomacy and highlighted the oversights, the shortcomings and the squanderings, of international co-operation."
"Europe's undertaking, then, cannot be understood as merely revolving around the reconciliation of the parties involved in the conflict, but the measure of its performance will depend upon the overall ability it displays in reconciling the Stability Pact, reconstruction and ever-increasing unemployment."
"In his statement, the President of the Commission undertook to spend money on reconstruction, not bureaucracy."
"Let us hope that this reconstruction will be more than just material."
"We must rebuild roads, schools, ports and water systems, but we must also restore the faith of peoples who for years have been deprived of the right to live with their loved ones on their own land with their own jobs, and who are now hoping to enjoy the peaceful life denied to them for years."
"If Europe were to pursue the aim indicated by Professor Prodi of providing the Balkans with a clear political and economic future, it would certainly achieve a great deal, but it would not be performing the whole of its task, which includes making a substantial contribution to building a path for democratic, and of course economic, development, but essentially social and cultural development, in the knowledge that reconciliation is all the stronger and more stable, the higher the level of tolerance and respect for diversity of the parties is concerned."
"Honoured President, esteemed Representative of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, it is inappropriate that the Representative for the acting Commission should make a full statement on the Finnish Presidency's programme here, for this programme will largely be implemented under the new Commission."
"Permit me, therefore, to restrict my comments in the main to two issues, namely reconstruction in Kosovo and the sentence passed on Abdullah Öçalan."
"Firstly, I should like to remind you that from the very beginning, the European Union was heavily involved in the endeavours being made to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo conflict."
"The Commission also provided humanitarian aid throughout the conflict."
"The European Union is, as we are all aware, the largest donor."
"We gave financial aid to those countries most severely affected by the influx of exiles and refugees."
"Now that the conflict is over, our immediate priority is to support KFOR's endeavours to restore peace and order and to reconstruct a functioning civil administration under the leadership of the United Nations."
"The European Union has a special task to fulfil in this respect."
"In particular, we bear the responsibility for the reconstruction aspects of UNMIG."
"Jollie Dixon, the acting Special Delegate for the Commission appointed for this purpose, has now taken up his position in Pristina and it is time to solve the huge number of practical problems."
"What has been provided so far in terms of aid?"
"The humanitarian aid committed to Kosovo and the neighbouring countries totals EUR 378 million, with the bulk going towards providing essential foods and other goods such as medicines, sanitation equipment and accommodation."
"This aid is channelled through the UNHCR, the International Red Cross, UNICEF and various NGOs."
"This amount includes the EUR 196 million currently being mobilised from the Commission's budgetary reserves."
"Furthermore, EUR 100 million were committed as macroeconomic aid for the damage sustained by other countries as a result of the Kosovo crisis, 62 million being earmarked for Albania, 25 million for FYROM and 13 million for Montenegro."
"The first instalments have already been paid out."
"In addition, EUR 45 million will be committed to Kosovo through the OBNOVA programme, a first priority of which will be to finance a delegation whose task is to ascertain the scale of material damage."
"The first set of findings will be available on 23 July."
"The European Commission will then base its definitive aid programme on these figures."
"In addition, the budgetary requirements for reconstruction will need to be set in the course of the next two to three years, and the anticipated costs which the other donors are to incur will need to be calculated."
"The measures to be financed under the OBNOVA programme as a matter of priority include such areas as mine clearance, obtaining materials for rebuilding houses and also public buildings, supporting public utilities and customs control, and a village employment and rehabilitation programme."
"Working in conjunction with KFOR, UNMIG and UNHCR, these projects were prioritised and they are to supplement the on-going work undertaken by the humanitarian organisations."
"We hope to be able to commit the EUR 45 million before the end of this month."
"As explained to the budgetary authorities in the trialogue of 2 July, an additional EUR 92 million will still be required this year."
"It was agreed during this trialogue session that in September the Commission will submit a proposal to increase the budget by means of an amending and supplementary budget which will raise the 92 million required."
"The funds are largely to be raised by reallocation, with as little utilisation as possible being made of additional funds."
"It was also agreed that both parts of the budgetary authorities will deal with this proposal in one reading."
"We are counting on receiving Parliament's support as far as this is concerned, so that the European Community can continue to play a leading role in the reconstruction process."
"I should now like to say a few words on the issue of a reconstruction agency."
"Before the Cologne European Council meeting, the Commission proposed to the Heads of State and Government that a special agency should be set up which would deal with the implementation of the reconstruction work."
"The European Council followed this recommendation and instructed the Commission back in June to formulate an actual proposal on the basis of experience gained from Bosnia."
"We at the Commission proposed that the agency should be located in Pristina, that is at the centre of reconstruction activity, where all the other international organisations are located."
"Applause"
"However, at the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Rio, the Heads of Government agreed that the agency 's seat should be in Thessaloniki."
"We cannot escape the conclusion though, that this was due not so much to the fact that the reconstruction activities, for which this agency was to be responsible, were in the immediate vicinity, but rather to the fact that there was a general need for economic aid throughout the region."
"The Commission takes the view that it will only be possible to work effectively if the vast proportion of activities is concentrated in Pristina."
"However, the Commission could envisage a solution whereby, for example, some of the administrative personnel would be based at another location."
"But this must not be to the detriment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation."
"The Commission assumes that to uphold these principles accords with the Court of Auditors' position and the first reactions of the European Parliament."
"However, the Council decided conclusively on Monday this week that the agency's seat should be in Thessaloniki."
"The Commission has refrained from stating its position, preferring the Commission's definitive position to be established by the new Commission."
"The proposal has now been submitted to Parliament for advice."
"Meanwhile, as of 1 July, the Commission has been despatching a task force consisting of approximately 20 officials and supporting personnel to Pristina, where it will be responsible for implementing the reconstruction programme."
"All authority required to effect implementation was transferred from Brussels to the leader of the task force in Pristina in order to create a mechanism which will work with optimum efficiency and speed to provide aid at a time when it is most urgently needed in Kosovo."
"Finally, a comment on achieving co-ordination amongst the donors."
"On 13 July, a meeting took place of the High Level Steering Group, the committee managed by the European Commission and the World Bank which is based on partnership and is intended to co-ordinate the Kosovo crisis aid provided by international donors."
"It was confirmed on this occasion that the first Kosovo donor conference would be held on 28 July in Brussels."
"This conference is to focus in particular on determining what the pressing needs will be from now until the end of the year."
"A second donor conference has been planned for October and this will deal in greater depth with the reconstruction efforts."
"Turning to the Öçalan trial, the Commission takes the same position on this matter as that taken up by the German Presidency on 29 June, following the death sentence passed by the state security tribunal of Ankara on Abdullah Öçalan, and again expresses its absolute repudiation of the death penalty."
"It was for this reason that on 29 June, the Commission asked the relevant Turkish authorities to take account of the European Union's repudiation of this death penalty."
"Consequently, the Commission, knowing that Turkey has not employed the death penalty since 1984, anticipates that as a member of the Council of Europe, Turkey will abide by the obligations that it has entered into."
"To carry out the death penalty would inevitably place relations between the European Union and Turkey under huge strain."
"Like the majority of EU Member States, the Commission believes that recent amendments to Turkish legislation have paved the way for the case against Mr Öçalan and the process of reaching a verdict, to be transferred to a civil court."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr Fischler."
"I have received ten motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I must begin by emphasising that this Parliament has observed that the Finnish Presidency, from the beginning of its mandate, has shown independence and equanimity and has sought agreed solutions."
"These three attributes, which I wish to highlight, bode well for the success of this first Finnish Presidency and they will be needed, given the challenges which face it."
"Since it is impossible in three minutes to list all these challenges - the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is impossible to list its programme - I will limit myself to a few brief observations on some particular points."
"With regard to enlargement, we must be aware that events in the Balkans have changed the landscape, and in Helsinki we will have to open negotiations with other countries."
"In relation to institutional affairs, the Finnish Presidency has an enormous responsibility: that of initiating work which will lead to the conclusion of a statute on fundamental rights."
"But we should not forget that the mandate of the Cologne European Council meeting speaks of a non-binding statute which, initially, will not be incorporated into the Treaties."
"If our intention, from the outset, is to implement a set of binding rights, this would leave us with a minimal statute which will offer little to European citizens."
"With regard to the statute on MEPs, the Finnish Presidency - and it should be congratulated on this - has also shown respect for the fact that this initiative concerns this Parliament."
"With regard to the functioning of the College of Commissioners, I would like to say, from this Chamber, that we will not allow the individual responsibility of the Commissioners to be used as a weapon."
"Moving on to economic affairs, the matter of a tax on energy has been mentioned here."
"The Finnish Presidency knows that this is a disputed question and we hope it will make use of all its powers of conciliation in order that this taxation package might move forward, since it is of great importance to Europe."
"And I would like to say a few words on the question of the internal market. I hope that the internal market does not suffer as a result of this idea of bringing it into line with international agreements in areas such as electronic commerce."
"It is must be stated that the Tampere Summit must not become a Summit on immigration and asylum."
"Although this is very important and events in the Balkans have demonstrated the urgency required in this field, the Tampere Summit must be dedicated to developing a region which enjoys liberty, security and justice."
"We must be conscious of the fact that, if this development is to be harmonious, we must insist on the idea of 'justice' , we must promote the European judicial network, we must be capable of making sentences effective and making the sentences immediate, both the criminal and the non-criminal ones, and we must facilitate direct relationships between judges."
"These are the challenges for the Tampere Summit and immigration, although important, must not be allowed to push them to one side."
"And just a word about three matters which have been side-stepped and which are important for the South and for Spain. We must begin a dialogue with Mexico and Mercosur."
"And with regard to Morocco, those EUR 125 million must be released."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, I should first like to offer my warmest congratulations to the Finnish Presidency, Madam Foreign Minister and her colleagues on their lucid and precisely-formulated programme, which may not be one imbued with great vision, but which is nevertheless very forward-looking."
"It is exactly what we need."
"There will be more than enough problems to solve, the list is already before us, but best efforts have been made to this end."
"I should like to stress the following, further to the points made by Mr Commissioner Fischler, giving particular attention to the two matters of Turkey and reconstruction in Yugoslavia."
"Firstly, I consider that it is right that as far as actual reconstruction work is concerned, particularly in Kosovo, the decisions should be taken on site."
"That is a line of argument that this Parliament has represented and which we have defended, namely that greater local autonomy should be devolved to the area where the reconstruction work is actually to take place."
"However, and I am probably prepared to go further than you are in this respect, Mr Commissioner, I believe that Greece and Thessaloniki would be a good location when it comes to aid for reconstruction in general for the Balkans or South-Eastern Europe, and particularly in co-operation with Mr Hombach."
"This work cannot be undertaken in Pristina alone, both in view of infrastructure and political relations."
"People may well say that is a bad compromise."
"I don't believe it is."
"I believe that they are two different things, but that they must be closely interwoven."
"But this decision is entirely reasonable, on the one hand Pristina for the actual reconstruction aid and, on the other, Thessaloniki."
"Turning now to my second point, which is Turkey, I believe that we must state in a clear and unambiguous fashion that as far as we are concerned, the Öçalan case is not just about one man threatened with the death penalty, but rather we repudiate the death penalty in general."
"He is a symbol for many others, for example Akim Birdal or others too, who are in prison, some of whom have not had legal proceedings taken against them, and some whose health is greatly impaired."
"Turkey must at last demonstrate respect for human rights, for full democracy, particularly as regards the Kurdish question."
"We do not support terrorism in either word or deed."
"We support a political solution for Turkey; this is necessary in every sense, and I hope that the Finnish Presidency too will succeed in making this clear to Turkey."
"Yes, there is a road that leads to Europe and there is also a road that leads to the European Union for Turkey, and the same rules apply to Turkey as apply to Latvia, Bratislava and Slovenia."
"If Turkey is prepared to recognise these rules, then there is a clear and unambiguous road leading to Europe, but that means showing respect for democracy and showing respect for human rights."
"Applause"
"Mr President, during the Finnish presidential term, the Council will be discussing many important issues."
"The Finnish government's programme for its presidential term shows that Finland intends to carry out its most important tasks in an effective manner. For my part, I would like to make two points."
"As far as the future of the Union is concerned the most important tasks of the Council will be tied, on the one hand, to enlargement, and, on the other, to improving the Union's decision-making machinery, both of which hinge on one another."
"The large-scale programme of enlargement which is now on the horizon calls for a selection of bold reforms to the decision-making process."
"The Union, which is achieving pan-European dimensions, can only function properly if it develops more as a union of independent states rather than a federation."
"This must be taken into account when the mandate for the next Intergovernmental Conference is being drafted."
"The mandate must be drafted in such a way that the Union's decision-making process is changed to cater for the needs of eastward enlargement as a whole and not the requirements of accession in respect of just five or six countries."
"This being the case, action cannot be restricted merely to the points not covered by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Union has to change direction."
"Any move towards a centralised federation of states on the American model must be checked; we should be aiming for a decentralised Union, and here the Swiss federation might serve as a model in principle."
"The Swiss system is often referred to as a confederation."
"Only a Union developing in this sort of direction will be able to enlarge in accordance with existing plans."
"The Intergovernmental Conference mandate must therefore be broad in scope and include an investigation into the basic principles of the Union's decision-making process."
"My other point is connected with the northern dimension."
"During its presidential term, Finland must try to speed up developments associated with the northern dimension."
"The next major step will be the development of the northern dimension as part of the union's internal policy."
"The northern dimension means that the situation and circumstances pertaining to the northern regions should be taken into consideration in all Union decision making."
"Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times we have discussed the problem of Balkan reconstruction in this Parliament."
"We have spoken about Bosnia and have endlessly discussed the same problems of decentralisation."
"I believe that the Balkans will not be reconstructed unless the European spirit of co-responsibility becomes the dominant spirit of politics there."
"I think that the European Union can offer the spirit of European construction to the reconstruction of the Balkans and that will be the determining factor."
"Nothing we say about Thessaloniki, Pristina or Sarajevo will have the same meaning, because today - and this is where the danger lies - in the method of reconstruction with the UN on one side, the European Union on another and the OSCE on yet another, we are creating institutions of dependence where the reconstruction of the Balkans depends on our will but the self-determination of the Balkan peoples in terms of managing themselves is not achieved."
"The danger is that we plan and construct on behalf of others, but do not create the conditions necessary for the peoples and countries of the Balkans to take control of their own destiny."
"It is for this reason that here, in this Parliament, we have already proposed, for example, a foundation for democracy which, starting with the Bosnian problems, should be extended to the whole of the Balkans."
"This foundation would finance all the initiatives and contribute to the reconstruction of democratic structures in the Balkans, because, at the end of the day, the capacity for self-determination depends on the society's capacity to organise itself democratically."
"This is where the great problem lies in those countries with authoritarian structures where democracy is not readily available."
"Not until democracy is readily available will the reconstruction of the Balkans be possible."
"Applause"
"Mr President, listening to the Finnish Presidency, it is evident that European Union policy, which only proliferates and aggravates the problems facing our citizens, will not undergo fundamental change."
"That is precisely why it is essential for our citizens to step up their fight against the objectives of the European Union."
"Indeed, with the Presidency of a country which is not even a NATO member and which is renowned for its pacifist stance, we will also witness the continuation of the European Union's participation in the escapades of new NATO on a similar or even a much worse scale, as in the imperialist attack against Yugoslavia. We can also expect to see a lot more of the flagrant attacks on workers, in addition to an increase in unemployment and poverty, heightened levels of social and marginal inequality, continuation by the Turkish regime, with the support of the European Union, of the 25 year occupation of 40 % of Cyprus and the genocide of the Kurdish people, regarded by some as terrorists."
"It is a crying shame that Öçalan has been refused asylum and that he was handed over to the Turkish authorities when it was certain that a death sentence would be imposed."
"In other words, we are dealing with a combination of imperialistic policies and crass hypocracies, since, amongst other things, the European Union does its utmost for Human Rights and the rights of its citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disastrous war in the Balkans unleashed against a sovereign State without the approval of the United Nations Security Council and with no prior declaration of war only appears to have ended."
"Of course, the Atlantic coalition, on the orders of American politicians, appears to have come out on top."
"But at what price?"
"We are now faced with the enormous destruction which we have caused, mostly with no serious military objective."
"Having paid for this destruction, the European tax-payer will now be asked to pay for reconstruction."
"Bitter derision and, material waste have added to the human and political damage, and we are now in the front line of Community confrontations, in a psychological situation which is aggravated by the destruction which we have brought about."
"We are at risk of being ensnared in these conflicts, unless the European countries do not stand by powerless in the face of the final phase of ethnic cleansing which has not touched the universal sense of conscience to any great extent: we risk the elimination of the remaining Serb inhabitants, in that region, who have become a minority in their own country."
"Respect for international law, for the sovereignty of States, for their territorial integrity, is not always without its problems, but the violation of that respect causes infinitely more problems."
"This is what the authorities of the Union and the governments of the Member States should understand."
"In that way we will perhaps be spared the still unforeseen dramas which may await us."
"Mr President, over the next six months, the Finnish Presidency faces the weighty task of initiating substantial input to the economic and social reconstruction of Kosovo."
"Indeed, it was the violent escalation of the drawn-out Kosovo affair that now places before us the prospect of a Stability Pact for the Balkans."
"I should like to make a number of recommendations in connection with both interrelated themes."
"If we are to consolidate the fragile peace on the legendary killing fields of Kosovo Polje, there must be optimum co-operation between the international organisations concerned; the UN for the return of the refugees, the OSCE in terms of constructing democracy, and the EU for economic and social construction."
"If international co-ordination is lacking or falls short then the price paid for this will be institutional chaos."
"For its part, the EU would do well to guard against this critical danger."
"Thus, there should be no proliferation of EU bodies all concentrating on the one essential task: the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"At the same time, Brussels must urge the rival Albanian parties, that is the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation Army, to work together."
"Ultimately, those who pay have a fair amount of say in the matter."
"We believe that it is precisely this kind of homegrown contribution that is indispensable to the realisation of an effective Stability Pact in the Balkans."
"That is why all those engaged in the Balkans should also turn their hand to the wheel together; with every available support from the European Union."
"A regional Stability Pact could be one solution, or a pan Balkans bureau for reconstruction."
"Homegrown initiatives of this kind will boost Western stabilisation efforts in a way that cannot be underestimated."
"For neither the region nor the European Union will be served by Balkan states entering into the race for Brussels on a purely individual basis."
"As I speak, the notion, perhaps the distant dream, of a form of Benelux, is spreading through the Balkans."
"This is certainly an encouraging sign, for even if we do not strive for political unity, we are certainly in favour of being on good neighbourly terms. Indeed, that is in every sense our Christian duty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in Office of the Council, ever since 1989, Kosovo has constantly been the subject of debate in this Parliament."
"We have demanded action and warned against passivity on the part of the West."
"I make this point so that those who are new here today know that we have been talking about this for a very long time."
"Unfortunately, the Western governments' lack of action led to Milosevic first launching an assault on Croatia, then on Bosnia Herzegovina, and ultimately creating a bloodbath in Kosovo."
"There are millions of refugees, umpteen thousand dead and misery everywhere we look in the region."
"Many years of turning a blind eye is one of the reasons why it was necessary to undertake a military strike."
"We are all glad that the joint action undertaken by the West and Russia brought the war to an end and made it possible for the Albanian refugees to return to their homeland."
"But major tasks now await us which we must tackle energetically and efficiently, ensuring above all that we do not exclude the citizens of Kosovo in the process."
"The errors that we made when undertaking reconstruction work in Bosnia Herzegovina must not be repeated."
"If the salaries received by the international personnel in Bosnia Herzegovina are not in reasonable proportion to the aid which is received on site, then that is unacceptable and must not be repeated in Kosovo under any circumstances."
"But we must also avoid making other errors of the kind that the Council is prepared to make now."
"If the Council were to locate the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki then inefficiency would be the order of the day."
"This agency must be located in Kosovo, and not 200 Kilometres away in another country, when all the UN, OSCE, and UNHCR organisations and agencies are located in Kosovo."
"However, I am convinced that Thessaloniki is the best location for the headquarters of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe."
"I urgently call upon the Council and also the Greek government to vote for this option."
"Permit me also to mention at this point that I cannot begin to see the point of next week's spectacle in Sarajevo."
"One and a half days of spectacle will cost EUR 1.5 million, which is out of all proportion to the achievements that won't be made that day, since all the things that are supposed to be achieved there have already been decided on in Cologne."
"How many small and medium-sized enterprises could we set up in Bosnia Herzegovina with this one and a half million euro?"
"How many jobs could we create and how many more people could return than have been able to hitherto?"
"Now just a word for Serbia's benefit."
"A warm welcome to two representatives of the Serbian Opposition in the stand."
"Esteemed colleagues, the Serbian resistance to the Milosevic regime must now be given all the help that we can offer, unlike two years ago when we left the Opposition to their own devices for fear of antagonising the regime."
"Let us at last learn from our mistakes."
"Applause"
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as others have said previously, your Presidency has come at an exceptional time, just when the crisis has erupted in Kosovo and the European Union has made its contribution to dealing with it, after an institutional crisis which we have still not dealt with, after the election of a new Parliament in very unusual circumstances with voters taking less and less interest in an institution which has more and more powers and, finally, after the Cologne European Council meeting which launched important projects for the future."
"In order to face up to this, Madam President, we require a Community machine which is in good working order, and I can assure you that my group will do everything possible so that this machine may be put in order as soon as possible."
"You need it and we need it."
"How can we allow a situation in which the resigning Commission has continued to operate since last March and is still intervening to try to undermine the implementation of a single price for books and to define the mandate for the next WTO negotiation, the importance of which for the future is well known."
"This is not democratic and we will fight it."
"On the other hand, we will help you with the rapid establishment of a serious and trustworthy Commission which is at the service of all Europeans."
"Apart from these considerations, our candidate for the Presidency, Mr Romano Prodi, has just displayed the constructive and creative spirit with which he views the contribution of the Commission to the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"Under your Presidency, it will fall to the Council to define the mandate of that IGC. I believe that the presence by your side of a strong Commission making its contribution to the development of that mandate is equally essential."
"We will certainly help you in this to ensure that everyone faces up to his or her responsibilities."
"However, apart from that IGC, certain things will also depend on your Presidency, and we all know that certain improvements to the functioning of the institutions do not necessarily depend on a reform of the Treaties and that it concerns firstly - and perhaps principally - the Council."
"It depends particularly on you."
"As for Kosovo, I only have one thing to say."
"At the end of the day we Europeans often regret our lack of a common foreign and security policy."
"We express our impatience in the face of these vacillations."
"However, the President of your country has given a marvellous demonstration of the contribution that Europeans can make to peace on their continent and the development of a European solution to European problems."
"The fact that the United Nations and Russia have been able to be incorporated into the peace process in Kosovo is due to united European action."
"With regard to the Öçalan affair, Mrs President, I would like to say a few words."
"The first is to congratulate you for having made Tampere into a European Council primarily dedicated to asylum policy."
"In fact I believe that the current Öçalan affair in Istanbul is also due to the fact that we were not at first able to implement an asylum policy worthy of its name."
"Finally, in relation to the death penalty, please allow me to draw your attention and insist to you that your Presidency intervenes with all its powers in Istanbul as well as in Tehran, since in Tehran we know of thirteen judges who face the death penalty simply for having been accused of spying on behalf of Israel."
"We are counting on you, Madam President."
"Applause"
"Madam President, it is an extremely difficult task to rebuild Kosovo without disempowering the population and undermining the self-supporting powers of that country."
"It is even harder to rebuild relations between the Serbs and the Albanians which make it possible for the Serbian minority to remain in Kosovo."
"This can only be achieved if legal proceedings are initiated against murderers, rapists and war criminals."
"This is one of the genuinely difficult tasks."
"The most difficult of all will be to secure long-term peace."
"We must learn to combine the military iron gloves of NATO with the economic velvet gloves of the EU and provide co-operation and aid for economic and democratic development."
"We in the EU must establish an anteroom to those Balkan states which intend to develop along the lines of democracy and the market economy."
"If they hope to perhaps one day become members of the European Union, we can strengthen the democratic forces in the same way as was successful for other previous dictatorships in Southern Europe."
"We must also provide humanitarian aid to Serbia, insofar as this can be achieved without supporting the Milosevic regime, and we must urge municipal leaders, private associations and others to work with the democratic forces in both Kosovo and Serbia."
"With regard to the reconstruction agency, I would like to thank Mr Fischler for his frankness."
"I have seldom heard a Commissioner distance himself so clearly, and in such a well-reasoned manner, from a Council Resolution."
"The Council has entered into a shameful, face-saving compromise for those who promised to locate the centre in Thessaloniki."
"Now, the Headquarters will be in Thessaloniki, whilst those carrying out the work will be in Pristina."
"What on earth is that all about?"
"I ask all the Union's citizens to note that it is therefore not the Commission and the Parliament but their own governments which cannot grasp something as simple as the fact that the reconstruction work in Kosovo must be carried out in Kosovo and from Kosovo."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will vigorously contest the Resolution."
"It simply won't do."
"It must be amended."
"Applause"
"Mr President, in addition to Kosovo we are currently dealing with the Öçalan case as well, which we could in fact have handled better as Europeans if we hadn't made so many mistakes."
"Abdullah Öçalan was in Italy. Abdullah Öçalan was in Greece."
"My country, Germany, didn't want him."
"He was not supposed to remain in Italy and neither did he wish to."
"He was not permitted to be in Greece."
"Now he is in Turkey."
"Our collective failure in the Öçalan case makes it difficult for us to explain to many people in Turkey, irrespective as to whether they are Turks or Kurds, why we are against the death penalty in principle, and that, as Mr Swoboda has just said, we do not just oppose the death penalty on account of Mr Öçalan, but in principle."
"We challenge the Turkish Parliament to abolish the death penalty once and for all, because it is very much in our interest to welcome Turkey amongst us as a European country amongst equal partners."
"For this reason, we are convinced that to use the death penalty in the Öçalan case would not be the right answer to the long-standing Kurdish question and certainly cannot be an alternative solution."
"The Öçalan case could also be an opportunity for the people, for the Turks, for the Kurds in Anatolia and for the country, the Republic of Turkey, if the Turkish government and the Turkish Parliament only had the will for this to be so."
"In this respect, our resolution, which hopefully we will adopt tomorrow, is also an appeal to our Turkish colleagues in Ankara."
"Working together, we could ensure that one day it will not be necessary to conduct debates in this exalted Chamber on a democratic Republic of Turkey."
"I hope that together we will succeed in bringing this about."
"Mr President, between the devil of Milosevic and the deep blue sea of NATO: this is the feeling of most of the Serbian democratic opposition to Milosevic."
"Between the violence of Serbian paramilitary forces, the intimidation and violence of the KLA and NATO bombs falling from the sky: this is the sentiment of those Kosovo Albanian troops who chose to fight for their rights without resorting to violence."
"Against the NATO bombings and against nationalism and the homicidal and suicidal politics of Milosevic: this is the feeling of millions and millions of European men and women who hold the respect of human rights to be fundamental, wherever they have been violated: in Kosovo, Kurdistan, Palestine or Iran."
"These are the democratic, peaceful forces which should have been supported by the international community."
"Obviously, Milosevic had and has to be stopped, as the KLA had and has to be stopped, each responsible in different ways."
"Now, after NATO has destroyed and laid waste in the name of the defence of human rights, we must rebuild."
"We hope and wish to act in this Parliament so that construction takes place in such a way that human resources and the dignity of each side involved in the conflict are respected and valued during the process, and that colonisation by Europe or the United States World Bank is avoided."
"Kosovo must be reconstructed with its present and past inhabitants - both Albanian and Serbian - as protagonists. At the same time, Serbia and Montenegro and the infrastructures laid to waste and destroyed by air raids, must be rebuilt, and the damage to the environment investigated and remedied."
"The reconstruction of Kosovo must focus not only on the economy and trade, but also on the social, civil and democratic fabric."
"To achieve this, reconstruction must be carried out through the involvement of local communities, with exchanges between municipalities, universities, men and women of the European Union, Kosovo and the Republic of Yugoslavia."
"For the war to be truly erased from the picture, we must bring about reconciliation, create societies and build democracy. This is our challenge."
"Mr President, NATO intervened in Yugoslavia maintaining that they were defending Kosovans from Serb persecution, but no-one intervened to defend the Kurds from Turkish persecution."
"This is the crux of the Öçalan issue: the fact that laws still exist in too many national legal codes which punish as a crime the exercising of peoples' rights to self-determination in its extreme form of secession, even when non-violent, democratic means are employed."
"This is the meaning of Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which, as Mr Kaleli, the Turkish ambassador, stated right here in Strasbourg, follows the example of Article 241 of the Italian Penal Code, which was issued at the time of the Fascists and is still in force."
"Therefore, for as long as the European Parliament focuses its attention solely on whether Öçalan's death sentence will be enforced, without dealing with the question of peoples' rights to self-determination, it will scratch the surface of the problem but never manage to resolve it."
"Mr President, I should very much like to congratulate the President of the Finnish Council Presidency on the statement she has just made, particularly with regard to the comments she made on Kosovo and the Balkans."
"As the Parliament of a union of democratic constitutional States how can we do otherwise than to advocate a just peace and reconciliation in that region, and particularly in Kosovo."
"That is the heart of the matter and we have gained that insight particularly during the debates on and inquiry into the enlargement of the European Union, a democratic constitutional state, that is the heart of our movement, of our Union."
"I also think that we are justified in saying that everything depends on this, both the safety of the citizens and the development of the economy in the regions concerned."
"Nothing can be achieved when there is no constitutional state."
"I believe that we must also endeavour in earnest to see that particularly the other aspects associated with law and government in Kosovo are also given the attention they deserve."
"It is about the safety of the citizens, and particularly those who are returning."
"I should like in particular to draw your attention to the fact that there are perhaps 2000 or maybe more Kosovan prisoners who have been taken to Serbia by the withdrawing Serbian troops."
"I feel that there should be no question of us leaving them to their fate, but that we in this Parliament, the Council and the Commission should give our full attention to the situation."
"Equally, if we are to see justice done then we will have to ensure that full co-operation is given to the International Tribunal in The Hague in order to pursue the criminals that have wrought havoc in Kosovo, and not just in Kosovo but now at last in Bosnia too."
"Why have Karadzic and Mladic still not been arrested?"
"If that doesn't happen, Mr President, then we can more or less forget being able to achieve reconstruction in the region in any real sense."
"If we talk about a Stability Pact then it isn't about gagging those who are screaming for justice, but about a just peace, and that demands action and not keeping serious crimes under wraps."
"I think that we should also urge parties and groups in Kosovo towards political participation in government."
"That is why the resolution also states how important it is for Mr Rugova to be present in Kosovo."
"On the subject of which, it will not do for the most important figures not to be present at all times when they too have a role to play in the process of political reconstruction, also perhaps in co-operation with other parties that have emerged from the KLA."
"We are going to have to get everyone there wishing to take political responsibility used to the fact that they are responsible in an administrative sense, so that later on, when elections take place, the population will also be able to see whom it can trust."
"I think that the Stability Pact is of great importance for the wider region."
"For far too long now, we as the European Union have taken measures, for example against Serbia, measures which were necessary but which were taken at no cost whatsoever to ourselves."
"It was Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the surrounding regions, which paid the price."
"It is imperative that we offer financial compensation here, but by no means that alone."
"We will also have to create economic opportunities so that the European Union, by taking a more generous stance, is able to recompense the economic damage done in this area."
"I believe that the whole process of development, also in terms of society, is of great importance."
"The same applies to the insights we have gained from the enlargement process."
"Democracy can only grow if the population truly experiences it."
"I should like to close by quoting the Bishop of Kosovo: 'Nothing will ever become of Serbia unless it is transformed into a democratic constitutional state' ."
"The Parliament has never given up hoping for this."
"Mr President, Madam Foreign Minister, it is shameful and deeply regrettable that now, just as so many other international problems begin to approach a solution, it has not yet been possible to treat the Kurdish question in a civilised way."
"It continues to be a bleeding wound in our continent."
"Despite international protests, including from this Chamber, the Turkish government continues not merely to refuse to recognise but also to systematically violate the basic rights of the Kurdish people."
"Thousands of people have been killed and maimed in the long years of this conflict."
"The arrest and death sentence of the PKK leader Öçalan and the strong reactions caused by this have emphasised the need for a rapid solution."
"Both Turkey and the Kurds must demonstrate the will to sit down at the conference table and must, in a peaceful and democratic way, find a solution in order to end the suffering."
"Hopefully, the EU and the Finnish Presidency will be able to play an active role in this process."
"It goes without saying that all Members of the Parliament distance themselves from Öçalan's methods and actions."
"I, nevertheless, believe that we are all ready to declare that capital punishment will not bring the problem closer to a solution."
"Capital punishment can never be the answer to any problem."
"We Liberals will never cease to condemn this barbaric act wherever it may occur."
"In those countries which have applied for membership of the Union and where capital punishment still exists we are currently witnessing how it is being abolished."
"Since we hope that Turkey also will be welcomed to the European Union within the next few years, we appeal to Turkey not only to suspend Öçalan's death sentence, but also to work towards the general abolition of capital punishment in Turkey."
"To conclude, I would like to urge the Turkish government on behalf of the Liberal Group to go even further and to use this opportunity in order to take the initiative for negotiations and to implement those reforms which are necessary in order to guarantee the political, human and cultural rights of the Kurds."
"Mr President, Madam Minister, I agree with you that the death sentence imposed on the Kurdish leader Mr Öçalan constitutes a significant challenge for the international community, since it violates minimum requirements in terms of justice as well as respect for human rights."
"Our group condemned both the violation of human rights on the part of Belgrade and the war by NATO against Yugoslavia, as an illegal, unjust and immoral war."
"For this reason, despite the violation of human rights and the ethnic cleansing against the Kurds by the Turkish regime, our group does not request that the European Union nor NATO bomb Turkey."
"We are prudent and we are sensible."
"On the contrary, we believe that the two problems that you have mentioned - the death sentence and respect for the human rights of the Kurdish ethnic minority - require a peaceful, political solution."
"The death sentence against Mr Öçalan must be lifted."
"In addition, the European Union must demand that the Turkish government maintains a dialogue with the Kurds, a dialogue which resolves the Kurdish claims for autonomy within Turkey, as well as respect for democratic rights."
"In the same way that there are Autonomous Communities in Spain, Länder in Germany or Communities in Belgium, etc., there should also be a similar solution in Turkey for the Kurds, so that they may enjoy, in the same way that you have indicated in Finland, the ability to speak their own language, a free press reflecting their problems and a regional Parliament."
"To this end, we believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should react speedily and thoroughly, so that Turkey may embark on a democratic path and participate in this greater Europe which stretches from Portugal to Russia."
"Mr President, the programme of the Finnish Presidency, as presented, seems a very positive one, even though it does not differ greatly from the programmes of other Presidencies."
"The question is whether or not there is the basic political will throughout the whole of Europe to ensure its progress."
"Naturally, it is a welcomed sign that one of its long-term objectives is to advocate an Intergovernmental Conference which will deal with all institutional issues, in particular the hitherto largely unchecked issue of maintaining institutional balance."
"Of course, rebuilding Kosovo and intervention in the Western Balkans are matters requiring immediate attention but the question is: have we learned from past mistakes?"
"I have the feeling that European intervention and investment in the Balkans has remained very much on an individual rather than an institutional level."
"If we fail to recognise our past mistakes, I do not think that we will be able to proceed in the future and it must be said that, from now on, it all boils down to whether we can deal with issues relating to democratic progress without the use of weapons."
"That is what is important."
"As regards the issue of the reconstruction agency and of Thessaloniki, I would like to say that, whilst the solution may be a simple and straightforward one, let us not forget that we are primarily talking about European intervention."
"When there is a neighbouring country - and the same would be true, Mr President, if the situation were in Hungary, in which case the base for intervention would probably be in Austria - the question is not only whether the latter can and should benefit but also whether those neighbouring countries which border problematic areas really can share their experience about what is happening in the area."
"Therefore, this issue should be examined from a political, practical and commercial perspective."
"The security policy which the President referred to is, I believe, one of the most important issues but one which once again calls for political will."
"We have decided to narrow the gap between high-sounding proclamations and the practicalities of their implementation."
"Of course, all the organisations will work together and experience has it that wherever many international organisations are involved, we have had results."
"Issues concerning freedom and security are of utmost importance."
"Madam President, at the Tampere Council, we must decide to fight against drugs, organised crime and the threat to the safety of our citizens. We must also invest in the protection of citizens and not compromise with that 'dark side' which promotes closer links between terrorism, trade in arms and nuclear weapons and organised crime."
"Generally, our policy must not be one of compromise with the status quo, but of war against it."
"Only in this way can we ensure the protection of our citizens."
"The resignation of the Commission proves that we do not just need institutions - we also need the control mechanisms and the collective will to assign the European Commission the role it deserves. In addition, we have to fill the democratic void - not, as I see it, within the European Parliament but between the Council and the Commission."
"We must return to the fundamental principles which advocate real co-ordination between social and economic policies."
"We must intensify our social intervention, Madam President, since guidelines are not enough."
"I am afraid that the problems are getting out of hand and our way of tackling them is far too bureaucratic."
"I wish, of course, to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for its ambitious programme."
"We know that the Finnish Presidency will do all that it can."
"The issue is whether the whole Council is determined, and if we are all determined for that matter, to meet the challenges of these difficult times of heavy competition and internationalisation, and to respond to all the problems, including Third World development, where the support of Europe is vital. We also need to ensure the success of enlargement which can only be made possible, Madam President, if we increase our existing pool of resources."
"Mr President, today we have heard two Foreign Ministers speaking on the issue of Turkey."
"We heard Mr Fischer, the great general of the European Union, who is in command of the incursions in the Balkans, speaking about Turkey and the only thing he said was that in Helsinki Turkey should be upgraded to a preaccession state."
"What Mr Fischer seems to have forgotten, what he failed to recall, what just escaped him, was the Öçalan factor and, not least, the existence of 20 million Kurds in Turkey."
"The Finnish government minister made reference to the Öçalan case which was most encouraging."
"But we must not limit ourselves to a few simple references in our speeches."
"There are two very good reasons why the European Union should intervene proactively."
"The first is that we were under the impression that it was interested in human rights both within the Balkans and further afield."
"So, there are 2 million Kosovars, fine - but what about the 30 million or so Kurds?"
"The second reason is that the European Union is guilty of not granting asylum to Öçalan."
"In this case, we need actual intervention, not words."
"I would like to end, Mr President, with a question to the President-in-Office of the Council of Foreign Ministers: If Turkey cannot give assurances for Öçalan's life and if Turkey does not take steps to ensure the political rights of the Kurds, then does the Finnish Presidency believe that Turkey should proceed to the preaccession stage in Helsinki?"
"I would like an answer from the Minister."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate Finland on the Presidency and I should also like to compliment the Finnish government on the sound and refreshing manner in which it is approaching this task."
"I shall not talk about Kosovo, for my colleagues Doris Pack and Arie Oostlander have already done that."
"I want to say something about the rest of your programme, because there are a number of interesting points there too."
"Firstly, the problematic area relating to asylum seekers."
"I understand that you are to organise a special summit on this subject."
"For many years now, there have been calls for effective policies at the European level in this area and we too advocate improved harmonisation of our legislation in this field, both in terms of admission procedures and reception facilities."
"We advocate improved distribution of asylum seekers across the European Member States so that it is not a case of a few Member States, and there are four or five of them, receiving the vast majority of asylum seekers and the others doing far too little."
"If you see an opportunity to achieve something in this respect then I think you will have achieved something very worthwhile for Europe."
"A second point on your agenda is a transparent Europe free of fraud."
"In my country, the Netherlands, we have a law on openness in government with maximum transparency and Finland has the same tradition."
"I understand that a number of international researchers have recently produced an excellent proposal relating to openness of government and transparency for the European Union."
"I shall see that you receive this proposal."
"It is a full regulation with explanatory notes, etc. I hope that we shall at last have the opportunity to implement something of this kind."
"Then I saw to my surprise that you have also put the subject of taxation high on your agenda."
"That is interesting, particularly with there being a new Commissioner from the Netherlands in that field."
"I should like to recommend that you concentrate above all on taxation pertaining to trade and industry, for there is a great deal that needs to be brought into line there."
"But I should also like to ask you to give attention to one particular area of income tax and that is the equal treatment of men and women."
"The Parliament has been asking for this for more than ten years."
"If you could make a first move in this respect and receive support from Mr Bolkestein then you will also be doing something very positive for Europe."
"To conclude, Mr President, the subject of human rights."
"I have seen that you wish to undertake a number of endeavours in this field too."
"Firstly, in relation to Yugoslavia."
"I sincerely hope, and concur with Doris Pack and Arie Oostlander in this respect, that you take the opportunity to exert such pressure on Yugoslavia that those who have violated human rights there are indeed handed over to the Tribunal in the Hague."
"I also hope that you can prevent the death penalty from being carried out in Turkey for I believe that would be a disgrace for Europe."
"Lastly, a subject I am particularly keen for you to give a great deal of attention to is Burma."
"I hear that the Finnish Presidency has already organised a visit to Burma."
"Earlier this week, a request was made for attention to be given to the subject."
"I belong to the international committee that supports Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"I hope to travel to Thailand and Burma in three weeks' time and to speak to all parties concerned."
"I sincerely hope that you will take the opportunity to at last bring about progress where Burma is concerned."
"I think that you would receive a great deal of support from this Parliament."
"I think that you would then have performed a valuable task for democracy in the ASEAN countries."
"I wish you a great deal of luck and success."
"It is your first Presidency but it appears to me that you really are going to do it well."
"Mr President, although our hemicycle is largely empty, I do not want to miss this opportunity, from the benches of this Assembly, to greet and wish the best of luck to my former colleague, Tarya Halonen."
"There is a new Presidency, which does not resemble the last one very much, but shouldn't we point out some similarities nonetheless?"
"The German Presidency was concerned with putting together its key work, Agenda 2000, and faced two major crises, that of the Commission, and the much more serious one of the war in Kosovo."
"The Finnish Presidency has been entrusted by the European Council with a number of important projects which could be grouped together under the heading 'Preparation for Europe's Future' ."
"Indeed, if it manages to bring to a successful conclusion the Tampere Extraordinary Summit, which concerns the security of Europe's citizens, the preparation of a European defence system, through the integration of the WEU with the European Union, the launch of a new round of enlargement in December, and finally, the implementation of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the Finnish Presidency will have been a great Presidency of transition for the 21st century."
"Finland, thanks to the commitment and tenacity of its President, Martti Ahtisaari, caused a shift in the mind set in Kosovo from one of war to one of peace."
"Together with the German Presidency, the Finnish President clearly articulated Europe's voice at the opportune moment."
"In Kosovo, and throughout the region devastated by war, almost everything remains to be done: to guarantee an orderly return of the refugees, to build democratic institutions, to set up infrastructures, to reconstruct the economy and make it work."
"Well, in order to overcome all of these challenges, the international community, particularly Europe, will have to commit a huge amount of human and financial resources."
"Are we ready for that?"
"The necessary funds have not, of course, been provided for in the financial projections."
"The sums of money which have been announced seem largely insufficient, and the ECO/FIN Council, as it has done many times before, is already questioning formal decisions taken elsewhere."
"If I have one piece of advice to offer you today, Mrs Halonen, one suggestion to make, it is that you should ensure that these words are followed up with action."
"The great European plan for definitive peacemaking in the Balkans must not fall victim to complicated and penny-pinching calculations."
"Mr President, Kosovo is a small economy."
"The European Union could subsidise Kosovo for ever and hardly notice it."
"But surely this is not an acceptable solution."
"As soon as possible, we must aim to have Kosovo stand on its own economic feet."
"That inevitably means external trade."
"However, there is a problem in redeveloping Kosovo's trade."
"Its biggest trading partner in the past and almost certainly in the future must be its neighbour immediately to the north, Serbia proper."
"Not only that but its trade routes to much of the rest of Europe past through Serbia."
"And yet Serbia is a pariah, embargoed, its infrastructure largely destroyed, its economy shattered."
"Here we have a conundrum: how do we get Kosovo to stand on its own feet unless we can rehabilitate Serbia also?"
"The current international community's set purpose is that Milosevic and his regime must be got rid of and then everything is possible."
"Until he goes, not a penny - well, we heard earlier, hardly a penny."
"But what if Milosevic does not go?"
"Let us hope that he does, but if he does not, have we begun to estimate the cost of restoring Serbia's infrastructure and productive economy?"
"Remember, Serbia was a sizeable, developed industrial economy, a vital trading partner and transport corridor for Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Greece, as well as Kosovo and all the former Yugoslav Republics."
"So my question to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission is this: how far have you thought through the political steps, the economic and financial commitments that are needed to bring about a free and democratic Serbia and reintegrate a free and democratic Serbia into the European economy and body politic?"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur for the rules governing Members of Parliament, I would like to make a couple of observations."
"In December 1998, the European Parliament adopted a statute with a qualified majority, a decision which was confirmed in May of this year by an overwhelming majority."
"We therefore have a statute, all that is now required is the approval of the Council."
"It is not enough that the Council submits an alternative draft."
"That is no solution."
"I would like to remind you that the European Commission has unequivocally approved the statute of the European Parliament."
"Permit me to make a few observations regarding the principles which will govern our actions."
"One thing is for sure; this statute will not be drawn up by the press, be it the Swedish press, the British press, the Dutch press or that of any other country."
"Not even the highly regarded French daily Libération will write this statute, nor shall we allow ourselves to be governed by a statute produced by civil servants."
"We are not children who can be taken to task; we shall not be harassed by civil servants."
"Therefore, I would recommend that the Finnish Presidency gently shelves the Council document."
"We will not place ourselves in the Babylonian Captivity of the Council."
"We will preserve the Parliament's autonomy and reject any type of guardianship over the Parliament."
"Applause"
"We shall make constructive proposals to the Finnish Presidency."
"I look forward to initial talks taking place at the beginning of September."
"My request to the Finnish Presidency is that the talks, which will be necessary, be conducted at the highest possible political level."
"In this way, I believe the success we are after will be achieved as soon as possible."
"Mr President, we are pinning high hopes on the Finnish Presidency."
"We are also pinning our hopes on the Finnish Presidency as far as the European Parliament's involvement in drawing up the catalogue of fundamental rights is concerned."
"The Council cannot seriously be considering the option that only two members of Parliament collaborate on this catalogue of fundamental rights."
"Without a minimum of 15 delegates, an imbalance will exist between the European Parliament and the national Members of Parliament, where such a balance is required."
"Applause"
"Madam Minister, since 11 February, when our Parliament reacted to the first news of the massacres in Kosovo, it has ceaselessly denounced the atrocities committed in that province, caught up again in that hellish spiral of violence and fear which has caused so much suffering through the systematic violation of a human being's most basic rights, one of the first of which is that of being able to stay in the place where one was born, and to retain the culture one has grown up with."
"The dynamic reaction of the Union's governments has been supported by the large majority of European citizens."
"Public opinion can be congratulated for the fact that, for the first time in centuries, a war has been fought, not in the defence of national or private interests, but in order that what is right should triumph."
"If many of us feared seven years ago, that Europe had been killed in Sarajevo, our President is all the more right when he says this morning that a new Europe should be born in Pristina."
"However, the political aim, which caused us to resort to force, is still far from being achieved."
"Peace needs to be rebuilt there."
"Allied soldiers, with their Russian partners, are on the ground to calm people's fears and in time, to allow reconciliation to take place."
"They will only be effective if the whole of Europe, and its Parliamentary representatives at the highest level are up to the task of taking over from them."
"Nicole Fontaine committed herself this morning to contributing personally to this undertaking."
"I think that I am speaking on behalf of most of this Assembly when I say that we approve of this initiative, and that many of us would like to join her in this."
"It has been said that Parliament should provide itself with the means for this action through its budgetary powers."
"This is the message that several of us were expecting, because we were worried to discover the absence of any specific funds and feared that in these circumstances we might be tempted to rob Peter to pay PauI by sacrificing steps which were considered essential at the time the budget was set."
"I am therefore repeating the request that our colleague, Mr Poos, has just made."
"We know that the healthy management of the budget during the last Parliamentary term has left us with sufficient means to deal with Kosovo's immediate needs."
"We fervently hope that this will be done."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, repairing the dramatic material and, above all, moral consequences of the Kosovo drama, collaborating with the International Criminal Court so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished, laying down the foundations for the economic development of the area so as to promote reconciliation between the Kosovan Albanian and Serbian populations, must be matters of the utmost priority for the European Union."
"Another priority must be the promotion of enlargement in order to safeguard the peace and political stability of the continent."
"To this end I have heard, Madam President, with satisfaction, that both issues are political priorities of the Presidency, together with the creation of a catalogue of human rights."
"I was also satisfied to hear, passing on to other matters, although no less important, of its concern about the creation of jobs and improvements in the well-being of our citizens."
"In the global world of today, job-creation measures, in order to be genuinely effective, must be adopted within a global framework."
"Hence the need for this Presidency to pay particular attention also to the preparation of the next Millennium round."
"Not only to continue with the deregulation of world trade, but also to provide instruments with which to fight fraud and dishonest commercial practices and to guarantee reciprocal compliance with the regulations governing international trade to achieve the simplification and generalisation of customs procedures under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, in order, in a word, that the opening up of markets may constitute a genuine opportunity which will create jobs and contribute to the well-being of the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, most of the contributions in this debate have been about the big global issues that appear on our television sets. I want to raise something with the Presidency which was in the small print of her remarks."
"It is something which affects millions of our fellow citizens in Europe, not once in a while, but every day of every year, and that is mental illness."
"I was so pleased when the Finnish Government decided to make mental health promotion one of their priorities for their presidency. That is welcome."
"It is important because as the World Bank showed, this is the fastest growing area of health burden throughout the world."
"It is important because as the United Nations has declared, it is to be one of the priorities for the UN for the next fifty years, as declared by Boutros-Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General."
"It is important because, as the Harvard World Bank report showed, mental disorder accounts for some 10.5 % of the global health burden and that is forecast to rise to 15 % by the year 2020."
"It is important because five of the ten leading causes of disability are psychiatric, with the first of those, unipolar depression, accounting for some 10 % of life with disability."
"It is important because psychiatric and neurological conditions cause 28 % of lives with disability."
"It is important because suicide is the tenth most important cause of death in the world - in the United Kingdom it is the ninth, ahead of road accidents."
"It is important because surveys show that one in three people visiting their doctors have a mental health problem but only one in six are diagnosed as such."
"It is important because one in seven of us have a mental health problem at any one time."
"One in three of us will during our lifetime."
"It is not a forgettable minority."
"Nothing is more important among all the Finnish pledges than their pledge to take up the cause of people and their families who suffer not just an illness or a disability but disadvantage and stigma too."
"We need to encourage good mental health."
"We need to help prevent illness and we need to educate peoples and governments in Europe that mental illness is not to be feared, not to be ignored."
"It can be cured, it can be treated and millions of our fellow citizens can lead full and fulfilled lives if we..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"I would also like to commend the Finnish Presidency on another of their initiatives which is the attention they are giving to the development of the information society."
"This issue is going to affect the lives of every citizen in the European Union."
"We have crucial decisions to make in the Union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years."
"I am very much hoping that the Finnish Presidency will give us the right framework within which those decisions will be taken."
"I would just like to set out some pointers for that."
"The first pointer is that it is quite clear that technology runs ahead of politicians."
"I cannot resist pointing out, Mr President, that we do not yet have computers or Internet access in this splendid building."
"Indeed, I suspect that many of our colleagues are not as literate in technology as they should be, but that technology is going to have a huge effect on opening up the single market and we must make sure, first of all, that legislation does not restrict the ability of people to innovate and introduce changes and new forms of electronic commerce."
"Secondly, we must ensure that consumers powerfully use this technology."
"The information society is going to be one in which consumers have tremendous power to shop all over the world and particularly within the boundaries of the single market."
"I have to say that over the next five years the power of electronic commerce will act more quickly to create the single market than any amount of harmonising legislation that we might care to introduce in this Chamber or anywhere else."
"It will be crucial in creating the single market. Finally, of course, it will create jobs."
"Electronic commerce is giving small entrepreneurs access to global markets cheaply, quickly and effectively."
"It is encouraging the development of new forms of small business and we must continue to allow those new businesses to grow."
"And so, in conclusion, Mr President, Finland with its great strength in computers and communications is ideally placed to lead us."
"There are three words I would leave you with if I may - openness, flexibility and innovation."
"- (FI) Mr President, time and again, we will return to those issues that have been raised here in these two hours or so."
"I apologise sincerely for not being able to respond to all the excellent, well-considered and immensely important speeches that we have heard here today."
"I have solved the time problem to some extent by addressing some of the issues that have been touched on by the majority of members in my response."
"Firstly, the situation in the Balkans. In September, when I come to the committee meeting here I shall certainly be once more engaged in the same discussion."
"However, I would like to answer two questions."
"Firstly, the position on the Commission's agency in Thessaloniki, which has been expressed here, comes as no surprise."
"The Commission expressed the same position in the General Affairs Council."
"The General Affairs Council made a unanimous decision, which you are aware of, and which I mentioned in my speech."
"We begin from the position that the European Union will approach the issue of stability in the Balkans on a regional basis."
"Accordingly, the headquarters will be in Thessaloniki."
"However, the centre of operations, the first of such, will be in Pristina and there will be more of them in other regions as and when facilities improve."
"I sincerely hope that we, the Commission and you yourselves will achieve consensus on this matter."
"As far as I am aware, we have a tradition that when the Heads of our Governments and States come to a decision on an issue at a summit, be it a regular or extraordinary meeting, we strive in the General Affairs Council to find a way of implementing that decision."
"This is what was done in the case of the Thessaloniki office as well as with regard to the broader plan and Hombach."
"As the country holding the Presidency, we shall strive to implement, as I said, all those decisions we need in respect of Sarajevo and the future."
"In every respect I agree that we have to avoid excessive bureaucracy. That is not the right way to provide employment for the citizens of the European Union."
"But we do need a sufficient number of skilled officials to take care of the operation."
"As for the other matters, I would just like to say briefly that despite all the help we shall give the region, ultimately the responsibility obviously lies with the people there themselves."
"We will only be providing them with support."
"Serbia is a part of the Balkans."
"For this reason, we have looked at great length into ways of helping Serbia to achieve democracy as quickly as possible."
"One condition of the return to democracy is freedom of opinion."
"In this I agree with what has been said here regarding the safety of those who are speaking for freedom of opinion and also the proposal that we should create, through various means, a structure to support real freedom of opinion for this country."
"The war is behind us, but the peace has to be built."
"For this, we shall also need peacekeeping forces."
"Finland is not a Member State of NATO, though you might perhaps have formed the opinion she was, from some of the speeches we have heard."
"But Finland respects the choice of those eleven EU Member States who do belong to NATO."
"Finland, which has a population of five million, is making its contribution by sending eight hundred peacekeepers to Kosovo."
"You may compare that figure in terms of the population of your own country."
"In my opinion, we should all share in the task of ensuring that the Balkan region is secure."
"But as I said before, for this we need a non-military option in addition to the military one."
"In this connection, I would like to acknowledge the role played by Denmark for being the first country to allude clearly to this issue in the resolution passed at the Cologne Council meeting."
"Denmark was the country to make the proposal, but Finland is the country which, as holder of the Presidency, will promote this worthy initiative as vigorously as possible in co-operation with others."
"I would also like to mention that the International War Crimes Tribunal is, in our opinion, extremely important, and the tribunal dealing with war crimes in Yugoslavia is a special partner in co-operation for us."
"We have been co-operating together in Kosovo ever since the report was put together on the mass killings at Racak, when the expert opinion of Finnish coroners was used."
"We believe this policy is a coherent one."
"Next, I will briefly mention the Tampere Summit again."
"We will strive to strike a balance, a very delicate balance, between human rights and the question of security."
"The Tampere meeting will be preceded by an independent meeting of non-Governmental organisations, and we, for our part, wish to offer them our support, while obviously respecting their independent status."
"The European Union must not be allowed to become a fortress: it must be both strong and open at the same time."
"This is the principle upon which we will operate, with respect to the Tampere Summit also."
"The rights of minorities are a weak area in established democracies also, whatever aspect of minorities they are concerned with."
"I wish to call attention to the fact that there is often room for improvement in all our countries when it comes to the status of ethnic minorities."
"The Roma are a European minority with no host country to speak up for them when their rights are being violated."
"I have been in touch with the foreign ministry in Slovakia, one of the applicant countries, and we have begun talks on how the issue may be solved from their point of view."
"But there is no cause for complacency: the status of the Romain Europe is by no means good."
"In addition, the situation regarding the rights of minorities in Turkey has been mentioned here."
"I spoke of it in my speech, and the Kurdish question will most certainly be a subject for debate here very often in the future, when we shall strive to find a way to improve the situation."
"As for enlargement, we shall accept with seriousness the challenge this presents while Finland holds the Presidency."
"As I must respect the order of business I cannot go into this question in any great detail now as it would take up too much time. But I would like to assure you of two things."
"We shall treat the applicant countries as impartially as possible, on the basis of the Commission's reports, and we shall try to make our decisions wisely so that the applicant countries will feel they have made progress according to their individual merits, believing the process to be fair, efficiently undertaken and conducive to the common good."
"For this reason, we Finns have never made promises in connection with timetables any more than we have regarding other matters."
"However, in our opinion, enlargement is a special issue, and we will do everything within our power in the area of institutional reform to move it along."
"Institutional reforms must be introduced in such a way that the Union can live with them even when the number of Member States has exceeded twenty."
"Finally, I have to commend the many here who have spoken of a socially and ecologically strong Europe."
"That gives me hope."
"I mentioned it today to a group representing young people in Europe, who met me, as a representative of the European Union, at a writing competition award ceremony."
"I assured them that we would be giving consideration to the issue of youth, although there is no longer any special portfolio attached to this issue."
"Issues of youth can be successfully dealt with by means of mainstreaming, just as effectively as, for example, issues of gender equality, aged people, as has been touched upon here, and other such matters."
"I believe that we have to discuss the matter again with the new Commission, and also with you here in the European Parliament."
"I have tried to be as brief as possible to keep to the schedule, and in keeping with the spirit of the new, efficient European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m."
"Position of Mr Bangemann"
"The next item on the agenda concerns the statements by the Council and the Commission on the appointment of Martin Bangemann to a post in the private sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right at the start, I would also like to congratulate you on your election to this Parliament."
"I wish you all every success in the discharge of your demanding duties."
"As a representative of the country that now holds the Presidency, I shall be personally present at the part-session in September."
"I really appreciate having the opportunity to work together with you all."
"In a letter from him dated 9 June, Mr Bangemann, then Member of the Commission, informed the then President of the Commission, Gerhard Schröder, of his intention to enter the service of a private telecommunications company, the Spanish firm Telefónica ."
"The Council immediately looked into the matter, deciding on 9 July to take the case to the European Court of Justice, on the basis of Article 213 (2(3)) of the EC Treaty and the regulations contained in the ECSC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty."
"Under the EC Treaty, Members of the Commission must make a solemn declaration, when commencing their duties, that they will honour their obligations of membership, during their term of office and after it has ended, and behave with integrity and discretion, in the acceptance, after their term of office has ended, of certain appointments or benefits."
"In the view of the Council, Mr Bangemann, who has, since 1992, been the Commission Member expressly responsible for telecommunications, was in breach of the regulations."
"The Council believes he was under an obligation to decline Telefónica's offer."
"The Court will decide whether the Member of the Commission was in breach of the EC Treaty or not."
"While handling the Bangemann case, the Council noticed with satisfaction how swiftly the future President of the Commission was to act after the case was brought."
"It is the common objective of the Council, the future President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, and all the candidates for membership of the Commission to prevent the repetition in future of similar conflicts of interest, such as that which occurred in the Bangemann case."
"Professor Prodi, in his own programme of reforms for the Commission, has stressed the need for transparency, efficiency and accountability."
"When he spoke earlier today here in the European Parliament, he told us what demands he would be making in practice on the Members of the new Commission."
"For example, there will be clear rules for new Members regarding what sort of posts would be appropriate for them to take up on departure from the Commission."
"Members of the Commission must also, if requested, allow an independent ethics committee to investigate any future post up to a year after they have ceased to hold office, to ensure the new job is compatible in its nature with the work of the Commission."
"The Council and its President warmly support the rules on behaviour that Romano Prodi has given notice of, and they are a good start on the road to comprehensive reforms."
"Besides the Members of the Commission, all others in the service of the institutions of the Union must be able to demonstrate that they are adhering to the principle of transparency and complying with commonly accepted rules of behaviour."
"I am happy to note that the Commission has acted in accordance with the wishes of both the Council and Parliament and begun preparations to alter rules relating to personnel policy."
"We need precise rules."
"Only credible reforms will bring the Commission and the Union as a whole closer to the public and increase the confidence of our citizens in the Union and its institutions."
"Mr President, as Finland is bilingual, I will conclude my contribution in Swedish."
"As President of the European Union, Finland will place great emphasis on openness, efficiency and accountability."
"The reform process has been initiated in all institutions, which is due, amongst others, to the European Parliament, which on various occasions has drawn attention to these problems."
"On the other hand, there is still a lot to be done."
"I hope that all EU institutions take responsibility by showing the necessary readiness to undergo reform in this work."
"Can I join Mr Sasi in congratulating Members of the House on the election that they achieved to this Parliament and particularly congratulate, as Mr Sasi did, the new Members of the House?"
"I hope that they will find their tasks and their career here are both fascinating and fulfilling in the service of the people who have elected them."
"The resolution for debate relates to specific events and to principles concerning the conduct of Commissioners."
"I will therefore respond on behalf of the Commission by reporting briefly on those events and on the Commission's reaction to them."
"On 29 June 1999, the President of the Commission, Mr Santer was made aware of the decision of Mr Bangemann to depart from the Commission in order to take up a private sector appointment two days later on 1 July 1999."
"Mr Santer wrote to Mr Bangemann on 30 June 1999 informing him that he would be put on functional leave and that his responsibilities would be transferred to a colleague in the Commission."
"In that letter, Mr Santer stipulated that Mr Bangemann could not commence his new duties and his new activities until the procedure set out in Article 215 of the Treaty had been completed and he also said that he would submit to the College the question of the compatibility of that planned appointment with Article 213 of the Treaty."
"On 1 July 1999, the Commission discussed the matter before beginning its formal scheduled meeting."
"Mr Bangemann attended those proceedings and stated that he had not acted and would not act in ways that breached Article 213."
"The Commission formally took note of those statements from Mr Bangemann."
"The House will be familiar with Article 213 which, amongst other things, requires Members of the Commission in particular 'to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments'."
"All Commissioners, Mr President, appear before the Court of Justice to swear an oath to that effect on taking up office."
"At the meeting held on 1 July 1999, Commissioners expressed their views to Mr Bangemann and he then withdrew from the room."
"Commissioners subsequently considered the issues raised by these events and their conclusions are set out in a statement which was published on 1 July 1999 and extensively reported."
"On 9 July 1999, as the House will have heard from Mr Sasi, the Council decided to refer this case to the Court of Justice under Article 213 of the Treaty and, following that decision, it is now for the Court to pronounce on the matters."
"Honourable Members will understand that the case is therefore now sub judice and the Commission consequently has to abstain from public comment on it."
"As a general indication of the view of the Commission on the issues posed by the motion before the House, I refer Honourable Members to the concluding paragraph of the Commission's statement of 1 July 1999 which expressed the view 'that it would be advisable for the future to clarify the implementation of Article 213 regarding Commission members' activities after they have ceased to hold office'."
"The Commission consequently notes that on 17 July 1999 the President and Commission-designate agreed upon and published a draft Code of Conduct for Commissioners."
"As the House will have seen from press reports, that document specifies clear compulsory requirements for future Commissioners who intend to engage in any occupation during the year after they leave office to inform the Commission of their intentions in good time."
"It further provides for a procedure of examination and decision-making that includes the specific power of the Commission to refer the matter to an ethics committee when a Commissioner's planned occupation is related to his or her portfolio."
"The House may also wish to know that, in the course of discussions this month, Members of the existing Commission who have always fully respected their solemn undertaking to meet the obligations of integrity and discretion have readily and voluntarily reaffirmed that commitment."
"To them, as to me of course, it is axiomatic."
"The House will be aware that the composite version of the resolution for debate before this Parliament today was produced this morning in keeping with usual practice."
"The Commission has therefore had no opportunity to discuss the specific call in the motion for resolution for current Commissioners to respect voluntarily the new Code of Conduct."
"I have, however, consulted the acting President, Mr Marín, and can inform the House that this issue will receive the attention of the Commission at its meeting next week."
"I have sought to respond to the motion for debate as fully as possible whilst respecting the fact that the case which prompted the question is now sub judice ."
"I know that the House will share my awareness of the fact that this debate and my later response to it will need to take account of that obvious legal consideration."
"Mr President, it is clear that in our European Union today changes are underway, particularly in the Commission, as a result of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget and then the consequent and ultimate mass resignation of the Commission."
"Everything in that particular story showed where codes of conduct had begun to be discussed and debated."
"Indeed the acting President, Mr Santer, had put out a Code of Conduct for Commissioners and officials but it seemed it did not go far enough."
"Everything in the story was too little, too late."
"From the comments of Commissioner Kinnock, the Commission might examine this tomorrow or next week. It is always in the same kind of vein."
"This applies also to the question of a Code of Conduct for high level officials because in the Commission over the last few years there has indeed been lax management in internal organisation as was underlined by the Wise Men's report."
"This is why we were calling earlier today for the second part of that report to be available to us so we have as much information available to us when we come to the hearings in early September for the incoming Commission."
"One simple example which I can give the House of the internal games which were played by the heads of cabinets - not the Commissioners - on one particular staffing matter goes to show how these things were handled."
"ESPRIT, an important information technology programme designated under Mr Bangemann at the beginning of the Commission as it was in early 1995, was transferred from originally DG XIII which was under Mrs Cresson to Mr Bangemann."
"Lo and behold, in 1998, this was then shifted back to Mrs Cresson without any formal Commission decision - it was just decided as a game between the cabinets."
"How much time, energy and problems were caused for staff in the running of a programme simply because the Commissioners did a deal between themselves which was not transparent, not effective and certainly unaccountable to us here in the European Parliament."
"I come to this particular case of Mr Bangemann. It is to us extraordinary insensitivity at this particular time, in this current climate, when you have an acting Commission, that someone can, in that particular state of office simply say two days later he wants to go and work for a private company which is one of the major operators in the field for which he is responsible in telecommunications."
"It could be argued that Mr Bangemann is not doing anything strictly wrong because there was not an enforceable Code of Conduct."
"But the Statute is very generous to Commissioners."
"Is not 80 % of salary for five years enough to satisfy someone's need for financial back-up and to make sure that they do not need the extra finance which a company like Telefónica is giving?"
"We unanimously support in our group the Council's decision for this case to go to the Court of Justice."
"We are particularly hopeful that they will look at the suspension of pension rights for the Commissioner in this instance, particularly while he is engaged in a private company."
"What it leaves for us is a reflection of the disregard of certain members of the outgoing Commission for the need to have a rigorous approach to high standards in public life."
"We therefore welcome the statement by the incoming President, Mr Prodi, that there will now be codes of conduct applied rigorously, but we have heard this before. This is what worries us."
"We want to be able to see these codes of conduct effectively applied so as to make sure not only that the people at the top accept political responsibility, but also that we have high quality management right the way down so that people can be appointed for what they know rather than who they know."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council on his first appearance, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I asked the question on the Bangemann case because I thought it raised a matter of great topical importance, that of the ethical behaviour of public officials."
"We are not only judging a Commissioner whose behaviour has been unacceptable. We are talking about a former Member of this Parliament, a distinguished parliamentarian who was even a leader of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, a former German Minister for the Economy and a Commissioner with a long record of service."
"We must start with the freedom of people and the fact that we are all in public service voluntarily, and the ex-Commissioner cannot claim ignorance of this."
"I welcome the Council's decision on this case - and I believe it has been a quick one - as well as the Commission's explanations with regard to its actions in this case, which have been enormously speedy."
"It is clear - while I respect the fact that it is still sub judice - that the acceptance of the post offered to him by Telefónica represents an obvious conflict of interests."
"We simply have to remember the role played by Mr Bangemann in the Commission's revised proposal on royalties and the information society, the pressure applied by Telefónica to introduce changes to the proposed Directive previously rejected by Parliament, Telefónica 's active policy with regard to penetrating the media, and also in relation to charges."
"And I could mention other cases, such as the case of the Internet."
"Mr President, I know from my own experience what the Telefónica company represents in Spain."
"I was Minister in this area during the 80s and I can tell you that in Spain it is more significant than the Society of Jesus."
"Telefónica has been a monopoly from the beginning and has been privatised incredibly quickly, it has been put into the hands of an ex-college associate of the present Spanish Prime Minister, the whole privatisation having been highly questionable."
"But it still holds a dominant position in the Spanish market-place and an international profile, which means that this is not a purely Spanish matter."
"What is there at the moment to prevent Mr Bangemann from using any confidential or strategically sensitive information about Telefónica 's competitors that he has obtained through his status as Commissioner?"
"There is no answer to this question and it is truly serious."
"I therefore believe that we should draw up codes of conduct which include standards of political decency applicable in all of our countries."
"At the moment, as we have been reminded, the Commissioners now have a suspension of three years to rebuild their professional life without having to sell themselves to the highest bidder."
"Allow me, Mr President, to conclude with something which relates to the end of the last legislature and the beginning of this one."
"In the Committee on Budgetary Control, certain examples of the behaviour of the ex-Commissioner were presented."
"However, these were not used, even in the light of the report of the Committee of Experts, an inquisitorial campaign against certain Commissioners was preferred - and in one case I would say there was sexual discrimination because the Commissioner was a woman."
"Since highly critical things have been said here in this Chamber, who is going to restore the honour of those Commissioners?"
"In any event, I believe that, in view of the locations we have for this Parliament and in the Union, this is an experience which must not be repeated because, in the end, black sheep are found in unexpected places."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be making my first intervention under your Presidency."
"Mr President, on 10 June, all Europeans suffered an electoral defeat."
"By not voting, many people made it clear that they no longer have any faith in Europe as it now is."
"That is why it is an absolute priority for our group to restore our citizens' faith in Europe so that we are able to meet the challenges of the coming five years with credibility."
"For the same reason, my group finds it incomprehensible that Commissioner Bangemann should choose precisely this moment to take an extremely dubious step in his career."
"Unfortunately, this affair confirms the view that nothing will ever change in Europe."
"Whereas the whistleblowing official Paul van Buitenen is still waiting for his reputation to be rehabilitated, those at the top, such as Mr Bangemann, are evidently able to go about their affairs in the usual way."
"We democrats seek to restore the people's faith in Europe, which is no small challenge."
"That is why every European slip-up must be tackled, irrespective of who is responsible for it."
"Consequently, my group heartily endorses the fact that the Council intends to present this case to the Court of Justice."
"However, it would have been more fitting if the President of the European Commission had taken this step himself."
"This would have signalled an ability to put its own house in order, which would have been most welcome in view of recent events."
"Mr President, esteemed colleagues, I could make things easy for myself and side with the previous speakers."
"They are certainly right when they say that Mr Martin Bangemann, in his own inimitable manner, has succeeded in permanently damaging not only the reputation of the Commission and the Parliament but also the European ideal itself."
"The electorate, the citizens out there in our countries, cannot always clearly distinguish between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council."
"They frequently get the institutions mixed up and we now have a situation where people at home refer to us as 'you over there, you in Brussels who are always corrupt, lining your own pockets and so on' ."
"We now have to painstakingly rebuild, together with the new Commission, that which Mr Bangemann destroyed."
"What does this tell us about Mr Bangemann when he acts in such a manner?"
"It is imperative that the courts deal with this matter since, casting our minds back to the case of Ignacio Lopez at Volkswagen, this sort of insider knowledge is actually tantamount to a criminal act when an individual gains employment in another area so soon afterwards."
"This should also be borne in mind."
"This Mr Bangemann, however, was also sent here on two occasions by Kohl's government."
"In this regard, I would like to clear up the myth once and for all that the opposition in Germany also always provides a Commissioner."
"That was the case the first time with Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and only then."
"I would like to ask Mr Poettering, who of course is no longer here: Where was his Party when it came to controlling their own Commissioner?"
"He was hardly acceptable as Minister for Industry and Commerce."
"He has again been kicked out by the Liberal faction in the European Parliament."
"As Commissioner, he was very often controversial."
"Remember the business with the yacht."
"This is also relevant here."
"I welcome enormously the fact that the new President of the Commission, together with his new Commission, which we still have to approve, wishes to introduce different rules to the game."
"Of course, simply signing a Code of Conduct won't make any difference. We also have to lay down legally binding and documented sanctions in this regard."
"We can not accept it when someone says: 'Well, my reputation may have been called into question but, in any case, I am free to do what I like once my time in office is up' ."
"In this regard, it is down to us, among others, in our positions as Members of Parliament, to fight for clear statutes and rules of the game, and to elaborate on these, since no one benefits from simply throwing stones at others whilst overlooking the fact that we ourselves sometimes sit in glass houses."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bangemann's decision to accept a position on the board of directors of Telefónica represents an unacceptable breach of political ethics."
"Such behaviour endangers the reputation of European institutions and engenders reservations on the part of citizens towards the European Union."
"This makes it all the more pressing to take effective measures in the fight against corruption and to introduce clear and open regulations for the proper application of Article 213 of the Treaty."
"Legally binding regulations must be created, similar to those in private industry, which contain a competition clause or a competition restraint clause in employment contracts."
"Naturally, Mr Bangemann has to take personal responsibility for his actions, but a policy geared towards economic interests as a matter of priority and, unfortunately, towards the business management interests of large concerns, also as a matter of priority, poses the inevitable risk that their leading representatives, as those putting this policy into practise, adopt the same attitude, thereby devoting themselves to maximising their personal profit, in violation of every moral code."
"In order that an example can be made of Mr Bangemann for future generations as an unfortunate, one-off practitioner of amoral behaviour, the case against the former leader of the FDP, the party which, typically enough, carries the nickname in Germany 'Party of the Self-seekers' , must be upheld at the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group finds the attitude of Commissioner Bangemann, the Commissioner for Telecommunications in the previous Commission - or in the present one, we are not too sure of his exact position - completely unacceptable."
"This same Commissioner Bangemann has just accepted an extremely well-paid job on the board of a company involved in his area of responsibility."
"We think that the Council of Ministers was right to inform the Courts of Justice, in accordance with article 213 of the Treaty, which prohibits Commissioners from accepting, even after leaving their posts, jobs which would place them in an awkward position, given their obligations to be honest and sensitive in these matters."
"One of these obligations which I feel should be mentioned in particular, as it is not mentioned often enough, is that of professional secrecy, which, in accordance with Article 287 of the Treaty, applies to Commissioners indefinitely after leaving office."
"Indeed, I do not see how Mr Bangemann could act as a director of Telefónica without using, directly or indirectly, confidential information which he has acquired over the last few years."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group finds that the new Code of Conduct, touched on by Mr Prodi, is not up to the job."
"The one year minimum period which would relieve the Commissioners of their obligations after leaving office, seems far too short."
"In addition to this, potential penalties should be made much more severe, and could even include the returning of salaries paid to them during their time in office at the Commission."
"The stakes are high, dear colleagues."
"We must know whether or not we can take decisions at a European level which reflect the opinions of the citizens of Europe and not those of economic or financial lobby-groups."
"There is more."
"The indifference of Commissioner Bangemann, who has not even had the decency to wait just a few months until the Commission's agony is over, shows the extent to which there is a feeling within this institution, of being above the law and above public opinion."
"This type of behaviour casts serious doubts, in retrospect, on many past decisions."
"This must be put right as a matter of urgency, particularly before the forthcoming international negotiations at the Millennium round which will be fundamental to Europe's interests."
"In order to put things right though, Mr President, we will need more than a new Code of Conduct."
"The control of whole European institutions will have to be given back to the people, and the first step in this direction is to give this control back to their national parliaments."
"This case is interesting."
"It reveals totally rotten law and no less rotten policy."
"I consider that these persistent colleagues, who are keen to give their own ruling in the case brought before the Court, thus pre-empting the course of events by pronouncing a judgment without court proceedings, in obvious violation of Article 213, and depriving the man of his pension rights, are usurping a function which is rightly a matter for the courts."
"It is rotten law and it is rotten policy."
"However, I will take another starting point and say that I, representing the Danish opponents of the Union, the People's Movement against the EU, owe Mr Bangemann a debt of gratitude."
"It was Mr Bangemann who, as a Commissioner in 1992, spoke the truth concerning the Maastricht project."
"The truth which is evident today, namely that the large States have unlimited power and outrageous dominance over small, less fortunate States such as the State which I represent, Denmark."
"It was Mr Bangemann who, in this way, secured the Danish 'no' to the Maastricht Treaty on 2 June 1992, which put the skids under the process which we call the democratisation process."
"We now owe Herr Bangemann a debt of gratitude for yet another eye-opener."
"Mr Bangemann has breached a few regulations, but we are not here to defend Telefónica' s competitors."
"We are not here to reproach Mr Bangemann for damaging trust in this project."
"Mr Bangemann simply transgressed the very, very broad and flexible boundaries of greed and the merging of private and public, which is a vital part of the European Union."
"Mr Bangemann's offence is that he has made this fundamentally corrupt system visible, so that any European voter could see it and therefore choose to stay at home on voting day, as most people did between 10 and 13 June, thus depriving this assembly of any form of democratic legitimacy."
"That was all I wanted to say."
"Mr President, it is right that this Parliament and indeed the Council and the Commission treat this matter with the utmost seriousness."
"It really is most reprehensible that there has been not only an apparent flouting of the formal rules for Commissioners, but also a contravention of the spirit of transparency and trust that should be the basis of the work between this Parliament and Commissioners."
"I have been the rapporteur on a substantial number of Directives concerning the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry and I, and my colleagues, have acted in good faith in this work and had assumed that the former Commissioner Bangemann had done the same."
"One can only speculate at just how much of a commitment Mr Bangemann had to the level playing field in this aspect of the internal market when he is willing to sell his knowledge to Telefónica , a major player in the European Union and further afield."
"It is particularly difficult, Colleagues, when Mr Bangemann was a former Member of this Parliament and indeed, a leader of the Liberal Group."
"One matter which has not been mentioned in the debate is that there is to be a major review of all of the telecommunications legislation later this year and part of this work has already been started by the Commission under Mr Bangemann's commissionership."
"As I have previously stated, I have been the rapporteur on a number of matters, but if I can just give you a thumbnail sketch of just how extensive this review will be and what it will cover - universal service, frequencies, satellite, regulation, licences, interconnections, numbering, mobile telephones, convergence of broadcasting, data transmission and telecommunications - an explosion of legislation and an enormous segment of the European Union's manufacturing, industrial and commercial base in its own right, but also as an adjunct to so many other industries."
"On all of this, Mr Bangemann takes with him his knowledge and his contacts to Telefónica ."
"There are also a worryingly substantial number of cases before the European Court of Justice on breaches of legislation, particularly in the field of interconnections - again, matters on which the former Commissioner has intimate knowledge."
"The Commissioner, when he was here in this Chamber, and I have had many debates with him, was fond of quoting from Shakespeare and other English poets."
"I shall quote one in his absence on his behalf - 'Just for a handful of silver he left us, just for a ribbon to stick on his coat'."
"I know that the money he has been offered by Telefónica hardly can be justified by the description of a handful of silver and indeed it begs the question of just how seriously Members of this House will treat a company like Telefónica when it comes to lobby us as they surely will on the matter of the review and future legislation in this field."
"If I can be slightly mischievous, one wonders just how much value for money Telefónica will get out of Martin Bangemann."
"I wish he were on a performance-related pay and he might find that the fat cheque might not look nearly so attractive."
"I understand Commissioner Kinnock's hesitation and his hesitations because this matter is sub judice ."
"Fortunately, Members of this Parliament are protected by parliamentary privilege, but even then, Commissioner Kinnock, I would ask you to note the reasonably restrained language that there is in our resolution and if I may just quote to you briefly on what the resolution says - ""it deems his conduct to be particularly open to criticism' ."
"We did choose the language very carefully and many might say that 'open to criticism' might be a serious understatement."
"I finish, where I started, by saying that we are right to treat this with the utmost seriousness."
"I support absolutely the Council's decision to refer this matter to the Court and to use all the powers that there are under the agreements."
"However, one matter still is outstanding."
"There seems to be no mechanism within the existing rules and obligations where a company like Telefónica itself can be subject to some sort of punitive measures."
"If we could find some way not only of having a measure to take against former Commissioners who act in this way, but also against the companies who benefit from their knowledge, then I think that we might have two very powerful levers to use in future transgressions."
"We hope, of course, that these will not occur."
"We wish the new Commission every success and hope that the high standards they espouse will be put into practice."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say that I was always unpleasantly surprised by the fact - and this observation has nothing to do with the debate now taking place - that generally, when the Conciliation Committees were held, all the Commissioners except for one, were present and on time. Commissioner Bangemann never took part."
"He would send officials in his place, in spite of protests from us, Members of the European Parliament."
"I don't know, maybe it was just his way of doing things that was the problem."
"Mr President, the worst thing about Mr Bangemann's imprudent career move is the threat that it poses to the Commission that he served."
"The Commission was already in serious trouble and its problems were bound to have been compounded by the Bangemann decision."
"In my view, the Commission has a final chance to prove itself the clean, efficient and effective executive that the European Union needs and that its citizens deserve."
"Should the Prodi Commission fail, then I fear that the European Council will execute a coup d'état and deprive the Commission of its right of initiative and its important role as the promoter of European Union."
"So to start the process of the Commission's recuperation, may we insist that the outgoing Members of the Santer Commission apply voluntarily the Prodi Code of Conduct."
"Mr President, I share the indignation of Mr Markov of the GUE/NGL Group towards Mr Bangemann's attitude, but the real question is: what has Mr Bangemann been able to offer in order to command such a high salary?"
"How much have his services brought to Telefónica, a private company?"
"How much control do European institutions have over the subsidies and advantages gained by private companies such as Telefónica or others, and what control is there over the use that these companies make of them?"
"Yes, it is shocking that a European Commissioner should be able to profit unduly from his position for his own benefit, but it is even more shocking that incredibly rich companies should be able to profit, quite legally, from subsidies from European institutions whilst to my knowledge, these same institutions are giving no help at all to the eighteen million unemployed workers throughout the Union, nor to the several million other people who are forced to live on salaries which barely keep them alive."
"Applause"
"He was a determined and skilful Member of the Commission, a bit like a steam train, and occasionally in debates he would slap us MEPs like cod on a jetty, but what of that?"
"What is most important is that this sort of thing does not spread to the civil service or gain popularity there."
"The impartial nature of our administration is the most important issue for all of us here and in the Commission."
"There is a real need to reform the bureaucratic machinery of the European institutions, and an end must be made to these sorts of cliques."
"This is what the public hates most about the European Union."
"That was seen in the elections and in the campaigning."
"Our citizens do not understand an administration that works along such lines, and we should not wonder."
"Mr Prodi's Commission is off to a good start, and I congratulate him on that, but it must continue as it has begun."
"I thank the Council for taking a swift decision to bring this case to the European Court of Justice, but as we have to be the pioneers in an administration which is open and efficient, so Mr Prodi's Commission should get ready for the test in September."
"I believe that by the start of next year, we will see, on the basis of the study by the five experts, what the Commission has achieved with regard to its own administrative reforms and those of its body of civil servants."
"Therefore, we shall meet up here once more at the end of the year."
"Mr President, we have been unanimous in this debate. The actions of Mr Bangemann, a Member of the Commission, in this affair can in no way be approved."
"I would like to thank those who have spoken for having given their approval of the Council's decision to take swift action in this affair, and for their support in bringing the case to court."
"I would like to underline the importance of Mr Prodi's code of practice in this connection, and I wish to refer to Mr Elles' speech in which he said that hopefully we will not be saying 'too little, too late' next time."
"We must take care this time, then, that codes of conduct are absolutely clear and legally binding on all parties."
"In my view, it is an issue that concerns us all as it is sometimes hard for the public, as was mentioned here, to distinguish between the institutions of the Union, which means that events such as this should not be allowed to occur in any of the institutions."
"Thank you."
"I should like to begin by saying that Mrs Read was absolutely right to draw attention to the moderate way in which the resolution is couched and indeed the moderation of the language throughout the whole of this debate."
"It would have been easy for people to try to make a populist appeal."
"That was almost entirely avoided."
"That simply added to the weight of the opinion of this House and therefore to the reaction which everyone has just heard from Mrs Sasi, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr Elles was quite right to emphasise that it is absolutely essential to see responsibility exercised to the highest standard."
"I hope - to take Mr Barón Crespo's point - that this experience is not repeated, that we can ensure that specific and very clear provision is made so that there cannot be any repetition of the experience of recent weeks."
"There are those who would say, and they have, I believe, rationality on their side, that the provisions of Article 213 of the Treaty and its references to integrity and discretion mean that for anyone who has an understanding of required standards in public life, little more should need to be said, if anything."
"But if it is necessary - and I am conscious of being subject to the fact this issue is now before the court - even then to be more specific about what the implications of integrity and discretion are, then I am glad the House welcomes the developments that will take place as a consequence of the initiative taken by the President designate."
"I look forward to ensuring that there is a full response to both the appeal of Mr Barón Crespo and that of Mr Elles to the demonstration of the highest standards of public integrity."
"I would also say that Mr Kreissl-Dörfler was right to emphasise, together with Mr Duff - in a very interesting maiden speech - that if all institutions do not demonstrate the highest standards of rectitude for themselves, by themselves, then those standards will be imposed externally, either in the form of punishment by the general public, initially through its apathy and detachment but maybe in other ways more directly, politically too, or by the Council taking a responsibility which others appear to be unwilling to demonstrate."
"I do not believe the European Union, its institutions or its people would be enriched by that experience."
"It is a fair warning to all of us who serve the institutions and the European people that we are responsible for our own destiny and our own standards and we must therefore proceed without any form of delay to ensuring that those standards are as stringent as possible."
"I was interested in the point made in another fine maiden speech by Miss van der Laan which calls for a response."
"I am happy to report to the House that she is a friend of some years and therefore my joy in witnessing her maiden speech was very particular."
"I see it was shared in other parts of the House."
"She said that it would be 'better if the Commission had taken the step of reference to the Court of Justice' ."
"I should like to say to her, therefore, that the Commission, as I reported earlier, discussed the matter in its meeting of 1 July."
"In that meeting the feeling was expressed that the issues relating to Mr Bangemann and to Article 213 had legal complexities that could not be speedily resolved."
"For that reason the Commission made plain its view in its statement of 1 July that there needed to be clarification of implementation of Article 213."
"There was no consensus at that meeting which supported reference to the Court of Justice at that stage."
"I say that to ensure that Members of this House understand that the issue is live, it has been a matter of discussion, the action has now been taken by the Council and that determines the path for the future."
"But there is no lack of concern or consideration in the current Commission, despite the fact that it is coming to the end of its life, in these issues."
"I conclude by saying that Mrs Laguiller made an extremely valuable contribution to this debate because, like others, she dramatised the issue quite properly by drawing attention to the economic gaps in society and the way in which those divisions actually serve to emphasise the fact that it is absolutely essential for those of us who have the good fortune to hold representative and appointed positions in the public service to act with complete integrity and discretion."
"We enjoy a very considerable privilege."
"We must, therefore, show complete probity."
"This debate has served to underlined that."
"If anybody ever needed the lesson, this has added to it."
"I hope we can look forward to a future where no instruction will be necessary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m."
"I have received four motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The sitting was closed at 9.10 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"I wonder if you are able to confirm, or your services are able to confirm, that this building, particularly the Tower Building, satisfies all aspects of health and safety legislation and whether it has a valid fire certificate."
"These are important issues and if it does not, then I think serious questions must be raised."
"I would therefore ask you either to confirm this categorically or, if not, to confirm that measures are taken to investigate the situation."
"Mr Evans, we have followed the building regulations and taken them into serious consideration during this time at the Presidency office, and I believe that your concerns received due attention."
"I will, however, pass on your comments to the President and they will be discussed at the Presidency office, so that all possible clarification may be given to the Assembly on this matter."
"Mr President, do I understand it that you are therefore not able to confirm what I asked?"
"You are not confirming that the building satisfies health and safety and fire regulations?"
"You said you will look at it and try to clarify the situation."
"What I am asking is: are you able to categorically confirm that the building satisfies these regulations, yes or no?"
"Mr Evans, my opinion is that the building complies with all the specifications laid down by law, but at this precise moment, I am unable to give you a guarantee of this because I do not have the relevant information to hand, and I therefore reserve the right to pass on your intervention to the President."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Dioxin"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the contamination by dioxins of certain products intended for human or animal consumption."
"Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to congratulate you all on the election results and wish the European Parliament every success in its legislative work."
"I eagerly look forward to working in co-operation with you in my role of chairman of the Agriculture Council during the Finnish presidential term."
"I have no doubt that co-operation between us during this time will be fruitful and will serve the interests of European producers, manufacturers and consumers well."
"Obviously, I might have wished that our first meeting under the Finnish Presidency had taken place in other circumstances which would have permitted me to present the actual priorities of our programme."
"These include, in particular, legislation projects which aim to guarantee food safety for the consumer and promote the health and welfare of animals."
"Unfortunately, owing to circumstances, we were obliged to give consideration to a chain of events we would never have wished for."
"Recent events concerning the contamination by dioxins of certain foodstuffs in Belgium have resulted in a very serious situation, not only with regard to the risks to people's health, but also because they have weakened confidence in the animal feed and food production chain and in the ability of the authorities to monitor the situation properly."
"Quite understandably, there has been a very strong reaction on the part of the public to this crisis, which erupted just as we were starting to think that the BSE crisis was an exceptional, isolated case which we were already getting over."
"I fully understand why consumers expect us to take speedy, comprehensive and effective action, appropriate in terms of the gravity of the matter, to give them the necessary guarantees that the crisis will be resolved in both the short and the long-term."
"At the same time, we have to bear in mind that an undesirable occurrence such as this has very costly economic consequences."
"For that reason, we are under an obligation to do all we can to protect consumers' health and offer them guarantees regarding the safety of food that are as comprehensive as possible."
"It is in our own interest to take all necessary action to prevent incidents such as this from recurring."
"In connection with all this, I shall be working in co-operation with Ms Biaudet, who is chairman of the Council of Health Ministers, to restore consumer confidence."
"We have to take into account the fact that legislation on issues of veterinary medicine and animal feed in the European Union is amongst the most stringent in the world."
"You are well aware of the criticisms made by certain third countries that measures meant for the protection of consumers within the Union are too restrictive."
"I can mention, by way of example, the recent decision by the World Trade Organisation to allow the USA and Canada to impose penalty tariffs on our exports, owing to the importation ban on hormone-treated meat."
"The understandable financial and social worries of producers notwithstanding, the Council has always worked, and will continue to work, with two principles in mind."
"First, the most important objective is the protection of people's health, and second, all action must be based on the best possible scientific evidence."
"The recent decisions of the Council are indications of this style of approach."
"I would refer to the decision forbidding the use of some antibiotics in feed as a boost to growth, and the decision approved by the Council last Monday to tighten up the rules on the treatment of animal waste as a way of protecting against infectious TSE diseases."
"In speaking of dioxin contamination, we have to say that the investigations carried out by the Belgian authorities and the inspections made by the Commission show contamination was due to the introduction during the manufacturing process of a raw material that should never have been used for this purpose."
"We must also admit that the dioxin contamination of the feed shows that current legislation and protective measures are not fully sufficient to prevent the feed becoming contaminated by hazardous substances such as dioxin."
"For that reason, there is no doubt that Community legislation should be amended to ensure that the quality of animal produce is to be relied upon fully."
"We must act now to see that the 'prevention rather than cure' principle is fully applied in the future."
"Before I move on to the question of the approach agreed upon in the Council, I would like to remind everyone of the timely and effective work instigated by the Commission and given the support of the Member States' Standing Veterinary Committee to implement vital crisis measures imposed by the precautionary principle."
"This action led to the identification, withdrawal from the market and destruction of all produce that was contaminated or suspected of being so."
"In addition, the Commission imposed conditions on certified produce coming onto the market and on the continuance of trade in produce in national markets as well as the entire Community market."
"The Commission has already sent out all the details regarding the work it has begun, so I will not repeat them here."
"For my own part, and on behalf of the Council, I would like to say we appreciate the Commission's work."
"Turning to the action the Council has taken, I would like to remind everyone that the Ministers of Agriculture and Health have followed the dioxin crisis closely, and that they discussed the situation at the first available opportunity in meetings held in June."
"The aim was to provide a springboard and political direction for further vital action to be taken."
"The Council adopted a set of conclusions on how this issue should be approached."
"The Council particularly stressed that a swift, thorough and independently drafted report should be produced and, if required, that there should be changes to current legislation."
"The Council also made a point of asking Member States to ensure, through a comprehensive programme of checks, that EU legislation to guarantee health protection was being complied with."
"The Council reminded everyone that, with the threat of a risk looming, the Member States should use the early warning systems currently in place fully and in good time."
"Furthermore, the Council asked the Commission to monitor the effective and uniform implementation of these EU early warning systems and, if it was appropriate, to make recommendations regarding how they might be improved, and give consideration to how much the existing monitoring systems should be extended to cover all situations."
"In addition, the Council asked the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year on the progress made in the establishment of a Food Veterinary Office and its overall viability."
"On the basis of this report, we should also look at the need for a general improvement in food monitoring, including the possibility of food monitoring bodies."
"The Council urged the Commission to speed up the work already begun by its Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs, which re-examines the legislation on animal feed and proposes, if deemed necessary, additions and amendments for tighter harmonisation."
"The Council also urged the Commission to take a critical look at EU legislation regarding the disposal of meat meal, animal waste and feed."
"Moreover, the Council emphasised that the manufacturers of animal feed were responsible for the safety of their products."
"Anxious about the situation, the Agriculture Council in their meeting on Monday this week returned to the issue to monitor developments."
"At the end of a new full debate on the issue, the Council reaffirmed the conclusions drawn in June, and drew attention to the importance of unanimous political will on the part of the Member States and the Commission to act on these conclusions fully and immediately."
"The Council considered the Commission's proposal for an exhaustive programme of legislation to be welcome in principle, a programme of which you are aware and whose purpose is to accommodate legislation on animal nutrition and measures relating to animal waste."
"The Council made all the relevant decisions relating to procedure to ensure the speedy examination of the Commission's proposals, bearing in mind the aim the Council has to finish the job, if at all possible, before the end of the year."
"I will take this opportunity to remind everyone that the co-decision procedure applies to debates on future Commission proposals, and I would therefore ask the European Parliament for their co-operation in honouring this very ambitious timetable."
"I can assure you that Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, will, for its part, do everything within its power to ensure that work in the Council is expedited in order for us to achieve a positive end result as speedily as possible during the Finnish presidential term."
"Before I end, I would like to say that the dioxin crisis has clearly shown that the effects of this type of occurrence are not restricted to the regions, or even countries, in which it began."
"The effects spread to every region of the Community and extend also to our trading relations with third countries."
"This crisis has had an adverse effect on our exports, and the actions of some of our trading partners have in many respects exceeded justifiable limits as regards not only severity but also scope of application."
"We therefore have to rebuild consumer confidence both within the Community and the world over and, at the same time, develop appropriate action to restore viable commercial relations."
"When it is a matter of people's health, simply the best way to reassure the European people and the consumers who live outside Europe is to act with transparency, clarity and a sense of accountability."
"Aside from the programme of legislation, now available, as it is, to all, we are grateful to the Commission for the consistent way in which it kept third countries and the World Trade Organisation informed and for its reports on Community action to solve the dioxin crisis."
"It was an attempt to show that certified EU exports are safe."
"Some positive results have been achieved, but the situation remains unsatisfactory in some cases, which means that the Commission will have to continue with its efforts. In order to be successful these efforts need, and should receive, the support, not just of the Council, but the European Parliament also."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. Sincere thanks for affording me the opportunity to be able to inform you of the measures taken in relation to the recent dioxin crisis in Belgium."
"I would also like to take this opportunity, however, to outline, in a somewhat broader context, some plans and projects which will help, firstly, to put this event in context and secondly, to provide us with the opportunity to give consideration as to where we must, and should, make improvements in the law concerning animal feed and foodstuffs."
"Now to the reason itself."
"Unfortunately, the Commission was only informed of the problem by the Belgian authorities on 27 May, but we immediately implemented a whole range of measures with a view to safeguarding the health of humans and animals."
"With the consent of the representatives of the constituent Member States on the Standing Veterinary Committee, firstly, emergency measures were laid down for the poultry industry as well as for poultry products of Belgian origin."
"These were followed, several days later, by measures relating to the cattle, pig and milk sectors and products derived therefrom."
"In the meantime, however, it was possible, on the recommendation of the Scientific Committee, and following consultation with the Standing Veterinary Committee, to lift the bans on milk and milk products."
"As far as the question of the source of the contamination is concerned, and I should point out that inquiries are still continuing in this regard, it can be assumed, based on the latest findings by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Gent, that the cause of the crisis was a serious product contamination which took place in January of this year."
"I should also point out that Community officials arrived at the same conclusion during their inspections which were carried out on site between 8 and 11 June."
"Looking ahead, one can assume that all products which are manufactured or marketed in the Community today, be they of Belgian origin or otherwise, will not be contaminated by this source."
"Naturally, our work is continuing, and we will verify, as soon as the Belgian authorities have provided us with the necessary information, whether the PCB certificate can also be applied to pork and beef."
"This would then allow us to make certain changes to the precautionary measures already taken."
"In order to limit the economic damage caused by the dioxin crisis, the Commission has also introduced a number of measures."
"A Regulation was passed on 16 June with the aim of maintaining exports at an acceptable level in spite of the more difficult conditions."
"Pig breeders can also profit from having to keep their animals for extended periods."
"With regard to the poultry sector, a Regulation was passed on 13 June allowing export grants for destination countries in addition to the Middle East."
"As regards the milk sector, on 15 July, the management committee for milk decided to extend the period of use of butter and butter concentrates in bread, cakes, pastries and ice cream."
"A Commission resolution for eight different state subsidies, which were announced and notified by the Belgian authorities, was passed the day before yesterday."
"Apart from the emergency measures which have already been adopted, the Commission is, however, now working, and this is where the general context comes in, on proposals to improve and define Community provisions relating to foodstuffs and animal feed more closely."
"These projects far exceed what is required."
"In connection with this, I would now like to cover certain issues which have already been discussed in Parliament and which will continue to be discussed."
"Firstly, I shall come to the question of foodstuffs legislation."
"Here, we have already long since set about consolidating the texts of all hygiene-related regulations in the area of foodstuffs."
"This project is about to draw to a conclusion."
"On this point, we should also look to simplify matters from a legal viewpoint, which should serve to make the regulations relating to hygiene more transparent and ensure that they are applied better."
"In this regard, we have come to a definitive ruling on an issue which we have already discussed previously here in Parliament, namely to what extent the decontamination process, modified and carried out under strictly controlled conditions, should apply to slaughtered hens and chickens as well as to red meat."
"Another key issue is the traceability of animal products from the shop counter to the manufacturer."
"In the pig sector, of course, we have come a long way in this regard but the question still has to be asked regarding the extent to which this system should be applied to other sectors."
"Throughout the Community, four research laboratories are at our disposal for the testing and inspection of foodstuffs and the development of different research methods in connection with said testing and inspection. One of these, the laboratory in Rome, has been specially commissioned to develop, where necessary, new and improved research methods."
"In addition, this laboratory offers a further education programme which is particularly concerned with the consideration of environmental contaminants."
"In the last Council, which the President-in-Office of the Council has already talked about, political agreement was reached on different measures and, even prior to this in June, at the meeting of Agricultural Ministers, an agreement was reached on a Regulation concerning biological farming and its expansion to include animal products."
"This is also one of the Commission's initiatives which should assist in improving production conditions and, above all, transparency for the consumer."
"Another ambitious programme, which was last discussed on Monday at the meeting of Agricultural Ministers, concerns substantial changes to current foodstuffs legislation."
"The Commission is trying to deal with this matter as quickly as possible but, in this regard, we also need the support of the Member States and, above all, of this Parliament."
"We wish to concentrate on three different types of measures."
"In the first instance, we want to expand the list of animal feed raw materials which should not be used in mixed animal feed."
"Secondly, we wish to establish maximum dioxin values for oils and fats as well as mixed animal feed products to which oils and fats are added."
"Thirdly, we want to change the definition of animal feed raw materials, in particular with regard to oils and fats and animal products."
"In order to achieve this, we have a catalogue full of concrete proposals which have already been discussed by the committee responsible for animal feed products."
"I have forwarded this catalogue to the Committee Secretariat since it would simply take too long to go into all of these points here and now."
"Therefore, I would like to mention a few points briefly."
"A legal basis must be created as regards the application of a safeguard clause in the event of emergencies which may occur in the European Union in connection with animal feed products and which may pose a serious risk to the health of humans or animals and the environment."
"Secondly, it is a question of making it incumbent upon the Member States to implement a Union-wide monitoring programme for contaminants in animal feed products."
"Thirdly, we also wish to introduce an early-warning system for animal feed products, along the lines of the one already in place for foodstuffs."
"I would like to point out that the time frame for this has been altered and that it will now be in place as of September 1999."
"From this time, there will be a ban on the intermixing of contaminated animal feed raw materials and the exemption regulation for the regional use of animal feed products that have been contaminated due to local conditions will also cease to apply."
"Finally, we want to inspect current provisions relating to the information concerning raw materials, in particular provisions concerning the labelling found on mixed animal feed products in the sense that, in future, a clear statement of quantity on all the raw materials used should be possible which will obviate the need for information on raw materials by categories."
"We then want to approve, in general terms, all mixed animal feed manufacturers as well as drafting an exhaustive positive list for approved animal feed raw materials."
"I would also like to point out that not all of the measures contained in this list, which I have forwarded to the Committee Secretariat, are completely new."
"This is the case, for example, as regards the approval of mixed animal feed manufacturers."
"We have already made a proposal along these lines in the past, but at that time the Council did not accept the Commission's view and the proposal was therefore dropped."
"I would now like to talk about some trade issues with third countries."
"It was extremely important to inform these countries on the ensuing situation and of the precautionary measures taken by the Commission and to keep them updated on an on-going basis."
"To this end, the competent services of the Commission have been in regular contact with third countries and we used the WTO/SPS plenary session which took place on 7 and 8 July to report in detail on the current situation and the relevant legal documents."
"During this session, we also made it clear that the dioxin problems are not only a Community issue."
"No country is free from dioxins and we can cite a whole number of examples of dioxin contamination which have made the headlines in many different parts of the world."
"It is to be hoped, therefore, that all countries, not only Europe, can take some lessons from this."
"The majority of committee members at this session welcomed this report and thanked the Commission and the sovereign authorities for the on-going and reliable exchange of information."
"A final word on the tests."
"The Foodstuffs and Veterinary Office of DG XXIV has introduced a range of measures on site."
"Even in the case of the first visit to Belgium, it became clear that the crisis, unfortunately, had been poorly handled by the Belgian authorities."
"This state of affairs could be attributed primarily to the lack of co-ordination between the various competent administrative authorities and the responsibilities of these authorities which were fragmented and unclear."
"In addition, it was revealed that Community decisions concerning the withdrawal from the market of potentially contaminated products had been inadequately enforced by the Belgian authorities."
"Tests carried out in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain also demonstrated certain loopholes in the procedures relating to the inspection of animal feed products."
"Unfortunately, certain Member States used the crisis in Belgium as an excuse to erect trade barriers against non-contaminated Belgian products, thereby infringing the principle of the free movement of goods."
"It has also transpired that other Member States have also been supplied with reconditioned used oil which is Belgian in origin."
"With regard to the infringement procedures, I can report to you that the Commission has introduced, on the basis of Article 226 of the EC Treaty, summary infringement proceedings against Belgium, since it failed in its obligation to inform the Commission and Member States immediately regarding the dioxin cases and did not fully transpose Decision 1999/389."
"Other issues concern the import barriers imposed by certain Member States with regard to Belgian products in general."
"The Commission's services met with the competent authorities to discuss in detail the uncertain legal and administrative provisions."
"These talks have led, in the meantime, to specific health protection measures being implemented and the lifting of temporary import barriers for a range of products."
"Other problems persist of course, but the Commission's services are endeavouring to co-operate closely with those parties responsible at a national level, and we want to resolve the issues outstanding as quickly as possible."
"In conclusion, I would like to assure you that the Commission will continue to do everything in its power to alleviate the consequences of this crisis as quickly as possible."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you will allow me, I would like to address my speech to you directly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, because I believe that the European Council in recent years has become far too an insignificant factor at the heart of European discussions and has also held back somewhat when it has come down to stepping in and taking charge."
"In this instance, following our unpleasant experiences with BSE, the Commission is largely blameless and the Member States have once again played their games under the guise of subsidiarity and have not been brave enough, for example, in drafting a framework Directive on foodstuffs which could be something concrete to which the Member States can adhere."
"I do not want to go so far as to say that the last five years have seen an upswing in renationalisation but certainly, in that time, the Council has not become any more audacious when it has come down to, for example, in view of the obvious conclusions to be drawn from the BSE crisis, proposing real European goals which could then also be safeguarded and sanctioned."
"This is very regrettable and I fear the only thing that will get the Council moving on this question will be the agreement that we have just concluded with the Americans whereby they may verify whether Europe itself is observing the same standards of hygiene as we expect from the Americans."
"Only then will the Council start to act."
"The days of Member States playing their games must stop; instead, they have to play a European game with European goals and, of course, proceed along individual paths in order to achieve this goal."
"As a farmer, let me now come onto another issue which I am finding somewhat disconcerting."
"Worldwide competition in the foodstuffs industry is causing ruin."
"The Americans are squeezing the European market and the profits of processing industries are lower than ever before."
"Competition is passing this onto the consumer and, in this instance, onto producers in particular. As a result, this is clearly creating the environment for criminal dealings."
"Minister, you have said that the dioxin admixture was a mixture of unsuitable raw materials."
"Perhaps this is a translation problem."
"As far as I am concerned, it is a criminal act which is driving farmers in my constituency to ruin."
"Applause"
"Therefore, let's talk in clear and plain language for the benefit of consumers and farmers alike, and for the benefit of Europe as well."
"Applause"
"Mr President, let me begin by giving Mr Prodi a sound piece of advice, both him and all the other nominees who wish to be confirmed in their positions by this House here in September."
"One of the questions which all of the committees certainly wish to ask is this: What is your attitude towards honouring decisions made by the European Parliament?"
"If Mr Prodi or one of the other nominees replies, 'Well, I couldn't care less' , then these nominees will have a problem."
"Yesterday, in his third speech to this House, Mr Prodi used the words 'consumer protection' and 'health policy' for the first time."
"That is a fair few."
"In this regard, he also said that he would make provision for, and I quote, 'an independent European Food and Drugs Agency' ."
"This House decided, after long discussions in connection with the BSE crisis, that this is something which we simply do not want."
"We are not after an independent Agency but an authority which is subordinate to the Commission and which is accountable to this House, the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"I hope that this piece of information reaches Mr Prodi so that he knows in future to be very careful about what he says."
"I have already asked Mr Fischler yesterday whether this was his suggestion."
"He assured me that it was not."
"Mr Fischler, I believe this to be the case and, after your speech here today, which I thought was excellent, I am even more convinced."
"I would now like to say something to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"He said at certain points that the Council was concerned that the dioxin crisis has shown that its effects concern the Union as a whole and that the Council wants to act decisively and responsibly."
"Mr President, I believe that it would be something new if the Council were to act decisively and responsibly."
"I hope that the Finnish Presidency of the Council will actually bring this about."
"You would then be able to count a complete novelty amongst the successes of your Presidency."
"Up to now, the Council has routinely covered things up, dithered, and swept things under the carpet."
"Applause"
"So let's get down to business."
"Everyone in the Council knows that individual countries all handle things in a similar manner."
"What has happened in Belgium, and it is a disgrace that it took the government six weeks to inform the Commission, could have happened anywhere else."
"It was just bad luck that it happened in Belgium."
"We all know that it could have occurred in Italy, Germany or Austria."
"Have you, for example, done anything to help ensure tighter inspections and controls?"
"You have left untouched a proposal from the European Parliament on this matter for more than six months."
"As far as the details of this crisis are concerned, I would like to expressly commend the Commission."
"We have certainly frequently maintained, in connection with BSE, that the Commission was not quite on the ball."
"But at the same time, however, there is nothing, nothing at all, as regards the behaviour of the Commission for which it can be criticised."
"Everything the Commission did, and the way in which it was done, was excellent."
"The same certainly cannot be said of everybody else."
"So what lessons can be drawn from this?"
"Mr Fischler mentioned some of these."
"He made reference to legislation which is necessary."
"This is definitely the case. There is no question that other legislation for animal feed products is required."
"We have to avoid a situation where, for example, waste products enter into animal feed."
"We talk of foodstuffs and animals which have been fed on these foodstuffs."
"Waste products have no part here."
"Mr Fischler, of course there should not be dioxin limit values."
"The limit value has to be zero for both dioxins and PCB."
"We should therefore be very careful as regards both the wording and the language."
"In this regard, something else is worthy of mention."
"Let's have the courage to also declare dioxin to be a worldwide problem."
"Will there be a dioxin register in the European Union and worldwide?"
"Will it be investigated where emissions accumulate from incineration plants, where other dioxin emissions can be found which are present in the soil and in the grass which is eaten by animals?"
"We know for sure that they are not only found in animal feed but also in our natural environment."
"So please let's have a dioxin register."
"This is something that is definitely needed."
"I would now like to briefly outline some proposals relating to the checks."
"If we do not ensure that the tests are better carried out in Member States, if the Commission is not able to carry out inspections unannounced, but first has to wait for permission from a Member country such as Belgium or another Member State, we can forget it."
"We must modify the inspection process and agricultural policy as a whole."
"If we believe that we can make high profits by means of waste products which are as cheap as possible, and that is something which we want, such cases will always crop up."
"We have to change this within the European Union as well as with our partners outside the Union."
"Applause"
"Mr President, it is a shame that in my maiden speech as a new MEP, I should have to speak of serious mistakes that have been made in my country, firstly by companies that supply raw materials for cattle feed, and secondly by the control agencies whose responsibility it is to ensure that when a mistake is made, it is discovered immediately and the consequences limited."
"Particular mention should also be made of the government then in office which wasted weeks and caused us a great deal of harm by not giving the European Commission and the Member States adequate warning that something was wrong."
"These mistakes have resulted in an extremely serious situation, firstly as regards public health, and secondly, they have caused economic disaster in agriculture and throughout the food sector."
"People's trust has been damaged and it will, of course, be a long time before it is restored again."
"These mistakes were duly punished in the political arena at last month's elections."
"There is now a new government in Belgium which is trying to limit the damage, pick up the pieces and also repair the damage, as quickly as possible and using all the means at its disposal."
"I hope that Belgium will also be able to count on the Union's support in this, for it is clear that whether a crisis such as this is caused by a disease or an accident, or even a crime, that is of no consequence to a consumer, a farmer or a company that falls victim to the crisis."
"They are victims and they suffer."
"Fortunately, Mr Commissioner, at the beginning of the week, the Commission opened the door for the Belgian authorities to come to the assistance of companies in need."
"I hope that will not prove to be the last step."
"In the long-term, there is also a task for us here in the European Parliament."
"Mr Commissioner, you have said that you will soon be presenting proposals."
"I assume, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we and the Council will be able to discuss the texts very shortly and will be able to turn them into the legislation we need."
"We must have European regulations."
"Speaking as a liberal, Mr Commissioner, I am very pleased that you have said that these regulations must be simple and user-friendly."
"Of course, they must also be strict, so that people know what is meant by healthy food, and they must apply to the whole food chain."
"But it is clearly absurd that at the height of the crisis, the Commission and its technical services should be wasting time on discussions with the Belgian authorities and their technical services because there are no standards, because people do not know what the permitted level of dioxins is for different products."
"At the height of a crisis, time can be better spent on other things."
"Clear and unambiguous regulations must be drawn up for all matters of this kind which are clear, simple and strict."
"And, of course, you must monitor them as well."
"We must ensure that consumers are able to tell from a quality label when something is healthy, and they must also be made fully aware when something has the European seal of approval."
"I think it is a good thing that Romano Prodi said yesterday that there is to be a European agency for food."
"Of course, it goes without saying that such an agency must discharge its responsibility in a democratic manner and must be embedded, if I can put it this way, in the European institutions."
"If we, as European Parliament, European Commission and European Council, fail to ensure that regulations and effective controls are introduced very rapidly, then yet another item will be added to the long list of disasters already in existence."
"My colleague said things of this kind can happen in any country."
"We have seen a number of examples."
"I think that we should spare no efforts in ensuring that the list of examples does not grow ever longer."
"Mr President, may I remind Parliament that our group has two components, the Green component and the European Free Alliance component, of countries with no State."
"I have been noticing, yesterday and today, that, on the screens and elsewhere in general, the real name of our group, Greens/European Free Alliance, does not appear."
"I therefore ask the President to provide all the relevant information, in order that the true name of our group be re-established."
"Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, you are what you eat."
"This popular maxim demonstrates why the issue of 'food safety' is a matter of such sensitivity as far as public opinion and our electorate are concerned."
"I learnt at primary school that cows eat grass and are ruminants."
"And it is owing to pursuit of profit that we now feed our cows cattle feed fortified with animal bonemeal."
"We are turning our cows into cannibals."
"But that is not all."
"Our Belgian pigs are so susceptible to stress that they are given tranquillizers and betablockers just before they are transported to the slaughterhouse."
"Mafia-type organisations give our cattle hormones, antibiotics, corticosteroids, betablockers, and beta-agonists."
"We have also known for a few days now that there are dioxin chickens."
"In my country, Flanders, it used to be a tradition to eat chicken and chips on a Sunday."
"We now know that we can dispense with the chips as well because our chickens are fed discarded frying oil."
"This brings us to the heart of the problem."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the dioxin chicken scandal is far more than a mere setback."
"What happened in Belgium could just as well have taken place in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain or Italy."
"It is the result of a defective system, an erroneous Common Agricultural Policy that plunges farmers into a vicious circle of producing ever-increasing amounts ever more cheaply, investing ever more heavily, having ever larger scales of operation which must be farmed ever more intensively."
"Quantity takes precedence over quality."
"We must change tack."
"From now on, quality must take precedence over quantity."
"There is a common resolution which has been put forward by several groups, of which my own group, the Greens/European Free Alliance is one."
"I want to stress that there is a definite need for an efficient system whereby people are warned in good time about any kind of unsafe food."
"A far-reaching proposal must be produced which will reinforce the precautionary principle in food production and trade at European level."
"Let's be honest, there is going to have to be a debate on the recycling industry."
"Can it be acceptable for the waste from water purification plants, which contain cadmium and heavy metals, to be incorporated into cattle feed and thus end up in the food chain."
"A clear distinction must be drawn between what is waste and should be treated as such, and what can still be used in our food production."
"On a final note, this crisis is a disaster for the producers."
"Tens if not hundreds of companies will go bankrupt."
"I have here the report by the Court of Auditors on the Community aid given to those farmers affected by the BSE crisis."
"I have today heard the Commissioner listing a whole range of measures which are to be taken or which have already been taken."
"I am pleased about this, but still I cannot help but feel that this is still too little."
"Billions have been spent on the victims of the BSE crisis and something must also be done for the victims of this crisis."
"Why are Flemish farmers denied what is given to English farmers?"
"I fully concur with the view expressed by my colleague Sterckx that what the Commission has now done is just a first step, and that the Commission and the Council and this Parliament will have to go much further."
"To return to the comment made a minute ago, the competent services confirm that there is indeed a problem with the computer programme, and that the names will be corrected, I hope, by the next part-session in September."
"Mr President, the crises are mounting, we have the dioxin crisis in Belgium and the soft drinks crisis with Coca-Cola amongst others."
"We have the continuing crisis of mad cow disease, Mr Fischler."
"And the crisis is not yet over."
"A reliable British magazine has reported that towards the end of 1998, the number of young people dying from the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease quadrupled and yet we have no information on this matter."
"We do not know what is happening with mad cow disease in Portugal, yet we are hearing a great deal about hormone-treated meat from the United States and the intolerable pressures imposed on us with regard to its free movement."
"There was not even any fundamental and serious debate on genetically-modified foods prior to their becoming a part of our daily diet."
"As I read in a recent study, we do not ultimately know what we are eating. In fact, even our farmers and cattle breeders do not know what they are farming or how to feed their animals."
"It is all very disturbing and worrying, Mr President."
"The Parliament owes it to its citizens to do more than make accusations of criminal offences like the one committed by Belgium."
"It should also be noted, Mr Commissioner, that it hasn't yet made known those companies which used dioxin-contaminated cattle feed. This time, however, the Commission, having learned its lesson from mad cow disease, took Belgium to the European Court of Justice."
"However, we have still not discussed things fully and have not taken decisions on how to make controls tighter and more efficient, leaving them instead to the good will of the Member States."
"Although we are mindful of the fact that we are lacking infrastructure, veterinarians and inspectorates, we are well aware of the bribes and attempted bribes, the threats and the murders which have taken place in certain countries with regard to these issues - yet, I do not see anybody taking it seriously. We are also well aware that there have been strong reactions from the European Union itself to the establishment of a proper organisation to carry out spot-checks, along the lines of, for example, the American Food & Drug Administration, instead of having non-specialised research bodies."
"What we need here is both transparency and public access to information."
"Therefore, Mr President, I strongly endorse our group's proposal for the Parliament to set up a temporary committee which will fully deal with all issues of food safety and public health and not just certain aspects of it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dioxin crisis, BSE and the pressure put on us by the Americans to ensure that we accept hormone-treated meat are just a few examples of the very serious threats overhanging the safety of our citizens' food today."
"If these threats are not dealt with forcefully and adequately, irrationality will prevail at the expense of our farmers."
"The President-elect of the Commission recognised yesterday the huge importance of this matter, but he has remained completely silent about how he proposes to deal with it."
"Instead of these ideological tirades from days gone by, calling for a return of the old supranational connivance between Parliament and the Commission against the Council, we would have preferred to hear from Mr Prodi, how exactly he intends, within his jurisdiction, to repair the damage done by previous Commissions at the Uruguay Round."
"By accepting rules which act against our interests and measures such as the one covering sufficient scientific proof, which prevents us in practice from applying the precautionary principle, previous Commissions did a great deal of damage to our companies and to our economies."
"They offered up our exports as hostages to those countries who want to impose their methods of production on us with all the effects that these may entail, on health, the environment and society."
"In years to come, our citizens' food safety will depend almost entirely on the way in which the new Commission is able, at the forthcoming Millennium round of negotiations, to defend the complete acceptability of a model for a separate European zone of high agricultural quality."
"Member States must give or renew a clear and firm mandate to the Commission in order to make it the stimulus for a new, enlightened renegotiation of the GATT regulations which today are an obstacle to setting in action the precautionary principle in the areas of health and food safety."
"The Commission must also put a stop to the CAP's very serious drift towards collapse as a Community-wide policy, as European prices are higher than those anywhere else in the world."
"Those who are pushing for complete integration to the world market in order to satisfy American demands should be aware of the heavy responsibility that they bear."
"They are leaving many of our farmers no other option but to launch themselves ill-advisedly and prematurely into introducing new and untried methods of crop cultivation and animal-rearing, which have not been properly tested and which, therefore, may put public health at risk."
"Ensuring the safety of our citizens' food is one of our prime duties."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, let us not allow European farming to go mad."
"Mr President, as the people in my country already know, the dioxin crisis has, I am sorry to say, propelled tens of thousands of companies into extreme difficulties."
"It is my belief that when an economic and environmental disaster occurs on such a scale, people should have the courage to seek out and point to the causes, and, where appropriate, the culprits, not out of some misplaced form of vengeance, but in order to prevent problems of this kind from occurring in the future."
"We must be honest."
"It is, above all, the former Belgian government that made one blunder too many in this area."
"At first, the government didn't know what was going on and was completely indifferent, then it wanted to sweep everything under the carpet until after the elections, and ultimately it was responsible for a panic reaction which was out of all proportion and which led to the entire world boycotting so-called Belgian products, although it was my country, Flanders that suffered most from this, since the lion's share of so-called 'Belgian' exports are, of course, Flemish exports."
"But sadly enough, the problem is not just one of incompetence, nepotism in the administration, political appointments and lack of monitoring in Belgium alone."
"Perhaps we, as MEPs, must now just face the fact that years of European agricultural policy have, in fact, almost destroyed the high-quality agriculture that can invariably almost be described as small-scale, and have led to the omnipotence of industrial European agriculture and to the omnipotence of a number of agro-industrial groups which are only out to make a profit and which thumb their noses at public health and quality standards."
"If, for example, the man in the street were to hear that all manner of waste was being recycled for animal feed, that years after mad cow disease, herbivores are still being fed with animal bonemeal and what is more, that products of obscure provenance which have undergone no checks whatsoever, are being mixed into animal feed bases, then he may well ask himself if decades of European agricultural policy should not, in all honesty, be classified as a total failure."
"I shall remind you again that half of the European budget is spent on this agricultural policy."
"I believe we must now have the courage, and we must now ask the Council and the Commission to have the courage, firstly, to learn from past mistakes and to discontinue the kind of agricultural policy we have been pursuing to date, and to opt, at last, for high-quality agriculture in Europe, which is the sensible, sober and necessary choice."
"Mr President, yesterday we were alarmed yet again, this time by news of increased dioxin-content in German cattle feed."
"The contamination, though less serious than in Belgium, is another appeal to producers and governments to act responsibly."
"I consider the European Commission's strict measures in the recent crisis to be quite justified."
"It is right that irresponsible, indeed criminal behaviour, should be punished."
"However, punishment alone will not suffice."
"We must avoid such incidents in the future."
"The question is how?"
"I do not think there is any point in setting up a new bureau after every food crisis."
"More bureaucracy does not automatically lead to increased food safety."
"Neither do I think that we should ban an ever-increasing number of cattle feed ingredients."
"If cattle feed factories are no longer permitted to collect waste fat from catering establishments, then who will?"
"The environmental problems should not be underestimated."
"Well-integrated management of the food chain would be far more likely to prevent incidents of this kind from arising."
"It is very important to be able to trace the waste derived from cattle feed."
"This would also guard against one incident throwing the entire cattle feed sector into disrepute."
"It is, above all, the Member States that have an important role to play in terms of food chain management."
"If they are not prepared to take action for food safety, then the European Commission is powerless."
"Finally, I should also like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that Belgium's ban on vegetable fats for cattle feed encourages fraud, owing to the limited availability of animal fats."
"Therefore, for this reason too, I support the call within the resolution to change to vegetable fats."
"Pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 p.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has had, over the last few years, a succession of food-related scandals."
"We have had mad cow disease, we are questioning GMOs and their labelling; we are now aware of the problem of the dioxin content in animal bone meal; we are seeing well-known soft drinks withdrawn from sale because they have been causing problems...we are all wondering what the next scandal will be: which one will be uncovered tomorrow."
"We must certainly not give in to a mood of panic, but it is quite reasonable for us to be asking ourselves about the quality of the products which we consume."
"Concern about food safety is unfortunately far too recent a development in Europe, emerging as it did at the time of the BSE crisis."
"This concerns all of us, consumers, small producers, industrial-scale producers and farmers."
"We are all concerned because we care about public health, and this drives us."
"But at the same time, we also feel very worried for farmers who are directly involved and who have been singled out for blame, and for the whole food-processing industry."
"All parties are still suffering."
"These scandals have done them an injustice because there are some producers and farmers, very honest people, who do their best to ensure that their processes are faultless."
"We should not punish the whole profession because of a few people within its ranks who are less than honest."
"What can be done?"
"We must recreate the right conditions for winning back consumer confidence in Europe."
"We must therefore strengthen Europe-wide rapid alert mechanisms."
"Member States must be willing to accept health inspections."
"Member States must not be made to feel that they are being singled out for blame if we ask them to make these inspections."
"We must all play the game."
"It is in everyone's interest as we have this huge single market."
"This condition must be met if the market is to work successfully."
"If it is not, consumers will boycott products and we will find ourselves once again in an economic situation which most people will find extremely difficult."
"Member States and the Council must therefore both show greater transparency."
"Quality producers who respect the environment must be offered support."
"We must, in effect, be brave enough to bring about a fundamental reform of agricultural policy if our consumers are going to want to consume our products again."
"We must guarantee vigilance and consistency in traceability and labelling."
"We must be especially resolute in discussions with the WTO."
"We must, quite simply, put an end to unacceptable practices."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am certainly very reassured by the fact that no one in this House, nor in the European Commission or the Council, has considered the Belgian dioxin crisis to be a purely Belgian problem."
"It is indeed the case that enormous problems have arisen in Belgium and, of course, the European Commission was right to state that serious mistakes have been made as regards the Belgian situation. However, those of my colleagues who have got to know a little bit about the case in the meantime, are aware that the Belgian government has taken very drastic measures and can now give guarantees to all consumers throughout the European Union."
"Indeed the Belgian dioxin problem also points to a European problem and as such, of course, it has to do with the European internal market, with competition policy and with flawed agricultural policy."
"I must say, Mr Commissioner and Mr President, that I welcomed the measures just announced by you both, but I would like to remind you that a number of those measures were placed on the table by the European Parliament some time ago. In fact, they have been there since the Committee of Enquiry into mad cow disease finished its work."
"First and foremost, Commissioner Fischler, I do indeed think that the European legislative framework needs to be improved."
"You are quite right in saying that we need new quality standards."
"I should be pleased if a positive list was indeed to be produced and we were to stop undermining the legislation on account of pressure and lobbying from the agro-industry."
"Or are there really people out there who can make out a good case for recycled products and waste entering our food chain?"
"Secondly, I wish to say something about the organisation of the European administration."
"My colleague Dagmar Roth-Behrendt has already said that we are of the opinion that food safety should remain under the control of the European Commission, and consequently also under that of the European Parliament."
"We believe that the European Commission should set up a service that is adequately staffed and has adequate finances but which above all, is also able to co-ordinate the controls undertaken by the national bodies and which is able to carry out its own controls, sometimes unannounced, on its own initiative, where and when it considers it appropriate."
"Mr Commissioner, I was particularly taken with your announcement regarding the legal foundation for a community initiative on food safety."
"It would indeed appear to me to be of benefit for action to be taken to prevent contamination of the food chain and to avoid public health disasters, without the bona fide farmers being the ones to suffer in the process."
"But to conclude, Mr Commissioner, Mr President, I should still like to emphasise, just as my colleagues have done, that we shall never be able to solve this food safety problem unless we undertake a radical and complete rethink of our agriculture and of our food production."
"We should not continue to give preferential treatment to large-scale agro-industry alone."
"In particular, we must support small-scale agriculture and healthy food production."
"As a matter of fact, I must say that I find it totally unacceptable that the Belgian farmers' union is refusing to co-operate on agricultural reform during this dioxin crisis, and on reducing the quantity of livestock in Belgium."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, there are perhaps quite a number of arguments in support of setting up a European Committee of Enquiry as part of this European approach."
"I should just like to say that we must give serious thought to the matter before we come to a decision, and we must think carefully as to whether it would not be better to use the respective committees to continue our work."
"Mr President, the last speaker can rest assured that I do not intend to talk exclusively about the mistakes made in Belgium either."
"I believe that a dioxin scandal or a BSE crisis, or whatever it may be, can occur anywhere in Europe."
"I therefore feel it is high time that the European Commission, together with the European Council, which I understand has given its full support, should develop initiatives as rapidly as possible for bringing about a food policy at European level."
"Of course, it goes without saying that it is all about public health."
"Providing guarantees for public health must be the first priority."
"On the same theme, I should just like to refer to the resolution adopted in October last year, when the European Parliament gave unanimous support to producing a European quality assurance policy for foodstuffs."
"All foods which are to enter the marketplace and receive a European label of quality will have to have been monitored throughout the food chain."
"Who will be able to do this?"
"We already know of a number of inspection bureaus that are offshoots of the biological production industry."
"If people do not want to buy such food, they want to have food in a different way, but so that we know exactly how it has been produced, then in my opinion that should be possible."
"The customer is king and the same inspection bureau that monitors biological food will also be able to monitor food subject to different standards."
"I think it is particularly important for this to happen in Europe."
"For if it happens in Europe, then we will be the first large trading block in the world to provide consumers with guarantees of food quality in this way."
"At the end of the day, that is what it is all about."
"It has already been pointed out from various quarters that our first priority is to guarantee fair competition, that if we demand something of the European producers, we can also demand the same standards of producers outside Europe."
"What would be the best way of bringing this about at the moment?"
"We are already aware that there are, at present, integrated production systems in various European countries."
"Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, to name a few countries at random, all have standards for integrated production."
"It is only a pity that these standards vary from country to country and I consider that unacceptable for such large common European markets."
"It is, therefore, for the Commission to find the common denominator as soon as possible."
"I should also like to talk about what Mr Prodi said yesterday on the subject of a European food bureau."
"I am not yet absolutely convinced of the need for one. The American Food and Drug Administration has some five to six thousand officials."
"Can the Commission afford to set up something of this kind?"
"I very much doubt it."
"I should therefore like to ask if it could send something to the European Parliament so that a comparison can be made."
"How does the American Food and Drugs Administration operate?"
"How would it be if a particular department were to be added to our office in Dublin, the Veterinary and Phytosanitary Bureau."
"They could perhaps fulfil the very same function considerably cheaper."
"That seems to me to be something that this Parliament should consent to."
"Finally, I wish Finland every success."
"We shall take stock at the end of this year."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to have been able to address the Commissioner for the Environment and other Commissioners too, because we know very well the harmful effects of dioxins on human health, and this is not merely an agricultural matter. It goes far beyond that."
"Along with many scientists, we estimate that the spreading of carcinogenic dioxins into the human food chain will undoubtably be the scourge of the next century."
"I really would like the Commissioner to hear what I have to say, because it is our job as well as his, within the framework of the policies which he will be putting into place, to find a way of integrating this problem into these different policies."
"We also believe that it is criminal to allow dangerous dioxins to spread into the human food chain."
"Recent studies have shown that mother's milk throughout the world is contaminated by dioxin, and that nobody is immune."
"We also know that the main causes, the things spitting out most dioxins, are incinerators."
"In this matter though, given the considerable financial cost of analysing it, we do not yet know how many people on continental Europe are currently contaminated by dioxins, imagining that they are eating foodstuffs grown in a nice clean field, which are actually being grown near old incinerators still in use."
"The European Union is responsible for conserving human health and the environment."
"This is why we are demanding first of all, a totally efficient warning system."
"It appears that we do not currently have one, given that France did not immediately interpret the announcement of contamination published by Belgium as a health alert."
"We are also asking for a parliamentary enquiry."
"We know that when the announcement was made about the chicken 'with dioxin in it' , consumers rushed out to buy fish, even though we know that fish are fed with the same food."
"What will be next on the list?"
"We very much hope that the Commission will be able to tell us."
"Mr President, although the BSE crisis was of an epidemiological nature and the dioxin crisis of a toxic nature, they share worryingly similar characteristics."
"Both crises were caused by the addition to animal feedingstuffs of raw materials derived from recycling and both caused serious problems for consumer health."
"These practices inevitably lead to the concentration and accumulation of elements which are either infectious or toxic."
"The dioxin crisis has also coincided with the scandal of the use of sewage sludge in the manufacture of feedingstuffs."
"In this case, the risk arises from the accumulation of heavy metals."
"But although we cannot go into a schematic analysis here, I must make a comment in this context: the Common Agricultural Policy and the World Trade Organisation are increasingly promoting the search for aggressive competitiveness as a fundamental principle, which worries me greatly because this type of official approval of competitiveness, above all else, will surely lead to practices presenting risks, such as the use of hormones or antibiotics for example, amongst the raw materials used in animal feedingstuffs."
"For the European Union, the precautionary principle in defence of consumer health should take precedence in these cases."
"One serious problem in this area concerns the insufficient regulations on the manufacture of feedingstuffs and the lack of a food policy in the European Union."
"Let me remind you of the fact that Community institutions have not taken heed of the recommendations and demands of the Parliament, which requested the prohibition of meat and bone meal in animal feedingstuffs."
"Nevertheless, the most serious problem arises from the fact that any ingredient which has not been expressly prohibited in the manufacture of feedingstuffs is implicitly authorised."
"Therefore, the Commission must draw up and formulate proposals for the creation of a positive list of raw materials authorised for use in animal feedingstuffs, together with a study of the incidence of production costs for cattle feedingstuffs in order to prevent incompatibilities with the CAP."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to remind the Commission that it must immediately formulate a food policy, in implementation of the Green Paper which was produced two years ago, and I would like to express my agreement with the comments of Mrs Roth-Behrendt with regard to the independent Food Agency."
"Mr President, given the history of the United Kingdom in relation to the BSE crisis, some delegates may consider that the UK is disqualified from giving an objective view."
"However, such a view would be wrong."
"It must be remembered that this was not our only crisis."
"We also had salmonella in eggs and listeria, giving us unparalleled experience in dealing with food safety crises."
"On the matter of listeria, this crisis came to a head in 1989 when over 200 babies and young children had been killed in preceding years, far more than died of new variant CJD."
"What fellow Members may not know is that the main source of the disease was contaminated paté sold from three Belgian plants."
"Only when UK health officials intervened was the problem finally resolved."
"What this says is that it is not just the UK that has food safety problems."
"But what we have learned from our incidents is that precipitate reaction can often do more damage than the initial crises."
"Action needs to be carefully considered and based on good science."
"In response to the dioxin incident, we see the Commission launching once again into frenzied legislative action."
"This is damaging British interests, in particular a company called Spalding Nutrition which is threatened by an entirely unnecessary ban."
"Thus, we would say: by all means have an enquiry, but first let us have a wide-ranging review of all Member States' systems for dealing with food and health scares, starting with an evaluation of the British system."
"Mr President, once again, we are faced with unbelievable sloppiness and criminal behaviour and, in this respect, there are definite parallels with past events, with one difference however: the Commission has taken the lessons on board and has acted more rapidly than in the past."
"Some Member States, in this particular instance Belgium, are still taking preventative consumer protection far too lightly."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, after listening to your speech this morning, I hope that there will be jump forward in terms of quality in the Council and I also hope that this will become evident through actions and decisions over the coming months."
"The Commission has now submitted a number of good recommendations, in part, recommendations which have already been called for in relation to BSE."
"Therefore, Mr Fischler, you will be able to rely on this Parliament for its full co-operation and support as regards the questions of open declaration, the safeguard clause and also the positive list."
"But I should also say that I find it absurd if Member States which, in the past, have not observed European safety standards for example, now wish to prohibit the use of meat and bone meal in general or, if the Commission, as regards the question of the use of oils and fats, at the same time makes a general issue in a working document of the recycling of leftovers."
"In this event, we are heading from recycling systems which are in working order towards unresolved waste problems."
"One last point: I am opposed to the inflammatory ideas expressed by news agencies who say that the Commission is no longer required."
"This is my point: tell the Parliament what you expect of veterinary surgeons and inspectors, make sure that the notification procedures function more quickly and that the allocation of posts within the Commission is more flexible."
"In this way, we can bring about an improved system within the Commission which is also under the control of the Commission."
"Here in Parliament, we will make sure that, in the case of co-decision making, matters are dealt with smoothly, quickly and in a proper manner and do not descend into chaos."
"The dioxin story is very familiar to those of us in the United Kingdom who have lived through BSE."
"Many of the ingredients are exactly the same - disagreeable and even disgusting practices in the preparation of some animal foodstuffs in a world of intensive agriculture and panic and deceit in some of the Member States concerned when the source of contamination is first discovered."
"We must remember this was discovered in January 1999 and the Commission was only able to take action after a period of months and a good deal of obfuscation."
"What we have now seen is the same set of arguments that perhaps they were trying to avoid: a consumer panic and protection of a market - a market which is actually now much more imperilled by the way in which the crisis has unfolded."
"I think there are dangers of overreaction and some Members have referred to that."
"What I would say is that we must learn lessons from this crisis."
"Firstly, a vigorous and properly funded inspectorate must be established to take a preventative role in this matter."
"We are now talking about significant changes in the law, long lists of further regulations of substances which may be banned."
"I certainly do not know, because I do not have the technical expertise, whether the range of recovered vegetable oils which are now seen to be a source of risk should be subject to an outright ban, or whether it should simply be limited to some section of kitchen waste which should never have been in any form of animal foodstuff in the first instance. What I do know is that the inspectorate which we have fought for - we had to fight to get an effective budget for it, to set up the veterinary office in Brussels and to make sure that we had the principle of general inspections throughout the Community - that inspectorate finds itself threatened and bullied."
"We have had examples in my country and in Belgium of people being physically threatened, of being blackmailed and in some instances even murdered!"
"Now when that is the situation, how can we say that the proposal, welcome as it is, to look at a Europe-wide Food and Drugs Agency and all these grand gestures can work when no individual inspector can penetrate into the world of crime and fraud which characterises sections of this industry."
"So, in my opinion, we have to put our own House in order in this matter."
"We have to be able to say, as the motion of the Socialist Group does, that the rule of law must apply, that we are a Community of law, and unless we have a universal application, which never happened in the wake of BSE, of the regulations, the situation cannot improve."
"Simply to bring forward new lists to imperil the producers and not to safeguard the consumer in the actions involved is the wrong way forward."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Fischler, in this dreadful state of affairs, we must take note of the fact that here clearly systematically toxic substances have been recycled via animal feed."
"You have talked about product contamination being the starting point of this crisis, but there is still no apparent mishap to which blame can be attributed."
"Clearly, this contamination can also take place systematically and therefore the full force of the law must be brought to bear."
"The criminal elements who exploit people by using them as human waste disposal units must be punished."
"Many demands which they have made are still under discussion by the BSE investigation committee."
"I hope that they can now be transposed quickly."
"Above all else Mr Fischler, the question of maximum values must be tied in with a ban on mixing or else this systematic disposal will continue."
"One more thought on waste: if we are talking about toxic substances, it is not....."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr President, in an internal market, the attention given to producing safe and healthy food must, of course, be organised on a cross-border basis."
"We appear to all be in agreement on this, but we still haven't managed to bring it about, either in terms of prescriptive legislation or in terms of monitoring and control."
"However, the dioxin crisis is not the first crisis to occur in European food policy and neither will it be the last."
"Let us hope that we shall be able to manage future crises more effectively."
"Of course the Member States must exercise more control, but there is also a need for control at the European level."
"That has already been made clear here this morning."
"It goes without saying that this must be brought about in a democratic manner, but what I ask myself is when is something at last to be done?"
"Commissioner Bonino told us the week after the parliamentary elections that she didn't think an agency would work out."
"Mr Mulder has already spoken here of the 5, 000 officials that would be needed to staff it."
"The new President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, told us yesterday that he is in fact considering such an agency."
"I should very much like to know which course of action the Commission actually intends to pursue, what actual steps have been taken, and whether the Commission intends to take account of the wishes expressed by the Parliament, both in the BSE reports and in the Green Paper on food, the resolution that we drew up on the subject."
"However effective the control, we can never rule out human error."
"We have learnt that the consequences of problems can escalate to an unexpectedly high level."
"This raises the question as to the purpose of Community solidarity."
"Should this really continue to be restricted to natural disasters and veterinary illness, or should it also come into play when human error has serious economic consequences, for many entirely blameless SMEs, among others."
"Hence my second question to the Commission."
"Has consideration already been given to creating a legal foundation for Community financial aid given to innocent victims?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, we owe it to the people of Europe to tell them the whole truth about this dioxin business."
"In addition to this, we must finally obtain world-wide figures for this sinister matter."
"That is why I am asking for a Temporary Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry to be established, with the responsibility of ensuring that the whole range of problems is brought to the table, and that all the lessons to be learned from it are looked at."
"I can see at least three."
"The first would be to amend European legislation which has shown obvious shortcomings."
"There are some products which need to be banned, and some mechanisms which need improving."
"The second is the question of the notification procedure which did not work and which must be clarified, toughened up and improved."
"And here we come to the vital matter of inspection."
"This Europe of ours will not work, and there will be no confidence that Europe does work, if we are not able to move from this type of co-ordination of inspection towards a genuine Community-wide approach to at least some aspects of food inspection."
"From this point of view, Mr Prodi's proposal for an authority or agency seems attractive."
"There is a need for an authority with specific responsibility for food safety, but it would have to remain independent, because we need both the Commission and Parliament to uphold the public interest in this matter."
"I would like to insist finally on the banning of animal bone meal."
"How many more times must we have the kind of accident that results from this practice before we put an end to this absurd system which leaves land fallow and farmers, who should be working in order to keep the heritage and the countryside of this Europe of ours alive, unable to work because we favour the use of recycled waste, particularly animal waste."
"This is an absurd and dangerous system which we should really bring to an end."
"I would like to end with the idea that behind this question, which is asked so often, lies the fundamental issue of the direction that farming is taking in Europe and around the world."
"We shall be reopening the WTO negotiations, and like everyone else in this Parliament, I expect you, the Commission to ensure that standards for health, the environment and society are set to limit and restrict this theory, which is becoming more and more dangerous, of a free market whose prime motive is profit."
"Europeans expect something better than this."
"Mr Commissioner, I would like to know if you are intending to propose a ban on animal bone meal and within what framework you think this measure might be possible."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, in recent years, Europe has been plunged into two significant health crises caused by food; firstly, BSE in the United Kingdom and, subsequently, the dioxin case in Belgium."
"This should give us cause for reflection. But rather than just reflecting, we should take urgent and effective steps."
"The effects of these crises have been collective panic amongst consumers, some unfortunate cases of people affected, and irreparable and significant financial losses in the agricultural and food industries."
"Furthermore, they have caused distrust amongst consumers, damaged the reputation of the European agricultural and food industries amongst third countries and caused headaches for the governments of the Member countries. I can confirm this as a former head of food policy in Spain."
"I want to highlight the fact that this serious health crisis is being fought with instruments which were designed for other purposes connected to the Common Agricultural Policy, such as the Standing Veterinary Committee which was intended to monitor animal health."
"Europe should have a professional Scientific Committee which guarantees food safety, including animal feedingstuffs which are another link in the food chain."
"It should have control mechanisms which allow for prevention rather than a posteriori stop-gap solutions and must have in place mechanisms to penalise Member countries which put public health at risk by deliberately obscuring causes of risk for a certain length of time."
"Let us bear in mind that the necessary liberalisation of the markets and the opening up to third countries is exposing agriculture and cattle farming to difficult levels of competition and if effective preventative measures are not taken, the race to lower production costs will sooner or later bring about another similar case."
"Legislation is important as well as ecologically friendly agriculture, but it is not enough."
"We must act through effective mechanisms."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to the Commission's chaotic information policy."
"In the case of dioxin, 15 days passed between the communication of the Standing Veterinary Committee and the official alert, while Commissioner Bonino simply announced that she did not drink Belgian milk."
"All of this was conveniently manipulated by the media."
"Mr President, I want to focus on one particular issue which I feel has not been fully explored."
"Dioxin, and in this case its source chemical PCB, is one of the number of non-biodegradable bio-accumulative chemicals that we know are contaminating the food chain around the world."
"There are rules and regulations already in existence for the correct and proper disposal of these substances."
"Indeed, I was Parliament's rapporteur on the Council and Commission proposal for the elimination of PCBs and PCDs we dealt with in the last Parliament."
"We have to ask if these existing European rules and regulations are being properly followed."
"Are the responsible authorities given the duty to dispose of these chemicals in a correct and safe way, following the rules, or are they deliberately avoiding them and disposing of these chemicals in the wrong way?"
"This incident appears to indicate that is the case."
"Unlike bacterial or some other form of organic or biological contamination of the food chain, we have here a finite quantity of substance that could easily be eliminated."
"Would the Commission please look into why the regulations on the proper disposal of PCBs and PCDs are not being correctly followed?"
"Will they please investigate where the substances came from that caused this incident?"
"Mr President, the dioxin crisis has demonstrated that consumers want safe food."
"Farmers produce it, but things sometimes go wrong through no fault of their own."
"At such times, it falls to the authorities to do something."
"As far as that is concerned, we should note that although this crisis originated in Belgium, it affects countries throughout the EU. I should like to propose, therefore, that we quickly get to work on setting up a food safety bureau, and that more money is devoted to this."
"I should like in particular to lend my support to the proposals put forward by MEP Böge on this point."
"Let the Commission advise the Council of Ministers on what is necessary in terms of money and manpower, with a view to dealing with this more quickly."
"For citizens and farmers are entitled to expect the authorities to respond effectively to a crisis of this kind and although it may not be appropriate to term a natural disaster, it comes very close to one when you see what the effects are."
"I would thus advocate quickly getting down to work and setting up a food safety bureau under the direction of Commissioner Fischler."
"My second point is that there should be improved harmonisation of national legislation as regards criminal law, with a view to dealing rapidly with those who infringe the laws on this point, which is, in fact, a criminal matter."
"I should like to draw attention to two matters: firstly, the side effects."
"It is Belgian farmers and Belgian consumers who have been the ones to suffer."
"In fact, it is a natural disaster of sorts and we actually ought to be able to say: this is a matter for the European institutions."
"I should like to support MEP Thyssen's call for the Commission to be more generous in that respect and to enter into discussion with the Parliament on how matters of this kind should be dealt with in future."
"Secondly, what is the Commission doing about the fact that the minute such a crisis arises, the next thing to happen is that Belgian pigs are transported to other countries, are slaughtered and labelled there, and are therefore using a different label?"
"This has repercussions for the market."
"What does the Commissioner hope to do at this juncture and in terms of creating effective policy?"
"As a representative of the European People's Party, I should particularly like to point out that whilst we cannot prevent disasters, as administrators, as parliamentarians, we must take the opportunity to deal with matters in a completely effective way."
"That is why I wish to make you fully aware of these two points in particular."
"Mr President, this House is expected to produce at last one clear statement in relation to the dioxin crisis."
"I would sum this up by saying that on the question of health, we do not want to enter into a compromise, nor do we want to compromise on the issue of industrial crimes."
"This crisis, just like the BSE crisis, is throwing up questions which we must answer, both in concrete terms and also very quickly."
"Are the resources which we have allocated to carry out checks sufficient at the end of the day?"
"And are they efficient? To what extent are crises of this sort also an opportunity for certain Member States, as the Commissioner has just mentioned, to set up additional trade barriers over and above the measures imposed?"
"What resources shall we place at our disposal, together with the Commission and especially with the Council, so that definite checks and early warning systems can be introduced?"
"I am raising these issues because I am of the opinion that we do not have to answer these questions in tedious or prolonged committees of enquiry."
"Nor am I convinced that a government Commissioner responsible for dealing with a crisis in a country will concern himself with efficiency and credibility."
"Let us simply show, at our level and at a national level, that we possess the political will to act rather than simply to analyse."
"The consumer expects a swift and efficient response, not contradictory statements by experts who engender more mistrust than trust with consumers."
"Quick, efficient action is also expected by farmers since, in our country, in Belgium, well over 90 % of farmers are victims of this crisis."
"We should not punish these farmers who have invested many years in the quality and also the clarity of their controls."
"I therefore ask you not to give a de facto refusal to provide financial assistance within the framework of the European Union."
"We know, in the meantime, how crises originate; now we must finally provide ourselves with the means of avoiding them."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all it was cattle and BSE, now the fuss is all about poultry and dioxin."
"I do not want to know what will be next."
"Therefore, I cannot repeat often enough the importance of maintaining animals in proper conditions and having a food processing industry which is conscious of its responsibilities."
"The chain begins with the farmers, but then leads via the foodstuffs industry to our dinner plates."
"As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is a healthy diet, and this is something which concerns us all."
"Therefore, we all have a responsibility."
"I do not want to insinuate anything, yet clearly precautionary measures and careful inspections in an area as sensitive as the human food chain were disregarded."
"Extra special care is necessary when we are talking about highly toxic substances such as dioxins."
"All of us here know that dioxin was used in the Vietnam war and I would also today like to remember Seveso."
"Therefore, we need a comprehensible labelling system for the foodstuffs industry as well."
"The image of all Austrian foodstuffs is being damaged by such incidents."
"European agriculture will be an important topic for discussion at the next WTO round and the world market will pose immense problems for us over the next few years."
"One possibility for our continuing survival is quality production in the EU."
"Our foods must be safe and healthy. This must be our trademark and represent an opportunity for our farmers."
"We must do everything we can to allay consumer fears."
"Quality must take precedence but quality also has its price, ladies and gentlemen."
"In this regard, I welcome the establishment of an independent European Food Agency."
"In the long run, we will all benefit from it."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree in many respects with what has been said here today."
"The safety of consumers is vital, not just for the consumers themselves, obviously, but for the whole food chain from the field to the dining table."
"In fact, consumer safety is an absolutely essential aspect of an idea which has become familiar in connection with Agenda 2000, that of the European agricultural model."
"That model includes the notion that the farmer must be able to trust in the quality of the production foods he or she purchases, such as animal feed."
"The dioxin crisis is also proof of this as its result is that tens of thousands of innocent farmers will suffer heavy financial losses."
"I agree, in this regard, with the comments of Mrs Grossetête and Mr Souchet on the European agricultural model."
"I would like to return to two particular comments."
"Mr Florenz raised the issue of the position of the Council in this crisis."
"This theme was taken up by Mr Böge, among others."
"I would like to stress the fact that the Council embarked on a series of measures as soon as the problem arose."
"The Agriculture and Health Ministers began work on the matter in co-operation with the Commission immediately."
"As far as the Agriculture Ministers are concerned, the conclusions were adopted at political level in the Council in June, and now, again in terms of practical action, in the Council last Monday."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt mentioned the independent European Food Agency."
"This was also mentioned by Mr Thyssen, Mr Mulder and Mr Van Dam."
"Regarding this, I would like to state very clearly that food monitoring is the responsibility of the Member States, of the regions and the local authorities."
"At Community level we need effective control, but the office responsible for overseeing the work of the Member States is sufficient for that."
"I would like to give my strongest assurance to Mrs Roth-Behrendt that Finland will act with complete transparency in this matter."
"Mr President, I shall convey the messages I have heard here to my colleagues in the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for conducting a very constructive and healthy debate on this difficult question."
"I would like to briefly add to certain points that have been raised."
"Firstly, the question of the applicability of the PCB tests for pork is still open."
"The problem, and this particularly applies to the Belgian Members of Parliament who have asked to speak on this issue, that we are still faced with is that as a prerequisite for using this test, parallel tests on dioxin and PCB content must be available so that a correlation can be established."
"In order to do this however, a minimum number of samples is required."
"Thus far, we have received a total of eight such samples from the Belgian authorities."
"This is far too few."
"As soon as we obtain the necessary results from the Belgian government, we are ready to implement the required measures immediately."
"A second issue which has been raised by many is the question of the use of Community funds to aid farmers who have been victims of this crisis."
"In my introductory remarks on this issue, I pointed out that in the area of market regulations, we have put in place a whole range of measures to alleviate the difficult situation in different areas."
"I also pointed out that we have thus far authorised eight national subsidies after notifications."
"However, as far as a direct Community subsidy for Belgian products is concerned, I have to make it clear that there is no basis in Community law for doing so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with those of you who have asserted here that the mixing together of substances which are highly contaminated with dioxins, and which is suspected here, is still a criminal act and not an animal illness."
"We can only pay compensation or subsidies where animal illnesses are concerned."
"Applause"
"Mention should also be made of the fact that recently, there has allegedly been increased dioxin values in Germany."
"I do not want to leave this matter hanging as that would be unfair."
"What is the issue here?"
"Several clay minerals were tested which are also partly used as binding agents in the production of animal feedingstuffs."
"In some of these clay minerals, increased dioxin values were actually found."
"This dioxin, ladies and gentlemen, is several million years old, and is therefore nothing new."
"So we must take care that these substances have also been tested where they are used in the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs."
"At the same time, this also demonstrates that it is not possible to have a zero dioxin value."
"Dioxin these days is an ubiquitous substance that can be found anywhere in the world and which also occurs, unfortunately, in our countryside."
"What we have to prevent, therefore, is the mixing together of dioxin-containing substances or at least ensure that such substances do not enter the animal feed chain via another route in spite of sufficient controls."
"In this regard, I am also of the opinion, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that it is irresponsible that we do this by means of the dilution factor."
"That cannot be the plan."
"On the other hand, however, we must discuss further how we should deal with animal waste products in general."
"Things are actually not as simple as Mr Böge suggests."
"It is also illogical, for example, that it is permissible to cook soup for human consumption from cattle marrowbone, or that the cattle marrow is even served in restaurants as a delicacy, while its use is prohibited in the animal feed industry."
"Therefore, I am very much in favour of ruminants not obtaining their feed from materials which are animal in origin. Such a black and white policy in this area is not possible, however, if we do not want to run the risk of finding ourselves with enormous difficulties in terms of waste disposal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a couple of small points to finish with which I consider to be important. Firstly, repeated mention has been made of the issue of safety and quality requirements and an appropriate label."
"Let me be quite clear on this point. We are not saying that if we have a quality label, we can, so to speak, permit a two-tier system as regards safety requirements."
"The safety requirements must be satisfied for every foodstuff; there can be no compromise on this."
"Of course, however, there have to be other possibilities for designating particular quality accordingly."
"In this regard, we have the resolution from Autumn '98, which I commented on at the time."
"My stance remains the same today."
"Last point: Hormone meat."
"On this issue I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to draw your attention to the fact that, the day before yesterday, the USA announced that they are abandoning, at least temporarily, the supply of hormone-free meat to Europe since they are not currently in a position to observe the guarantees required by us."
"As you know, however, we have made considerable changes to our regulations so that not only are spot checks carried out on imports but that every import is scrutinised."
"Just so you know!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 p.m."
"Madam President, I should like an error to be rectified."
"In Annex I of the Minutes for yesterday, Wednesday 21 July, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck's name appears under the Liberals in the list of Members that took part in the vote."
"Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is no longer an MEP."
"However, Mr Ward Beysen, who succeeded Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is an MEP and he participated in this vote."
"Might I then request that the name Neyts-Uyttebroeck be deleted as regards the first round of voting as well as the second, and that the name Ward Beysen be added."
"Of course."
"The Belgians did, in fact, send the details of their newly elected Members rather late, and the services will, naturally, make the necessary changes to these lists."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, 21 July, my name appears as a Member of the ARE Group."
"I believe that the ARE Group no longer exists as a political entity."
"Politically, I belong to the Liberal Group."
"I would be grateful if this error could be rectified."
"Absolutely."
"This correction will, of course, be made."
"Madam President, as Mr Sánchez has pointed out, there are errors in the Minutes, but not only because Mr Sánchez is included in the European Radical Alliance, which does not exist - and this has also happened with MEPs Bautista, Hudghton and MacCormick - but because I, although I belong to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, appear in the Group of Non-attached Members."
"I therefore respectfully request that the Minutes be revised since, to be quite frank, they are awful."
"Of course, we will be systematically checking all of that to ensure that everything is correct."
"Madam President, my intervention concerns the same matter."
"I appear in both votes as belonging to the Group of Non-attached Members, although I belong to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"May I ask that the appropriate rectifications be made."
"A small matter, Madam President."
"Is it possible to sort out the microphones?"
"Those of us that must listen to interpretation for nearly every speaker are finding it very difficult to hear with the volume of these mikes."
"A small matter, but please resolve it."
"Applause"
"Mrs Doyle, we are working on a list which will be as complete as possible, of all the problems - and unfortunately there are many - that we have encountered in this building."
"The list will be compiled at the beginning of next week."
"It will be sent to all MEPs - I insisted on this - so that you can each add to it if needs be."
"We will then, of course, do everything we can to rectify all the problems."
"Madam President, I would just like to point out that although I, like Mrs Thomas Moreau, took part in the second round of the Election of Quaestors, this fact is not recorded in the Minutes."
"We shall have this corrected as well."
"Madam President, yesterday's Minutes state quite correctly that I asked you to supply all the MEPs with the preliminary draft by the Committee of the Wise Men, if such a draft exists."
"The Minutes state that your response to me was that you would take the steps necessary to achieve this."
"Madam President, have you, from your position of importance, had the time to take any action in this matter yet?"
"Yes, Mr Staes."
"You will shortly receive chapter VII of this report."
"The Chairman of the Committee has sent me chapter VII and he says that the other chapters will only be available on 13 September."
"I have already replied to him, asking to see him in order to let him know that this arrangement does not meet the wishes of our Assembly at all."
"Applause"
"Madam President, it seems that there have been some amendments to the nomination of Members of the committees and delegations."
"I would like to know if I am the only person who is not aware of these amendments, or if there are other MEPs in the same position, because before deciding if I am for or against an amendment, I would like to know what it is about."
"I shall announce these amendments very slowly so that everyone will be aware of them."
"As you will see, they are not particularly problematic, and this is why they have not been distributed in advance, although obviously, all amendments should otherwise be distributed beforehand."
"Madam President, I respect the individual way in which you conduct sessions but could you perhaps ensure that it is standardised as far as possible that once the speaking time has expired, and before the microphone is switched off, an acoustic warning, made with the small hammer, sounds first so that a speaker is not simply cut off mid-sentence?"
"I have taken note of your request."
"Madam President, apparently the Committee of the Wise Men may be presenting their report to the President and the group leaders sometime today."
"If that is the case, could you please ensure that these are the final conclusions and that they are available to all Members as soon as possible?"
"Mr Elles, I have just given an answer to Mr Staes."
"The position is exactly the one I have just stated, which is that one chapter of this report has been made available to us."
"This is by no means acceptable, and that is why we are pursuing our demand as I have just told Mr Staes."
"VOTE"
"Six amendments have been submitted to me, and I would like to repeat the point that I have just made, that they are merely redistributions of posts between various political groups, and by that I mean that they represent the exchange of various posts within the same group, or the addition of an appointment for a post which was vacant."
"Madam President, you say that these are just revisions or changes, but we would like the Socialist Group to tell us, concerning its amendment 1, if it is an addition or a real change, and we would like the same answer from the European Socialist Group on their amendment 4."
"Mrs Grossetête, I propose that you hear what I have to say, if you don't mind, and then, if you are not satisfied, you may ask for more detailed explanations."
"That is a good question."
"The amendments have not been given to any Member."
"I do not know what Mrs Grossetête's information networks may be, but no favouritism has been shown to any Member."
"By successive votes, Parliament adopted all the proposals"
"Madam President, would you please bear in mind that our group is called 'Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance' , that it has two components and that this is a new group and should be referred to as such."
"I do not know if you noticed, but when I called for your first amendment, I was careful to give the name in its entirety."
"I thought that afterwards, we might save time by abbreviating it."
"Applause"
"(Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution)"
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, can you confirm this latest electronic vote?"
"Is it a vote by roll call or not?"
"The President replied that the vote was confirmed"
"May we have a vote by roll call?"
"No, Mr Beazley, requests for votes by roll call must be made within certain time limits."
"Applause"
"It is quite possible that some Members may have voted electronically rather than by hand, but they are entirely within their rights to do so."
"In any case, I personally did not observe the result, but the machine deems it to be correct, and the result stands as I have just announced it."
"We shall now proceed to the resolution of the Group of the PPE and European Democrats."
"As this resolution has not been adopted, we shall vote on the other resolutions."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0008/99), on behalf of the PPE Group on the conclusions of the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Madam President, firstly, please allow me to intervene so that there may be equal treatment amongst all of the groups."
"I believe that you said that it was the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats."
"I believe that the third part of the group's title is missing, and I say this so that all of us may be treated equally."
"Secondly, Madam President, I believe that the proposal that you are suggesting we put to the vote has already been rejected. I think we should move on to the next one."
"No, Mr Barón Crespo, we had a joint motion for a resolution which was issued by two political groups, the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, and the Liberal Group."
"This resolution has just been rejected."
"We are therefore proceeding now to the vote on the various resolutions which have been put forward individually by the groups."
"That is how it stands."
"Do you agree?"
"Madam President, in the event that the PPE Group and the Liberal Group present a joint motion for a resolution, as I understand it, the other proposals are automatically rejected."
"Absolutely not. That would have been the case had their resolution been adopted, but it was not."
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0014/99), on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the results of the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0016/99), tabled by MEP Hautala and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0019/99), tabled by Mr Goerens and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0024/99), tabled by Mr Bonde, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities on the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0025/99), on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Cologne European Council meeting on 3 and 4 June 1999"
"Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution"
"Madam President, I would already have asked for the Minutes to have been approved this morning if I had seen that Annex III had not been distributed for our perusal."
"This morning, we found on our seats the Minutes containing two Annexes while the third Annex had not been distributed."
"They were only pigeonholed over the course of the morning."
"I wish to protest at this and would like to ask about the reasoning behind it."
"Approval of the Minutes dictates that all three Annexes, and not just two, are available."
"Secondly, I wish to point out that the third Annex contains the composition of the committees of delegations, and I would like to ask whether yesterday, when we took a vote on this issue - which is what apparently happened - whether the lists with the names and the composition were available or whether we took a vote without knowledge of the composition. I consider this to be an unheard of sequence of events if no appropriate submission was forthcoming."
"We have just voted on the composition of the committees and delegations."
"As far as the Annexes are concerned, you are indeed quite right. Members must have all relevant documents, and let me assure you that we will see that they do."
"Madam President, the Cologne Council launched two processes for institutional reform which, to our mind, avoid the fundamental issues."
"Firstly, it decided to work on a Charter which will bring together citizens' basic rights already in force throughout the Union, but it did not state exactly what legal basis it should end up having, nor what it would add to current legislation."
"This is an obvious case of propaganda, with the aim of bringing to the table the idea of a European Constitution which would itself legitimise a Super-State ready to be constituted."
"The second Cologne initiative was the work towards an Intergovernmental Conference on improving institutions with the future enlargement of the European Union in mind."
"Its mandate has expanded beyond what was foreseen in the first Article of the Protocol on Institutions found in the Annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam, because the Cologne European Council, without consultation, added the option to extend voting to the qualified majority."
"This solution strikes us as completely unworkable, for in order to prepare for enlargement, we need institutions which are not more rigid but more flexible, and that is why we feel that this mandate for negotiation must be set right by the Helsinki Council."
"The biggest drawback about the Cologne conclusions is that they made a huge omission."
"Almost nothing has been learned from the institutional point of view, from the major crisis, prompted last March by the collective resignation of the Commission, as a result of irresponsible management."
"No amendment to the Treaty was proposed."
"The possible reforms are being dealt with by the Anti-Fraud Office and by Romano Prodi himself, who told us yesterday that he would be able to resolve almost everything by changing the internal workings of the Commission and by putting forward a Members' Code of Conduct."
"We are being taken for a ride, because the problems which led to the resignation of the Commission are much more serious."
"They represent a huge gulf between the Union's institutions and its citizens, which can only be remedied by reform on a huge scale which would establish a Europe of Nations."
"By forgetting this, the Cologne Council managed to dodge the question of democracy itself."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution from the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the Cologne European Council Meeting because we found the main content to be sound."
"However, we wish to draw attention to three points on which we do not share the group's position."
"These are:"
"1.The points concerning an EU defence policy, since Denmark has a reservation in this matter.2.The point concerning the statute for European parliamentarians."
"We abstained from voting on this point, since the European Parliament's proposal for a statute is unsatisfactory.3.The point concerning the next Intergovernmental Conference, since we consider that the Conference should only cover enlargement and not be hampered by extensive reforms."
"Madam President, with regard to the resolution approved on Kosovo, and in particular with respect to point 11, which appears to be an opportunity for political dialogue between the different positions, I think that it is important, within the declaration of voting intent, to emphasise a certain number of aspects."
"One of these is related to the structure of the reconstruction agency in Kosovo."
"The fact that a decentralised, flexible structure for improving efficiency has been identified is very important, but this must be linked to a more comprehensive assessment."
"Since 1990, certain areas of Europe, Southern Italy, and, in particular, Puglia, have been suffering because of their geographic location from the effects of migration flows."
"The Kosovo conflict has further complicated this situation."
"In attempting to evaluate the situation, a more comprehensive assessment of the problem will be crucial, as will efforts to identify solutions which, within the flexibility of the structure, are able to highlight any aspects which may be linked to the problems of these territories of Southern Italy."
"As far as I am concerned, there is no reason for soul-searching. Europe was right to use military intervention."
"Europe must do everything to punish the murderers. Europe must contribute to the reconstruction of the region."
"I would like to say that, above and beyond these three points, the most important thing for me is that we quickly build a politically solid Europe, to speed up enlargement in the East in order to strengthen democracy, to eliminate the residues of National Communism and to reassure democratic governments by giving them the possibility of association and then accession."
"The Balkan region is still very sensitive, and there is no guarantee that we will not face another, even more serious crisis."
"There is, therefore, no time to lose."
"The issue that we are dealing with during this constitutive session is an extremely serious one: that of the dioxin crisis."
"I am pleased that it features on our agenda and that representatives of the European Commission and the Council spoke on this matter this morning at the request of our Assembly."
"The scandal of chickens and other animals being contaminated by dioxin, this carcinogenic substance, brought back very bad memories for all consumers."
"This is the unpleasant impression for many of us, of having been through this scenario before - a scenario in which consumers are the last to find out what they are eating, and yet whose health is at serious risk."
"The vote for this resolution is a genuine sign of the will of the European Parliament to get to the very bottom of this business and to answer consumers' legitimate concerns."
"At the time of the mad cow crisis, the European Parliament did not spare any effort to have measures adopted for the protection of consumers."
"Through its Temporary Committees of Enquiry, it followed with great vigilance the way the European Commission and the Member States managed the crisis."
"Its efficiency has been unanimously recognised by all European institutions."
"This is why I, like many of my colleagues, feel that we must set up a Temporary Committee of Enquiry on the dioxin crisis."
"Short-term solutions must be found in order to resolve problems caused by the contamination of foodstuffs in Belgium, and in the longer term, debate must be started on the many questions first thrown up by the mad cow crisis and which are again coming to the fore because of this new food crisis."
"I am thinking, for example of the Belgian government's lack of transparency in alerting the European Commission so late, and of the lack of information which was given to consumers."
"On a more global scale, the question being asked is 'what kind of food policy do we want within the European Union?' ."
"The European Parliament, as well as numerous consumer associations, has been able to give answers which are also ways forward for thinking about a new definition of the European Union's approach to food."
"This must uphold the interests of consumers, it must ensure that the precautionary principle prevails over all other principles, and it must set up an integrated inspection of the food chain in its entirety, from producer to consumer."
"This traceability is essential for food safety."
"This is, therefore, a global debate which we Members of the European Parliament must sustain throughout the next legislature."
"It must cover dioxin, hormones and GMOs which are all very controversial issues."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany we have a saying: 'Was ich nicht weiß, macht mich nicht heiß ' , i.e., ' What the eye cannot see, the heart cannot grieve over' ."
"At a personal level, this holds true, but when it comes to consumer protection, this maxim can not apply."
"The dioxin scandal has once again demonstrated that an open information policy is an essential prerequisite for effective and comprehensive consumer protection."
"The irresponsible behaviour of the Belgian authorities and the withholding of information relating to animal feed and foodstuffs contaminated with dioxins have shaken consumer confidence permanently."
"Consumers must be able to feel confident that they will not be presented with health-endangering foodstuffs."
"This equally applies to farmers as regards animal feed."
"They obtain their feed from industrial enterprises and do not have the opportunity to inspect these products for harmful substances."
"They must also be able to have the confidence that the animal feed is completely untainted."
"On the one hand, this clarifies the responsibility of the competent authorities which are responsible for inspecting products and, on the other, makes it clear that the dioxin scandal is not a problem nor a mistake on the part of agriculture."
"It is solely a failure on the part of industry."
"Farmers, along with consumers, are the ones who have suffered as a result of this scandal."
"Through no fault of their own, it is the farmers who have to accept heavy losses and who must also carry the burden of trying to win back the trust of the consumers."
"Healthy feed is a precondition for healthy animals and thereby also for healthy foodstuffs."
"Equally, it is a prerequisite for a flourishing farming industry with good operating profits."
"Like other products, animal feed and foodstuffs could also be traded throughout the European Union without boundaries."
"Nevertheless, or precisely because of this, it is important that consumer safety is safeguarded by the Member States and the European Union."
"European standards exist in the area of foodstuffs, ensuring that products are properly inspected."
"Similar monitoring should also be put in place for animal feed."
"The dioxin scandal has clearly demonstrated one thing - if animal feed, as the first link in the food chain, is contaminated, the inspection of foodstuffs comes too late."
"That concludes voting time."
"The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, today's Minutes include an Annex indicating that the Bureaux of delegations of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States have already been elected."
"However, if you read the Rules of Procedure, you will see that Rule 170(6) states that the appointment of the joint parliamentary committees is somewhat different from the interparliamentary delegations and must therefore be carried out under the same conditions as the appointment of the committees."
"This is how we have done it in the past."
"This means that elections must take place as for the committees."
"The fact that there are discussions between the groups of parties is another matter altogether."
"So, in the case of interparliamentary delegations, the Plenum decides, whereas in the case of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States, in my opinion, Rule 170(6) applies."
"I would like to make that point."
"There is a second point which I would also like to make."
"The deadline for submitting the relevant proposals was ten o'clock yesterday."
"However, the proposals - that is, the preliminary draft - on which we voted did not reach us until after ten o'clock and so I must call the entire vote into question."
"I would ask you to consider both points and give me your feedback at the next sitting."
"I will make the President aware of your first point, and she will discuss it with the Presidents of the Groups at the Conference of Presidents."
"On your second point, the services have informed me that you were given all the documents relating to the Minutes of the previous sitting."
"In any case, your comments have been noted."
"Madam President, I would like to ask that the results of the votes be displayed on the indicator board for at least ten seconds so that in future they can be noted down."
"We now have a new voting device and perhaps this can be programmed to display the results for at least ten seconds."
"This has been noted."
"I think that many here share your concern."
"It is important that we find out the result of every vote."
"Madam President, I have a question on Wednesday's Minutes, or, more specifically, on Annex 3 which was first distributed yesterday afternoon and which contains the proposals for nominations to the Bureaux of interparliamentary delegations."
"I would like to know whether the typing error, which is actually binding, has since been corrected."
"It meant that my colleague Sumberg from the PPE Group would have become a deputy chairperson in two of these delegations, i.e. for Japan and China."
"In actual fact, colleague Jarzembowski has become deputy chairperson for the Japan delegation."
"Has this been corrected and is this binding?"
"This correction has been made and everything is now as it should be."
"Madam President, I wish to refer to the comments which the President, Mrs. Fontaine, made yesterday concerning the prohibition of the use of mobile telephones inside the hemicycle. There is nothing more important in our Parliament than talking and communication, but in debates and not through external means of communication such as mobile telephones with the ringing and distortion that they cause."
"I ask that real measures be taken, where necessary, to impose sanctions, just as we might penalise those who do not vote."
"Those who distort the use of words in this hemicycle must be penalised, forbidden entry or have their mobile telephones confiscated."
"I request that effective measures be taken."
"Applause"
"I shall certainly make the President aware of this, but I think that the first step is to appeal first to the courtesy and public-spiritedness of our colleagues."
"I am sure that, given time, everyone will find ways of treating one another with respect."
"In any case, I hope that we will not find ourselves having to impose disciplinary measures."
"We will discuss this within the Bureau to see how this problem can be dealt with."
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to point out that the German interpreting service has clearly failed."
"However, I also have a second point: are you aware of the significance of Mr Posselt's explanation?"
"If the error, as pointed out by Mr Posselt stands, we do not have a properly elected President and Vice-President in the delegations."
"This is an extremely serious matter and must therefore be treated with urgency."
"I would ask that this be clarified and dealt with as soon as possible by the Bureau because this means we are entering the summer recess with a completely unclear situation with regard to the delegations and this must not happen in this Parliament."
"Applause"
"On your first point, I have been told that the German interpreting service appears to be working again, and I am very relieved that this is the case."
"On your second point, I think that you are right."
"I shall inform our President of the comments which you and others have made."
"As you are part of the Bureau, I know that you will also make her aware of this."
"Madam President, it has become a bit of a tradition in this House for Members to stand up and say that their name was not on the attendance list for the previous day."
"My name does not appear on the list for yesterday for some reason or other."
"Perhaps it might be a better system if one could just go up to the front desk somewhere and point out to a member of staff that one's name was not on the list, rather than having to rise and inform the whole House."
"We shall be attending to this."
"Incidentally, you have just given me the opportunity to tell our new colleagues that the procedure you have just mentioned is available to all Members. This makes the sitting somewhat easier and also means that an MEP does not have to come and point out the omission orally."
"Madam President, I was very interested to hear the main findings of the second report by the Committee of Wisemen on Belgian radio this morning."
"But I think it is a bit of a shame that in this high temple of communication, it appears to have been easier for the report to find its way into the newspapers, even in a far and distant land such as Belgium, than onto the desks of the MEPs."
"My colleague Mr Staes raised this matter yesterday."
"I understand that he succeeded in getting hold of the report, on which I congratulate him, but to tell the truth, I had at least expected that all MEPs would receive this report yesterday."
"That is right. It seems that the report has indeed been given out to all MEPs."
"Perhaps you should approach the distribution services."
"In any case, this is what I have been told, and I shall see to it that it is confirmed, and that everyone does indeed have access to this report."
"Besides, you know that, unfortunately, the media sometimes manages to obtain information before the official channels are able to act."
"This is one of the great debates in society today."
"Madam President, I should like to raise a point of order, and he should not take this personally, regarding the presence of the Commissioner."
"The subject we are shortly to discuss is the 'non-competition clause in football' ."
"That is on the agenda for this morning."
"The Commissioner for competition policy, Mr Van Miert, ought to be present for this."
"It has often been the case in the past that Commissioners who did not have competence in the agenda item have attended here."
"I would urge you as the Bureau, to discuss with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, that when certain items appear on our agenda, the Commissioners who attend are those who actually have competence for the area concerned."
"Mr Kinnock is not to take this personally, for it may be that he is a great fan of football, and I know that he is a talented Commissioner, but I think this matter is too important to have to bring before the new Parliament again."
"It is the Commissioners with responsibility for the topic concerned that should be here when their subject is being discussed."
"Applause"
"As you know, in his new Commission, Mr Prodi has nominated a Commissioner with special responsibility for relations with Parliament."
"We must be able to make Mr Prodi and his new Commissioner aware of your proposal to have Commissioners come and give detailed replies to questions which are relevant to them. Having said that, the Commission is a collective body, and Mr Kinnock certainly made use of all the necessary information in replying to us this morning, and I would like to thank him for being here."
"The Minutes were approved"
"French Football Federation fine"
"The next item on the agenda is the Commission's statement on the fine imposed on the French Football Federation following its infringement of the European legislation on competition."
"I should like to begin by responding to the words of Maij-Weggen."
"The point is well made and well taken."
"I know that she feels strongly about this and that she is not alone in that."
"Whilst I obviously cannot commit my colleague, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who is happily a Member of this House at the present time, to the development of her policy and approach in this House, there are several who feel that the time is right for further discussion between the Commission and Parliament on some of the procedures and conventions of this House, which obviously meets in more than one place, as well as the conventions and procedures of the College."
"I hope that discussion can proceed without great delay because there could be developments which would be of mutual benefit and would actually promote accountability and transparency in the service of the Union."
"On the question before the House, I would like to make the following statement on behalf of the Commission."
"This week, the Commission issued a formal legal decision against the local organisers of last year's football World Cup tournament in France."
"The organisers were the CFO."
"That decision followed the organisation's use of discriminatory sales arrangements for tickets for matches."
"As the House will recall, in 1996 and 1997 the system used by CFO favoured consumers who were able to provide an address in France."
"In the view of the Commission, that constituted an abuse of the organisation's dominant position in the market which is contrary to Article 82 of the Treaty."
"This was the first case in Community history in which Article 82 of the Treaty has been used to penalise a discriminatory practice that harms the interests of consumers without having a significant effect on the market."
"In reaching its decision therefore, the Commission took account of the fact that there were no previous decisions of the Commission or case-law from the Court of Justice to guide CFO in its ticketing policy."
"In addition it was evident that the ticketing arrangements used by CFO in 1996 and 1997 were exactly similar to those employed in previous World Cup tournaments and other similar major international contests."
"As the House will recall, the Commission responded to complaints from people outside France who were finding it impossible to buy tickets by beginning an investigation."
"The CFO then quickly changed its policy and made efforts to make sure that tickets sold in 1998 were available without discrimination."
"Then 100, 000 tickets became available to everyone on a first-come-first-served basis."
"The Commission judged that these factors - the unprecedented application of the law, the conventions relating to previous ticket sales for international tournaments, and the constructive action of CFO - justified a symbolic rather than a punitive fine."
"In addition, it is relevant to add that a more substantial fine on the organisers of the 1998 World Cup in France would have imposed an obligation on the Commission to consider action against the organisers of previous major tournaments who used exactly the same ticketing policies."
"This could have meant, for example, action against the organisers of the 1996 European Championship because on that occasion, supporters benefitted from a sales scheme which favoured nationals over fans from abroad."
"The French organising committee is not a normal commercial profit-seeking company."
"It exists for the interests of football and it is important to recognise that all profits reverted to the game of football."
"Fining the French organising committee means taking money away from grassroots football and from the promotion of the game and putting that money into the coffers of the European Commission."
"I do not believe that any genuine lover of football would think that was either sensible or acceptable."
"I know that football supporters in parts of the Union have strongly criticised the size of the EUR 1, 000 fine."
"My colleagues and I can certainly understand such reactions when those reactions are not informed by the facts."
"I hope, however, that in this House and elsewhere, there will be recognition of the specific factors directly relevant to this case."
"The important - and I think the instructive - outcome of the case is plain."
"All future sports tournament organisers now clearly know that any ticketing arrangements must comply fully with European Community competition rules and be non-discriminatory."
"Secondly, they know that the Commission will not hesitate to take action against any organiser that fails to comply with those rules."
"Thirdly, they know that the symbolic approach could only be followed once, and in very particular circumstances."
"These realities, in the view of the Commission, mean that standards of fair treatment for sports fans have been clarified and strengthened."
"They will definitely enjoy protection against discrimination in the future."
"The organisers of the Euro-2000 Cup in Belgium and the Netherlands have, for instance, contacted the Commission and as a result, they have adapted their sales system to meet the requirements of Community law."
"There has been no previous occasion on which a higher percentage of tickets has been made available to the general public with absolutely equal rights for all citizens of the European Union."
"We intend to keep it that way."
"That is the silver lining."
"It is a pity that first there had to be a cloud."
"Madam President, I want to congratulate Commissioner Kinnock on the statement he has just made. I simply do not know how he managed to keep a straight face as he read out those comments."
"That statement from the Commission was quite appalling."
"I do not blame Commissioner Kinnock himself, but I certainly blame the action, attitude and inaction, in fact, of the outgoing Commission."
"This is a pathetic fine from a pathetic Commission."
"All we can say is that it is absolutely typical of the way they have conducted affairs over the last five years."
"I only hope that the President-elect Mr Prodi will take this as an example of how not to do it."
"I was one of 32 Members of this Parliament who took a private legal action before the French courts last year in a last-ditch attempt to get more tickets for fans across Europe."
"Unfortunately, when we went to the French courts, we were told that it was too late at that stage to get the redistribution of tickets ordered, although the French courts themselves recognised that European rules had been flouted in the procedure that was followed."
"I should like to point out that the costs to the individual Members of Parliament who took that legal action was, surprise, surprise, in the order of £1000 each, something rather more than the fine that has now been imposed upon the World Cup organisers."
"The Commission itself, had it wished, had the power to impose a fine of something like EUR 20m - perhaps even more - if it had taken this seriously."
"It did not take it seriously in 1997 when it could have taken action to ensure a fair distribution."
"It did not take it seriously in 1998 when we had the problem and fans across Europe were denied the opportunity to see the World Cup."
"It is not taking it seriously now."
"What sort of message is this giving out to sports organisers?"
"Commissioner Kinnock called this a symbolic fine."
"Well, it is certainly giving a sign that it does not take it seriously at all."
"We are talking about big business here."
"The amounts of money involved are significant."
"Something like £300m, I am told, was the turnover of the World Cup; the fine something like EUR 1000."
"This is simply not acceptable at all."
"The sign that is being given is that the Commission is turning a blind eye, that it is not really worried."
"It is saying to large-scale organisers: 'You can carry on exploiting the fans' ."
"It is also saying that this is the way to encourage - and it is encouraging - a black market in these tickets."
"It must do something to stop it."
"Sport is now big business."
"The Commission in future must show that it means business to ensure that sport, like other businesses across Europe, must observe European rules and regulations."
"Madam President, I thank the Commission and Commissioner Kinnock for being available to make this statement following my request earlier in the week."
"While I welcome the fact they are here to make the statement, I am disappointed in its content."
"I am told I do not like football: I am a Manchester City season-ticket holder."
"I am told that the Commissioner has similar problems with a rumoured enthusiasm for Cardiff City which may explain some of the difficulties we both face."
"Nevertheless, I agree that the French Football Federation put on a wonderful feast of football."
"The French 'rainbow team' did much to confound the xenophobics and racists who, like Mr Le Pen and our unlamented former colleague Mr Mègret, believe that to be French is to be white."
"Yet importantly, there clearly was a breach of competition rules on a massive scale."
"Commissioner Kinnock talked about 180, 000 tickets being made available to football fans across Europe."
"That was after 600, 000 tickets were sold on a discriminatory basis."
"The organising committee deliberately and provocatively ignored early on the requirement that all citizens of the European Union be treated equally, and clearly breached Article 82 of the Treaty."
"In doing so, they massively increased their profits, selling tickets in corporate blocks as small as one."
"You could not buy a ticket by telephoning and paying FF500, but for FF5, 000 you could get the same ticket and the equivalent of a school dinner - I have had corporate hospitality before."
"If Commissioner Kinnock is asking me if I believe that the European Commission could actually help grassroots football better than the multinational corporations who actually rely on the profits, I would actually vote for the European Commission."
"It may not be a very popular move but I have seen very little evidence of the people who are making multi-millions of pounds out of football putting it back into football."
"They are putting it into franchising and other things."
"This also endangered the security of thousands of football fans."
"It turned tens of thousands of French men and women into amateur ticket touts."
"If they bought their allocation of four tickets each for a major match and sold them on the black market, they had enough money for two of them to take a two-week holiday in Australia."
"It was very difficult to imagine that French men and women would not pick up tickets and sell them in that way and clearly that was happening."
"In these circumstances, therefore, does the Commissioner not agree that football fans will think it is absolutely ludicrous, the EUR 1000 fine - which was about the black-market price for a ticket for England-Argentina - that ticket touts will think that this is good news and that genuine football fans will be disappointed?"
"Can he not confirm that we could have fined the French football authorities something between FF 100m and FF 200m, which was something like 10 % of the extra profits they made?"
"Does he not believe that the excuse that the organising federation no longer exists is actually a facile one when clearly it is the responsibility of the French Football Federation?"
"Does he not agree that the message to the organisers of Europe 2000, to the organisers of Europe 2004 and the possible organisers of the Mondiale 2006, whether in Germany or the United Kingdom, is that they can ignore the rules, maximise profits and in the end, all it costs them is the small change?"
"Should the Commission be treating football differently from any other multi-billion pound industrial operation?"
"It seems to me that if this had been in the telecommunications sector or elsewhere, the notion that we would have come back with a symbolic fine in circumstances where people had increased their profits by £200m or £300m would have been as ludicrous as the symbolic fine appears to football fans."
"Madam President, our former Belgian Socialist colleague, Mr De Coene, and I led the group of 30 MEPs who took the case to the High Court in Paris last year."
"The tribunal there found in our favour."
"They found that the European law had been broken by the CFO."
"They dismissed our case on a technicality, finding that we were inadmissible as litigants."
"But we took action because we were not convinced that the European Commission was standing up for the rights of the European citizen."
"As a result of our action, we were assured by Commissioner Van Miert that the Commission would prosecute this to the very end."
"That action, as Mr Perry has pointed out, cost us individually more than EUR 1000 each."
"Members of this House are sick at the fine that has been imposed by the European Commission on the CFO."
"I can well imagine why Commissioner Van Miert did not want to come here personally to make this statement today."
"This is not the first time that the World Cup organisers have rigged the sales of tickets against the ordinary football fan."
"But it is the first time that they have trumpeted their tournament as the first billion-dollar World Cup."
"They have made millions out of discriminatory sales arrangements."
"If the Commission had pursued this abuse of Article 82 as rigorously as it pursues abuses in other areas of industry then this fine would have been not £600 but £6m or more."
"The Commissioner tells us that the interests of consumers were harmed but that this had no serious effect on the market."
"I suggest to the Commissioner that it has a very serious effect on the European Union's reputation."
"He tells us that there was nothing to guide the CFO."
"What about the fine that the Commission imposed on the Italian organisers of the World Cup in 1990, a fine which was, in fact, larger than the fine that is imposed on the CFO this year?"
"What about the exchange of correspondence between the CFO and the European Commission which started the previous July?"
"Unlike Mr Ford, who represents the Southwest but supports Manchester City, I do not support any football club, but I do support the right of the European citizen to be protected from discriminatory practices and the abuse of a dominant market position."
"I support the European Union in developing its role to protect those citizens."
"To me, this fine sends to the European citizen the message that Europe is on the side of big business and not on the side of the ordinary man or woman in the street."
"In my view, this is a sad-and-sorry ending to a sad-and-sorry Commission."
"I hope that our new Commissioners, when they have been approved in September, will have rather more backbone in taking up this kind of case on behalf of the people of Europe."
"Applause"
"Madam President, unlike the previous speakers, who were, it has to be said, all British - well, well, what a surprise! - I would like to protest against the Commission's decision, which I find quite astounding, to penalise the French Football Federation for so-called discrimination in the sale of tickets during the last football World Cup."
"Commissioner Kinnock pointed out, and rightly so, that this has been the accepted practice in previous World Cups."
"And why is this an accepted practice, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Well, it is quite simply that a World Cup like that is organised by a country, and paid for by the tax-payers of that country."
"Given these conditions, it is felt to be courteous and good practice to allocate a slightly larger quota to that country's citizens."
"When a company floats shares for example, increases its capital, and then sells the shares, nobody says that it is illegal if it reserves a quota for its own employees, who are a vital component of the company's lifeblood."
"This quota is, of course, a form of discrimination and yet, I feel it is a legitimate one."
"I, therefore, think that the Commission was wrong to apply Article 82 of the Treaty because there was no real abusive exploitation of power, only a quite legitimate and understandable use of a set of circumstances which were highly unusual from a financial point of view."
"However, Madam President, I would like to move on, because this is, when all is said and done, a relatively minor matter which is of no great consequence to life in our country. There are other more serious matters in which the Commission has been guided by the same extremist mind set which may bring about very serious imbalances in our country's economy and also in its employment figures."
"I am thinking in particular of the sanction imposed, yet again on France, for having allowed certain textile companies to reduce their national insurance contributions at a time when they were taking on new staff in an international climate which, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, is extremely tough, largely because of the international agreements negotiated by the Commission itself."
"So these businesses are now going to have to repay the social grants which they were given because of an extremist, narrow-minded and almost plain stupid way of seeing things."
"It is an absolute scandal."
"I think that, in future, this Parliament should set an example with a more considered vision, one which is more fair and impartial towards competition."
"Applause"
"Madam President, first and foremost, I should like to quote a great Dutch philosopher, Michels, a famous football coach who once said that football is war."
"I would prefer to suggest that if football is an alternative to war then I am in complete agreement with that."
"I do not intend to talk about the World Cup in France here, but there are a few general points I wish to make."
"I believe that football, and international fixtures in particular, are indeed a valuable alternative to war, however silly that may sound."
"Football should be a celebration, and international fixtures such as World Cups or European Championships really ought to belong to the people again."
"What we are seeing now, and what happened last year in France, is a perfect illustration of this."
"What ought to be a celebration for the people has, to some extent, become a completely commercialised celebration."
"We can see that the same thing is tending to happen with national football competitions throughout Europe."
"These show that football is becoming less and less accessible to ordinary people and has to some extent become a celebration of business, with people tucked away behind plate glass windows and in comfortable business lounges."
"That is why I want to call on the Commissioner to take positive action for a sport that must remain accessible to ordinary people and that must be protected from commercial interests."
"Of course, the same applies to competitive cycling, where cyclists sometimes inject themselves with the same hormones that cattle are injected with."
"On the same note, I would ask the Commissioner to actually produce a policy that is no longer concerned with imposing fines on organisations that have infringed some competition regulation or other, but is, in every sense, a policy aimed at controlling those big organisations and ensuring that European Championships and World Cups that are held in Europe really do continue to be celebrations for the people and not celebrations of business."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the market should be the only factor taken into consideration as regards the organisation of sporting events."
"During the 1998 World Cup, of the two million tickets sold, the largest share was handled directly by FIFA, which sent quotas to the 203 national football associations, with a larger share going to the 24 qualifying countries, of which the United Kingdom was one."
"Another share, 600, 000 tickets, was handled by the host nation, which reserved 37 % of this quota."
"The idea of putting all tickets for a sporting event of this size up for sale on the European market has never been put into practice by any country, as Commissioner Neil Kinnock has just pointed out."
"In Euro '96, for example, the football tournament organised in the United Kingdom, 42 %, not 37 % of the tickets were reserved for the host nation."
"Secondly, having control of the tickets is to have 90 % control of security."
"If the World Cup was a success in this area too, if we had relatively few incidents, it was largely because this control over the tickets facilitated for example, Franco-British co-operation in security matters, and efficiency in handling the arrival of groups of supporters, supervising them, and following up any problems."
"This allowed us to escape many outbreaks of hooliganism, which we hope never to see again on our continent."
"Thirdly, the more individual sales that are made, the greater the risk of a black market developing."
"This is the lesson learned by the Italians themselves, from organising the 1990 World Cup, and it was obviously taken on board by the French organising committee."
"Fourthly and finally, it is understandable to ensure that where a popular sport is concerned, when the host nation has invested nine billion francs in the event, the citizens of the host nation support and participate positively in this event, and this is also a key factor in its success. But it is also understandable that care is taken over the security of these citizens and also that of the groups from abroad, whom the host country accommodates for the occasion."
"During this World Cup, ladies and gentlemen, you saw thousands of little Zidanes and Marcel Desaillys, coming from the working-class neighbourhoods of Marseilles, Toulouse and Strasbourg to applaud the exploits of the great Zidane and the great Desailly, but also those of the great Owen, the great Beckham, and the great Di Pietro."
"Nobody could say that this amazing World Cup was tainted by racial or social discrimination."
"It was an open and welcoming popular celebration."
"It gave us a wonderful picture of sport, a picture of the diversity of our teams and of our nations, and a picture of fraternity across our continent."
"The supporters group which was most successful and most appreciated by the French people was that of the Scots."
"We, the citizens of France, did not go on holiday to Australia in July 1998 because the world came to France, and because we were at the Stade de France, at St-Denis, at the velodrome, in Marseilles with the people from our working-class neighbourhoods."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Union's priority in sport today is not to punish a Member Nation which has managed successfully to organise an event like this, but is rather, as Romano Prodi said yesterday, to engage in a real pan-European battle against doping, and this means refusing to allow the unique power of money to kill off the beauty and the very spirit of sport."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I am here to speak on behalf of millions of women football fans."
"I welcome Commissioner Kinnock's reassurances."
"I must say that I was appalled at how the ticket allocation was handled by the French authorities."
"I know that a large number of people in Britain were equally frustrated."
"The release of the tickets was really too late for most people to be able to take up those opportunities given their work commitments."
"What we need, I believe, is some joined-up thinking."
"One of the main objectives of the EU institutions is to ensure that citizens of all EU countries are treated fairly and equally."
"In this instance, millions of football fans were discriminated against."
"And yet, this breach is taken lightly."
"Whatever the reasons for that particular measly fine, it will alienate a large number of fans."
"It is another missed opportunity to connect with the people of Europe."
"Football is a passion that unites all the countries."
"What better way for us to change our image and connect with the people of Europe than to say that we take football as seriously as we take any branch of commerce."
"I should like to begin where Ms Gill left off, first of all by congratulating her on her maiden speech in this House."
"She will never feel such fear again or derive such satisfaction."
"I am sure the whole House thanks her for her contribution."
"Indeed, she summed up the feelings of the Commission in many ways when she said that she deeply regretted the existence of discrimination."
"That is the universal feeling in the Commission, which is why my colleague, Mr Van Miert, and his associates in the Commission specifically sought to do something effective about preventing for all time in the future and indeed for 1998 the use of discriminatory practices by CFO."
"I should like to take up where Mr Vander Taelen left off."
"When he said that football is a valid alternative to war I was reminded of the maxim that the first casualty of war is truth."
"As I listened to some of the contributions in the course of this debate, I could not escape the feeling that sometimes the first casualty of football is truth because there were one or two contributions that were made passionately, but largely without the recognition of fact."
"I would like to respond on behalf of the Commission, with some repetition of fact."
"I regret it if I am repetitive, but if at first people do not hear, perhaps they will hear the second time."
"I begin with Mr Perry."
"I enjoyed his recitation of sound-bites about pathetic, appalling and all the rest of it."
"But what is he really saying when he says that the European Commission has the power to impose a EUR 20m fine?"
"In theory and in constitutional terms, he is right."
"But is he really suggesting that the European Commission should take EUR 20m or EUR 30m out of football and put it in the coffers of the European Commission?"
"Mr Ford says 'yes' , he would rather that the European Commission have the money than the CFO."
"He demonstrated a surprising distance from the realities of public opinion."
"This man has been my friend for a considerable time."
"I admire everything but his taste in football clubs."
"But the fact remains that if that were the course of action taken, he knows what the headlines would be."
"So does Mr Watson, who is disturbed about the reputation of the European Union."
"He knows the headlines would say: 'Euros snatched from football' ."
"Let us be rational."
"Is it sensible in the circumstances to take the money in large amounts from football and deposit it in the European Commission's coffers, or is it sensible to take action that guarantees that on no future occasion will there be discriminatory sales of football or other international tournament tickets?"
"Then Mr Perry says that he wants this action to be absolutely firm and ferocious."
"I can understand the sentiment."
"But to be consistent the same action would have to be taken against the organisers of the European Cup competition which happened to be in the United Kingdom in 1996."
"Football came home, it was said."
"Are we really suggesting in this House, or anywhere else, that we should look back to 1996 or comparable competitions and say that we are dishing out EUR 20m fines on those who organised these competitions?"
"Come on."
"Let us be rational."
"Let me return very briefly again to Mr Ford."
"He said those who make money out of football should put it back in."
"He knows very well that I am zealous in my support of that view."
"But I would suggest that we have to do rather more than attend only to international football ticket sales in order to bring about that intelligent and necessary recycling of funds."
"One point I want to focus on, in what Mr Ford said, is that the Commission, he alleges, is sending out the message to organisers of Euro 2000 and maybe future World Cup competitions in the European Union that they can ignore the rules."
"The absolute opposite is taking place."
"I had already said ten minutes before Mr Ford spoke that the organisers of the Belgian and Netherlands European championship have been in touch with the Commission and not a single ticket will be sold on a discriminatory basis."
"They are already obeying the rules, setting the precedent, and, at all future times in the European Union, that will be the way in which affairs are conducted."
"The football supporters and supporters of other sports quite rightly will now know that they have the protection of the law and organisers of tournaments will know that they will be the object of real and heavy punishment if they break what are now known to be the rules."
"This is the point."
"There was no knowledge of the rules."
"There is no case-law from the Court of Justice."
"There is no precedent of action by the European Commission."
"The money would have been taken out of football if there had been a heavier fine."
"There would have to be a further effort to levy fines against previous organisers."
"The fact is that CFO, who I do not paint as plaster saints, the moment that our investigation commenced, stopped the discriminatory sales."
"Everybody would have liked that to have occurred earlier, but it did happen."
"When Mr Watson says, therefore, that this is not the first time that organisers have rigged the sales, he may be right."
"But this is the first time that the legal competition authority has stopped the rigging, stopped the discriminatory sales and the first time that any competition authority in the world has prevented for all future time the use of discriminatory methods in the sale of tickets."
"Mr Watson accepted my point when I said that this was a case where consumers were hit but the effect was not on the market as it is generally understood."
"I think he conceded that because he said that was my claim and the problem was that the reputation of Europe had suffered."
"I would put this point to him, a man for whom I have very high regard, as I do for the other participants in this debate: that reputation can only suffer if what has occurred is misrepresented."
"I know there is no-one in this House who will ever want to do that."
"I therefore appeal for attention to the facts."
"Whilst I fully understand and indeed, to a degree, share the passions about the way in which the big business of football so frequently now is operating in ways that contradict the interests of genuine football fans, I accept all that."
"I ask for fair treatment in this case as indeed in many others."
"It was uncharacteristically unworthy of one honourable Member to say that he could understand why my colleague Mr Van Miert is not here because of the gravity of this case."
"If there has ever been a Commissioner in the forty-two year history of the European Union who has publicly demonstrated integrity and guts, it is Mr Van Miert."
"The reason he is not here this morning is because he has to attend to his work, not from any cowardice."
"It is infamous for anybody to even infer that is the reason for his absence."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 9.55 a.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 23 July 1999."
"This summer I have been led to express our solidarity with the people of Turkey and Greece on the occasion of the tragic events they suffered at the time of the violent earthquakes at Izmit and Athens."
"As some of you may have noted, I offered condolences on behalf of us all, on your behalf, and I expressed our deepest sympathy for the plight they have endured."
"At this point in the proceedings, out of respect for the memory of the victims and the profound grief of their families, I ask you to please observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you may also perhaps have noted, as soon as I learnt of the deaths, in particularly tragic conditions, of Yaguine Koita and Fodé Tounkara, I felt bound to express how shocked I was by these tragic deaths."
"The feeling was the same, of course, when the death of a young Senegalese man in the same circumstances was reported."
"The letter they wrote addressed to the leaders of Europe was obviously of prime concern to me in my capacity as President of the European Parliament."
"This gesture, deeply moving in its humanity, expressed the desperate cry of the youth of a continent which sees the gap between standards of life in North and South increasing inexorably from year to year."
"At a time when we are currently involved in renegotiating the Lomé Convention and negotiations, as you know, are coming up, in particular, against the stumbling block of the principles of proper administration of public monies, it seemed to me to be essential to state that education must be one of the priorities of the European Union."
"Regarding the Strasbourg building premises, you will recall just how often during the July part-session we all noted significant defects, poor operation and problems affecting the reception and working conditions of colleagues and also those of our assistants and the media who follow our work."
"You will recall that I undertook, here in this very Chamber, to do all in my power to improve matters."
"I must thank our Secretary-General for the very industrious and efficient assistance he gave me, since a task force, combining all the departments concerned, was immediately formed, and which tackled the whole situation very thoroughly."
"For my part, I established a number of contacts with legal and administrative personnel and I planned a visit which I would not hesitate to describe as an inspection visit."
"Last Wednesday, therefore, together with the Quaestors, Mr Colom i Naval, who is the Vice-President specifically responsible for monitoring buildings, the Secretary-General, my Chief-of-Staff and the civil servants more specifically involved in this case, we spent an entire day here, in order to establish the situation regarding what it had been possible to improve and what still had to be improved."
"At the end of the day, which concluded in a business meeting - I must specify that it was a business meeting - with the Mayor and also the managing director of the building firm, I wrote you a letter, which I hope you have already received - at any event you will have it in your mail boxes - summing up the situation."
"Appended to this letter are some details of what it has been possible to achieve and what is still outstanding."
"I shall simply mention the few matters which, at the time, seemed most urgent, starting with disabled access."
"It has been possible to complete a number of modifications, following the perfectly legitimate request of one of our colleagues."
"I think that matters are now in hand regarding this aspect."
"The problem of access for disabled visitors still remains, but we naturally intend to have the situation under control."
"Regarding signposting and access to the building, you will, I hope, have noticed some improvements."
"You no doubt appreciated the welcome offered by the young hostesses whom the Mayor of Strasbourg agreed to make available to us in order to make reception more welcoming."
"We also spent many hours on the safety problems regarding the lifts and all the very serious malfunctions which occurred during the July part-session affecting both the ventilation and the operation of the lifts."
"We have also very attentively studied the problems of the working conditions of the media and we have, in particular, looked into the outfitting of the press room and the problem of access with mobile phones, but not just this problem."
"And finally, the Quaestors have taken note, and I think they are sufficiently creative in this field, of the matter of decoration of the building in order to render it somewhat less lugubrious."
"So, for example, in one lift we have a prototype for light wood panelling which, if we are in agreement, may be used to improve other surfaces."
"Obviously, I shall meticulously examine the legal problem this may present with regard to the building constructor' s artistic copyright."
"As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, my intention was that all this should be taken very seriously, but I do not want us to engage in a debate now."
"I think this would not be very useful as you have not yet had time to see everything that has been done."
"There is also the problem of the offices for Members of Parliament and the need for mailboxes which can be locked."
"We have really gone into a great deal of detail and, if you agree, I would like to organise a sort of question time on Friday morning, which I shall chair, when you can report any problems you may have again noted this week so that together, we can see what we can do in order to be able to conduct the October 4 part-session in better conditions."
"If this suggestion is acceptable to you, we can adopt it, and table a question time for Friday at 9 a.m."
"Madam President, I respect what you say about not engaging in the debate and I will not seek to do so. But I wonder if you could give an undertaking to reply to the letter that I and a number of other Members specifically wrote to you personally on the issue of disability access."
"If we were to receive that reply in advance of Friday, it would help the issue enormously."
"Absolutely, we intend to look into the matter with colleagues but also with the organisations which are competent in these matters in order to ensure that everything which has to be done is done."
"But I shall, of course, give you a reply before Friday, if you so wish."
"Madam President, we have a marvellous television in our room and it works too, so I have no complaints whatsoever on that score."
"It is fantastic, and there are twenty channels."
"But in the previous Parliament building, one of them was a Dutch TV channel, which meant that we Dutch MEPs could follow the news as well."
"Now, not one of the twenty channels is a Dutch one."
"Could you please have this channel re-installed?"
"I do not mean one for following the plenary part-session but an actual TV channel such as Nederland 1,2,3 or RTL 4, as we had last time."
"As you can imagine, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, since I have tabled this period on Friday in order to itemise all the new problems and the old problems which have not been remedied, that is the time when we can look into all this."
"I would ask you to please keep your comments concerning the premises until Friday so that we can have a comprehensive debate on the subject at that time."
"If it is a matter of urgency, we shall see if the problem can be settled before Friday, but I am not sure whether it can."
"Madam President, I believe that it would be appropriate if we now, having observed a minute' s silence for the victims of the earthquakes in Greece and Turkey - with good reason since, quite apart from the large numbers of casualties, these events have a deep political significance - observed a minute' s silence for the victims of Indonesian repression in East Timor."
"As you know, Mr Nogueira Román, we have put this tragic matter on the agenda for our plenary part-session."
"At that time, we shall have an in-depth debate on the question, with a contribution from the Finnish Presidency, and a vote upon a text."
"This is the reason why I did not mention the situation in East Timor when opening this part-session."
"But I can tell you, as you well know, that this is a matter of great concern to me."
"And indeed, I have already expressed a very strong opinion on this matter on behalf of all of us."
"As you perhaps also know, a small delegation of observers was organised during the summer on an emergency basis by the President, Mr Báron Crespo, who came to see me on the matter, and I was pleased to follow up his request."
"So, Mr Nogueira Román, you can be assured of our solidarity in this matter."
"Madam President, I should like to request that the ""no smoking"" areas are respected, which was not the case at the last Strasbourg session."
"As an asthmatic, I had two asthma attacks in this building during the last session."
"I do not wish to repeat that performance."
"I am sure there are other people in this building who also have asthma and other lung problems, so I request that all ""no smoking"" areas are respected."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mrs Lynne, I have noted your request which is perfectly legitimate, even, indeed, if one does not suffer from asthma."
"It is certainly very unpleasant, and we shall ensure that these areas are scrupulously respected."
"Madam President, as well as supporting my colleague' s proposal regarding the victims in East Timor, I would like to remind you that, a year ago, a peace process was launched in my country. I would like, through your Presidency, to ask the European Parliament firstly to support the efforts of all political forces in the promotion of dialogue between all political representatives."
"Secondly, I would ask this Parliament to strongly urge ETA to abandon violence for good. Thirdly, and lastly, we should agree on programmes to aid victims, the rehabilitation of prisoners and education aimed at peace in the Basque Country and Northern Ireland."
"Mr Knörr Borràs, I have noted your intervention whose rightful place is in the context of the debate we have organised on the matter."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 23 July have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, a word regarding the Minutes."
"I just want to point out that in the Minutes from last Friday, one of my interventions was not properly reproduced."
"I was pointing out that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, the joint parliamentary committees, unlike the delegations, but just like the committees, have to elect their bureaux."
"This is not properly reflected in the Minutes."
"All that is contained is my protest that the documents were not distributed on time."
"I request that it be made clear that we in the joint parliamentary committees also have to hold elections just as is the case in the parliamentary committees."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"I take note of your request."
"If there are no further comments on the Minutes, I declare the Minutes approved."
"Madam Chairman, I rise on a point of order."
"I see that certain Members in the House at this time are raising banners in support of a cause."
"I am sure the overwhelming majority, myself included, agree with the sentiment but can you advise us on any rules, regulations or guidance that you wish to give this House in terms of manifestations in any form other than speaking under the Rules of Procedure of the House?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Perry has just said, I think I can say that virtually everyone in this Parliament of course shares the feelings of our colleagues who are waving the banners concerned."
"This demonstration does, however, create a difficult precedent and though, today, there is great consensus on the Timor question, you will understand that this may not always be the case."
"Moreover, as I have already told you, we have tabled a debate on the subject."
"We hope this will be a truly serious debate, and I do not doubt it for an instant, a debate which will result in some conclusions on the political role which the European Parliament considers it must play in this situation."
"I shall therefore request you, colleagues, to be so kind as to put away your banners."
"The message has been received."
"But that will suffice, as we must take care not to set a precedent which may, in other circumstances, seriously impede the running of our House."
"Thank you for your understanding, and as an expression of thanks I am going to grant your request and propose that you stand to observe a minute' s silence for the victims in East Timor."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure"
"I am sure you remember that during its meeting on 27 and 28 July, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) examined a request for interpretation of Rule 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure put forward by the Conference of Presidents during the meeting on 21 July."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs ruled as follows: ""The constitution of the Technical Group of Independent Members, a mixed group, is not in accordance with Rule 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament."""
"In fact, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs continues, ""The constitution of this group, specifically Annex 2 to the letter of constitution addressed to the President of the European Parliament, excludes any political allegiance."
"It permits the various signatory members total political autonomy within the group."""
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs requests that the following interpretation be inserted into Rule 29(1) of our Rules of Procedure: ""The formation of a group which openly rejects any political character and all political affiliation between its Members is not acceptable within the meaning of this rule."""
"This interpretation will be included, as is right and proper, in the Minutes for this day' s sitting."
"It will then be inserted into the Rules of Procedure, but if this interpretation is opposed tomorrow, before the Minutes of the current sitting are adopted, by a political group or by at least 32 Members, in accordance with Rule 180(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the matter will then be immediately referred to our House for a decision, as is usual, by simple majority vote, with at least one third of members in attendance."
"This is the procedure."
"If rejected, the matter will be referred back to the appropriate committee."
"Madam President, as you might expect, given that until tomorrow morning the Technical Group of Independent Members will still be in existence, we will ask for a vote and to that end, we will ask for an immediate announcement that tomorrow morning, the Chamber will give an opinion on the matter."
"Those elected from the Bonino list tried to explain in an open letter to all their colleagues the reason for the setting up of this group, the reasons for the discrimination against the Non-attached Members in this Parliament and therefore the reasons for our initiative - as well as for the motion for an amendment to the Rules of Procedure which I hope will be announced soon - and to invite them to vote with us against this interpretation."
"There is no need to start a debate on the subject."
"Thank you for giving us advance notice that there will be opposition to this interpretation and that, consequently, our House will be required to vote at 9 a.m. tomorrow according to the procedure which I have just mentioned."
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 9 September has been distributed."
"Madam Chairman, I rise with regard to an item on the agenda for Wednesday, 15 September."
"I am rather surprised to see a procedure without debate on a report under the name of Mr Westendorp."
"I have the document of this report in which it says that the committee voted it."
"I was in attendance in the committee at this time and I am not aware that this report was voted."
"I think there has been a misunderstanding or a mistake within the secretariat of the committee."
"I am giving advance notice that this is a matter subject to a query and that we may have to object to this item on the agenda."
"Obviously, Mr Chichester, if this report has not been voted on by the committee concerned, there can be no question of voting on it in plenary session."
"We shall therefore check this point, and I thank you for drawing attention to it."
"(The President read out the amendments to the Agenda for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) (The order of business was adopted thus amended)"
"Second Report of the Independent Experts"
"The next item is the Statement by the Commission on the follow-up to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which has been issued to you, as you wished, as speedily as possible."
"We have really done all in our power so that you could familiarise yourselves with it at a sufficiently early stage, particularly within the groups."
"I would remind you that at its meeting on Thursday, 9 September, the Conference of Presidents decided to refer the matter to the Committee on Budgetary Control so that a report could be drawn up."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday the Commission received the text of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts, which analyses the administrative management of the Commission and puts forward proposals regarding its reform."
"There is no need to point out the political significance of this day."
"This Commission, the outgoing Commission, held what will probably be its last meeting last Wednesday and, therefore, has not had the opportunity, in the short time which has passed since the document was issued, to carry out a thorough analysis of its contents or to establish a final position in relation to it."
"It will be the task of the new Commission to carry out a more thorough evaluation of this second report and, in this regard, the Vice-President responsible for reform of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, will respond during the debate to the specific points relating to future activities."
"Having said this, please allow me briefly to address certain comments to you, from the point of view of the outgoing Commission, regarding the work carried out by the Committee of Independent Experts in this second report."
"First of all, I would like to stress the fact that the Commission has cooperated honestly and constructively with the work of the committee as it promised Parliament from the moment that work began."
"When Parliament proposed the creation of the committee and established its mandate, the Commission expressed its agreement with it and its acceptance of the consequences and responsibilities which may arise from it."
"This was the case with the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts and the events that followed its presentation, which led to the resignation of the Commission."
"I will not dwell on these, since Parliament is well acquainted with them and I believe they are already assigned to history."
"However, what does interest me, with a view to the future, is to point out that this second report is, in our opinion, a positive contribution to the reform process which the next Commission will have to undergo under the Presidency of Professor Prodi."
"I would like to express my agreement on this point."
"This is a debate which looks to the future, the future of the European Union and the strengthening of its institutions and, in particular, the European Commission, whose central role in European construction cannot be called into question."
"Lessons can no doubt be learned from a reading of this second report."
"Shortcomings in management are highlighted, but also, timidly, in our opinion, the causes are mentioned."
"In some cases, these include legislative limitations and the obligations which the Commission, institutionally, has had to take on in circumstances which were not expected and were insufficiently prepared for."
"But, furthermore, there is one issue that appeared in the first report and which is repeated in this report on various occasions: The limited human resources available for the tasks taken on by the Commission in response to public opinion or at the request of the Council and, on occasions, also of Parliament itself."
"Therefore, I believe that this is basically an analytical report."
"It is clearly a critical report and it demonstrates once again something that I have always observed as a Commissioner and that I would like to testify to before this Chamber: The human and professional quality and integrity of the men and women who make up the European civil service and who offer that service not only their labour but also their personal commitment."
"There have been exceptions."
"There have been cases of abuse, but they are very limited, very limited indeed."
"It has always seemed to me unjust that, as a result of very limited cases, generalisations have been made in the past with regard to the European civil service."
"There are officials in the European Commission who are worthy and honest and who wish to cooperate with you and overcome the crisis which has arisen during this past year."
"Please do not forget that the European Commission is, by nature, the embodiment, the consequence and the summary of everything good and bad in the history of European integration."
"It is true that the Commission, as an institution, represents more than forty years of heritage in terms of European integration."
"But forty years of heritage can also undoubtedly be a burden. And sometimes, a negative burden."
"Every day, the European Commission has had to confront new and numerous tasks and it is true - and I wish to freely admit this here without any compunction - that we had difficulties in adapting to the new challenges."
"This has undoubtedly been our great responsibility."
"Modernisation and reform are therefore necessary and they should be carried out if we want the Commission to be able not only to fulfil its basic role of guardian of the Treaties but also to be the promoter of the decision-making process and the effective manager of the programmes and projects assigned to it."
"Everybody has proclaimed during recent months - Parliament, the Member States, the media - that the future requires a strong and independent Commission."
"I hope this proclamation is sincere, although I must admit that I sometimes doubt whether it is actually sincere."
"The report proposes a large number of changes which are summed up in 90 recommendations."
"This is not the time to analyse them in detail, but I would like to highlight the fact that the problems relating to the distribution of budgetary resources, the protection of the Union' s financial interests, the fight against fraud, the management of contracts and decentralisation are matters which require solutions and responses which will demand the active cooperation of the European Parliament and also, and above all, of the Member States that make up the Council of Ministers."
"Why is this?"
"The recommendations, as we have read in the report, are of a very varied nature, Madam President."
"Some require practical changes."
"They can be carried out, and without delay."
"Others require changes in management mechanisms."
"They can also be carried out, but, as my colleague Mr Kinnock will explain, they will require a certain amount of time."
"Other cases involve profound, sometimes radical, modifications of the legal and regulatory framework, and this cannot be done by the Commission alone."
"Finally there are others, with a greater content and on a higher level, which will even require the reform of the Treaties and, in some cases, probably the reform of the Constitutions of some Member States."
"I freely admit, Madam President, that as a European citizen after next week, I will be very curious to observe the attitude of the Member States and the European Parliament when the new Intergovernmental Conference opens in Helsinki. The conclusions of the Committee of Independent Experts can obviously be applauded."
"Some, in my opinion, are necessary, very necessary, and can be carried out. Others will need time."
"But in some cases, the European Parliament should apply pressure in the correct quarters, and this pressure should not be applied on the Commission this time but basically on the Member States; otherwise we will be faced with an enormous disappointment."
"I repeat that the most radical reforms require a reform of the Treaties."
"In my humble opinion, with much experience as a Commissioner, I am curious to see how we will all behave, at this precise moment, at the moment of truth, faced with a new model for the organisation of European integration."
"Other issues are old and recurrent and are not innovations but a product of the realities, contradictions and also the residue of successive political commitments which are, at the end of the day, the ones which form the overall picture of the European Commission."
"We are at a decisive juncture."
"Perhaps we were not able to explain it, perhaps we could not do it, perhaps we lacked courage, but something was started with the outgoing Commission."
"And I would like to end by saying that this debate is good and positive."
"The other day, we briefly analysed the work of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"We believe that much can be done."
"We are perhaps paying a heavy price for not having been able to do it, but I would ask this Parliament to painstakingly analyse the second report of the committee, to understand, after the explanations of Mr Kinnock, that the Commission will require some time, and to be a bit more generous this time."
"Give the Prodi team some time to carry out the task that we were unable to do, as it has work to do which is probably even more difficult."
"I believe that this is the constructive way to evaluate the results of the crisis, with a view to the future and, above all, in the eyes of the citizens."
"Perhaps the Commission, as well as yourselves, will gain from all this."
"Consequently, perhaps, the next European elections will not see a repeat of the behaviour of the citizens who did not vote this time, probably because they did not understand what was happening in Brussels."
"Please allow me to be frank. I have tried to illustrate the positive attitude that we have in the outgoing Commission and to ask, please, for calm, serenity and a little generosity to allow the new team to launch those reforms which, in our opinion, are absolutely necessary."
"Madam President, honourable Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that my colleague Mr Pöttering has today spoken in different terms than was previously the case when we were still uncertain as to its contents."
"Many myths have been spun surrounding this report, one being that this report will show that several Commissioners from the old Commission should no longer be represented in the new Commission - a further statement on the old Commission and its practices."
"In reality this has happened, something I consider very important, and I believe that in this sense I have also understood the previous speaker. We must take appropriate steps as a result of the mistakes and inappropriate behaviour of certain Commissioners."
"In this respect, we have to draw a line under the old Commission, we should not cover anything up as far the mistakes that have been made are concerned, but rather we should look to the future in order to jointly make things better in the coming years."
"This is our task for which, as far as I have been able to read the report, very many starting points are contained therein, although it is too early to put my name to it at the moment."
"I would, however, also like to make an observation regarding the time factor."
"I did not understand Vice-President Marín to be rebuking us, although perhaps, in his situation, he sees things somewhat differently from us parliamentarians."
"Why am I in favour of giving the Commission time, albeit not too much time?"
"Because I take the viewpoint that, at the end of the day, we have to get round to the important issues: strengthening the Union and enlargement of the Union."
"In addition, we must get away from the fact that for far too many of our people, the European Union is associated with scandals, fraud and maladministration."
"This is certainly not the case."
"But we also have to demonstrate this by rectifying matters where mistakes have been made."
"My question to Commissioner Kinnock therefore relates to the notion of time."
"Yes to having sufficient time to initiate reforms, but also yes to beginning these important steps as soon as possible, in order that we can get away from the bad light in which the Commission, and indeed the whole European Union, is portrayed."
"In this regard, clear decisions must be taken."
"The most important thing, and this is something which was also often mentioned at the hearings, during yours too Commissioner Kinnock, is the question of responsibility."
"It was not clear to Parliament and, of course, still less so to the citizens of Europe, as to who is ultimately responsible for what."
"These points, which have been clearly pointed out in the first and also in the second report, must be quickly rectified."
"I, for example, am in total agreement with the report where it says that ultimately, the Directorates-General within the Commission should also bear not only the political and administrative responsibility but also financial responsibility."
"It should be made clear in this regard that in carrying out a range of duties, with this comes full responsibility."
"I would like to make one more comment in connection with this which is very important as far as my group is concerned."
"We stand by our policy of collective responsibility within the Commission and we want to see this maintained in the future."
"But we are also standing by the fact that, in addition to this, we have to find the means of incorporating individual responsibility of the individual Commissioners."
"In this regard, some positive things have come out from the hearings, while other points were perhaps rather cautious."
"This will be a difficult matter."
"My question to Commissioner Kinnock is certainly along the lines of him taking the trouble to make it clear that individual responsibility of the individual Commissioners and collective responsibility do not contradict one another."
"We do not want to amend or abolish collective responsibility in principle but we would like to supplement it accordingly."
"The report of the Committee of Wise Men also makes it clear that the Commission must be bolder in relation to national governments, even with regard to filling certain posts."
"I have experienced it myself in the area of foreign policy how governments exert influence and how decisions that the Commission would like to make itself are frequently delayed for long periods."
"I call upon the Commission to show greater courage in relation to national governments and to report to Parliament if governments, as a result of their stalling tactics, not making a decision, or their unacceptable and unreasonable influence, prevent the Commission from adopting a certain stance or making clear decisions."
"They have us on their side provided they clearly demonstrate where the reason lies."
"An important area which we must concern ourselves with over the coming weeks is the overall question of the allocation of contracts and subsidies."
"This is my question to Commissioner Kinnock in this regard: is the Commission ready to draw up clear regulations regarding the allocation of contracts, subsidies and regulations which are transparent and comparable?"
"This seems to me to be an important issue and it will certainly be difficult to do this in such a way that flexibility is not lost."
"But transparent and clear regulations of this type are required and I hope that the Commission is ready in this regard."
"Such clear regulations are also particularly necessary in those instances where responsibilities have to be delegated elsewhere."
"In this area, I am also in agreement with the report."
"It should not be that the Commission takes on all the responsibilities itself and does not delegate anything."
"That would mean an immense extension of the apparatus of officialdom."
"Yet even if responsibilities were to be delegated elsewhere, then the regulations must be clear as to the principles according to which this allocation should be effected."
"The report of the Wise Men is also very clear on matters relating to control in the Member States."
"I know that this is a delicate area."
"I now come back to my original point."
"Member States are all too ready to apportion the blame to the European institutions, to Brussels."
"In this regard, in truth there is quite a lot of abuse and inappropriate behaviour on the part of Member States themselves and their own institutions."
"Even here we will be on your side if you implement controls where they are necessary, even in the Member States."
"Through OLAF and the Bösch report, we have made considerable strides with regard to controlling fraud."
"In my opinion, we should get away from the saying: fraud has its home in Brussels."
"Fraud does not have its home in Brussels!"
"As with all large institutions, there are cases of fraud."
"But what there has been too little of at home is the clear disclosure and pursuit of fraud."
"And, my colleague Mr Pöttering, Commissioner Kinnock has already said that certainly as far as whistle-blowers are concerned, there will be new support procedures in this regard, and this House will certainly fully endorse that."
"In this sense, Commissioner Kinnock, I hope that we will soon have this regulation."
"The final point, which this report also goes into in detail, is openness and transparency."
"It is not only this House which now expects a higher degree of openness from the Commission than was the case in the past."
"There will be fewer rumours circulated in the media if openness and transparency hold sway."
"In Recommendation No. 85 - I would particularly like to draw the Commissioner 's attention to this point - it clearly states that there may only be a few regulations that are exempt from this openness and transparency and these should still be agreed with the institutions."
"But the large majority - 95% of cases - should be characterised by openness and transparency."
"If the Commission succeeds in this in the coming years, then it will have our support."
"Then, what has happened in the past will not be repeated for we will not be interested in sending the Commission packing again."
"We want to cooperate with a strong Commission."
"Madam President, it has, of course, only been possible to draw tentative conclusions in the time allotted to us for reading the report."
"My first reaction to the report is that it is a constructive one."
"It does not focus so much on individuals, but rather on issues, which I feel is right and proper."
"The only individual mentioned, and rightly so, is Mr Bösch in connection with OLAF."
"There are two general comments to be made."
"The most explosive sentence in the Wise Men' s first report, which I may not be quoting entirely accurately, is that there is scarcely anyone to be found in the Commission who feels responsible for anything."
"I think that was the stumbling block of the whole report the first time round."
"This report emphasises that it is all about structures, the nature of the decision-making process, the way in which supervision is exercised, the different safeguards that are needed."
"This makes it impossible for any one individual to feel that they are responsible, for there is so much supervision that everyone thinks there is always someone else in charge."
"That is why the recommendations merit serious consideration."
"I was particularly interested to read Chapter 3(13)(2) on export repayments."
"No product is mentioned, the name of the company is not mentioned, but I am very familiar with the whole saga."
"It is about butter exports to the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the 90s."
"The report concludes that there was clear evidence of fraud and condemns the Commission' s attitude as far as this is concerned."
"Commissioner-designate Lamy stated in the course of the hearings that it had been a completely normal affair. If I understood Commissioner Kinnock correctly at his hearing, then, as far as the Commission is concerned, the case is closed."
"I can assure Commissioner Kinnock that the case is not closed."
"The case will only be closed when Parliament deems it to be so."
"We will certainly come back to this matter."
"A few general comments on contracts."
"Too many different contracts are concluded with various forms of financial assistance from the Commission."
"I believe that is quite right."
"To hear the average consultant in Europe, we take far longer to pay these consultants than do other donor organisations."
"For that reason alone, we need to alter the system."
"I also feel that some extremely useful points are made on European agricultural policy."
"It is a policy that does not find favour with everyone."
"We could improve the situation by reducing the irregularities etc. at the very least. I believe that what was said about the Conciliation Committee deserves particular attention."
"I feel that all too often the Member States use it as an excuse not to have to pay when there is a dispute."
"The proposals for an internal audit service also sound attractive, particularly as they are based on a recommendation from an institute for internal auditors."
"As to whether it is really necessary for DG XX to be abolished, I consider that to be a finding that is all too makeshift."
"But who knows, maybe it will be taken out."
"I believe it is also a good thing that the committee said something about the way in which the Court of Auditors operates."
"Year in, year out the Court of Auditors recommends not giving a positive statement of assurance."
"Like the Wise Men, I too would very much like to know why that is so."
"And maybe in the future the Court of Auditors could go into a little more detail about sectors, systems, procedures, and perhaps even about that holy of holies, the Member States themselves."
"Which Member States have sound procedures and which do not?"
"We are very receptive to the argument in favour of a European Public Prosecutor, an idea that was raised in the Wiebenga report in April of this year."
"Recommendations 85, 86 and 87 are of particular interest."
"The Commission is always ultimately accountable to Parliament."
"Individual accountability to the Commissioners must be the first priority."
"And it is particularly important that any Commissioner who knowingly misleads Parliament must resign."
"I consider that to be an excellent proposal."
"I believe a heavy task awaits us in view of the low turnout at the elections."
"Together with the new Commission, we will need to develop improved structures, so as to increase Europe' s credibility."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Commissioners, the report that we have before us is, I feel, an impressive work."
"It undoubtedly exercises the mind in an extremely useful way, coming as it does in the wake of the first report produced last March."
"In any case, it shows that there is a need for greater transparency."
"For almost three hundred pages, the experts bash away remorselessly at the problems relating to management, supervisory mechanisms, the fight against fraud, personnel management and business organisation."
"In so doing, they do not shrink from taking the Commission severely to task, but they also refer to what has sometimes been weak behaviour on the part of the European Parliament and the Council."
"I feel this only increases the objectivity of this report."
"I fully endorse my colleague Mr Mulder' s comments on the Flechard case."
"Be that as it may, our group considers that this report has come slightly too late."
"It should have been available when the hearings started at the beginning of this month."
"There is no doubt that it contains a whole armoury of facts that we could have used to good effect during our hearings."
"Certainly as far as Commissioner-designate Kinnock was concerned, who will probably be responsible for reforming the Commission, it has provided us with facts which could really have added to the discussion."
"I will cite just two examples."
"Under point 2.323 the Committee of Wise Men suggests that when the Commission' s contracts are put out to tender, non-profit making associations are used which have been set up by officials or officials' acquaintances."
"What truth is there to this?"
"It could have been an interesting debate."
"The Committee of Wise Men also refers to the handbook that Santer' s dismissed Commission compiled on Technical Assistance Offices."
"The Committee of Wise Men considers this to have been an analytical error."
"It could have been an interesting debate with Commissioner Kinnock."
"It is all too late though."
"Be that as it may, the crunch question now is what does Prodi' s Commission intend to do with this document?"
"I have been told that Mr Prodi said in the Conference of Presidents that this document has no legal basis."
"Is that so?"
"In any case, our group considered it unacceptable that this document should just be brushed aside."
"Our group of greens, regionalists and nationalists wants Mr Prodi to take this document seriously."
"The European Parliament and the Commission financed the five Wise Men."
"In the course of the last six months, they have spoken to many people working at the Commission, and their analysis is damning and sometimes caustic."
"Messrs Prodi and Kinnock, what do you intend to do with this report?"
"As a matter of fact, I feel that it would be a good thing if the Commission, which is soon to take office, were to provide answers on a point by point basis to the proposals and comments made by the Committee of Wise Men."
"Come what may, there must be some follow-up to this document in the European Parliament."
"I am very pleased that the Conference of Presidents has proposed that this document should be referred to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It is certainly the case that this committee must now draw up an own-initiative report, but I would also like to appeal to all the other committees which, in view of their expertise, could each make a particularly substantial contribution."
"I have in mind the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Regional Policy, and also of course, the Committee on Industry, which could make a number of concrete proposals in the run-up to the IGC."
"To conclude, let us be quite honest about this, the Committee on Budgetary Control has done a lot of work in this area over the past five years."
"But at the end of the day, it was a humble official on level B3 who, in December 1998, passed a 700-page memorandum to the European Parliament, and whom we owe thanks to for the fact that this document at last came into being."
"His actions had a catalytic effect and ultimately led to the appointment of the Committee of Wise Men."
"I fully endorse Mr Pöttering' s proposals on this matter, but I would like to point out to Mr Kinnock that Mr Van Buitenen is still in the dark so far as his position is concerned."
"The disciplinary procedure to which he is subject is still on-going."
"Would Mr Kinnock, working together with the whole Commission as a College, undertake to bring this disciplinary procedure to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible after his appointment, so that Mr Van Buitenen can at last return to work in the right and proper manner and have his reputation restored?"
"Madam President, my colleague Herman Schmid will be making a contribution on behalf of my group in this debate."
"I would, however, like to make a preliminary comment and ask a very concrete question of Mr Kinnock."
"Reading the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts shows how right we were to ask these five wise men to pursue their investigations and their thinking beyond the cases of the individual Commissioners and, in particular, to draw up a more general diagnosis of the institution as a whole."
"For this diagnosis is an edifying one."
"The title of the report alone represents strong condemnation of the outgoing Commission: tackling maladministration, irregularities and fraud."
"The former Commission must be reminded, 42 years after the creation of this institution, of the necessity of, I quote: ""making Commissioners responsible from the initial drawing up of a proposal through to its implementation"" ."
"The matter is in fact one, as one can read in the conclusions of the Experts' report, beyond the actual operational problems, of an attitude problem, one which implicates not the staff of the Commission, but the structural deficiencies of this institution, which are of a political rather than technical nature."
"Another document had already been produced on this subject, proposing an analysis which was, in my view, lucid and pertinent."
"What is more, it had been commissioned by the Commission itself from its own Forward Studies Unit in preparation for the European Council of Pörtschach, and was subsequently classified as not to be followed up."
"It contained, for example, fundamental criticism of the propensity of the Commission - like other administrations - to, I quote: ""deal with its own area according to a logic of its own, listening to a particular type of lobbying, and taking insufficient account of the consequences outside its own field of expertise"" ."
"This exposition of the internal workings of the crisis which the Commission is going through, and with which all the European institutions are faced, would contribute towards usefully placing the analyses of the Independent Experts in their global political context, which is characterised, in the terms of the Forward Studies Unit document in question, by the exhaustion of a certain manner of organising public action, by a crisis in governance which is clashing head-on with the European Union."
"My question to Commissioner Kinnock is thus a simple one: do you agree to make public this document of the outgoing Commission, whose great topicality is shown by our debate?"
"Madam President, the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts, which has just been issued to us, is remarkable in terms of the breadth and the quality of the work achieved within a few months, and also in terms of the will to describe frankly the internal operational problems of the Commission."
"It is the first time I have read as incisive an analysis from an official source, without waffle or prevarication."
"It will provide a basis for working towards serious reforms."
"In the report, one discovers that the rules regarding the awarding of subsidies are practically non-existent; that the advisory committee on procurement and contracts common to the institutions has only a formal and subordinate checking role."
"That the Commission has turned to the technical assistance office in order to get around budgetary restrictions; that in shared operation expenses, the Commission and the Member States take responsibility away from each other; that a priori financial control is practically useless; that internal auditing is inadequate; that the Financial Regulation is unsuitable for the requirements of modern management and effective monitoring or that the enquiries of the anti-fraud unit have a tendency to drag on too long and offer only minimal results."
"These observations match what my group has long been denouncing, and also, indeed, the technical solutions suggested, i.e. reinforcement of internal auditing, of anti-fraud action, of transparency, and the requirement for the Commission to be accountable."
"It seems to us, though, that the Committee of Independent Experts does not go far enough in the analysis of the political causes of the crisis, but perhaps, after all, this was not its role at this stage."
"For example, reading phrases such as this, on page 64, ""Why has the Commission lost control over technical assistance?"
"Because the Financial Regulation has never adequately spelt out the law on contracts"" , one cannot help having the disturbing impression that thinking remains incomplete."
"Why indeed was the Financial Regulation unsuitable?"
"Why was it not improved?"
"Is it not true that a lot of people found advantages in these imperfections?"
"And, in the final analysis, is it not true that the theory of the independence of the Commission, as cultivated by the Federalists, but resulting in the weakening of controls, has provided a breeding ground for irregularities and fraud which go unpunished?"
"Under cover of this, indeed, organised networks have been set in place to misappropriate and launder Community money, such that today fraud is essentially not the result of individual slips, like those denounced in the first report of the Experts, but rather of permanent covert mechanisms."
"This is why, according to the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, the real political problem we face today is that of the statutes of the Commission, a supranational institution subject to limited control and protected by prerogative, privilege and immunity."
"In this regard we are witnesses to a disturbing development."
"Whilst, in recent times, the European Parliament has been attempting to strengthen its control of the Commission and the theory of its independence should logically have been retreating, it has instead re-emerged and been re-affirmed with new vigour, no longer at the level of the Commissioners but at the level of the departments."
"Thus, during the hearings of last week, Commissioner-designate Kinnock clearly upheld, both in his written answers and his spoken responses, two curious principles which I shall quote verbatim."
"Firstly, ""management independence"" which the Directorates-General enjoy with regard to the Commissioners and, as a corollary to this, the ""principle of non-interference"" which the Commissioners are subject to with regard to the departments."
"Mr Kinnock even specified that, in his experience over recent years, these principles worked very well."
"Obviously, this is by no means the opinion of my group, nor is it the opinion of the Committee of Independent Experts who, in Chapter 7, rightly state that the distinction within the Commission between laying down policy and implementing policy is tenable, I quote, ""neither in law nor in fact"" ."
"It makes it possible to evade political responsibility, and it should logically be eliminated in favour of accountability to the Commissioners who have political responsibility."
"There we see a complete contradiction between the recommendations of the Experts' report and the declared intentions of the new Commission."
"We must draw our own conclusions from this when voting in the election of the Commission on Wednesday."
"Everyone must accept their own responsibilities."
"As for the privileges and immunities of the Commission and its staff, they clearly seem, from reading the report, to constitute a serious brake on the fight against fraud."
"This is, in fact, the first obstacle which OLAF, the anti-fraud office, faces when it wishes to expedite a case against the staff of the European institutions in national courts of law."
"In fact, to quote the report, ""to proceed with a criminal investigation, a national jurisdiction must request waivers of official immunity (for suspects), of professional secrecy (for witnesses) and of the inviolability of Commission premises (for searches and access to documents)"" ."
"Such obstacles are enough to discourage the best will in the world."
"This is why the priority of my group is to get rid of them and to subject the Commission to common law before investigating other solutions such as the institution of a European Public Prosecutor, which would satisfy the Federalist hobby horses but would not contribute a great deal more in relation to the powers of OLAF in the fight against fraud."
"More generally, control over the Commission should be strengthened."
"Control by the European Parliament of course; for example, our House should, following this Experts' report, request new audits on specific points or even appoint one or more committees of enquiry in order to shed light on some still obscure areas, for example, the evaluation of the actual impact of community subsidies."
"But if it stands alone, European Parliament control over the Commission will be insufficient for two reasons: firstly, because the European Parliament shares the objectives of the Commission and because Parliament is not subject to the pressure of pubic opinion."
"That is why there must be Council control in addition to Parliament control."
"The Council must stop letting itself be brainwashed by the peculiar arguments of the Federalists."
"It must re-establish its authority and strip the Commission of its outmoded privileges and immunities."
"Above all, it must not let itself be deprived of the future Intergovernmental Conference, which it must take advantage of in order to take the initiative again, reinforce the anti-fraud campaign and subject the Commission to a new form of responsibility with regard to national governments."
"Mr President, we are being asked to comment on a 283-page report that was not released until late on Friday morning, and that was produced in two languages."
"In between there has been a weekend and today most people have spent the whole day travelling to Strasbourg."
"We cannot possibly comment in any way at all in such a short space of time."
"It is not possible for us to have formed any real opinions."
"For certain, no business would ever operate like this."
"But perhaps I should not be surprised because it seems to me that in the European Union one is drowned in paper to the level where the European Parliament - and, I am sure, the Council of Ministers - cannot actually read what they are being asked to approve."
"In this world the bureaucrat most certainly is king."
"There are, however, two points that I have picked up: firstly the outgoing Commissioners complained that in practice they were unable to supervise the actions of their most senior officials, namely, their Directors-General."
"It seems to me unacceptable that the Commissioners can be the executive of the EU without having the responsibility that goes with it."
"But the real meat of this is Recommendation No. 59 which urges strongly the appointment of a European public prosecutor, which urges strongly a European prosecution office with delegated public prosecutors in Member States to create ""an area of freedom, security and justice as laid down in the Treaty"" ."
"The British Government has repeatedly told us that corpus juris was merely a discussion document."
"And yet it would appear that we are at the beginning now of an entirely new legal system just for the sake of a few fraudulent officials."
"It is quite unacceptable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally the Wise Men' s report is an excellent report, and naturally their recommendations must be studied in great detail."
"I would say that, as with their first report, which had a far-reaching effect on the College of Commissioners, I also think that this second report, if possible, should have an effect that is just as far-reaching and severe, where it is deemed necessary, on the structure of the Commission."
"However, since everyone is talking about the Commission, I would like to talk instead about the European Parliament."
"Every now and again some self-criticism does not hurt, and the same goes for the other institutions."
"Firstly, I would like to say to my colleagues who, in January and February, protested against the motion which established the Committee of Wise Men, thinking that it was a kind of manoeuvring to stifle everything through the creation of a committee, that I think they realise they were very wrong in their viewpoint and reasoning, and they should at least withdraw all the criticisms they made at that time of the European Parliament' s initiative, which I believe was a positive move, on the part of those Members who voted to establish the Group of the Wise Men."
"And I would also like our Parliament itself to take its cue from the Wise Men' s report."
"What does the Wise Men' s report say?"
"It says that the institutions and the budgetary authorities were likewise not very quick to detect a series of irregularities and that they themselves did not operate in the best and wisest way to prevent the consequences either."
"I am thinking, for example, of the great policy which led us to drop the famous mini-budgets."
"Our Parliament, ready for battle, created a policy which brought about - and we are proud of it - the abolition of mini-budgets."
"It seemed to be the overall solution."
"The abolition of the mini-budgets and a freeze on human resources: this was the recipe that the Commission should have followed to implement infinite additional policies."
"Naturally, four years on, the result is that those who protested against the mini-budgets are now saying: ah, you have given the jobs to the TAOs, to the Technical Assistance Offices!"
"A little self-criticism then!"
"From those same pulpits now comes the argument, for example, on helicopters: much is said about Agusta but we never hear about Westland, for example."
"Well, I would like to hear about the Westland case from those pulpits that have so much to say on the Agusta case, given that the Commission had an interest in these helicopter stories too."
"I have strayed from the point a little, but to get back to the subject, I would say then that our Parliament should..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have impatiently awaited the second report from the Wise Men and I cannot conceal the fact that I would have preferred to have had it before the hearings of the Commission candidates were held rather than afterwards."
"But we do now have it and it was announced that it would not be a continuation of the first report and would therefore not contain any new revelations."
"Rather the report is providing us with a yardstick for the reform of the European Commission, which the future President, Romano Prodi, has announced, and which has just been confirmed again in some detail by Mr Kinnock."
"The report also makes it clear how necessary a far-reaching wholesale reorganisation and rearrangement is and that it is not enough to carry out only selective modifications."
"Even where the subject of this second draft of the Wise Men talks in somewhat theoretical terms of ""cultural practices and Commission procedures"" , the question of the improved utilisation, supervision and thereby protection of Community finances runs like a red thread through the thoroughly analysed areas."
"Recommendations are included, which Parliament, for the most part, has already stipulated as requirements for the previous Commission."
"Will they now be adhered to?"
"Mr Kinnock, we will have to take you at your word."
"I am thinking in this regard of the question of the Financial Regulation and its adaptation, efficient controls, independence of financial control, the significance of discharge and, above all, the question of clear definitions of tasks and responsibility for the individual departments, officials and Commissioners."
"A clear reference to ethical responsibility will be a pointer to a new culture that does not just stop at the Secretary-General, the Cabinets and the Commissioners."
"If the Code of Conduct for the Commission is described as being insufficient and the Wise Men call for a stricter code for the administration, if the disciplinary process is reformed and sanctions brought about, then in this way our demands will also be taken up, the fulfilment of which we will have to keep an eye on."
"As far as the complex matter of combating fraud is concerned, the call of the five Wise Men for a European Prosecution Office raised eyebrows and rightly so."
"The significance of this point is not impaired by the fact that the Wise Men were not the first to call for this."
"I am casting my mind back to the reports of my colleagues, Fabra Vallés and Bösch, as well as my own report concerning criminal prosecution to protect the financial interests of the Union."
"This key question must be resolved if we want to successfully defend ourselves against fraud and corruption, which is to the detriment of European contributors."
"The goal, which the Wise Men have set, the creation of a European Prosecution Office within a year, is ambitious, yet it is completely feasible if the will is there."
"With close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, within three months we have succeeded in establishing the new, independent anti-fraud office OLAF."
"Now the next step must be taken."
"Here as well, the new Commission will have to be measured in terms of their willingness for reform, as demanded by the public and Parliament."
"Although the reports of the five Wise Men have been regarded as being helpful, in future Parliament should again assume responsibility for supervisory functions and not pass this responsibility on to outside parties."
"We do want a strong Commission but we also want a strong Parliament."
"In any case, the second report of the Wise Men still has to be prepared for the plenum by the competent committee, and for this we require all the documentation and information which the Wise Men had access to."
"On this matter I would like to put another question to Mr Kinnock, a question which was not answered in the hearings: will the Committee on Budgetary Control also have access to the same documentation and information made available to the Wise Men?"
"I believe that we can then work together towards a sound future for the European Union."
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for informing us of the action that is to be taken and of the debate due to take place in February."
"The European Union is in a paradoxical situation."
"On the one hand, there is a great deal of support for the ""people' s Europe"" , food, air quality and so on, and a variety of issues must be tackled at a European level."
"The citizens support this and consider it to be important, but on the other hand, they do not understand how the workings of the European institutions actually function."
"The low turnout at the elections reflects this lack of understanding."
"It will undoubtedly be possible to tackle some of the problems on the basis of the report of the Committee of Wise Men. To some extent, and others have made this point here, it is also something that we as a Parliament must address ourselves."
"If there were less of an ivory tower mentality in the hemicycles and more interaction with ordinary citizens; if more time was spent amongst them; if there were not so many debates between experts and institutional specialists and institutional debates were to take place rather as a result of tackling actual problems, then Europe would draw much closer to its citizens."
"It is not just the Commission and the institutions that are deserving of criticism, for we too have a difficult task ahead of us."
"When the debate with the Commission takes place in February, we will also need to hold a debate ourselves."
"Madam President, as regards the second report which we now have before us, issues such as subsidiarity, the delegation of competencies, the importance of combating fraud using independent agencies, are the key concepts."
"They are underpinned by a vision."
"Less centralised hierarchical control over social and economic affairs, with more delegation to States and to social organisations would create space and consequently greater clarity in job demarcation."
"That too demands a certain vision."
"A kind of vision that certainly was not always of central importance in this Chamber."
"I am very curious as to whether that is the path that will be chosen in February."
"If that path is chosen, then that will mean creating a different kind of culture."
"In Mr Kinnock' s words, a different culture for officialdom, getting away from the island structure that we have now, a more inviting work atmosphere, entailing a different remuneration structure."
"My personal view, and I say this without hesitation, is that the expatriation allowance should be abolished too, for no one has to feel all that much of an expatriate in Brussels."
"We support the idea of a European Prosecution Office and its being independent."
"It could be seen as a trial run prior to establishing a European Public Ministry in the longer term."
"It would mean a more clear-cut relationship with Parliament and effective supervision. It would not be under the supervision of the President of the Commission, but rather there would be a more clear-cut relationship with this Parliament."
"Madam President, might I also make a suggestion as regards the events referred to by Mr Kinnock which are to take place in February?"
"Why, if there are so many important issues at stake in our Member States, do we not ask them to initiate debate in the regions and local councils on fund spending and end-results, enabling a public debate to take place in these countries, which will feed into our work and ensure that these two issues are not separated?"
"I am in favour of having a European-wide national day of monitoring for fund end-results."
"Lastly, Madam President, on the subject of the whistle-blowers, I hope that we will soon know when the matter is to be settled and I support everything that has been said in this Chamber about Mr Van Buitenen."
"Madam President, as Vice-President of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I will have plenty of time in the coming weeks to exchange ideas with Mr Kinnock and other Members of the Commission on this report."
"I want to restrict the comments I make now to a few major points."
"Firstly, we must not forget why this all started if we are to guard against losing the support of the European people as we embrace the major challenges of the future."
"And we need to aim high in the face of such major challenges."
"That is why I see this report not as a panacea but as a modest starting point for the reforms which are to take place."
"And so I challenge the Commission not to regard this report as the ultimate yardstick but merely as the minimum level to which we should aspire."
"Listening to Mr Kinnock, I also hope that we can trust him to push his proposals for reform this far and that he will do all that is necessary and not just work through a wish list like the one we have here."
"Secondly, this report could be used by some individuals in this Chamber, and also outside it, to pass the buck to the Commission, so that they get all the blame for the crisis in Europe."
"This has happened in the past and I want to warn everyone to guard against it happening again."
"The Commission is now being investigated and we applaud this, for it is a first step towards improving the situation."
"But we cannot blame the Commission alone for the crisis of confidence as regards Europe."
"The European Parliament has its own role to play here and it is also time now for us to hold up our hands and put our own house in order, just as if a report had been written on our working practices."
"Nor should we forget the part played by the national parliaments and governments."
"More than 80% of all fraud goes on there."
"That is why it would also be a good idea to create a legal structure for carrying out effective supervision of the way in which these Member States spend European money."
"Finally, a few words about Paul Van Buitenen."
"He has become symbolic of the fight against fraud in Europe, probably reluctantly."
"The care we take over a symbol of this kind here in Europe could, to a very large extent, determine whether or not we regain the trust of the citizens of Europe, which is why we must ensure that the Commission, and particularly Mr Kinnock, live up to the pledges undertaken during the hearings with regard to Mr Van Buitenen."
"But I am sure the Commission was already aware that we will continue to keep a very close eye on this."
"Madam President, as I round off this Dutch trio, I would not wish to deprive you of hearing about the feelings I experienced over the weekend."
"I must say it was difficult to suppress a certain amount of despondency."
"Thirty degrees outside and I was indoors ploughing my way through an enormous, well-documented, but also depressing analysis of the functioning of the European Commission."
"Fortunately these analyses were followed by many well-documented and well thought through recommendations and solutions."
"There is no point in going into detail right now, but I would like to mention two."
"One is the proposal to set up an independent internal auditing service, which is directly accountable to the President of the Commission."
"I am pleased that Mr Kinnock promised when he delivered his answers during the first round, that this idea would be taken up by the Commission in any case."
"The same goes for the proposal to establish a Public Prosecutor."
"A Public Prosecutor in Brussels and also in the Member States having special responsibility for fraud involving European money."
"To be quite honest, I am a little more circumspect about the third step in the Committee of Wise Men' s proposal."
"The third proposal relates to a European bureau, a European Prosecution Office, an EPO."
"It is not just to do with the abbreviation EPO, which is just a little too reminiscent of doping scandals for my liking; it is our view that that third institution, that third step in the process is taking things just a touch too far at this stage, and that we are being a little premature in concluding that it all has to be done at a European level."
"Returning to the broad outlines of the Commission' s proposal, the report clearly shows that the personal errors of judgement of a number of Commissioners which were laid bare so painstakingly in the first report, were committed within an organisation which falls short on a number of crucial points."
"I think that it is crystal clear to anyone who has read through 300 pages, or even 100 pages, that the European Commission needs to be reformed if not just the Commission, but also the European Union, wish to retain their credibility."
"But various things must first be done."
"I would like to ask Mr Kinnock the following question: in Recommendation No. 36, based on what is, to my mind, a very correct analysis in Chapter IV, emphasis is once again placed on the fact that ultimately the individual Commissioners are the ones who are responsible, not just for the political functioning of their Directorate-General but also for financial management and control."
"I would very much appreciate it if Mr Kinnock were to endorse this analysis and the findings."
"I think that is one of the most important prerequisites for the effective functioning of a new Commission."
"A second point which, to my mind, must not be ignored, is the role and influence of the IGC, the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think that it would be impossible, after this report, to regard the agenda for the IGC and everything that went on in the report, separately from each other, because the role of the Member States, of Parliament and the Commission, for example when it comes to the budget, control and discharge, really is under discussion."
"And Mr Marín has already said that a number of changes proposed in the report cannot be made without treaty amendments and, to my mind, it would be a very bad thing if Parliament, Commission and Council were shortly to set to work on an IGC without addressing these problems in the process."
"A third point which merits attention is as follows: it is right and proper that the Committee on Budgetary Control has been designated as the committee in Parliament which must address the report."
"I completely agree with Mrs Theato that this can only be done if all the papers held by the Commission are also passed through to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The fundamental and sweeping reform of the Commission will be of crucial importance and, of course, the first wave of reform must apply to the Commission itself."
"If this takes place without the involvement of Parliament in a transparent and effective manner, then I fear it will not succeed."
"If you want it to succeed, if you want to involve Parliament in the mammoth task awaiting you, then you can count on the support of my group."
"Mr President, when you read this report by the Committee of Independent Experts, you are amazed at how many unsatisfactory states of affairs are reported there; so amazed, in fact, that you wonder how it can have been possible for there to be so many."
"I think that the committee has really left us a bit in the lurch in regard to this."
"I do not think the analysis it offers is sufficiently thorough and searching, but is too superficial."
"I will try to explain what I mean by that."
"The experts are looking for more rationality, more administrative professionalism etc., but they are ignoring what is itself the main problem with the Commission, namely that the Commission is a political bureaucracy."
"In classical bureaucracy theory, a sharp distinction was made between the political and the bureaucratic."
"The bureaucracy was to be a neutral organisation, drawing its impetus from the political system."
"But the Commission is a political democracy."
"The main problem which has given rise to the cheating, fraud and other difficulties there have been over the years is precisely the fact that the Commission is political in character, meaning that it acts politically and is therefore treated in a political way by other political forces."
"I also think that the committee' s recommendations point in the direction of a strengthened political democracy."
"The talk is of more internal monitoring, increased management responsibility and a more efficient and cohesive bureaucracy with more muscle."
"That is how I would summarise the ninety recommendations."
"I had hoped to hear something quite different: more talk about the principle of transparency, more talk about freedom of information."
"How are people like Van Buitenen going to go on in the future? Will they get caught?"
"Will they be stopped? Will they be silenced, or will they get to speak freely?"
"I would like to hear more talk about openness and public control. That is the first problem I think requires a deeper analysis, that is to say how a political democracy' s internal antagonisms and problems are to be dealt with."
"The second problem, which is also a major one, is in fact touched upon in the report, but too superficially."
"It has to do with the antagonism between the Member States and the central EU community."
"We all know that this is an on-going antagonism that characterises day-to-day life in the EU in everything, big and small."
"Joint decisions are taken at one level and are then put into effect by an administrative apparatus with offshoots all around Europe."
"International interests then come to dominate more often than not."
"That is when you get cheating and bad supervision and when even the EU' s inspectors and their attempts to carry out inspections are viewed as abusive meddling or as disagreeable acts of hostility."
"You do not solve the problem by sending in more EU inspectors or by tightening up on the hierarchical controls."
"Quite different approaches are needed."
"The talk must be of democracy."
"Discussions have to be started about how the Commission might be de-politicised and about how political power might be transferred to the actual political bodies."
"How do you go about that?"
"Do you create a relationship between democracy and administration such as we have in the democratic nation states?"
"Renationalisation is also a tool we can work with."
"Large parts of the EU' s activities would benefit from renationalisation."
"This would also reduce the problems concerning legitimacy."
"Political reforms are needed, then, and not just administrative reforms."
"I' ll conclude by turning to Mr Kinnock and to President of the Commission Prodi and asking some specific questions. What is the situation now regarding freedom to provide information?"
"Are we to be getting any changes or guarantees in this connection?"
"What is happening about the principle of transparency?"
"What is to be done about the political character of the Commission?"
"Is this something we want to hold on to and develop or is it something we want progressively to do away with?"
"Those of us who sit in this Parliament experience on a daily basis just how powerful the Commission is as a political factor."
"Is this the road we want to go down, or ought we to be moving in the direction of the classical relationship between political and bureaucratic authorities?"
"Madam President, when it comes to financial management, the following holds true: trust is good but control is better."
"I want to consider the Wise Men' s second report in this light."
"Their criticisms leave little to be desired in terms of clarity."
"Control over the European programmes must be greatly improved."
"The report demonstrates again the importance of control before the event."
"Control after the event should be the finishing touch."
"The new Commission should make the improvement of financial management and combating fraud its highest priority, but this would mean making a lot of changes."
"Up until now, most Commissioners were interested primarily in new policies."
"The Wise Men refer to it as expansionism in the Delors era."
"Little attention was given to management of the programmes."
"There are a number of reasons why we have no use for expansionist tendencies Delors-style."
"The Union should concentrate on its core tasks and to carrying them out to good effect as well."
"The Wise Men say the legal framework for tackling fraud is disjointed and incomplete."
"This must be improved with all speed, as must cooperation with the national control organisations."
"After all, a good two thirds of the European budget is channelled via the Member States."
"Is the Commission prepared to step up the controls in the Member States to a considerable extent? 150 control visits per year are currently undertaken in relation to an agricultural budget of EUR 40 billion, which is nowhere near enough."
"To conclude, this Parliament has stringent requirements as far as the European Commission' s financial management is concerned."
"Practically all the instruments for tackling fraud originated in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"But that means that we must also set high standards for ourselves, on the subject of which, I am attracted by the idea of imposing a kind of interinstitutional Code of Conduct on the committee."
"Parliament should take up the gauntlet here."
"Mr President, the second report of the Committee of Wise Men is an important contribution, while not containing too many big surprises."
"It deals in the main almost inevitably with the reform proposals which we today regard as being necessary."
"Of course, I cannot go into detail on all the recommendations contained in the report, but I would like to concentrate on one problem, namely that of individual responsibility."
"When the Wise Men' s report, which expressly does not draw a distinction between administrative and political responsibility, calls, inter alia, for the Commission President to have the authority to dismiss individual Commission members, then, to my mind this requirement does not do justice to the gentlemen' s agreement between President Prodi and the Commissioners-designate."
"In any case, as called for in the report, what is required is a relevant contractual regulation designed to provide a firm basis for a form of individual responsibility which is legally enforceable in serious cases."
"The agreement can only be a transitional regulation."
"No one has so far been able to explain to me, and the report in question has not helped in this regard either, how those Commissioners who are standing again have contributed to exclusive collective responsibility, something which has been criticised by us but which is legally stipulated."
"In view of this de facto rejected responsibility, it is now difficult however to take the explanations of the Commissioners seriously, i.e. that they would in future resign if requested to do so by the Commission President."
"With good reason, the report additionally calls for the Commissioners to be directly responsible to Parliament, but the gentlemen' s agreement also brings with it the danger that if we trust it, we could prevent ourselves from actually taking the necessary radical steps."
"That should certainly not be allowed to happen."
"I consider it absolutely necessary that the recommendations in this regard from the Committee of Wise Men be included in the programme for the next Intergovernmental Conference and be legally transposed, in spite of the explanations given by the designated Commissioners."
"That should be a considerable pillar for effective cooperation between the institutions from the point of view of citizens' interests."
"Mr President, like many, I am pleased to have a document which will undoubtedly be useful in the process of administrative reform which the Commission must undergo, unavoidably, in the short-term. Commissioner Kinnock will no doubt be delighted to have this guide and, perhaps, alibi."
"However, apart from this shared sentiment, I am also pleased for other reasons. In particular, because I hope it will put an end to the unhealthy climate which is stifling the discussion of Community matters."
"Too often, the unavoidable and laudable concern for good management and the fight against fraud has been manipulated and used in demagogic and hypocritical operations, deliberately aimed at the discrediting of the European Institutions and even the European project itself."
"Well-intentioned colleagues have fallen naively into this anti-European trap."
"I confess that, having seen the product issued to us by the Committee of Independent Experts, my initial doubts remain with regard to whether its appointment did not basically illustrate a certain recognition of the inability of our own systems of control and political orientation."
"I trust that the voters will not demand to know who is responsible for the cost of the report given that, as well as penetrating observations, I have noted the presence of obvious remarks, various ""re-discoveries of the wheel"" and a wide use of our own documents."
"Although my mental hygiene rules for the weekends have stopped me from dedicating the hours to my reading of the report which it no doubt deserves, I believe that it has an additional virtue little appreciated by my predecessors, if I may use that word. In many points, it takes up positions of Parliament and proposals which were not favoured in their day."
"It is to be hoped that now, endorsed by independent and well paid experts, they will be better treated."
"Some of our colleagues have dedicated dithyrambic eulogies to the report, which we might have been spared had they paid more attention to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control or had they not voted against some of our suggestions."
"Do not oblige me to mention any names, but I do not have to look far to see people in these very seats who now applaud the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor, but who had no hesitation in voting against it when Mrs Theato and myself proposed it a couple of years ago, anticipating that this would require going ahead with the creation of a European judicial area and amending the Treaties."
"A new Financial Regulation."
"Enough of patching up and ""updating"" processes."
"Excellent."
"I have spent fourteen years in the Committee on Budgetary Control and, without delving into my archives, I can remember four resolutions of the Plenum in which this very thing was demanded."
"I requested it myself from this bench last year from Commissioner Liikanen on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"Time is at a premium and I would like to highlight a couple of observations which are important, if not fundamental."
"Firstly, the Committee of Independent Experts recognises that, in spite of the fact that ultimate responsibility for management falls to the Commission, we should not forget that Member State administrations handle more than 80% of the Community budget and that their attitude towards fraud is not always diligent, although their Ministers do protest about Community management."
"They have clearly read Mr Brinkhorst' s working document of May last year."
"Secondly, in its final observation 8.1, the committee highlights that the Commission must be provided with the resources necessary for its responsibilities and stipulates that it is not only referring to those laid down in the Regulations."
"It is de facto alluding to the possible hypocrisy and incoherence of the budgetary authorities."
"And lastly, chapter 5 refers to ""whistle-blowers"" ."
"Before anybody proposes the restoration of torture in the investigative processes, I would ask, please, that the defence of the accused be attended to."
"Mr President, one of the aspects of the discussion on the Experts' report concerns Community personnel which includes, I believe, the staff of the European Parliament."
"This is why my question is addressed as much to Mr Kinnock as to the President of the Parliament."
"In their report, the Experts highlighted the non-transparency which taints recruitment and recommended that regulations and principles be applied to Community personnel."
"That is all well and good, but it should also be the case for the staff of the European Parliament."
"The fact is, we have heard of many instances of irregularities, of non-observance of the Community Charter of Basic Social Rights for Workers within the European Parliament, especially in sub-contracting firms."
"There have, for example, been irregularities as gross as paying night watchmen at day work rates."
"There is also the problem of social welfare cover according to local law. There are problems with wages."
"And these are just a few examples."
"My question is thus as follows: what action do you intend to take in order, in the first place, to make an inventory of all these irregularities and, more especially, of course, to put an end to them?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been possible to make an in-depth analysis of what the Wise Men have said from an initial examination of the report that we have received and also from a comparison of this examination with what my colleagues have said in the Chamber."
"We had the feeling, or at least I had the feeling, that we are faced with a wonderful exposition of analyses, proposals, rules and legal points which seem very impressive, but which do not really change anything."
"It has been said that there are 90 recommendations."
"It is true that God made 10 recommendations but especially in the case of the seventh commandment, he did not manage to put a stop to the large numbers of thieves and delinquents who crowd our planet."
"I hope that in some way something can come of these rules, but I think that we have to start, as a Parliament, but in the first place as individuals, by proposing firmly that the activities of Parliament' s inspection body with regard to the Commission be stepped up, thereby providing us with a procedural method."
"Today, we have had a statement by the President of the Parliament who announced the dissolution of the Technical Group of Independent Members."
"Here too, in my opinion, we are dealing with genuine fraud as it certainly is not a good example of democracy and freedom to have the authority to overrule the free will of people who unite on the basis of one of the Rules of Procedure."
"On the contrary, if a Member of Parliament was to think that this act came about simply because of the economic budget of the groups and the assistants, then we are dealing with an out and out case of fraud."
"Mr President, many Europeans were awaiting this report to see when the hard core, the driving force which the Commission is supposed to be, will finally begin to function at a certain amount of speed."
"This is not the time to deal with details, since in the Committee on Budgetary Control, thanks to the proposal which we have made, we will have the opportunity to closely observe the work of Commissioner Kinnock."
"He tells us that he will respond effectively."
"Perhaps we will have our first opportunity to see whether this is the case in a month' s time when the Justice and Home Affairs Council takes place."
"I do not know whether or not you will have time to include in the agenda of that Council meeting some of the questions put forward in the report of the Committee of Independent Experts which I believe are supported by general consensus."
"There is no doubt that the fight against fraud should be one of the objectives which we aim for immediately."
"I believe that we should offer OLAF the necessary resources as soon as possible so that it can carry out its work efficiently, but it is nevertheless essential that budgetary control goes much further than the sixth part which is directly controlled by the Commission."
"We will have to pursue those 1,327 cases which in 1997 were included in the former UCLAF."
"The current legal framework is incoherent and incomplete."
"We will have to work, steadily and relentlessly, to remove that permanent suspicion of fraud which, unfortunately, engulfs the activities of the Community institutions."
"But I do not wish to dwell on these issues, since I agree that the enormous majority of people who work for Europe are competent and honest."
"It is perhaps not the resources lost through fraud or corruption which should worry us most but rather those lost through the absence of a personnel policy, as claimed by the Committee of Independent Experts."
"Those inefficiencies, those mistakes and that lack of motivation which affect the work of the people who work for the Commission must be, from our point of view, one of the principle areas of activity of the reform of the Commission."
"Chapter 6 of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts, which we have not had time to study in detail, demands absolute transparency."
"It demands it, perhaps, because we have never had it."
"There has certainly never been transparency in the policies of recruitment, promotion or mobility."
"We want a Commission which is strong and independent."
"Therefore, we want you to be prepared to say no when you are asked to carry out work for which you do not have the resources."
"You must not accept commitments which you are not able to fulfil effectively."
"In your hearing, Mr Kinnock, we heard that there are 500 posts, which have been authorised by Parliament, which are still vacant."
"Perhaps this was pressure?"
"Distribution of power?"
"Lack of transparency in recruitment procedures?"
"It is essential to evaluate the merits of the personnel who work for the Commission, to have a genuine career policy."
"I have noticed that, amongst the 90 recommendations of the Independent Experts, some describe an Anglo-Saxon style administration, where more responsibility falls to managers."
"It is necessary to decentralise and clarify competences."
"Not everybody is responsible for everything, neither in the management carried out in the Member States, nor in the Regions nor in the Commission."
"Therefore, Mr Kinnock, time is running out."
"The European citizens cannot allow us to fail in this pursuit."
"Let us work steadily and relentlessly because, as I have said, we cannot continue to be a source of scandal for the citizens of Europe."
"This is not good for Europe and not good for any of us."
"Mr President, as a new Member of the European Parliament I had not anticipated coming here and beginning by saying thank you."
"However, I do want to thank the group of Experts for the work they have carried out."
"It has, in fact, led us straight into matters relating to the EU' s legitimacy and credibility, straight into the core questions affecting the EU citizen: questions of accountability, openness, supervision and efficient use of the EU' s resources."
"I would also say that all this may possibly already have been discussed in Parliament (in fact, I am certain it has been), but a firm push from outside is perhaps what is needed to speed up the process."
"I would also take the opportunity to thank Paul van Buitenen."
"Secondly, I would like to thank Neil Kinnock who has given a major political response today."
"I am very pleased to be able to say that I have no important questions to ask him in this connection."
"Instead, I will say only this: with what he is promising, with the pledges he is making, we can return to our fellow citizens, our voters, and say that the process is under way."
"We are on the way to concluding a pact for radical reforms of the EU, just as our voters and all citizens of the Union expect of us. So thank you."
"Mr President, President-designate of the Commission, Romano Prodi, spoke in July of a revolution of the working method which it is now time to translate into action."
"In fact, the statements from the Wise Men make it clear that we in Europe need a new culture of responsibility and I would like to add, Mr Kinnock, that on this very point it would be an enticing prospect to continue the hearings from the past week because many issues from the hearings which are still unclear have to be tidied up in terms of definitions and clarity since we would certainly like to know how exactly the Commission should look and function in future."
"The Wise Men' s second report contains approximately 90 recommendations which are worth analysing and discussing carefully."
"I shall pick out four points. There are the recommendations relating to the Commission' s Code of Conduct."
"The Committee of the Wise Men says that these recommendations have not yet been fully incorporated into the Commission' s proposals."
"When I look at the wording of the Wise Men on this point, what they talk about are actually foregone conclusions, and it really is surprising that the Commission has not even transposed these in the past."
"As regards OLAF, I am of the opinion that it should be made clear that the strict independence of OLAF, which is something we all want, must include the operative, independent capacity to act."
"This has to do with personnel provision and, at the end of the day, has to lead to the establishment of a European Prosecution Office."
"It is quite interesting that the Committee of Experts in its concluding remarks says that Community administration is moving towards favouring the tasks of conception and negotiation to the disadvantage of management and supervision responsibilities."
"I believe that this is the crucial point."
"We have to learn to practise successful management at a European level and this will only be achieved, and this is something that has been made clear to the Commission, if, in this regard, Parliament, the Commission and the Council can come to solutions jointly."
"I would also like to mention another point in this regard."
"In most political areas, we have committees in which representatives of the Member States have administrative and supervisory authority, but this is used by these representatives, at the end of the day, to pursue their own interests."
"Whilst not wishing to anticipate Thursday' s debate, I would like to make it very clear that, for example, the discussion regarding the creation of the reconstruction agency in Kosovo, both with regard to the legal position as well as with regard to the administrative structures for which provision has been made, is heading precisely in this direction."
"It cannot be allowed to do so, hence my reference to the discussion due to take place on Thursday."
"I expect the new Commission to comply with Parliament on these very points, as regards the legal basis and on the question of the future administrative and responsibility structures of this reconstruction agency for Kosovo."
"Otherwise, we will be creating new structures which are basically encumbered with past mistakes."
"Let me say one more thing."
"The Committee of Independent Experts has complained that the indifference with which the Council practised the discharge procedure in the past, was truly scandalous."
"In this area as well, it is quite crucial that in the interests of Europe, a new culture of responsibility takes shape in the Council itself."
"The Commission has at last taken action on quite a few issues although, with regard to BSE, it only acted after coming under pressure, and the pressure of public opinion at that."
"I say to you: in future, you are better off listening to Parliament than some policy advisors, even from among your own ranks."
"That will benefit the European project, the success of which we all certainly believe in and wish for."
"Mr President, we are debating a report of around 200 pages which contains an exhaustive analysis of the structural operation of the Commission' s departments, and yet we have had only 48 hours in which to read it and give it our consideration."
"I think that, given the seriousness of the subject, it would have been preferable if the President of the Commission had made a statement on the document which we are expecting from Mr Kinnock, on institutional reform, and to wait for a report compiled by the competent body of this House, and then formulate Parliament' s position on the future functioning of the Commission."
"We could then have done this without the conditions which have led to the rushed inclusion of this report in the plenary part-session before we have even voted on the investiture of the Commission which will have to propose and apply the reform."
"Indeed, Mr President, in the great haste which seems to hold sway over us, the competent committee for the fund has been decided on even before we know what it contains."
"It is a great source of satisfaction for me - and I would like to make this known - to have heard the current Commissioner Manuel Marín refer today to the Commission' s future with the same honesty he displayed throughout his terms in office, and the same dignity with which he took on the problems of the previous College of Commissioners."
"I must also point out that it is the outgoing Commission which is presenting this document, bringing into the debate a Member of both Colleges, but we are not altogether sure in which of his two roles he is addressing us."
"The reasons we have found ourselves in this situation, a situation the Chairman of my group has been warning of since June, are to do with the fact that we have not been able to impose the limit for institutional responsibility on those groups who thought that the report' s contents could influence the investiture of the new Commission and who, for this reason, have insisted that it be debated now."
"They have underestimated this Parliament' s ability to implement independently the competences conferred on it by the Treaties, and this has brought about the present situation: the public has the impression that we are unable to comment on the future Commission since this report, as important as it is, and as knowledgeable as its authors may be, does not really determine our political standpoint."
"As spokesperson for the Socialist Group on the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to make a few observations regarding the idea put forward in this report on the future functioning of the Commission."
"One of the mitigating circumstances in the Commission' s shortcomings, which is clear throughout the report, is the lack of resources that the Commission' s departments have in order to carry out the policies which we MEPs agree on in the area of cooperation in development and humanitarian aid, both of which fly the flag for Community action abroad."
"We cannot expect the Commission to have a growing, skilled, visible and efficient presence in the developing world if we do not provide it with the necessary means to achieve it."
"Some of the problems which afflicted the last Commission in this area of cooperation for development were sometimes due more to the imbalance between resources and aims than to poor administration."
"This is why I advocate - I believe with the consensus of the majority in this Parliament - that, in the future, together with our parliamentary requirements for efficiency, our generosity should also be realistic."
"We can start, as the budgetary authority, with the budget for the year 2000, which we have recently been debating in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Mr President, I hope that this report will prove to be a useful contribution to the reform of the Commission' s functioning."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group is prepared to contribute - given the institutional responsibility that Parliament must hold - to an improved functioning of the Community institutions, both of Parliament and of the Commission, and to demand this of the Council."
"Mr President, I shall just comment on one point made in the report by the Committee of Independent Experts, which is chapter 5, concerning fraud in the European Union."
"The Committee of Independent Experts has hit the nail on the head in the sense that, at the moment, fraud is a matter of national responsibility."
"That is to say that, theoretically, somebody could take all the European Community' s money, and if that person is brought before a court, in a legal system which does not recognise the crime of fraud against the Institutions of the European Community because it is not classified as such, that person would not even be able to be tried, because there would be no legal basis to do so."
"I think that this is quite a serious matter."
"We must remember, for example, that only four States have ratified the European Union Agreement on cooperation in the fight against fraud in the European Union and that, at the moment, there is no legal framework for combating fraud."
"The Committee of Independent Experts' report has some practical conclusions to offer on this matter."
"The most important is the creation of a European Ministry for Public Affairs in various stages."
"Both Joan Colom and Mrs Theato mentioned this. I think though, that the problem goes far beyond that."
"Specifically, the Committee of Independent Experts' report proposes that the Union Treaties be amended in order to give the European Ministry for Public Affairs far-ranging powers."
"But the question we should ask is, is it not time, if the European Union wants to protect its financial interests effectively, for a Community Criminal Law which would allow us to establish fraud against the Community' s financial interests as a Community-wide crime, and to have a competent criminal legal system?"
"I have the impression that, when all is said and done, the proposals are positive, that we should endorse them, but that probably, bearing the Intergovernmental Conference in mind, we should take them further."
"I would like to end my intervention by thanking Mr Marín for his hard work over all these years in his posts within the Commission, and in his final one as President-in-Office of the Commission, and by wishing Mr Kinnock good luck, a lot of tact and caution in the difficult tasks which await him in the forthcoming months and years."
"Mr President, I, along with my Socialist colleagues very much welcome this report which underlines the work that we have done in the Budgetary Control Committee and really is built upon that."
"There are several very radical recommendations, not least the one that establishes the post of the European public prosecutor."
"Time and again many Eurosceptics have used fraud within the European Union institutions as a battering ram to beat us with."
"Of course any degree of maladministration and fraud must be weeded out. But this makes clear that 80% of the problem lies within the Member States themselves."
"The recommendation to establish a European public prosecutor, as proposed, would mean that there would be a mechanism to present criminal cases relating to EU fraud throughout the Union but it would not impinge on the jurisdiction of national courts."
"That is the way it has been written."
"It is sensitive to Member States' worries."
"A series of shortcomings within the institutions have been identified in this report and recommendations are made here for correcting the problems."
"We look forward to developing the action programme for reform with the Commissioner responsible and although we have not had time to look at it in detail, I believe it would be fair to ask the Commissioner for a clear discussion and justification on why steps are not taken if some recommendations are left out."
"I am sure we will not agree with every single detail in this report but that would be a useful exercise nevertheless."
"The whole question of outside bodies doing work for the Commission is an area that needs clear attention."
"Whose responsibilities are the bureaus for technical assistance?"
"Can we tighten-up the contracts granted to these bodies?"
"How can we simplify procedures and make staff within the Commission more knowledgeable about tendering processes?"
"The proposals outlined by Commissioner Kinnock in his hearing, in particular in the field of training, need more detailed response."
"We look forward to hearing more of his ideas over the next few months."
"I hope people will take time to read the report which clearly distinguishes between fraud and irregularity."
"The report states that of all the thousands of transactions which take place within the European Union institutions there are only 30 investigations involving Commission officials in fraud."
"Of course that is 30 too many, but the main cause of concern are the many examples of irregularities."
"This is an administrative problem, not a criminal issue."
"But measures are needed to tighten up the slack administrative practices, to rewrite poor regulations, to cut down complicated payment mechanisms, dispense with excessive exceptions and derogations which lead to the far too many irregularities and errors."
"It is these irregularities that give rise to alarmist headlines when we are presented with the Court of Auditors' report on an annual basis."
"The report also correctly referred to the regulation on the protection of the financial interests of the European Community and points out that only three Member States have ratified the regulation."
"I am sure this report will give food for thought to those Member States that have not signed."
"It will be interesting to note how they respond in particular to the recommendation on the creation in each Member State of a national prosecution office for European offences."
"It is indeed appropriate that this report is published this week when we are about to decide on the fate of a new Commission."
"It is interesting in particular, in the light of recent events, that the Committee of Experts recommends that legal powers are given to allow the Commission President to sack individual Commissioners."
"This week we also received from the Commission a request on the supplementary and amending budget for money to establish the staff necessary to operate the new fraud office, OLAF."
"We would also concur with the report that specialised expertise is needed for these posts, and the need to make more effective use of information technology in intelligence gathering."
"The report itself should also be a lesson to us all within the European Union institutions."
"It has been clearly written, is really easily accessible and avoids jargon wherever possible."
"It is really a model on how to write European legislation."
"Having said that we welcome the move from ex ante to ongoing ex post control in the budget control mechanisms within the Commission."
"We would like to see that implemented."
"Again, we will have further discussions on that in the committee."
"We are at the dawn of a new era within the European Union institutions."
"We look forward to a time when officials are promoted on merit."
"We look forward to recruitment of people with appropriate expertise in specific sectors."
"We look forward to the commitments already made on whistle-blowers being implemented."
"But most of all we look forward to a time when every official and Member State Government responds to a new culture of responsibility."
"The next few months and years will be critical."
"But let us not forget that we have a base on which to build."
"The report is clear in its praise of the commitment and experience of most officials."
"From this week on a new chapter is being written."
"The plot is outlined in this report."
"It will be written by the Commission but Parliament will insist on strong editorial control."
"In partnership we can rebuild confidence in the institutions, not only for the people who work within them but most of all, for the people they serve."
". I will speak, as I can at this juncture, only on behalf of the current Commission."
"As I said earlier, my fate is in the hands of this Parliament."
"Depending on the vote on Wednesday, either I have taken up much too much of Parliament' s time already in putting forward a point of view or we are at the start of something big."
"It is for Parliament to choose, therefore, which capacity I speak in on this particular evening."
"It really must be a big question because there are an awful lot of questions on your plate."
"I hope you can answer some of them at least."
"As you have indicated, Commissioner, this matter will be under discussion for weeks, months, years and possibly even generations in the future."
"But thank you just now."
"Accidental marine pollution"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5­0003/99) by Ms McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision setting up a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution."
". Mr President, I am rather disappointed that the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Bjerregaard, is not here."
"It is rather disappointing that the Member of the Commission responsible for this issue is not here and that someone else is here who is not responsible for this portfolio."
"It makes a laughing-stock of the debates in this Parliament."
"Marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment of Western Europe."
"This region represents one of the most intensively industrialised areas of the world where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships."
"The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world."
"There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying various forms of dangerous cargoes."
"More by good fortune than by good planning there has not yet been a major accident resulting in radioactive spillage with a ship carrying radioactive materials although there was an incident some years back where a ship carrying uranium hydrofluoride from France to Riga sank but it is recorded that the containers apparently were recovered without any spillage."
"Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste."
"Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought to the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable."
"However, the legacy of the years where materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with severe consequences."
"It is a lesson which tells us that when we attempt to throw things away there really is no such thing as ""away"" ."
"This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution."
"Furthermore there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational historical and radioactive and other harmful substances, accidental and operational marine pollution."
"Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents, in terms of the chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern."
"In terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no real consequence, the environmental impact remains."
"Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumps of redundant munitions, is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States, the sites of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases, for example not far from my own coast, the Beaufort Dyke, a threat to human safety. Often fishermen' s lives are at risk, as are the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea."
"Furthermore, as the sea is the ultimate sink for much industrial material from the shores and rivers these sources must be included within the definition."
"The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution."
"Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea and discharges into the sea which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents."
"Effective mitigation requires a rapid response. The longer an incident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact, as we have seen."
"Hence it is too late to begin trying to get the required information after a serious pollution problem has occurred."
"We need to take action before."
"Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations."
"It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk."
"The public' s trust in the authorities is important to ensuring adequate responses."
"Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations are being made, what types of materials are threatening and what impacts may be expected."
"To this end, publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information, for example emergency phone contact numbers."
"Such information can be easily made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels."
"To conclude, it is a truism that once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage."
"However a rapid, efficient, adequate and effective response coordinated across national boundaries is needed to mitigate the impacts on the environment and public health in the case of a pollution incident."
"A prerequisite is the necessary information sharing with all parties."
"The database and information technology exists to establish the necessary communications between national and regional authorities, emergency response experts and the public."
"The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats - hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public."
"On the issue of radioactive substances, during the debate in the committee the Commission representative said that it was ""implicit"" but we want it to be explicit."
"It is quite clear that it should be explicit and if it is already implied then I do not see what the problem is about ensuring that it is explicit because as time goes by radioactive substances are going to pose an even greater danger and - as I have already said - we are very lucky that there has not already been a serious accident."
"Mr President, accidental marine pollution is in reality a rather odd expression."
"It is an expression which I do not think sounds alarming enough in relation to the problem we are confronted with here and which does not at all convey the seriousness of the matter."
"It includes oil spills, serious instances of which we are all aware of."
"We have all seen pictures of thousands of birds covered in oil."
"But it also includes all other possible examples of sea pollution which cause damage to health and to the environment and which often lead to extensive damage to, and real catastrophes for, the environment and animal life."
"Obviously, the responsibility lies with the Member States, but I also think I am right in saying that there are two reasons why cooperation at European level is required."
"Firstly, we are talking here about what is definitely a cross-frontier problem concerning pollution and the environment."
"And secondly, we derive a lot of benefit from being able to exchange experience and expertise with one another, so that we can make use of each other' s experience and support each other in taking measures to prevent and combat damage."
"That was recognised in the EU as long as 20 years ago with the first initiatives involving cooperation in this area, and the proposal we now have before us is in fact one which, in reality, extends and implements the cooperation established at that time."
"I should like to indicate four areas where I think it is a question of really useful innovations, especially when the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment are included."
"The first is a matter which Mrs McKenna has been much exercised by, namely the question of providing a broad definition of both ""accidental marine pollution"" and ""harmful materials"" ."
"It is not only oil spills we are talking about."
"It is just as important to make clear that we are also concerned here with leaks from dumped munitions."
"It may be a question of leaks from radioactive materials or of leaks which can cause people' s hormonal balance to be upset."
"I think it is important that we do not set limits here but that we define things broadly."
"Any measures taken ought to relate to all these materials."
"The other thing I want to refer to is the information system itself, which I think is very important."
"It is simply a key tool for efficient cooperation in this area so that we might quickly exchange information and so intervene early on."
"It also means that we are able to track down the polluters and so both assign liability and establish the relevant penalty to the extent that that is necessary."
"The third thing I want to mention is the reference in the comments to the Directive concerning harbour facilities for receiving waste from ships."
"I think it is very important that we also call upon these particular facilities in our efforts to prevent damage to the marine environment."
"It is important that ships should easily be able to dispose of their waste."
"The final matter I want to refer to is the question of involving neighbouring non-EU countries in Eastern and Central Europe and in the Mediterranean and Baltic areas."
"If cooperation is to be effective, then it is enormously important that we involve these countries. In this connection, I also think it is important that reference should be made in the proposed amendments to the fact that we ought to be giving economic support to these countries so that they have a real opportunity to participate in the process."
"After emphasising these four points, however, I would say that we are very glad to support the proposal, together with the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf on my political group I would like to offer heartfelt congratulations to Mrs McKenna on her excellent report."
"It is about monitoring pollution of the maritime environment."
"The Commission' s proposal concentrates primarily on oil spillages at sea."
"It is an important problem but there are other issues."
"The Committee on the Environment was right to have the report include dangerous chemical substances and radioactivity."
"European Commission officials say that this is already implicit in the text."
"Would the Commissioner, Mrs Bjerregaard give explicit support to this as well?"
"In any case, why is she not here?"
"Mr Kinnock was right to criticise us for the fact that we MEPs do not turn up, and what is more, neither do those who put the questions."
"But we want information from the European Commission."
"With all due respect, I do not believe that Mr Marín is responsible for this area."
"If the great work, the framework Directive on water, is to succeed, then it is very important to monitor the pollution of the maritime environment effectively."
"This report makes an enormous contribution in this respect."
"Even those in favour of nuclear power and chlorine chemistry would be able to vote for this report for it only concerns itself with information relating to radioactivity and chemical substances."
"It does not deal with closing down or developing chemical factories or nuclear power stations."
"That is why I appeal to all my colleagues to vote for this report."
"Mr President, I agree with the tenor and the thrust of the McKenna report."
"Indeed, as a Member of the European Parliament who represents the east coast of Ireland, this is an issue which is close to my heart."
"It has come to my attention that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has applied to the British Department of the Environment for authorisation to discharge high levels of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea in the near future."
"If BNFL is successful with this application, while it will result in halving the levels of technetium 99 that are dumped in the Irish Sea, this will still be 15 times higher than the levels which existed in 1992."
"If BNFL has problems in discharging radioactive products such as technetium 99, it should store such waste materials on land in Britain as opposed to dumping them in the Irish Sea."
"It is quite timely that BNFL is making applications to the British Government to deal with how much radioactive materials it can discharge into the Irish Sea."
"I say this because 15 September - Wednesday of this week when there will be a lot happening - is the deadline which has been given by the Radioactive Discharges Commission of the Ottawa Convention for the British Government to come up with proposals as to how best it is going to substantially reduce the discharge of radioactive substances into the marine environment."
"One must remember that the Ottawa Convention on Marine Pollution has at its core the principle of substantially reducing the use of radioactive substances."
"A clear plan in this regard must be implemented by the year 2000."
"We know that the British Government has done nothing to implement its obligations under the Ottawa Convention to date."
"I await with interest to see how the British Department of the Environment intends to comply with its legal obligations under this important convention."
"As the British Government addresses the final details on this issue, it should be remembered that there is no safe level of radiation."
"The Irish Sea must not be used as a soft option for the disposal of radioactive nuclear materials by BNFL."
"Ever since the opposition to the THORP nuclear plant in 1993, the level of radioactive discharges from nuclear operations in Cumbria has substantially increased."
"In conclusion, I support the proposals in the report."
"From the Irish perspective, we will have more confidence in the British regulatory authorities if they reject this application in its totality."
"It is up to the British Government to force BNFL to come up with alternative technological methods to deal with the discharge of such materials."
"I congratulate Ms McKenna on her report."
"My dear Mr Fitzsimons, as President I always add a little on to the speaking time anyway. But if I am to indicate with the hammer that your speaking time is up, then I would request in future that you adhere to it."
"We cannot stick to a schedule if someone simply steals the speaking time of others, as you indeed have just done."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment, and particularly its rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, as well as the members of the Committee on Budgets, for the work and the dedication they have put into this proposal."
"I am sure that you will all agree with me in confirming the importance of this Community framework for cooperation with which we are trying to back up and finalise the work of the Member States in the field of accidental marine contamination, in order to make it more efficient."
"This framework has proved to be very useful when, in cases of severe spillage, it has been necessary to coordinate the work of various Member States."
"The Commission can completely or partially accept 20 of the 29 amendments proposed, which obviously improve the proposal."
"Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 9 and 13 and part of Amendment No 15 would be acceptable in principle, although we would like them to undergo another rewrite."
"The 9 remaining amendments pose difficulties for the following reasons:"
"Amendment No 1 and, in part, Recommendations 5, 15 and 24 make specific reference to contamination caused by radioactive substances which are already regulated by implication in the proposal."
"Furthermore, prevailing international agreements on the protection of the Mediterranean, Baltic and North seas, to which the Community is partially bound, all follow the same approach of not making mention of any specific substance."
"Amendments Nos 10, 11, 12, 17 and 18, and the first part of Amendment No 22 have as their objective closer cooperation between countries taking part in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes."
"The inclusion of these amendments may make managing it difficult, given the differences between the decision-making processes and the proposed Community framework."
"Amendment No 22, in the Commission' s opinion, does not conform to the recent decision on the amount of time spent in committee."
"Amendment No 23, in our opinion, contravenes the Commission' s right of initiative."
"In spite of these observations, I am sure that Parliament' s contribution and support will facilitate the rapid adoption of this proposal, so that continuity between the way in which the Community currently works and the programme which is due to be implemented on 1 January 2000 will be guaranteed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m."
"Environmental inspections"
"The next item is the report (A5-0002/99) by Mrs Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States (COM(1998)0772 - C4-0073/1999 - 1998/0358(COD)(former 1998/0358(SYN))."
". Mr President, I rise as the rapporteur on the draft recommendation from the European Commission on the provision of minimum criteria for environmental inspections."
"The most important thing about my report is that I rejected the idea - and the Committee has backed me on this - that it should be a recommendation."
"I want to make sure that this instrument is in fact a directive."
"I am absolutely certain that the speech which Mr Marin is now anxiously looking through rejects what I am about to say."
"It is a very important point and underlies some of the disappointments that people feel about the European Union in many of our countries."
"It is based on the perception that we adopt legislation in the European Union which is then not implemented universally throughout the Member States of the European Union."
"I do not know about my MEP colleagues but certainly this was one of the criticisms made against the European Union during the British version of the European election campaign."
"It is a situation at the moment where there are currently more than eighty actions pending before the Court of Justice against eleven Member States for infringement of European Union environmental legislation."
"I know, as rapporteur on the recent directive on landfill, that what is happening is that the European Commission is proposing legislation on the basis that it will be adopted and properly implemented in all the Member States while at the same time the same directorate-general of the European Union knows full well that in some areas of policy no inspectorates at all exist able to see that that legislation is implemented in some Member States of the European Union."
"The European Commission' s recipe for dealing with this is for inspectors from the various Member States to meet together from time to time to try to improve their techniques and to make that into a recommendation."
"There is nothing particularly radical about it at all."
"I and the members of the Environment Committee feel that this is grossly inadequate and that if it is not a directive there will in fact be no impulsion on the Member States which are currently lagging behind to do anything at all."
"The advantage of transforming the recommendation into a directive is twofold."
"First of all it creates the momentum for changes to take place under the eventual sanction of financial penalties and secondly, by taking the proposed text of the recommendation, which we have before us as its base, avoids creating a directive which is too heavily prescriptive in detail."
"People want to see the legislation implemented."
"They do not want what they call 'red tape' ."
"This instrument, if transformed into a directive, would mean that we are able to see through the European Commission and through the Members of Parliament whether anybody is actually doing anything."
"The likelihood is that if we leave it as a recommendation somebody in five years time or so may or may not remember to report to the European Parliament that a recommendation was passed and that very little was done about it."
"A directive has legal force and we feel that is what is needed."
"I note that the Greens have proposed an amendment drawing attention to the opinion of the European Parliament that there should be some form of European Union environmental inspectorate."
"We have to tread very carefully here if we are not to tie up even more red tape around the Member States."
"It is much better, rather than going for a supranational environment inspectorate with all the difficulty about right of entry, if we have the legislation in place to make sure that the environmental inspectorates in all the Member States (a) exist and (b) are performing their tasks to more or less the same standard."
"You can only do that through a directorate."
"A recommendation is grossly inadequate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to express our full support for the report by Mrs Jackson."
"I believe that this is an important question."
"We have seen it happen, even if it is not the direct subject of this report, with the dioxin case."
"We can set up all the European directives, all the recommendations, all the laws that we want."
"If their application is not guaranteed by inspection, I believe that the grave doubts of our fellow citizens regarding European effectiveness and the value of these standards may well increase."
"We therefore need to establish control and inspection on a Community basis. Obviously, a fair balance between the responsibility of Member States and European intervention must be found."
"In this area, we support the request from Mrs Jackson not to limit ourselves to adopting recommendations, but to go on to the phase of an actual directive, which establishes precise criteria, which each of the Member States shall have to respect in its performance of inspections."
"We therefore support all the amendments, requesting the Commission to take note of the need to set strict frameworks."
"We have heard the new Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, whom we questioned on the matter of the effectiveness of laws."
"She stated the intention of the Commission to be stricter to ensure that, in the end, inspection is effective and its application strict."
"We therefore support adoption of the amendments by Parliament."
"After all, after the cases we have experienced with dioxin, we can clearly see the risk we face."
"We can progress in a reasonable and strict manner towards effective European inspection of Member States, within the framework of a European vision."
"But the second phase is the creation of European inspectors - I might call them super-inspectors - who will be able to check the proper performance of Member State inspections."
"If we do not do this, when the first crisis comes along, given the lack of inspection in a Member State and the lack of a European principle on inspection, we shall resort to an independent agency which must be created in order to manage the question of food, for example, as we have seen when debating this matter."
"I think that this is not the correct response."
"The proper response is inspection, control, regulations, managed politically by the representative authorities of the Union, and in which the European Parliament must have entire responsibility."
"We therefore would request the Commission to heed the proposals of the Jackson report both to go on to issue a directive but, at the same time, to finally initiate a new phase as regards Community inspection."
"Mr President, the European Union has many critics but few voices of protest are heard when the institution takes action to protect our air, our rivers, our seas and our land."
"Because people everywhere recognise that pollution knows no national boundaries and can only be tackled effectively by countries working together."
"To its great credit Europe has taken a lead in introducing legislation to protect the environment."
"But laws which are not enforced equally by all 15 Member States will be cynically ignored by those who seek financial gain at any cost and will generate a sense of injustice and eventually hostility in all those who play by the rules."
"None of us, of course, have any reason to feel superior."
"No country has a perfect record when it comes to enforcing environmental legislation."
"This report takes us a positive step forward and shows Parliament at its best as a defender of the public interest."
"It emphasises our commitment to protecting our environment and applying equal procedures in each Member State."
"It greatly strengthens the Commission' s well-meaning but frankly insubstantial recommendations for inspection procedures which could not guarantee that improvements will actually take place and it provides for a detailed programme of action to make sure that existing laws are properly enforced within a realistic but tight timetable."
"There are one or two sections in this report, as drafted, which I believe would benefit from some very minor amendments to tighten them up."
"I have tabled a couple and one of the delights about making a maiden speech in this House is that one has the feeling that those words might actually be studied for their merits rather than simply judged on their party political background."
"The real substance of this report and my concern is as raised by Mrs Jackson, that the Commission may not give its support to these proposals."
"I congratulate Mrs Jackson on the work she has undertaken."
"I believe strongly that this report should be given Parliament' s wholehearted support and a message should be sent to both the Commission and the Council that we are determined that these essential measures should not be diluted or weakened in any way."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jackson has compiled a good report on the problems concerning compliance with environmental legislation."
"My group gives its full support to this report."
"But at the end of the day the European Union must work towards setting up an independent environment inspectorate."
"At the present time, those countries that fail to comply with environmental legislation have to supervise themselves, which, of course, is not working."
"This report aims, by realistic political means, to kick-start this stalled process and get it moving again, an aim which merits praise."
"But more needs to be done in the long-term."
"Where cartel formation and competition law are concerned, European officials, together with national investigators, drop into companies unannounced and are able to confront the company administration."
"Our proposed environmental inspectorate has a very long way to go before it reaches this stage."
"But if we regard the economy and the environment as being of equal importance then we should also conduct unannounced environmental inspections coordinated at European level."
"Mr President, I endorse Mrs Jackson' s report, which makes some very valid points, particularly in its explanation as to why we do not want a recommendation, but a directive."
"If we had had such inspections over the last few days in Greece, especially in Athens, even in the form recommended by Mrs Jackson, we certainly would have been able to protect, albeit indirectly, by looking after the land and the urban environment, most of the dead, the injured and the thousands of homeless which our capital is witnessing today."
"That is why we support the proposal for environmental inspections."
"I just wish to add two comments, Mr President, one of which is in slight disagreement with Mrs Jackson."
"I too believe that the inspections should at some point be carried out at a Community and pan-European level."
"It is not certain, it is not inevitable, as Mrs Jackson says, that this will lead to increased ""red tape"" ."
"There are ways in which we can organise it to make the inspections of a random nature and perhaps have them at a higher level of legal redress, which would not necessarily involve any red tape."
"On the other hand, it incorporates rules and, I believe, it satisfies all the citizens of the European Union, who not only want the legislation to be enforced but who also want it to be enforced to the same degree and at the same level in all the countries."
"My second comment - and I am, of course, stirred by my anguish and great sorrow in the wake of those earthquakes in Athens - is that our environmental legislation, which we will now have to review and enforce, still does not incorporate any, or does not incorporate enough, regulations on the use of land, the urban environment, and the degradation of the environment within towns and cities."
"With these two comments, which I hope we will be able to bring to the table as soon as we have settled the general issue raised thanks to Mrs Jackson' s report, I once again wish to offer my support of the report."
"Madam President, we are dedicated, as a European Parliament, to protecting the environment."
"For this to be a success the Member States must implement the directives, regulations and recommendations in the right and proper manner."
"It is, of course, extremely important for environmental legislation to be implemented and upheld if we are to protect the environment."
"We cannot allow an industrial sector in one Member State to expel far more polluting substances than the same industrial sector in another Member State."
"This would result in the manufacturing industry moving to the country where the most lax environmental regulations are in force; the environment would then stand to lose the most and those Member States that were taking the environmental legislation seriously would be punished for doing so."
"That is why we must invest a great deal of time and energy in the coming months in bringing about improvements in the way in which this legislation is implemented and upheld, in order to provide adequate guarantees that our policy really will bring about improvement in the quality of the environment."
"I want to emphasise how important it is for EU environmental legislation to be upheld to the same standard across the board."
"The existence of the internal market justifies striving for common competition regulations."
"How can this best be achieved?"
"The Member States are empowered to implement European directives under the terms of the subsidiarity principle."
"Equally, the Member States themselves bear full responsibility for implementing European environmental legislation."
"After some hesitation, I have allowed myself to be convinced by Mrs Jackson' s arguments in support of establishing minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States in a directive, and not settling for the European Commission' s proposal for a non-binding recommendation."
"However, in future, this Directive on environmental inspections must not be further embellished."
"Mr President, there is, in fact, in the report presented by Mrs Jackson, one point which concerns not so much the content but the question of which legal basis we should choose in order to try to resolve the problems of the minimum environmental criteria in Member States."
"The Commission has in fact proposed a recommendation."
"Parliament would like it to be a directive instead. This is not really, and I must repeat this, because we have a problem with the content, since none of the amendments are fundamental to the recommendation proposed by the Commission."
"Why has the Commission considered that in this specific case, it was better to present a recommendation rather than a directive?"
"Firstly, Mr President, because the Commission, before making a legislative proposal, holds appropriate consultations with Member States."
"Of the fifteen Member States, only one is in favour of a directive."
"And once more we find ourselves caught between a rock and a hard place. When the European Commission proposes a recommendation, you in Parliament want a directive, and when the Commission proposes a directive, we should be making recommendations, because the principle of subsidiarity must be respected."
"It is therefore extremely difficult, given that out of the 15 Member States, 14 think that a recommendation would be better."
"Firstly, because it is sometimes right to respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"Secondly, because we prefer the concept of shared responsibility."
"Thirdly, because in this case, it concerns a measure within a programme which does not exclude the possibility of presenting it as a directive in the future if the recommendation proves insufficient."
"This means, firstly, that it is just a pragmatic approach, knowing that most of the Member States do not want a directive."
"Secondly, it would have recourse to the principle of subsidiarity."
"And thirdly, the Commission prefers to maintain this programme through recommendations, see the results of this phase of closer cooperation on the question of inspections, and then present a directive at some point in the future if it considers it to be appropriate."
"These are the explanations which I am able to give you on behalf of the European Commission."
". Mr President, I will very briefly come back on that."
"I take the Commissioner' s point about subsidiarity but what we are arguing for in Parliament is a minimum framework directive which does not invade subsidiarity and which solves the problem by creating an obligation on the Member States to set up an inspectorate within certain broad guidelines."
"Secondly, I would like to ask the Commissioner, given that all of us will be lobbying the Member States to change their minds, whether he can let us in on a secret in the interests of transparency."
"Which is the one Member State which we do not need to lobby?"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.52 p.m.)"
"I find it entirely objectionable that the Greens demonstrated noisily in this House yesterday about East Timor."
"It seems to me that they are insensitive to the reality of how this House feels about the issue of East Timor, and I wish and I hope that you will insist on people not doing that kind of thing in the future."
"I might remind the Greens that the German Greens are the least interested in the issue of East Timor."
"I do not want to make a political statement, but the idea of demonstrating as they did yesterday I find disgusting, to say the very least."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have had some slight technical problems regarding the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting."
"Apparently, not all Members have received a copy."
"In this situation, given that a number of Members have not been able to obtain the Minutes, I do not think that I can ask you to approve the Minutes."
"This is one of the things that we are going to improve gradually in order to prevent a recurrence of this type of incident."
"So, we will approve the Minutes for both today' s sitting and yesterday' s sitting tomorrow morning."
"However, we still have one problem."
"You will recall that we had tabled a vote for this morning on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs regarding the Technical Group of Independent Members, a mixed group."
"I will now turn to the representatives of this group."
"If Mr Dell' Alba thinks that, considering the absence of the Minutes, we should postpone this vote too, then this is what I shall do."
"That would be quite in order."
"On the other hand, if he thinks that we can proceed to the vote, then I shall give an explanation of the case so that all Members are properly informed."
"Mrs Fontaine, since it is an Appendix to the Minutes, it would be appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, to vote tomorrow morning, at the same time as the Minutes, if you wish."
"Mr Dell' Alba, that would indeed seem to be perfectly in order."
"Madam President, I would propose that it be approved at midday."
"We are perfectly capable of doing so."
"Mr Barón Crespo, there is no vote at noon, and I do not think it would be desirable to interrupt the debate with Mr Prodi in order to have the Minutes approved."
"That is all that I am saying, even if it is very important to get the Minutes approved."
"Frankly, I think tomorrow would be better."
"Madam President, may I draw your attention to the fact that not voting on the Minutes this morning will have consequences which are not limited simply to their approval but will also affect the political and budgetary work of Parliament."
"Well, firstly, will we in fact have received the Minutes by noon?"
"As I am assured that everyone will have a copy of the Minutes in their own language by that time, we could, indeed, interrupt the debate for a few moments in order to approve the Minutes."
"But let the House decide the matter, and we will then also vote at noon on the interpretation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"That would seem logical."
"So, I turn to the House. Who is in favour of this, given that I have just had confirmation that everyone will have received the Minutes by then?"
"Madam President, there are matters which the President should decide, as a guarantee with regard to the entire House, so that we do not start to query the principles of proper procedure, even the most reasonable ones."
"We had accepted the decision which you announced."
"Going back on that now and submitting the decision you had so wisely taken to the majority of the House just because of the contribution of the chairman of the Socialist Group seems to me a meagre excuse in comparison with the principle which you applied and which we all supported."
"Mr Pannella, I have not gone back on any decision."
"The only decision I took, and which I still maintain, is not to have the Members proceed immediately to a vote on Minutes which they have not received, or on the Appendix to these Minutes."
"Now, a suggestion that we vote at noon has been referred to me, and, in any case, the agenda proposed a vote at this time, if necessary."
"Personally speaking, I would rather not have the debate with Mr Prodi interrupted."
"Now I am told that there may be consequences if we do not vote today."
"I therefore turn to the House, not to change my decision in any way, but to hear its response to the proposal which has just been made to vote on the Minutes at noon."
"Perfectly clear and simple."
"(Parliament gave its assent) The proposal is therefore adopted."
"At noon, we will vote on the Minutes and then on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure."
"Statement by Mr Prodi"
"The next item is the statement by Mr Prodi, President-designate of the Commission."
"Madam President, let me begin by saying on behalf of my group that we fully share the perspective of Mr Prodi that certainly from tomorrow we stand on the threshold of a new beginning; a new beginning in particular between our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and a new beginning for Europe itself."
"On the issues which the President-designate has raised of reform, which should be brought forward by Commissioner Kinnock next February with due consultation, the policy programme of next January, the moral and political imperative of addressing the enlargement challenge and preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference, I pledge my group to a positive and constructive engagement with the Commission in this regard."
"Indeed we look forward to getting down to serious and immediate work on questions such as East Timor, south-eastern Europe and the Balkans in particular."
"But today is an opportunity for this House to review the investiture process and to place on record some of the questions or observations that arise from that."
"In due course, within the House and in the appropriate fora, my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves, as Parliament, must learn from the hearings process."
"We certainly would hope for the future that we might be able to develop procedures to allow for what might be described as more questioning in depth of nominees."
"That said, however, we believe that the exercise just completed has been a positive and valuable exercise."
"Some in this House - I believe from the outset that they have been a minority, though perhaps rather vocal in terms of the media - have talked of targeting individual nominees."
"This has not been the approach nor the view of my group."
"We believe that ab initio this kind of process, which, as I said, was a minority pursuit, to be a sign of weakness and not of strength."
"Tomorrow, when we vote on the college, the ELDR group will vote for a college and we will not seek at this point to differentiate, to pick or to choose between nominees."
"We respect in the act of voting tomorrow the essential collegiality of the European Commission and regard that as an essential value for its working method."
"But we have some questions that arise from the hearings and some observations."
"In the procedures to date, many of the nominee Commissioners were kind enough to, in effect, promise in advance a charter of reform for their own areas and have alluded to specific policy commitments."
"We have taken note of those commitments and we expect to see them reflected in the work programme in January."
"We shall check that programme against those commitments which were given in the course of the hearings."
"It is obvious from the hearings - indeed without them it is obvious - that there are major areas of overlap and therefore potential conflict in operational responsibilities within the college."
"Here again we hope that, in working through the programme for January, where these overlaps arise they will be explicitly identified and addressed in order that potential conflicts in spheres of responsibility should not slow down the reform process."
"I recall in particular questions about the overlaps between food law and food safety, the various overlaps that one can imagine with the World Trade Organisation and a host of other responsibilities, not least those of the Environment Commissioner."
"The President mentioned the importance of electronic commerce and information technology."
"These issues must clearly be addressed as to responsibility."
"Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission."
"Many in my own group have raised this question with me."
"I raise it today but hasten to add that this is in no way a reflection on the qualities or capacity of the nominee Commissioner charged to deal with both of these issues in the current sphere of responsibilities."
"There has been a certain diversity of views, Mr Prodi, among your nominee Commissioners about their personal political accountability in the future."
"They all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets."
"Some did not quite accept what I believe is also a necessary requirement, that in the matter of policy formulation and implementation they carry a general responsibility for their departments, answerable to the college but accountable to this Parliament."
"Specifically, my group, has for many months now raised the question of individual responsibility."
"Again I return to that point today."
"I have already said we support as necessary the collegiate nature of the Commission."
"However we reassert, as we have done consistently, that an effective college requires the assumption of individual political responsibility."
"The buck must stop somewhere."
"Where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible."
"We do not contest, President Prodi, your prerogative to act in this regard."
"But we insist that, whatever the current state of law, the law needs changing and that if a Commissioner fails to enjoy the confidence of this House you must act accordingly."
"We urge you to do that."
"It is your prerogative but it is our right to insist that the confidence of this House be respected and its absence be respected also."
"Indeed, here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barón Crespo."
"I should add, arising from matters raised in the hearings but not concluded, in respect of some of the individual nominee Commissioners that should any legal or criminal proceedings arise - which I do not anticipate would necessarily be the case but which would pose problems for the integrity of the Commission - we would expect the President of the Commission to act in such circumstances."
"We intend to negotiate later today and tomorrow a political resolution. That will formulate and specify a number of requests, not just on the area of individual responsibility but also specifically to do with areas of transparency and access to documents."
"When we vote on those my group will expect to hear from you a specific detailed and positive response before our final vote."
"In conclusion, we share the vision expressed here today."
"It is high time that we had this new beginning."
"It is the time for us to return to serious work."
"It is time that we recognise and rebuild as institutions - Commission and Parliament - our common European vocation."
"The ELDR group pledges itself to that task."
"Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, you have recently outlined to us a view of what the tasks of the European Union will be."
"You have spoken of an enduring development, you have spoken of peace and of stability."
"Mr Prodi, you may not belong to the great Expressionist painters, but I have faith that your gentle leadership can produce good results."
"You have also mentioned East Timor, and we all expect that Europe will bear full responsibility in this matter."
"What we have heard from the Commission in Parliament has not been a useless act and a worthless spectacle at all, they have been particularly necessary and you yourself have been completely right to demonstrate to us in the last week that elsewhere in Parliament the Executive has not got around to issuing any detailed clarifications."
"Perhaps in this there would be a model also in relation to other Parliaments and executive bodies."
"This Commission cannot ally itself with the Council unilaterally, just as its predecessor frequently did, unfortunately."
"My group will not unite with those who would like the Commission to be some kind of secretariat to the Council."
"No."
"The Commission is a political organ and, as has now become clear, it also has political responsibility to, of all things, the European Parliament."
"So that we can have confidence in your Commission at least until the year 2005, it must first be confirmed what this new spirit in the relations between the Council and the Commission will come to mean in practice. We are still waiting for clarification."
"My group emphasises the political responsibility of each Member of the Commission, and we accept your promise that you will carefully study the well-founded dissatisfaction with each Member of the Commission."
"The President of the Commission must also commit himself to using his power if there is any Member of the Commission suspected of, or being investigated concerning, misconduct or criminal behaviour."
"Mr Prodi, one thing must be stressed: there are far too few women in the composition of your Commission, and this must be stated now so that we learn something from this for future occasions."
"In future, the equal representation of men and women in the Commission or in other named bodies of the Union cannot be an optional principle of others in the group."
"Concrete measures are needed."
"When the new agreement between Parliament and the Commission is negotiated, action must be taken so that in future the candidates for the Commission will also be discussed with Parliament."
"The procedure now followed has clearly proved to be too limited."
"My group also calls for the amendments to the legislative process proposed by a large majority in Parliament to be taken in accordance with the proposals of the Commission in future."
"We also appreciate that you have promised to take a serious view of Parliament' s suggestions for legislation."
"We also call for Parliament to be included in the coming reform of Union bodies and also in the negotiation process with a completely different emphasis than has previously been the case."
"We will also be responsible for including the whole commonwealth of European nations in this process because the upcoming reform of European institutions will guarantee greater rights to the citizens of Europe."
"We have not been satisfied with the way in which Parliament has been allowed to participate in international agreements."
"We also call for Parliament to be consulted at every stage in future in negotiations such as those involving the World Trade Organisation."
"Mr Prodi, everyone is talking about glasnost, and transparency, and I believe that you are talking about it sincerely, but the hearings have not convinced me that the individual candidates or even you yourself, as the future President of the Commission would understand what glasnost or transparency really mean in practice."
"It must not remain a mere catchphrase."
"Your first task is to create the background for the transparency required by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This is not only necessary so that Parliament is kept informed, but also so that the citizens and all the nations can influence the development of the European Union with an emphasis which is completely fresh."
"Mr President, since your nomination to the Presidency of the Commission and the candidacy of the nineteen Commissioners-designate, you and the members of the new College of Commissioners have spared no pains to get a very clear message across to the European Parliament."
"And we have received it."
"You and the Commissioners have found the words to express it: change, reforms, questioning, new culture, glasnost."
"Although often suspected of arrogance, the Commission has managed to come down off its pedestal."
"Although it has a reputation for opacity, it has committed itself to promoting transparency."
"Although severely criticised by the Committee of Wise Men, it has adopted the recommendations of the Independent Experts."
"During the hearings, the Commissioners proved to be so open to the consensus of the majority of Members that even the groups which, for reasons outside European politics, had promised to maintain an antagonistic attitude were quick to bury the hatchet."
"In short, you set yourself the task of regaining the confidence of Parliament, and you managed to achieve it."
"It must, however, be noted that you have not tackled the other challenge which you just mentioned, Mr President, a far more ambitious one, it is true, with the same strong will - that of regaining the confidence of the citizens of Europe."
"And there' s the rub."
"You, like us, will note that a real phenomenon of rejection of Neo-liberalism, bearing with it a great desire for justice, solidarity and change, is on the increase in our societies."
"What new solutions do you offer in response to the increasing rejection of the galloping ever-growing threat to job security and even to life itself?"
"What new solutions do you offer in response to this thirst for resistance to the frantic rush for profits which is being expressed throughout Europe, for example, at this very moment, in my own country, in the form of the immense movement of sympathy towards the workers of the Michelin group which has just announced 7 500 layoffs in Europe despite seeing its profits climb by 20%."
"What new solutions do you offer the men and women who expect Europe to give the impetus for a real dynamic of alternatives to the globalisation of exclusion that is today at work, whether it is a matter of employees, rural workers, or cultured people opposing the regulations of world trade, or two young men from Guinea, victims of the flight from poverty, in default of an international order recognising the right of each and every human being to life, employment and dignity?"
"In connection with this, I note, Mr President, that in your inaugural speech I heard no mention of the relationship between Europe and the South, that is to say the majority of the human race."
"Generally, the responses of the Commission to all these ethical questions are far too conventional: they do not have the ambition which generates major projects."
"At the start of my speech, I highlighted the efforts you have made towards fulfilling the expectations of Parliament."
"The comments I have just made do not deny the progress made, but put them into perspective."
"Still less does my group ignore the slight shift in the centre of gravity of the Commission towards Parliament which has just taken place, as this proves, in the eyes of the world, that it is possible to shift the position of seats of power, even those reputed to be untouchable, and this is very important."
"I would add that the working areas which have been opened up are of interest to us."
"In this respect, we shall be demanding but constructive partners."
"For all that, we cannot let ourselves be satisfied with administrative reform whilst our fellow citizens are asking us questions on the very meaning of Europe today."
"At this stage, therefore, we cannot, to our great regret, affirm our confidence in this Commission."
"Madam President, at the outset we must view this week as a new beginning for all the key institutions within the European Union as to how they intend to interact and work together on various policy programmes over the next five years."
"In particular the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Commission must be hardworking and harmonious, so as to ensure that key elements of our EU legislative requirements are enacted in as an effective a manner as possible."
"The 350 million people who make up the membership of the European Union will not thank either the European Parliament or the European Commission if we are seen in the public eye as having a fractious relationship in any shape or form."
"This would only help to erode public confidence in the institutions of the Union, which would be a very regressive step for all interested parties, particularly in the light of the key challenges that lie ahead for the Union as a political and economic entity."
"The President-elect of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has certainly made it clear that he intends to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work extremely closely together on the implementation of a comprehensive work programme within the Union over the next five years."
"Included within this process must be the efficient working of the codecision procedure, which covers the enactment of EU legislation across 38 different economic and social sectors of our society."
"Since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force on 1 May, the codecision procedure, which involves a very close relationship between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, now covers a wide range of policies including those in the transport sector, regional affairs, social matters, employment initiatives, structural funding, consumer protection, public health and environmental concerns."
"The relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament must not be based on strict contractual terms."
"We must set common policy objectives together and face the key challenges which lie ahead for the European Union within a united and unified framework."
"The European Union works at its best when Parliament, the Commission and the Council are working closely together on the implementation of various EU regulations and directives."
"The body of the European Union treaties and, in particular, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty are all to be reevaluated in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"This IGC will examine what key amendments must be made to the body of EU legislation to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union."
"Preparing for enlargement is not going to be a particularly easy task and it will not be made any easier if Parliament and the Commission are not working closely together to guarantee that tough decisions must be taken on these issues or worked through in an atmosphere of understanding and equal purpose."
"Enlargement of the European Union will itself not succeed unless the internal decision-making procedures within the Union are streamlined and simplified."
"Finally, with the accession of six new Member States between the years 2004 to 2006, we all collectively have a lot of work to do to ensure that this process is a success."
"The forthcoming IGC is the biggest challenge facing the European Union as a political and economic body since the decisions were taken when negotiating the Maastricht Treaty to set in train the process of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Madam President, the hearings have provided no clear answer."
"Next time, they must be prepared better and concentrate on fewer questions, which can then be pursued until the Commissioners give clear and unambiguous answers."
"We still do not know these 15 men and 5 women."
"We have heard about which of them is interested in jazz but we also want information about the economic interests they have represented over the last twenty years so that they are protected against unnecessary pressure."
"We shall also insist upon clear answers on the subject of openness."
"Some questions, then: will the ombudsman receive all the documents he asks for?"
"Will the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control receive all the documents concerning fraud that she requests?"
"Will we be able to obtain a complete overview of all the committees and their members so that we might see who is involved in making laws and taking decisions?"
"Will Mr Prodi, here in the Chamber, solemnly promise that there will no longer be documents in the Commission which can be read at COPA, within the national delegations, in the lobbying firms and by journalists but not by ourselves, who have merely been elected by the people?"
"Dear Professor Prodi, at the meeting with my group you promised that there would always be a place in Parliament where full information could be obtained from the Commission."
"Will you repeat that promise here today in the Chamber, where it is binding?"
"I shall then, in return, promise critical and constructive opposition on behalf of my group."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we will be called upon to vote for the Commission presided over by Mr Prodi who has presented, like everyone who presents programmes, a good programme - as if there were any doubt that he and his collaborators could present a good programme!"
"But let us take a look at what he has done in the past."
"I do not mean in a professional sense, because he has amassed considerable personal wealth - he has used his abilities well - but let us look at when he was Chairman of IRI, Italy' s largest economic public body, and the thousands of billions of lira much of this from the pockets of taxpayers in the Po area - that he managed to squander by implementing a policy which led to bankruptcy."
"Just think of the steelworks in Southern Italy that are now closed."
"And I recall that as Italy' s Prime Minister, a vote of no confidence was brought against him by Parliament and also by those political groups which - and I do not know how they have the nerve, the cheek - have become turncoats and have willingly voted for him here after having voted against him in Rome."
"Madam President, I also believe that the hearings process has been rigorous and useful, as my group has stated, and we have all taken an important step towards the transparency of the Community' s institutions."
"And as the coda to these hearings, in my judgement, Mr Prodi has shown signs of political good sense and courage in the speech which he has just made."
"The offers which he has made us, which are broadly accepted by this group, form a clear commitment to European integration and are a clear declaration of intentions with regard to the representation of citizens which this Parliament demonstrates."
"Where is the problem then?"
"In my frank opinion, it lies in some people' s attempts to transfer their domestic debates to the Community institutions, in those governments which juggle European postings in order to satisfy the demands of pacts in their countries, and also in some opposition parties who wish to achieve on a higher level what they cannot achieve at home, like Mr Barón, in Spain, who has been ordered to prolong the internal domestic debate by attacking the Vice-President-designate of the European Commission in, as he well knows, an unjust and dishonest way."
"Mr Barón, please display more independence, more prudence and, above all, more responsibility."
"Ask the advice of your sympathisers, Mr Solbes and Mr Solana, because we know how these things begin but not how they end and, sometimes, the schemes backfire."
"You have some experience in this respect."
"And above all, do not try to distort the facts."
"State here that the Committee of Inquiry on flax of the Congress of Deputies has already approved its conclusions. State clearly that this Committee has cleared Mrs de Palacio of any responsibility, pointing out that the responsibility for the management, control and granting of subsidies falls to the Spanish Autonomous Communities, and famously the one governed by one of your cohorts in Castilla La Mancha."
"I will end, Madam President, by saying that I want to forget about this squalor because it is not our style."
"We still have an enormous task to perform during the next five years, in which dialogue and the existence of a consensus between us and between the institutions is essential if we are to continue to make progress."
"We offer you our co-operation."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, I am assuming that you will be receiving a vote of confidence from this Chamber tomorrow."
"I should therefore like to speak to you directly, but I must first make just one comment to Mr Galeote who is also now being so kind as to put his headphones on."
"You started out by saying that we ought not to be discussing any internal political matters here."
"You then went on to spend at least half of your speech dealing with just such internal political matters."
"If you have seen how reticently Enrique Barón has addressed the subject, then you will see how reticently we too are dealing with it, because we do not want to deal with any internal political matters."
"Mr President of the Commission, I can agree one hundred per cent with the programme you have put forward today."
"I should not like, therefore, to comment upon it in more detail but, rather, to mention a few more points in particular."
"First of all, we are engaged in a process - and here I should like to take up a concept which Michel Barnier used during the hearings - a process of developing a constitution."
"This is not something which we can do overnight, but it is something which we really must set in progress over the next few years."
"For this, there needs to be a big European debate."
"You yourself have said - and I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission - that a succession of Intergovernmental Conferences is not particularly appealing."
"I would imagine that you are making proposals from your own point of view too about how you see this process of developing a constitution."
"For the Commission must in fact have a leading role to play."
"In this connection, Mr President, I must mention that a number of the Members of your Commission have still not perhaps made the relevant approach to the European Commissioner in the course of these hearings."
"A number of them were still too caught up in the business of the governments to which they belonged or in the roles set by their individual nations."
"Here, the European consciousness must certainly be strengthened, above all because we are unfortunately also seeing increasing nationalism, which we must combat."
"Secondly, reform of the institutions."
"In yesterday' s debate here, we were in complete agreement with what Commissioner Kinnock stated."
"It was a clear and unambiguous creed of reform and could not have been clearer."
"I should like, however, to repeat exactly what he said: ""deeds speak louder than words"" ."
"That is the basis on which we shall judge you."
"I am convinced that deeds will in fact follow, but it is they that will be the yardstick for our further ratification of the Commission in the years to come."
"The third point is the question of openness and transparency."
"Yes, it is also a measure of the relationship of the Commission to this Parliament that we demand complete openness, the full truth and not half-truths or statements which mislead."
"That, for us, is the deciding factor."
"It is also quite clear - and this too we have always said unambiguously - that if it should prove that a Member of the Commission has lied to this Parliament, then our confidence in that particular Commissioner has certainly been destroyed."
"We are therefore absolutely in favour of there being in addition to - I emphasise, in addition to - the principle of collegiality, the principles of individual trust and individual responsibility."
"Only, we do not want a situation in which a multi-party policy plays any role here."
"We do not want Commissioners from small political groups from small countries being to some degree open to blackmail by majorities in this Chamber."
"So we have to take this with a pinch of salt."
"We need sensible regulations which do not undermine and interfere with the principle of collegiality."
"A last word about the hearings."
"They were positive."
"Not everyone shone all the time, but it is easier being the examiner than the examinee."
"On the whole, though, we find that this Commission is in a position to be a strong Commission but, Mr Prodi, a strong Commission because you can be certain that we shall be a strong and alert Parliament."
"The two together can nicely set about the necessary reform of the European institutions."
"We wish you good luck with your work."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate, ladies and gentlemen, this new chapter in our history requires us to be here today for this discussion on the crisis in transparency and the crisis in the functioning of the Commission."
"Mr President-designate, you have agreed to lead us out of that crisis, which is why you are here today to propose, and we are here to demand, institutional reform and the strengthening of European politics."
"Leaving aside the albeit serious crisis which initiated everything, this was the only possible outcome because, there is now a demand, for apparently opposing reasons, for greater attention to be paid both to the need for institutional reform and for more policies."
"I said for apparently opposing reasons because one of the subjects we are dealing with is the apparent bewilderment - I hope it is not lack of confidence - of the European citizens, as shown by the poor turnout in the June elections but, on the other hand, there is undoubtedly more being asked of Europe."
"The Kosovo crisis has certainly highlighted the original reasons for the creation of a united Europe."
"Europe as an instrument of strengthened European institutions, as an instrument to ensure peace even before ensuring prosperity, across the entire continent."
"This demand calls for commitments on enlargement and on strengthening the institutions which on the one hand, we must honour."
"However, on the other hand, for the Europe already in existence, for those countries of Europe which are already part of the Union, there is more being asked of Europe."
"The euro is a tool, an intermediate stage."
"It is a condition, a tool for bringing prosperity to everyone, so that we can move on to those policies which form the fundamental chapter we are about to open, the final goal, that is, more growth, more development, more employment."
"We must deal with the need for new transparency, new institutions and new politics."
"As for transparency - we have already said, Mr President - our group puts all its confidence in you, confidence which obviously depends on the results you and your Commission will achieve."
"This confidence obviously depends on each individual Commissioner' s ability to sustain high moral and professional standards. We shall keep a close watch on the Commissioners in many different ways, which includes the improved methods of transparency that you have promised us."
"However, in my view, we need to make greater progress on the institutional problem, because that is what the institutions' image hinges on as far as the European citizens are concerned."
"I think that the points of that triangle you mentioned - Commission, Parliament and Council - must evolve, are evolving and will evolve along an upwards course towards the progressive, inevitable transfer of powers from the governments - that is, from the Council - to the citizens, and therefore to Parliament."
"This is the basic process that we can either speed up or slow down."
"We are asking you - and this is why we are happy to put our confidence in a strong Commission - to do all you can, which means a lot, and maybe even more than you imagine doing at the moment."
"We are asking you to be ambitious in this area, to make sure that as you already said in a meeting with the leaders of the parliamentary groups, the relationship between Parliament and the Commission is a positive one."
"This is possible, but it depends on you."
"It also depends on us."
"We will do all we can to create the conditions necessary for success."
"However, we are doing all this as a means to implement European policies."
"We accept the commitments that enlargement brings, but even if the focus is now essentially shifting towards Central and Eastern Europe, we must not lose sight of the Mediterranean policies that Europe has a duty to adopt."
"I know that there is a great deal of work to do. I know that the difficulties may seem impossible to overcome."
"But I also know that you have the right qualities, the will and the ability to succeed. Aim high, Mr President!"
"Mr President of the Commission, circumstances have contrived to focus the debate on the acceptance of the new Commission upon the operational problems of the institution."
"You announced your intention to set your house in order, fight against corruption, demonstrate efficiency and strictness, and you announced the implementation of ambitious reforms."
"We are delighted to hear it."
"You even went beyond this debate, mentioning a number of challenges facing the Commission and the European Union: expansion, consolidation of growth, sustainable development."
"Having said that, I do not see any hierarchical ordering in this list, and I do not believe we can get away from what seems to me a crucial challenge for the future: overcoming the possible lack of coherence between the policies run by the European Union."
"Let me take one example: you declare yourself in favour of greater liberalisation, yet it will be difficult, in this context, to achieve real sustainable development."
"You will recall the commitments on biodiversity made by the European Union, whether at Kyoto or at Rio: the convention on the subject is still at the draft stage."
"Do I also have to remind you of the Copenhagen Declaration on social development with its very ambitious handling of the North-South divide and the divisions within the North between rich and poor: the European Union made a number of commitments in this regard, none of which has to date been upheld."
"I therefore believe we must look into the tools which are available to us and not be content to use the tools which have already existed for many years."
"I am thinking, for example, of our relationship with the WTO."
"It goes without saying that the regulations of the World Trade Organisation are, to a great extent, incompatible with the objective of sustainable development."
"Finally, I would like to mention a second and final point: you wish to reconcile the European citizen with the European institutions."
"Very well."
"You also speak of transparency."
"Certainly, it is an effective tool, but it must not be limited to routine mechanisms and usual administrative procedures."
"There must also be transparency on the major stakes involved, particularly those which, justifiably, are of concern to citizens, as is the case right now with food safety."
"In this connection, I observe increasingly, hence my disquiet, that important decisions on the subject are both discussed and digested in advance in the inner sanctums of diplomats, thus escaping the control of both Members of Parliament and citizens."
"I am thinking in particular of a statement made a few days ago by the United States Ambassador to the European Union, in which he declared his delight that the biotechnological working party resulting from Transatlantic economic partnership had arrived at a draft agreement on procedures for the approval of new transgenic varieties."
"You know, Mr President, that transgenic varieties are not well thought of within the European Union and that we are therefore on the verge of a probably very heated conflict between expert opinion and public opinion on the subject."
"I would like to see more clarity from the Commission regarding the role it intends to play with regard to Parliament and the citizenry."
"Are you on the side of the experts and big industry or are you on the side of the citizens and Parliament?"
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-designate of the Commission for his presentation."
"As a newly elected Member of this Parliament, I had been rather looking forward to taking part in the democratic process which was planned before we were finally to adopt a position on the Commission."
"However, I was quickly disabused of any prior illusions I may have had, because the committee I served on had in fact already prepared the written questions before we held our first meeting."
"They had been prepared by officials and by the outgoing Parliament."
"We newly elected Members did not have any chance to pose written questions to the Commission."
"This can scarcely be called particularly democratic."
"Regarding the round of oral questions, this has been a major piece of work requiring a major effort by the Members of Parliament, the proposed Commissioners and the employees in both the Commission and Parliament."
"And yet it now looks as if it was not an open democratic process that decided the matter."
"The decisions were taken in a completely different place and against a completely different background."
"What was decisive was the conversation which you, Mr Prodi, had with Mr Poettering from the Group of the European People' s Party and, after you had twisted the arms of Parliament' s largest group, Mr Poettering obviously did not think he had any choice."
"Is it a sign of European democracy in the future, not to have any choice?"
"I will not be in a position to support this form of democracy."
"Certainly not when all the warnings have been taken no account of, when Commissioners are proposed whom the first Wise Men' s report has cast considerable suspicion upon and when, following the conversation I mentioned, no critical questions are asked of Mr Lamy in the course of the committee' s oral hearing."
"It is being said that we are getting a strong Commission, stronger than the one which is now bowing out."
"And Mr Prodi talked about our having an open, modern and efficient administration."
"There are a lot of positive things to say about this."
"But the introductory round of questioning does not augur well for how the Commission is to use the power it has."
"Twisting the arms of the European Parliament' s politicians, steamrollering through ideas such as common defence, common taxation and a common policy on social benefits (which, into the bargain, it is recommended be reduced); bulldozing policies like these through, irrespective of how the populations in Europe see things."
"A Commission which has the power and working methods of a bulldozer will make sensible co-operation and the development of democracy difficult, if in fact democracy is to be taken even slightly seriously."
"The previous speakers did not think that all this was symptomatic of what future co-operation would be like."
"Now, I believe that problems should be nipped in the bud."
"Promises were given at the Conference of Presidents."
"One of these was that a Commissioner who did not have the confidence of Parliament would be asked to resign."
"This sits ill with the requirement that the Commission be endorsed in the one go: either every single member or no-one at all."
"I cannot recommend a ""yes"" vote."
"I shall recommend saying ""no"" to the proposed Commission, and this for political reasons but, first and foremost, for democratic ones."
"Mr President, the statement of the President-designate of the Commission confirms his previous statements, particularly those given to our House on 13 April or 4 May, and the French Members in my group shall therefore be induced to vote against."
"Mr Prodi in fact thinks himself the head of government of a European super-state, and sees no solution to problems other than promoting ever greater integration, ever greater unification, ever greater limitation of national authority."
"During last week' s hearings, the Commissioners-designate competed to show their zeal on the subject in order to demonstrate their Federalist ambitions to their questioners."
"Mr Barnier tried to outdo them by proposing heading towards a ""European sovereignty,"" I quote ""replacing national sovereignties."""
"Let me say, in passing, that these hearings, in this form, which incite the candidate Commissioners to undertake commitments which are not approved by their peoples, seem to me to introduce a certain distortion in fidelity to the procedures."
"Mr Prodi furthermore described his extreme vision of the bonus of competition according to which public service would be acceptable only if did not present an obstacle to the market."
"The presidential candidate champions the continued liberalisation of international trade according to the reductionist route taken by the Uruguay Round."
"This assessment was somewhat tempered subsequently by Pascal Lamy, but it was still not very clear what means he would use in order to control globalisation without demanding radical change in the rules of the game, particularly by means of the introduction of the idea of social or environmental cost into international negotiations."
"Finally, Mr Prodi was insistent that the Commission, in his words, should establish itself as the main driving force behind an accelerated campaign for a review of the Treaties in many areas."
"Clearly, this idea leads in a direct line to a future expanded Intergovernmental Conference, where the nations would be deprived of their prerogatives and would no longer have any control."
"The initiative has already been given by Mr Prodi who himself appointed a Committee of Wise Men to produce a preliminary report on behalf of the Commission even though the Council of Cologne had expressly rejected this idea of the Committee of Wise Men."
"Indeed, although we never quite know how these Wise Men are selected, we do, however, know in advance that their conclusions are going to be in favour of going ever further in the direction of a super-state."
"I would like to tell you today, Mr Prodi, that you will not fight against fraud, as you would like, or re-establish democracy in Europe by constructing a super-state which would be artificial and which, by its very nature, would entail a Commission and a European civil service which are cut off from the people."
"What is necessary, on the other hand, is to make them more open and to re-establish their links with the nations."
"Mr Prodi, you spoke of glasnost in order to describe your future policy."
"This word, which was applied to Soviet institutions, seems to me particularly well chosen to apply to the Commission today."
"I hope that, like the other glasnost, your version will create a shock wave in these anti-democratic institutions likely to lead to reforms which you cannot today anticipate."
"Mr President, the problem today is not to judge the Commission programme but the operation of the institution."
"You said, President Prodi, that we must get past the crisis of last year and that we should turn the page."
"Yet you have not, in our opinion, learnt the lessons of the crisis."
"For, in spite of the recommendations of the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts backed up by the second report which has just been published, no serious action has been undertaken to modify the methods and modes of operation of the Commission."
"Thus, the new Commission includes four Commissioners who were part of the former, recently disowned team."
"Although they were not individually implicated, they did give their support to the incompetence of the entire Santer Commission and its lack of collective responsibility."
"In addition, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities deplores the fact that the essential reform of the Commission has been entrusted to a member of the former team."
"At the time of the hearings of the future Commissioners, the EDD Group, of course, noted the quality of the majority of these Commissioners while criticising some centralist tendencies."
"We would like to see a change in culture and democratisation of the existing system, as well as greater consideration for Parliament."
"At present, for instance, it is not possible to request the resignation or non-renewal of one individual Commissioner without implicating the Commission as a whole or without causing an overt crisis."
"The cultural revolution which you announced, Mr President, is not in sight."
"Bad practice is allowed without sanction, dysfunction in the system is allowed to continue."
"The work of Parliament is, furthermore, flouted by dubious practices."
"The second report of the Committee of Independent Experts discussed in the plenary part-session on Monday has still not been delivered, or has only just been delivered, to the majority of Members of Parliament, thus preventing us making a serious study of it."
"In these circumstances, the six CPNT Members, and the whole of the EDD Group, will be voting against the appointment of the Prodi Commission in order to denounce a system which is deeply undemocratic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the crisis of confidence we have experienced this year, there has been a lot of talk about the need for a new beginning in relations between the Commission and Parliament."
"A new beginning of this kind is in fact necessary."
"Mistrust on the part of Parliament arose as soon as documents concerning cases of fraud landed on the desks of newspaper editors but not on those of the Committee."
"It was unacceptable for amendments proposed by this Chamber simply to be ignored by the Commission and for any officials who referred to mismanagement also still to be punished for this."
"All this, in fact, makes a new beginning necessary. However, I still have some reservations even after the long preparatory phase this new Commission has been through."
"I should like to quote three reasons for this."
"Firstly, political responsibility must also be accepted by each individual."
"Each Member of the Commission is responsible and answerable for his department."
"Not all candidates see it like this."
"Secondly, there are still doubts about the Commissioner-designate responsible for research."
"I expect you, Mr Prodi, to produce a further statement of your position regarding this matter."
"Thirdly, because the former Commissioners are again standing as candidates, there is still in the end the question of the terms in which they understand their political responsibility as part of a collegiate body."
"Europe' s citizens are entitled to expect transparency and proper supervision and a policy which accepts, undivided, that responsibility which has been transferred to it."
"We have our justified doubts as to whether this has in fact been guaranteed for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, responsibility for Europe and the European Union again having by the end of tomorrow a Commission which is capable of acting lies with this Parliament, with ourselves."
"In an overall judgement, we have to decide whether or not, tomorrow, we can affirm our confidence in this Commission."
"In so doing, Parliament accepts responsibility for the Commission, as well as for individual proposals, and that does not make our decision any the easier."
"I should like first of all to say to you, Professor Prodi, that as President of the Commission you can count upon the broad assent of the CDU/CSU Members of Parliament."
"The fact that we have formed different judgements about individual members of the collegiate body is no surprise."
"A number of people have used the opportunity of the hearings brilliantly, for example Chris Patten and also Mr Vitorino."
"However, you have on board a candidate who has been implicated in a matter regarding a donation in his home country and about whom we must, since yesterday, ask whether he has made an appropriate statement in the hearings before this Parliament."
"This particular candidate could become a burden on the Commission."
"I allow myself to issue this warning because the restoration of trust which you yourself, Professor Prodi, have quite rightly demanded naturally depends too upon your heading a Commission which can go to work unimpeded by reproaches of this kind."
"It is precisely this which must distinguish it from its predecessor."
"There has been talk of the political balance of the Commission. It is not a condition of any treaty that there should be balance of this kind but a sign of political wisdom and, in fact, of consideration for this Parliament."
"Our critical comment on this subject still stands, although we do not want to emphasise it again right now."
"We therefore have high expectations, Professor Prodi, in connection with our comprehensive affirmation of yourself and of your task as President of the Commission."
"You are the first Commission President to whom the Treaty grants the ability to reach agreements, and not only with the Commission as a whole but also with each individual candidate."
"We can only encourage you to make energetic use of this role."
"No government of any Member State should, in future, be able to disregard the President of the Commission."
"In this connection, we demand that the budget and the supervision of the budget be very clearly separated."
"We shall judge the Commission on the basis of whether you succeed, when legislating, in being more true to the spirit of subsidiarity than Commissions in the past have been."
"A new culture of subsidiarity must enter the Commission over which you preside."
"Mr President, tomorrow' s vote means that finally, the Commission presided over by Professor Prodi can get down to work."
"After listening to the speeches that the President-designate has made to Parliament, after voting for his appointment in May, and after taking part in the hearings with the 19 Commissioners-designate with a professional and open-minded approach, our group believes that the long crisis involving the Commission must end with a clear and strong appointment: you, Mr President, and your proposed Commission, in accordance with the powers that the Treaty confers on you."
"We have no hesitation in endorsing you so that the Union can once more have a strong executive, where there are new people, new programme perspectives and a new way of handling important internal and international policies which call for efficient, transparent and democratic institutions that respect each other' s autonomy yet co-operate effectively."
"I hope that this framework will bring about a return to the strategic partnership between Parliament and the Commission, albeit respecting their different functions."
"I say this because, as well as the political balances within the various institutions, the Council' s role is to represent the national governments, and the federal and Community leaning of the Commission and Parliament means that they are the driving force behind integration."
"This is the subject which recent events threatened to overshadow and that we must now discuss. It goes without saying that we must fight abuse of power, dishonesty and inefficiency in this area."
"The second report of the Committee of Independent Experts highlights the areas we need to deal with, many of which were already among Parliament' s suggestions and which you yourself have already given clear undertakings on."
"For example, the new criteria for the establishment of private offices and more transparency in relations with the European Parliament and public opinion."
"I would, however, like to mention that I am particularly concerned about something in the report, although I do not intend to dwell on it longer than necessary."
"Nonetheless, it is almost as dangerous as corruption. I refer to pursuing national interests to the detriment of common interests, and that goes for the Commission, and also Parliament, although in a different way."
"In fact, if Parliament becomes the forum where national political conflicts are replayed, how can we credibly rebuild an open, objective, robust and sometimes severe relationship with the Commission? How can we restore credibility to European politics?"
"We are faced with economic and social challenges in the wake of the single currency and must carry out a far-reaching reform of the institutions."
"We need to specify the rights of European citizens. Looking beyond our borders, we must tackle the strategic vacuum that has been around for at least ten years and that has been exposed by the dramatic Balkans crisis."
"We must continue with a policy on the Mediterranean which is supported by the revitalised peace process. Then there is the dramatic crisis in Russia, and matters concerning human rights and the rights of the world' s minorities."
"In conclusion, if the European citizens do not receive convincing replies at a supranational level, it will be difficult to curb their feelings of detachment and alienation from the institutions, which will seem distant, incomprehensible and also costly."
"This is why, Mr Prodi, I wish you and your Commission every success in your work."
"It is indeed welcome of course that the interinstitutional trauma of the last few months is now drawing to a close and good that normal business is about to resume."
"But, as has been said before by many speakers, we must understand the way in which the interinstitutional crisis of the last few months has altered in some fundamental way the relationship between our two institutions."
"It is fair to say that in the past there was a traditional view that the European Parliament and the European Commission should operate in an almost permanent state of collusion to take on the vested interests of Member States and so promote European integration."
"This is now an outdated view which has been bypassed by recent events."
"From now on we should perhaps both accept and welcome a permanent creative tension between our two institutions - that, after all, is the heart of a mature parliamentary democracy."
"This requires changes not only in the European Commission with which we are all familiar, but also changes in the European Parliament itself."
"Indeed, I hope that Parliament will take this opportunity to reform our own outdated procedures and practices including the financial provisions for MEPs."
"Unless we, as parliamentarians, examine ourselves with the same forensic attention with which we examine other institutions we will find it difficult to reverse the shocking voter apathy which was seen in so many parts of Europe in the elections in June."
"Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that voter indifference remains the greatest long-term threat to the European Union as a whole and perhaps to this Parliament in particular."
"Thus our overwhelming priority should be to re-engage the disenchanted voter: a reformed European Commission, a reformed European Parliament, interacting in a robust but mature manner, is the only way in which we have any real hope of doing so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we want a democratic Europe, a peaceful Europe, a Europe of different nations."
"We are a Europe in the making."
"We want to be a strong Parliament and that is why we also want a strong Commission."
"The hearings have shown that some of your Commissioners are strong and others are weaker."
"Parliament does not have as much confidence in their readiness to reform things and does not have as much faith in the way in which they will treat Parliament."
"But all in all, our wish for you is that you will be the strong Commission we need, although it is possible that not all members of our group will vote for you."
"You were right to regard the word ""responsibility"" as a key word, not just in the Wise Men' s first report, but also in terms of solving future problems - collective responsibility, but also the individual responsibility held by the members of your Commission, and to my mind, the responsibility held by your officials."
"I am thinking of the fate of Mr Van Buitenen here, and of the fact that his case should be brought to a conclusion in an honourable manner."
"Commissioner, our institutions are not equal to the challenges you have outlined as regards the enlargement of Europe for we must bring about the enlargement of Europe and make it more democratic at the same time, which is difficult."
"You spoke of reorganising subsidiarity and that is a statement that finds favour with us as it holds promise for the future."
"The parliaments of the Member States, as well as our own, must become involved."
"But we want to go further."
"We want you to consider that if the right of nations to self-determination is to be taken seriously, then that will also mean the constitutional parliaments of federal states, regions and of cultural communities being taken seriously and being given a place in the subsidiarity-based Europe of the future, for the right of nations to self-determination is a sacred principle for all the nations of the world and that does not always mean for the states alone, for those concepts do not always coincide."
"I also want to remind you that we inhabit a world that has become very small."
"I found your speech to be rather heavily eurocentric."
"For when we look down our own streets we find that the poor of Africa are there as well."
"To a large extent, the world is one of poverty and AIDS, and one in which the Europe that you outlined as being an island of prosperity and peace is, as we know from experience, one which remains a distant dream for many people."
"Indeed, we have not yet been able to realise this distant dream within our own Europe."
"I have in mind the peace processes that are dragging on in Northern Ireland and the Basque country."
"Commissioner, you can inspire confidence but at the end of the day, you have to earn it too."
"I hope that this Commission will achieve this."
"Mr President, our group' s vote, which expresses our lack of confidence in the Commission, is not down to disliking the people, the Members of the Commission, or the President, but is the result of a political assessment of their programmes."
"We have listened carefully and with an open mind to the President' s repeated statements and the Commission hearings, and this has allowed us to welcome the commitment which springs from a new relationship between the Commission and Parliament."
"Following the collapse of the previous Commission, a significant change is being proposed, which includes the undertaking to produce an Annual Report on the State of the Union."
"This is a change that we welcome."
"Nevertheless, on the subject of the programme, our dissent could not be clearer."
"Indeed, the Commission appears to be continuing along the same path as the previous Commission."
"We disapproved before, and disapprove even more today, because to continue along that path now, in the light of two important new events - first, the terrible war in the Balkans, whose effects are still being felt, and second, the creation of the euro, something which has the potential for development."
"We would then need a new political plan to deal with the economic and social issues."
"The tragedy in East Timor testifies to the falsity of the thinking behind the war in the Balkans."
"The UN Charter was torn up and international aid and the supremacy of the United States was the only reason behind the war. America' s geopolitical vision worried even its old friends like Helmut Schmidt."
"You are proposing an ambiguous response on the UN, which is dominated by the United States from a military point of view, and you are totally uncritical with regard to the process of globalisation of the world economy which greatly reduces Europe' s autonomy."
"Basically, there are no original ideas for a new social and political European model, so it might end up simply as a watered-down copy of the North American model."
"I am struck by the Commission' s lack of useful and original discussions on culture, mass communication and artistic and cultural production, with regard to which Europe is showing a distrust and a stubborn resistance to the influence of the United States."
"However, it is mainly your proposals on economic and social matters that do not convince us."
"The Stability Pact has been confirmed, and you propose a neoliberal approach to the World Trade Organisation' s important meeting."
"This is basically another monetarist orthodoxy which goes against any proposed attempts to leave it behind, such as the proposals made by the French Government or by a Minister such as Lafontaine."
"We have seen the creation of the euro and, as the President says, we are in an economic upturn, although mass unemployment undermines this orthodox policy."
"You propose maintaining this policy so that in reality, you can pursue the goal of increased productivity by means of increased flexibility in work."
"However, this will lead to an increase not a reduction in the social crisis. Mr President, I fear that this will accentuate Europe' s political crisis and widen the gap between the European citizens and these institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the long appointment process is drawing to a close."
"It marks the end of a turbulent time in the life of the Union, from an institutional point of view, a time which Parliament has used to express all its capabilities and resolutely reaffirm its democratic vocation."
"We need a strong, responsible Commission, able to propose suitable choices and ensure that the aspirations of the European citizens will be honoured, which will work alongside a Council that expresses the will of the national governments, and a Parliament which represents the people."
"The Commission will be strong if it can carry out its work in harmony with Parliament, which would like more involvement in drawing up legislative proposals and an enduring institutional relationship with the Commission."
"This continuous transparent relationship with Parliament will prevent the Commission from acting as the Council' s secretariat and from harming Parliament and its democratic function."
"Making proposals is not the same as implementing them, but means drawing up initiatives based on the guidelines discussed with Parliament."
"The statement by President-designate Prodi seems to express this intention. We invite him to pursue this avenue, thereby taking the path to reducing bureaucracy."
"The events that led the previous Commission to step down must never happen again."
"Internal reforms and reorganisation must be carried out according to the rules of transparency."
"The principle of collegiate responsibility has been reconfirmed, but it is up to the President to exert control over individual responsibilities."
"Trade talks will soon begin within the framework of the Millennium Round, and we ask the Commission to take a firm and determined stance so that within the World Trade Organisation, it can defend the supreme importance of social rights, safeguard the environment and protect the European agricultural model and the consumer with regard to world trade."
"It must also find the courage to propose again a triangular nature for aid for developing countries."
"Preserving and spreading the culture of the European peoples is a main common priority."
"If the Commission performs this task with conviction, it will have Parliament' s support."
"One of the more delicate and immediate tasks is to regain people' s confidence, as you, Mr President, said in your report, to bridge the gap made apparent by the poor turnout at the elections."
"It is not only a political problem, but also a social one, with the citizens' increasing feeling of alienation from politics, and this is something we find in all our countries."
"A structure as complex as the European Union cannot do without a stable relationship with its inhabitants, those on the receiving end of all its decisions and policies, but the unification process cannot proceed without the conscious support of citizens, without combating unemployment and creating new economic growth."
"Without deepening the Union, which is the basis for a new institutional order to give Europe a role on the world stage, we will neither be effective promoters of peace and justice nor capable of reconciling the needs, sometimes opposing needs, of North-East Europe with South-West Europe."
"So we must have new and thorough discussions on the enlargement process in our institutions."
"Good luck, Mr President, to you, the Commission and Parliament!"
"And good luck with the Europe which we must finally build!"
"Mr President, as far as we, the Dutch members of the EDD group are concerned, the European Parliament does not approve of appointing Mr Prodi' s Commission."
"We have major objections to the political vision being broadcast by this nominated Commission."
"Mr Prodi' s first policy priority is not enlargement of the European Union with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but political integration of the current Union."
"We fundamentally disagree with this."
"We want to see the old ideological gulf between Eastern and Western Europe eliminated as soon as possible."
"You also take it for granted that opting for political integration will have a centralising effect, which will work against the decentralisation of policy that we need."
"Secondly, we are very disappointed in President Prodi' s attitude as regards the Van Buitenen affair."
"At least 6,000 Dutch voters have shown their support by signing a petition for this whistle-blower' s reputation to be restored, which we initiated and which has the support of all the Dutch delegations."
"So far, Mr Prodi, you have shown no sign of making out a case for rehabilitation."
"You are even reluctant to find the time to take receipt of the signatures That is a very negative signal to send out to citizens and officials because the idea will take root that your intentions as regards the fight against fraud and nepotism are nothing more than paper tigers."
"To conclude, there are individuals amongst the candidates who have against them the appearance of having been involved in some way in fraudulent practices."
"Certainly after the goings-on of this Spring, the Council should have the sense not to nominate candidates whose incorruptibility and integrity are debatable."
"It is incomprehensible that Mr Prodi should have protected these candidates with strong and assertive words, even before Parliament heard the candidates and made its findings known."
"That is why we oppose the new Commission."
"Professor Prodi, you are a man of great talent, surrounded by men and women of equally great talent: Professor Monti, Mr Barnier, and Mr Busquin, who survived where Mrs Cresson succumbed."
"You are, together with Mr Lamy, the negotiator for the Fifteen."
"But are you going to work in transparency, or are you going to work as you did at Blair House in 1992, where we had to wait a year, until October 1993, before receiving the Blair House text?"
"In other words, are you taking the democracy of Athens or the oligarchy of Venice as your model?"
"And this is the real question of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The problem is not the vote by qualified majority or the reduction in the number of Commissioners."
"The problem is how to work with realism, with compromise, perhaps even with such a compromise as there was in Luxembourg in 1965."
"After all, the World Trade Organisation has over 137 members and operates by consensus."
"We can therefore expand to twenty members while still respecting the identity of each one."
"In other words, expansion is not an institutional problem."
"It is perhaps a fiscal problem, to know who will pay: will there be a tax on revenue?"
"It is perhaps a geographical problem: how far should we expand?"
"You mentioned Ukraine."
"In the South, should we extend as far as Turkey?"
"And then, at a certain point, we will be faced with an issue of civilisation, not between the civilisation of Maimonides, Averros or Saint Augustine, but between that of the Islamists, who carry out bombing in Moscow or massacres in East Timor, and the sophisticated civilisation which you represent."
"In other words, Mr Prodi, when one seeks to create a synthesis of East and West, the result is Byzantium, and you know how that ended."
"That is why we shall be voting against the Byzantine route, while admiring the ""emperor"" you could have been."
"Mr President, I should like to make four points."
"The Conservatives are opposed to the return of any of the former Commission and we have been denied votes on individual Commissioners."
"Secondly, the left-wing composition of the proposed Commission is wholly contrary to the views of Europe' s voters as shown in June."
"Thirdly, important questions on probity have still not been answered in respect of some of the Commissioners-designate."
"Fourthly, we are concerned that some are simply not up to the job."
"Over the past two weeks Conservative MEPs, as others, have cross-examined the nominated European Commissioners."
"Our criteria were competence, policy and background."
"Right from the outset we demanded an open vote in every parliamentary committee in order to allow MEPs to register their opinion on individual EU Commissioners."
"Time and again this request was blocked."
"Finding ourselves unable to hold individual Commissioners to account, Conservative MEPs are left with no choice but to oppose, on the grounds of democratic principle, the incoming team of European Commissioners."
"We insist on responsibility and accountability."
"Even Professor Prodi declined to face an open hearing."
"In most of our countries, perhaps all, a minister who misleads parliament or who fails to take action to deal with grave mismanagement would step down."
"In the Wise Men' s report into the last Commission, it was noted that it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility."
"It is even less reassuring to note that during their time as commissioners not once were the EU accounts effectively signed off."
"It is hardly an advertisement for responsible financial governance."
"The outgoing Commission stood on collegiate responsibility."
"Four governments reappointed their Commissioners."
"For these reasons, Conservative MEPs oppose the four returnees."
"This is not personal."
"It is not political."
"It is a point of principle."
"The only way to deliver on this is to vote against the Commission as a whole."
"We want the European Parliament to be given the power to dismiss individual Commissioners for maladministration or fraud."
"By failing to allow votes on individual Commissioners, MEPs have been denied an important democratic right."
"We want a European Union that is efficient and accountable and where Europe' s institutions are kept under close scrutiny."
"We are not anti-European Commission."
"We are against fraud and corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency."
"We want a Commission which works, which really does less better."
"Wednesday' s vote is an important opportunity to signal to the new Commission that business as usual cannot be the guiding principle in Brussels."
"Mr President, I address my remarks this morning in the main to Mrs De Palacio."
"Mr Prodi in his address to this Parliament some time ago gave a strong commitment to combating fraud and the misuse of public money."
"That is why during Mrs De Palacio' s hearing I and my colleagues insisted on questioning her very closely on the flax subsidy scandal in which her department was involved in Spain."
"The response of Mrs De Palacio was not to our satisfaction and indeed her contention that the Spanish Parliament had cleared her of any responsibility and that the issue is now closed is clearly not true."
"Whilst I appreciate that the OLAF and Spanish investigation is ongoing and that Mrs De Palacio may be totally exonerated of any involvement, the fact remains that she was a little economical with the truth when answering my questions on 30 August."
"Finally, Mrs De Palacio' s outburst at the press conference following the hearing does not bode well for someone whose remit includes relationships with the European Parliament and, whilst I accept that Mrs De Palacio did apologise later for her remarks, it nevertheless raises another doubt about her ability to carry out this specific role in the new Commission."
"Sadly, Mr President, even though Mrs De Palacio answered our questions on transport to our satisfaction, and as a group we will no doubt endorse the Commission tomorrow, we must enter a reservation on the candidature of Mrs De Palacio pending the findings of the OLAF and the Spanish authorities' investigations and because of the way she responded to questioning on this issue at her hearing."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, you have spoken, Mr Prodi, of the future of the Union as a union of sentiments, as a preservation of diversities."
"You have spoken of a new order as a co-operation between cultures."
"You have even spoken of religions."
"I believe that, so that it may be politically effective, this desire demands the recognition of the plural reality of Europe and plural reality of many States."
"The United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, Italy and many States which will join the Union in the future are plural realities."
"For their political recognition to be effective we have to promote it and we believe that the appropriate body for this purpose is the Committee on the Regions, the institution which will lead this process within the European Union."
"Tomorrow, a group of MEPs will begin work on the creation of an Intergroup to work in this area, with the intention of creating a spirit of co-operation with the Commission and the institutions of the Union so that collective rights and their recognition should become an extension of the recognition of individual rights."
"This process of recognition will be based on dialogue, negotiation and political agreement, so that the supreme values of co-existence and peace should be paramount."
"If this new culture is recognised as having value, it will be to the good of the European Union."
"There is no doubt that if over the past decade, our position on the former Yugoslavia had shown more sensitivity to the different realities of peoples, instead of becoming obsessed with the idea of the State, things would have been different and, no doubt, less disastrous."
"I appreciate your active sensitivity with regard to East Timor and also with regard to the Mediterranean area."
"You can count on my vote, Mr Prodi, as our spokesman, Mr Cox has announced, with full conviction."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, I shall be giving my approval to your Commission tomorrow. However, I shall be taking some aspirin beforehand, and I shall probably need a double dose after the end of the hearings and in view of the results of these."
"We had been told that the sun shone out of this Commission. In fact, the Commission did come through the test, but hardly shone."
"A number of Commissioners are suspected of having mislead Parliament, and there is the risk of the past catching up with a number of them. A number of Commissioners were hardly filled with ambition, ability and the desire to continue working in the Commission, and the fact that this applies to candidates who are to be concerned with relations between the Commission and Parliament and with preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference is something I find very regrettable indeed."
"Mr President of the Commission, I believe you have a bigger job in front of you than your Commission is aware."
"I am voting for you with the sober insight that work has to begin and I am voting for you in the light of your very trustworthy promise to enter into an alliance with this European Parliament."
"I am voting for you not because of the visions which, for the most part, you still owe us and for the ways leading to the fulfilment of these."
"I believe that it is either in this Chamber or nowhere at all that the vision of European integration will arise."
"However, we need the alliance you propose for the vision of a European democracy. We need it for the vision of a peaceful order in Europe, and we need it for the vision of Europe as a single social and ecological area."
"However, more is needed in order to achieve these things than you have so far set out."
"For a European democracy, a constitutional process is needed; for a peaceful order in Europe, courage is needed to accept responsibility for our own security; and for the vision of Europe as a single social and ecological area it will be necessary for politics to be emancipated from an ever more aggressive neo-liberal ideology."
"This may be a punishable offence for a parliamentarian of 20 years' standing, but I am voting for you out of hope and not yet out of conviction."
"Mr President, despite the brave efforts, all the palaver with the resignation of the Commission, the replacement and hearings of the Commissioners did not succeed in blotting out the crux of the problem."
"In fact, in our view, the most important thing is not the individual personalities and abilities of the Commissioners, nor the changes in administration."
"Our judgement and evaluation of the new Commission is based on the policies it is called upon to implement."
"We must admit that the Commissioners under scrutiny, both as individuals and as a whole, have all the skills and determination, as was evident not only in the hearings but also in Mr Prodi' s statements today, to meet both faithfully and unswervingly the objectives of the European Union at the cost of the interests of the working people and of the European people more generally."
"In our view, it is certain that the new Commission will not just continue the disastrous work of the outgoing Commission, but will reinforce it."
"Today, Mr Prodi again presented his credentials to the forum affirming not only that both he and his team are ready to serve it but also that they can, with their alluring words, deliberately mislead the citizens."
"However, the people of Europe must not succumb to this seduction."
"It is simply the old hiding under the cloak of the new."
"They can, however, rest assured that even with the new Commission, today' s bleak situation will still persist as it is precisely that Commission which is the brainchild behind NATO and European Union policy."
"We will see fresh tensions and wars like the ones witnessed in the Balkans; a continuance of the double standards policy as regards respect for human rights and independence; we will also witness increased levels of unemployment, greater privatisation, the liquidation of all small and medium-sized agricultural and industrial enterprises, the gradual petering out of social rights, and the curtailment of democratic freedoms."
"Thus, against this dangerous backdrop not only are we refusing to remain blasé, not only are we rejecting and voting against the new Commission, but we are also calling on all working people and the people of Europe, to step up their fight, to thwart those plans which are disastrous for their future and to revolt against the current situation, for the sake of another Europe, a Europe of the People, of peace and solidarity, of mutual and beneficial co-operation."
"It is with growing concern that I have heard the President-designate of the Commission' s, Mr Prodi' s, remarks about the role of the Commission."
"Mr Prodi and a number of the Commissioners-designate have put forward strongly federalist plans which the majority of people in my country are opponents of, and which, I have noted, a growing number of people in other Member States are also opposing."
"The aversion to a federalist Europe is, of course, due to the fact that EU countries are generally much better at solving their own problems in accordance with their people' s wishes than an overpaid officialdom out to lord it over the continent."
"This attitude has been reinforced by the maladministration, deceit and lack of accountability which led to the downfall of the previous Commission."
"We all know that it will, at best, be a very big task to bring the Commission' s ponderous and high-handed bureaucracy up to the standard we require of public administration in our home countries."
"It has therefore been a source of shock to see that the new Commission contains a number of members who, in one area of responsibility or another, have such a share in the mistakes of the past that they definitely ought not to be sitting on the Commission."
"It has been disgraceful to hear a number of Commissioners dismissing the need for quite elementary changes which in fact are a prior condition of stamping out the scandalous states of affairs which characterised the previous Commission and a number of earlier Commissions, and which have turned the EU' s administration into a caricature of an accountable democratic administration."
"Mr Kinnock' s hearing showed, then, that there is no will in the Commission to use its powers to instruct, and assume full responsibility for, the directors-general and their employees."
"If the Commission does not take full responsibility and exercise complete authority in connection with the whole administration, then any talk about proper administration is just empty words, and I am certain that Mr Kinnock, like most of us, is used to better things at home."
"I must say, therefore, that I regard it as my duty to my electors and to my conscience to vote against endorsing this Commission."
"Mr President, it would seem that even the majority of your own MEPs are indifferent to this charade of a democratic debate."
"What can one say in 90 seconds or even in 90 minutes, Mr Prodi, that would justify to the people of Europe your appointment and that of your Commissioners?"
"The answer is ""nothing"" because there is nothing that can justify your agenda to control the political life of the nations of Europe by stealth, aided and abetted by the Heads of Government of Member States, not least the United Kingdom."
"The United Kingdom Independence Party supports the EDD and rejects the dangerous and unworkable scheme to create a new nation called Europe."
"We campaign for a Europe that once again respects the political, economic and cultural diversities of all the individual nations and their right to democratic self government."
"That is why the UK Independence Party campaigns for the withdrawal of our country from membership of the European Union by repealing the European Communities Act so misguidedly signed by Prime Minister Heath in 1972."
"Already almost 50% of the British electorate are in favour of withdrawal."
"Our campaign has placed this question firmly on our nation' s political agenda."
"Of the three nations allowed a vote on the Maastricht Treaty seven years ago only Ireland, with a population of 3.6 million, showed any enthusiasm."
"What about the other twelve Member States?"
"So much for European democracy."
"The appointment of Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten clearly underlines the impression that appointment to the Commission is in effect a consolation prize to compensate for political rejection in one' s own country."
"Clearly this is yet another reason why a large section of the British electorate reject membership of the EU and backed our campaign for withdrawal."
"Tomorrow we shall vote against the appointment of your Commission."
"Mr President, there are, of course, many areas in which the new Commission must be assessed, but firstly, I think that it is simply the question relating to trust that must be asked, in other words, can we as Members of Parliament, as representatives of our people, reasonably assume that the new Commission is not going to go down the same road that led to the downfall of the Santer Commission?"
"Sadly enough, I believe that the answer to that question has to be no, notwithstanding the respect it is possible to feel for the competence of some Commissioners-designate as individuals."
"After all, the Belgian Government has, in appointing Mr Busquin, chosen a Commissioner-designate who was the President of that den of thieves, the Walloon Socialist Party, a party truly epitomising bribery scandals, financing by arms dealers, fraud, political appointments, squandering of the authorities' money and European subsidies."
"Mr Busquin himself enjoys massive protection, which is reported quite openly in my country' s press, but he was certainly personally responsible, and he has recognised and admitted this himself, for submitting party accounts which he knew had been falsified and which led to the party being financed by unlawful means."
"What is more, he refuses to speak Dutch, the language spoken by the majority of people in his country, and has made this a kind of trademark of his."
"Esteemed President, in my country, Flanders, people roar with laughter whenever this question of trust is raised in relation to a Commission containing such politically suspect individuals."
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, we welcomed your report on the enlargement of the European Union, institutional reform, the consolidation and economic growth of the entire Union, as well as sustainable development for the creation of jobs."
"During your speech, Mr President-designate, you stressed a subject that we are particularly concerned about: the need to fight for a European identity."
"It is something that all the European institutions - the Council, the Commission and this Parliament - must fight for together."
"It is a fight to give the Europeans a feeling of shared destiny, of a shared mission, a shared identity, a shared civilisation and a shared land."
"And we, our movement, Forza Italia, the Italian Popular Party, and the European People' s Party, with links to our Christian heritage, will give all the support we can to this fight."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate, just a few words on the WTO and agriculture."
"We do indeed need the WTO in order to organise the opening of markets and not to suffer from them."
"This is particularly true for agriculture."
"Everyone knows that our form of agriculture, our rural environment, is not comparable to that in Australia, Argentina and the USA."
"Confronted with this, Europe therefore has a duty to defend its own model of agriculture and has the right to an appropriate common agricultural policy."
"We expect specifically that multinational agreements integrate the concerns of our farmers and of our consumers."
"We expect the forthcoming negotiations to expressly take into account the fact that, in Europe, we have structures of production, and environmental and social conditions, which entail costs which must be compensated by public subsidy."
"I also wish to point out that competitiveness in agriculture is measured not only on the world market but also in terms of balance of the land, maintenance of the fabric of rural life and conservation of our natural heritage."
"That is why the concept of multifunctionality in agriculture must also be recognised in the WTO."
"That is why, Commissioner, we intend to continue the debate on all these matters with the Commissioners concerned and we intend to monitor developments in negotiations very closely."
"Mr President, honourable Commissioners-designate, I have to say that I feel sorry for you in a way."
"You will not be having any honeymoon period because we are all waiting impatiently for you to begin work on the task in hand and for us, together, to begin working for Europe."
"So I do not think you' re going to be getting any honeymoon period, as new colleagues and new bodies usually do."
"In general, I take a positive view of your programme and of what you have put forward already and today."
"There are, however, three things I should like to ask you to consider."
"I perceive that there is something of the ""emperor' s new clothes"" about the Codes of Conduct you have adopted for the new Commission."
"The question I am asking is what distinguishes them from the rules which applied to the old Commission."
"This is not robust legislation we have here. The rules do not take account of citizens or of citizens' rights."
"Where are the hard and fast rules and the citizen' s perspective upon things?"
"Secondly, Mr Prodi used the word glasnost today."
"Coming from Finland, I am familiar with a number of Russian jokes."
"There' s a Russian joke about a number of Presidents and Soviet leaders travelling by train, and the punchline includes the very words glasnost and Gorbachev."
"One sign of glasnost is that nothing happens."
"There is openness but nothing else."
"I do not think we shall be talking in the future about any spirit of glasnost in Europe because it is synonymous with nothing happening."
"Thirdly, I would draw your attention to the fact that you must look again at your staff of advisers."
"If you have the same staff of advisers in the new Commission as in the old, there is in fact a risk of precisely the same errors being committed as, for example, by the previous Commission in its relations with Parliament."
"You should have a shake-up of the advisers who are closest to your colleagues in the Commission."
"Finally, I want to say a few words to Mr Swoboda."
"I agreed entirely with him when he said that we must be careful about how we judge the individual Commissioners in future."
"We did not get it right with the previous Commission."
"In fact, it was in particular the Commissioners-designate from smaller countries who were questioned the hardest."
"This is not an honourable way of looking into just how responsible individual Commissioners-designate are."
"Mr Prodi, the ecologist group suggested that you amend the distribution of portfolios among your team because, in addition to the integrity and competence of each Commissioner, we consider that their personal commitment and their determination to defend the matters entrusted to them from the perspective of a federal Europe are a further important element in our assessment of them."
"Regarding the subject of growth which you dealt with in your introductory presentation, our commitments to the people who elected us are those of sustainable and less inegalitarian growth, going in the opposite direction to the structural tendencies which we observe today."
"In this respect, new European policies are indispensable and in the course of their hearings the Commissioners were given the opportunity to indicate their priorities in this direction."
"Regarding fiscal policy specifically, we were particularly disappointed by the lack of conviction expressed by the Commissioner questioned on the subject of developing the co-ordination of fiscal regimes and the need to move towards qualified majority rule at the forthcoming IGC."
"The great majority of our fellow citizens would like to see increased fairness in fiscal matters, Mr Prodi, that is why we again ask for a strong personal commitment from you on these questions."
"Mr President, the Members representing LO and the LCR will be voting against the Prodi Commission."
"The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, was designed to serve the interests of the main European financial and industrial groups in international competition."
"Resulting from undercover bargains between governments, its role is to contribute towards creating the most favourable conditions for the multinationals in their constant efforts to increase their profits on the back of their own employees, the most recent example being that of Michelin, and, more than this, to the detriment of the majority of the population of the European Union and the peoples of poor countries."
"Its method of appointment, its operation and its composition reflect this basic reality."
"The essential interests of the working classes are not taken into consideration."
"In order to justify catastrophic unemployment and layoffs, the European Union takes refuge behind national governments."
"As for the harmonisation measures which it is responsible for, they do not improve the situation even in countries where the legislation is most unfavourable for the working classes and underprivileged sectors of the population or those discriminated against, women and immigrants in particular, as harmonisation, when it is implemented, is to the lowest common denominator."
"The Members of the European Parliament representing Lutte Ouvrière and the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire shall consequently be voting against the Prodi Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Members of the PPE/ED have come to a generally positive assessment of the Prodi Commission."
"This positive opinion is not, however, either a rubber cheque, or a blank cheque."
"It is not a worthless rubber cheque, Mr President, as we are aware of the developments in relation to the previous Commission."
"Mr Prodi has undertaken, at the request of groups, our own in particular, some very clear commitments as regards the transparency of the actions of the Commission, consultation with Parliament, and the responsibility of Members of the Commission towards this House."
"On the major issues coming up - negotiations on the World Trade Organisation, the Intergovernmental Conference, debates on the case of the Mediterranean - the President of the Commission also indicated his wish to include all the Members of this Parliament as parties involved, as decision makers."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"But still we cannot give you a blank cheque."
"Firstly, because, even though the hearings of the Commissioners went well on the whole, they did not give rise to unanimous enthusiasm."
"In July already, without implicating the individuals, we denounced the political imbalance of this Commission which hardly corresponds to the distribution of power within this Chamber."
"In September, some of the Commissioners did not necessarily seem to us to be up to the ambitious plans which you defined yourself."
"This morning, Mr President, you stated that you wanted an integrated and efficient administration, competent Commissioners above all suspicion, a political programme for the next five years, in full collaboration with Parliament."
"How could we possibly not approve?"
"Mr President, the great challenges which await us - expansion, deepening of a European reality while respecting national identities by the new approach of subsidiarity, the safekeeping of our agricultural systems, the construction of a more humane Europe in the field of employment, a more generous Europe - are such that we must accept them together."
"But while we can not give you a rubber cheque or a blank cheque, we can announce our wish to work together in order to give all the peoples of Europe, in spite of difficulties and conflicts, good reasons to believe in their own destiny and to have faith in their shared future."
"Madam President, it is not my task to make a political evaluation of the new Commission."
"However I would like to say a few words about fishing."
"The reform of the common fisheries policy, envisaged for 2002, will be a great challenge and a great test which this new Commission will have to face since the fishing industry expects this reform to turn the fishing policy into a genuine common European policy and the Commission to endow it with the necessary additional Community status."
"In the fishing industry, employment should also be our political priority, Mr Prodi."
"The Commission which you preside over must commit itself to maintaining employment in the fishing industry, both in the Community fleet and in the processing industry."
"The fishing policy, Mr Prodi, is also an effective tool with regard to the organisation of European territory and the correction of the disparities which still exist in Europe today."
"It is the peripheral regions with a degree of development which is lower, much lower, than the Community average which suffer most from unemployment and which have the least effective infrastructures."
"These are the regions, Mr Prodi, which depend most on the fishing industry."
"Please make great efforts, Mr President, Commissioners, Mr Fischler, with regard to the common fisheries policy, since the whole of Europe, including inland Europe, will be grateful for them."
"Mr Prodi, you expressed the wish to restore the trust of citizens in the building of Europe and in the European Union."
"Our view is that a great deal of the disrepute of the European Union is related to its inability to fight effectively against the ravages of all-pervading neo-liberalism."
"The Members here present who have all conducted campaigns in which the debate focussed on the urgency of the social situation and the fight for greater employment, have been elected to ensure real progress towards a Europe of employment."
"The work programme which you presented today, as you have reported it to us and as it has been implemented for several years now, does not live up to expectations."
"The Greens are proposing a number of measures on the active, global and massive reduction of working hours, and on support for sustainable economic activities, which are creating employment, in sectors such as the construction of accommodation, public transport, renewable energy."
"We also think there is an urgent case for measurement and harmonisation of minimum social values on the European scale."
"We are obviously not unaware of the fact that there is no consensus within the European Union, and within this Parliament indeed, on this work programme and programme to combat job insecurity and unemployment."
"However, we think it a matter of urgency, and it is a matter of responsibility, to permit public debate on these matters."
"That is why we are totally aggrieved at the exclusion of the European Parliament from the employment process resulting from Cologne and we formally request, Mr Prodi, that you do all that you can to ensure that Parliament can regain its proper place in this employment process."
"Mr President, I would like to ask a question on an issue which was not raised in the Commissioners' hearings as the problem had not yet arisen."
"What does Mr Prodi think about the action and proposals of the Commission for dealing with the earthquakes and their consequences for Greece?"
"This is a major issue as we are talking about 130 dead with the numbers continually increasing and 100,000 made homeless within Athens alone not to mention the tremendous burden on the Greek economy, the huge social problem, and those small businesses and industries which have collapsed."
"As far as I know, Mr Prodi received a letter from the Greek Prime Minister."
"I understand that perhaps he is unable to announce specific measures today, but I would appreciate his initial thoughts on the matter."
"I know that he is attuned to the issue and he will recall the measures taken by the European Union following the earthquakes in Italy, in Assisi. I therefore look forward to a positive reply."
"Mr President, honoured colleagues, if we are talking today about the future Commission, then we are also talking about our political priorities."
"And what do these include, Mr Prodi?"
"They incorporate areas of life which are among the most significant for human beings and which are of importance every day for us and our children."
"Examples include clean air and drinkable water, safe food which does not poison people, the safeguarding of their personal economic interests and the development of a basic standard of health within the European Union."
"In the course of the hearings before the relevant committees, Margot Wallström and David Byrne have shown brilliantly and convincingly, as well as to the satisfaction of the committees, that these priorities have been recognised and that full commitment will be given to this policy and to its fulfilment."
"How, though, do such policy areas become political realities and priorities?"
"That can only happen with the support of the whole Commission around the Commission table and with the support of the President of the Commission, that is to say of yourself, Mr Prodi."
"So, can we be hopeful?"
"I have been asking myself that question for a number of days now and, Mr Prodi, I have been asking it whenever I hear a speech by you."
"That is four or five in all now."
"I will also tell you the answer. I am not hopeful."
"My impression is that, in the past, you have merely been paying lip service."
"And because it was too much trouble, you do not do it at all now."
"In your speech today, you did not say a word, not a single word, about environmental policy."
"You mentioned sustainable development once."
"This is a compulsory exercise which everyone engages in."
"You did not say a word, not a single word, about consumer protection and safe food."
"And that is after BSE and dioxin!"
"You used the word ""health"" in connection with the economy and sport."
"You betray your ignorance here, Mr Prodi, not that of your Commission, merely your own."
"Mrs Wallström and Mr Byrne have quite clearly come through their examinations before the European Parliament with flying colours."
"But they will probably often feel themselves to be alone around the Commission table, for you, Mr Prodi, have no idea about the interests of people inside the European Union despite the fact that you are always spouting about the ""European soul"" ."
"You say you have learned lessons."
"So what lessons have you learned, Mr Prodi, other than that enterprise is important?"
"You have shown in the past that you do not seriously mean what you say, and so you no longer say anything at all."
"I am telling you quite clearly, Mr Prodi, you have not passed the examination as far as I am concerned. So far, you have clearly failed it."
"So if I vote ""yes"" tomorrow, it is because of your esteemed colleagues, Mr Prodi, and not because of you."
"If, when voting, I was able to differentiate between yourself and your colleagues, you would get a clear ""no"" and all the others a clear ""yes"" ."
"In football, a good team with a bad coach would never reach the top of the league."
"I only hope that the future Commission will overturn this rule."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am suspending the debate to allow the vote that was decided on this morning to take place."
"The debate will resume after the vote."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"You have all had time to look at them."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, in the text of the Minutes that have been distributed, only the second part of the decision made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is included."
"Yesterday, you read both the first and second part in the House."
"The second part refers to the interpretation to be inserted as a note in the Rules of Procedure, but the first part says: ""the declaration of the creation of the Technical Group of Independent Members is not compatible with Rule 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure"" and you have entrusted us with this matter and also given us the opportunity to make our own interpretation as a note in the Rules of Procedure, which will be relevant in the future too."
"I therefore think that the Minutes should also include the first part of the statement you made to the House yesterday."
"That will certainly be done."
"The Minutes will be corrected and completed so that this is the case."
"I would like to make a comment on the Minutes and on our colleague' s intervention on what you have just said, if you do not mind, Madam President."
"In the same way that this morning, you delayed the vote until later, and quite rightly so, because we did not have the Minutes on which the House was due to decide, it is quite obvious here that we would only be able to decide on the rule which features in the Minutes, which is a rule of general order, and not on the particular conclusions which follow on from it."
"This is my first point, Madam President, which I believe cannot be argued with."
"The House' s decision will hold for the general rule which represents an interpretation of Rule 29 of our Rules of Procedure."
"I would also like to say very briefly, if you do not mind, why, in our opinion, this interpretation must not be upheld."
"Rule 29(4) of our Rules of Procedure, states that a group declaration must show the designation of the group, the names of its members, and the composition of its bureau."
"These are the only three requirements stipulated in our Rules of Procedure."
"If, ladies and gentlemen, you choose to interpret the rule in a way which goes beyond the letter of Parliament' s law, even though it is extremely clear, perhaps out of scorn for the rights of minorities or as a way of expressing the large Parties' hegemonic desires, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that you would be creating an extremely important and damaging precedent which might rebound on any of the Groups or sub-groups of this House one day."
"You would, in effect, be allowing the majority of the House, the way it currently stands, to make decisions on political allegiances which might exist between any MEPs who may nevertheless have signed the constitution of a Group, and we know very well that there are, even within Groups with a majority, factions which are certainly in agreement with one other on a common political programme."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the reasons why we are appealing to the House' s wisdom, its moderation and, above all, to its respect for the rights of minorities which, until now, it must be said, it has not observed with any great distinction."
"Madam President, I would just like to say that the Minutes are perfectly well written as they are, and so it is right that they should be the sole basis for a decision on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure which will be annexed to the Rules of Procedure themselves."
"The rest of the ruling decided on by the Constitutional Committee has no place in this text."
"I therefore propose that we keep the Minutes in the form in which they were written, and in which they have been submitted to us for approval."
"Mr Dell' Alba, one thing is clear: I know what I said yesterday, and not only do I know it, but I have here, in front of me, the text which I read out yesterday, and which nobody can dispute."
"We have a procedure which makes provision for the adoption of the Minutes and which makes provision so that Members who think that the Minutes are not in line with what has been said can choose not to adopt them."
"I too, have the feeling that my ideas have indeed not been accurately reported, given the differences between the way that I expressed them and the way I see them reported here today."
"The only thing I can do is, of course, to retain the correction Mr Napolitano is demanding, as I am more qualified than anyone to tell if my words have been correctly reported."
"Therefore, I cannot refuse to include this correction."
"Are there any other comments on the Minutes?"
"Our task is to vote in favour of the Minutes or against them, certainly not for or against the consequences of this vote and of a statement by this House."
"That is all."
"Absolutely, Mr Pannella."
"Furthermore, we must not get things confused."
"For the moment, I would ask everyone to present the corrections which they consider necessary to the Minutes, on other points as well as this one."
"In accordance with the way we have always done things, I will then declare the Minutes adopted with the corrections I have been informed of."
"Only afterwards will we proceed to the vote on your opposition to the interpretation."
"Are there any other comments?"
"Madam President, I would like to make a comment regarding page 7 of the Minutes."
"Yesterday you were kind enough to give me the floor and I spoke of the anniversary of the beginning of the peace process in my country, the Basque country."
"In your kind response, you said:"
"""Mr Knörr Borràs, I have noted your intervention whose rightful place is in the context of the debate we have organised on this matter."""
"(ES) We have not organised a debate on this matter."
"It was probably an error in translation but anyway, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say what I had to say concerning the peace process in the Basque Country."
"Madam President, on page 6 of the Minutes it says that Mr Posselt clarified his remarks at the beginning of the sitting."
"I want to say something about this. Firstly, I made no remarks at all at the beginning of the sitting and, secondly, this clarification of mine yesterday would appear to have been to no avail, since there is again no mention in the Minutes of what I actually said, and the next point in fact contradicts what I said."
"I should therefore like to repeat my comments. I indicated last plenary week that, according to our Rules of Procedure, the plenum decides about the Bureaux of the delegations but that, again, according to our Rules of Procedure, the joint parliamentary committees, just like the parliamentary committees (that is to say, the normal specialised committees of Parliament) have to hold elections to their Bureaux, just as we have done in the internal committee in all committees."
"This also has to happen with the joint parliamentary committees in third countries."
"I have touched upon this matter on a number of occasions here, and there has never been any reaction, although it is clearly stated in the Rules of Procedure."
"I again referred to this matter yesterday when the Minutes of the Friday sitting of the last part-session were adopted. Now, the Minutes state that I clarified my remarks (but do not go on to state what I actually said) and then list at the back who' s who in the Bureaux of these joint parliamentary committees."
"This is incorrect, though. What instead we are concerned with here are proposals which still have to be voted on in the joint parliamentary committees once these have been constituted."
"Mr Posselt, we will make sure that what you said yesterday has been correctly included in the Minutes, because that is really the only issue here, and not whether there should be a new debate on the matter."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Statement by Mr Prodi (continued)"
"I have received, pursuant to Rule 180(4) of the Rules of Procedure, an opposition from the Technical Group of Independent Members, to the interpretation proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to Rule 29(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, I am submitting the interpretation to Parliament."
"I would like to remind you, as I stated yesterday, that our Rules of Procedure require a simple majority with at least a third of the Members present."
"I would say that there are about 209 of us present, maybe more, but in any case, we will find out easily enough as there is a request for a nominal vote."
"(The interpretation was adopted)"
"Madam President, Mr President, from Kosovo to East Timor, the world needs Europe, the Europe of the institutions of the Union. And the European Union needs a good relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament in order to win the full confidence of its citizens."
"Mr Prodi has proved to be fully aware of these considerations."
"An institutional crisis would weaken the Commission but also this new Parliament at a time which is crucial for European federalism."
"In our political opinion, the Commission' s programme is very important in that it intends to build on past triumphs and strengthen the commitment to peace, security, stability, employment and the well-being of all Europeans, but also people from other nearby countries, to the East and South."
"But regarding the appointment of the Commission, the method of government is important too, in terms of its collegiate nature but also in terms of the behaviour of individual Commissioners."
"We think that Mr Prodi will perform the duties of President with authority regarding this matter."
"Taken together, the issues we have discussed allow us to express a vote of confidence in what Mr Prodi called 'a new start' : a term commonly used to refer to the Commission, but also in my opinion, that applies to this new Parliament too."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi this morning you used a Russian word, glasnost, which means openness."
"I hope you know the other word which Mr Gorbachov made famous - perestroika, meaning restructuring, reforming - because we expect that from you too."
"You have to regain the confidence of the public of Europe."
"Everyone has said that this morning."
"You will only do that if you show these qualities: clarity, leadership, honesty and humility."
"Clarity: your political vision, as expounded this morning, does not completely satisfy our vision, and you have to expand and think very much about social Europe, the environment and other aspects."
"We want from you concrete objectives."
"That is what people understand, and we want, as part of this clarity, evidence that you can listen."
"That evidence is not forthcoming at the moment."
"We want evidence that you can listen and understand what your role is, what our role is and what the roles of of the Council of Ministers, of lobbyists and of members of the directorates-general are."
"Leadership: you have to show willpower, integrity and you have to show that you have very good eyes and ears and that you are a competent person."
"Honesty: telling the truth even when it is not comfortable to do so."
"Your Commissioners are being tested on the same grounds."
"Our committee, the Industry Committee, questioned three Commissioners and sent delegations to three others."
"We questioned Commissioners Liikanen, Lamy and Busquin and we went to the hearings of de Palacio, Patten and Wallström."
"We had the widest grasp of any committee."
"When we questioned Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy, we did so objectively, asking questions about their role."
"That was not the case with half of the Members there for Commissioner Busquin."
"Commissioner Busquin' s hearing revealed far more about that side of the House than it did about Commissioner Busquin."
"That is because he was subjected, unlike any other Commissioner-designate, to a sadistic, preplanned and concerted attack."
"There was no reaction to his repeated, very clear answers to the same question, and issues involving internal Belgian politics which had no bearing on Mr Busquin' s future role, given that this is a multilingual House, were repeated ad nauseam."
"No other Commissioner was subjected to this ordeal and it is bitterly resented by those of us who wanted to do this thing properly and to objectively listen to what Commissioners would say about their future work."
"That side of the House should be thoroughly ashamed of their conduct in the Busquin hearing."
"Unlike those opposite we listened to the answers to questions about the future roles."
"The six Commissioners with whom we had dealings satisfied us as to their future competence in the roles which they will undertake."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order."
"One of the things that is being agreed with Mr Prodi' s Commission is that the Commissioners will attend if the subject under discussion concerns them."
"I now see that a large number of Commissioners, indeed a sizeable number of them, have obviously already gone for lunch, despite the fact that they are still the object of discussion."
"I consider that the whole Commission should attend until the end of this debate."
"Mr President-designate, you know that you have the confidence of many in this House, as a result of your conduct, and also I believe, as a result of your human and personal qualities."
"These factors ensure that you will gain the confidence of this House, and because of you, many of us will be voting for your whole team."
"You will be responsible for the common interests of Europe."
"This is the mission that the Commission has."
"I think that the common interests of Europe today will require you to face up to two main challenges over the next five years."
"The first challenge is the European people' s complete lack of understanding of the European Institutions."
"What we have here are institutions for beginners, which people do not understand, which they are not informed about, and as these institutions are a mystery to them, they are suspicious about them, sometimes excessively so."
"It is your duty, as defender of the common interests of Europe, and it is our duty as the people' s representatives, to give this action clarity, and this is why we are defending, as you know, the idea of a constitution, of working towards a European constitution."
"The second challenge, which is even more important, is to find out if there is a social action programme for Europe."
"Europe was made for just such a programme, and in these times of globalisation, when our citizens have the impression, the feeling that all the real decisions are made somewhere else, and particularly in the world of finance, it is important to revive the idea of a plan for Europe which is understood by the citizens and defended by the institutions."
"The task of formulating a plan for Europe falls to you as President of the Commission, just as it falls to us as representatives of the people."
"As you well know, and I shall end now, it is through dialogue, between the European Parliament and the European Commission then, that we will find the key to Europe' s future."
"Mr President, on a point of order. I should like to refer to the point of order that was made from the other side of the House about the attendance of Commissioners."
"If we demand the attendance of Commissioners, surely it is right and proper that we demand the attendance of all parliamentarians in this House?"
"I would point out to the other side of the House that you cannot be selective in the application of principle."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, in your speech on 21 July 1999 you said that your bywords were transparency, a sense of responsibility and efficiency."
"It is precisely in the area of budget policy that these three basic principles need to be given concrete expression."
"If we want to win back the confidence of our citizens, we need transparency regarding the implementation of the EU budget in all its details, a sense of responsibility in handling tax revenue and efficiency in transposing Community budget policies."
"Clearly, this is a task for the Commission as a whole, all Commissioners and all departments."
"In the person of Mrs Schreyer you have introduced us to an experienced politician who still has to find her way around one or two corridors here and go through one or two new experiences at a European level but who is also, however, someone who has become quickly and comprehensively acquainted with the very complicated material of budget policy and who is very aware of the forthcoming challenges of budget policy."
"She has set out budgetary discipline as being, for her, one of the cardinal virtues."
"This is praiseworthy stuff."
"However, we shall also take care to ensure that it is not just a question here of describing new tasks and slipping these into our budget. Instead, we shall need, together with yourself, to go before the Council and say that new tasks require new money."
"I was gratified to hear Mrs Schreyer say, very undiplomatically, that the distinction between non-compulsory and compulsory funds has to be removed."
"This would mean equal rights for all parts of the Parliament."
"A courageous statement like that is worth repeating."
"She also said that control over revenue needs to be shifted in this direction, something we must set about discussing very soon."
"I think Mrs Schreyer is among those proposed candidates who will do full justice to their tasks in this Parliament."
"We shall have no cause - over here at least - to doubt your team."
"Mr President, we listened attentively to the statements concerning the programme of the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, in which he highlighted the policies which the European Union is to follow."
"Mr President Prodi, your references to the extreme importance of enlargement as well as your dedication to full integration and to the political union of Europe are principles with which we sympathise."
"We believe that Europe may indeed have a future only as a political, social and cultural entity."
"Its goal should be to become a place where freedom and social justice prevails for all European citizens."
"However, such a place needs the full participation of all the citizens."
"The last European elections were characterised by the very low turnout."
"You know that in the minds of the European citizens the structure of Europe is not so much an issue as is peaceful existence between the people."
"The recent crisis and the resignation of the European Commission due to certain individuals who did not fulfil their duties contributed to the disillusionment of the European people."
"Mr President Prodi, you are assuming your responsibilities at a time of great uncertainty but this Europe, despite its concerns and misgivings, will not go away and you and your Commissioners have serious responsibilities."
"When you were designated President, we thought, based on your statements, that the final decision for appointing each of the Commissioners would have your seal of approval."
"However, it did not quite happen in this way."
"Of course, we are not asking you to breach any treaties. We are, however, asking you to bring about a new start, to defy and take a stand against the badly construed texts of the past and to take account of Parliament' s recommendations."
"We, the New Democracy Party of Greece, will vote in favour of your Commission, regardless of any reservations, because we are hopeful that you will respect your commitments of the previous week on the one hand and because we agree with the political content of today' s statements on the other."
"This is not a blank cheque but a move of confidence in you, in a Europe which must forge ahead."
"We hope that you will make transparency within the functioning of the European Commission a priority and set your initial goal as policies covering citizen protection, employment, cultural development as well as solidarity amongst those who suffer from an absence of democracy and from poverty."
"Mr President, we Socialist members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believe that Mrs Diamantopoulou has shown herself to have the skills and attributes that she will need to become a good Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs."
"We will give her every encouragement and the support she will need to pursue progress for social Europe through the college of the Commission."
"We hope she will be heard fairly there."
"She knows some of the tests we will apply to her."
"I should like to mention three."
"Firstly, a commitment to sit down at the earliest opportunity with members of the committee to devise a new social action programme to cover the term of office of the new Commission, which will recognise the realities of the new world brought by the euro and the new possibilities arising from Amsterdam to promote employment and opportunity and to combat insecurity and exclusion."
"Secondly, to seek with Parliament a new understanding on the operation of the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter."
"Neither the procedure itself nor the legitimate expectations of this democratically-elected institution have been met in the way the procedure has been used so far."
"That is an urgent priority."
"Thirdly, to join with Parliament in calling upon the Council to remedy the exclusion of Parliament from the macroeconomic dialogue agreed at Cologne."
"The last thing we need now is to add to the democratic deficit."
"Should all go well tomorrow, we look forward to working with her on these and other matters."
"Mr President, even if the Commission gets a majority in this Chamber tomorrow, that does not mean that our group does not have any doubts about certain individual Commissioners."
"Indeed it is because of these doubts that two critical passages have been included in the resolutions."
"It is clearly stated under 3 and 5(a), (b) of our resolution that if Parliament loses confidence in a Commissioner then we will only need a simple majority to ask the President, Mr Prodi, to dismiss the Commissioner concerned."
"Point 5(b) adds that if a judicial accusation is made on account of corruption then that too is a reason for the Commissioner concerned to depart."
"In addition, point 5(f) of the resolution reiterates that Parliament can request for there to be an exchange of portfolios if there is good reason for this."
"I would like to ask Mr Prodi again to respond to this."
"My second comment relates to the agreements that have already been made under paragraphs 1 and 4 of the resolution and under paragraph 5 up to and including (h)."
"It must be evident from the additional questions that other than the points I have just mentioned, the undertakings that have been made have been inadequate."
"But I also want to refer to the obligation to provide information, to the need to pass documents through to Parliament whenever requested to do so."
"I have already presented a draft regulation in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as regards this obligation to provide information."
"We believe this matter should be speedily resolved."
"Either you draw up a draft regulation or the Committee will do it itself, in which case there is already a text."
"To conclude, I have a message for Mr Bolkestein, who is not in fact present."
"For years, he has presented himself as a euro-critic and euro-sceptic, and during the hearing he made a 180º turn."
"As Christian Democrats, we must, of course, support anyone who repents."
"But we are assuming that it wasn' t a turn just for the purposes of the hearing, but one which will also be given expression in his work."
"We will follow this with a very critical eye"
"The question as to whether we will vote for or against tomorrow, or whether we will abstain, depends on the answers provided by Mr Prodi to the paragraphs in the second half of our resolution."
"Mr President, the right to approve the Commission goes, by implication, hand in hand with Parliament' s duty to determine the aptitude of future Commissioners for exercising their mandate."
"The hearings have been extremely useful. They generally took place in a constructive atmosphere."
"I would like, nevertheless, to warn Members against any attempt to ape certain practises of the American Congress, particularly its intrusions into the private lives of politicians, both male and female."
"It is reasonable to require anyone on the political stage to declare his or her interests, but transparency must stop when it reaches the private domain."
"The European Parliament is not the holy inquisition, although this idea might not please some of our apprentice Torquemadas whether they are Bavarian or Flemish who did their best to denigrate Philippe Busquin."
"Flanders is one of the cradles of European civilisation. The Flemish people deserve better than the Vlaams Blok."
"Having known Philippe Busquin for years, I have full confidence in his personal integrity."
"I am also taking up arms against those who seem to want to bring about a political emasculation of the future Commissioners."
"I do not share Mr Bolkestein' s political ideals, but he is entirely within his rights to remain active within the Liberal International."
"Future Commissioners will have to abstain from standing in political elections during their term of office."
"I hope, though, that they will remain faithful to their political convictions."
"No one criticised the excessive number of Commissioners with Socialist allegiances."
"This fact is perhaps less a reflection of the current political composition of Parliament than of the image of the power held by Socialists across the fifteen Member States."
"Whatever the reason, the Commission must rise above traditional political divisions."
"It must, at all costs, remain a College."
"Even if many MEPs are sorely tempted to judge the Commissioners individually, the Treaty requires - and quite rightly so - a vote for the whole body."
"The Treaty also gives the Commission the only right of initiative relating to the administration of Europe."
"An attempt to change this would mean turning the Commission into a merely executive body."
"It is in Parliament' s interest to defend the Commission' s powers and particularly its right of initiative, without which the power of national governments and bureaucracies would become overwhelming."
"Parliament has nothing to gain from neutralising the Commission' s powers."
"The hearings showed that the Prodi Commission wants to co-operate with Parliament, to take note of our suggestions and of our legislative work."
"When they appeared before the Economic and Monetary Committee, Commissioners Monti and Solbes laid down bases, solid bases for future collaboration."
"Be that as it may, the Commission and its Commissioners should be judged on their political action."
"What President Prodi gave us this morning was a preliminary sketch."
"I hope that we will be able to see, by the beginning of the year 2000, a much larger portrait of Europe."
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, you began your intervention by talking about East Timor."
"I thank you for your interest in this matter, and I call on the Commission to understand clearly that the issue of Timor will, unfortunately, remain open for some time, and to demand that urgent action be taken, both in terms of humanitarian aid and in political and security terms, because the announcement of intervention by an international force does not per se guarantee security conditions in the region, as it must intervene without any kind of condition imposed by the Indonesian authorities, and the urgency of providing humanitarian aid is URGENT in the true sense of the word."
"I can confirm this as I witnessed the elections in Timor personally, on behalf of this Parliament."
"The situation is extremely serious and requires immediate intervention and relentless, immediate pressure from all European institutions because nothing has yet been guaranteed."
"The start of a new Commission' s work is a moment of hope for Europe."
"We know that the circumstances in which the proposal for the composition of the Commission arrived in this Parliament were far from ideal."
"We know and reaffirm the legitimate doubts as to the factors which led governments to the individual nomination of Members, and we see with some concern that the composition of the Commission takes into account neither the results of the recent European elections nor the old tradition of political pluralism."
"But these objections do not mean that we do not wish the Commission well in its task."
"The forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for Europe."
"We hope that the Commission will be able to face up to what will probably be its main task, which is to reconcile social and economic cohesion with enlargement."
"If it does not achieve these two objectives in a coherent and integrated way, it will find it very difficult to make the borders showing Europe' s politics and well-being match Europe' s geographical borders."
"Conscious of the fact that this is the Commission' s main task, we would like to assure Professor Prodi and the Members of the Commission that we wish them well in their work and to state that he can count on the votes of the Portuguese MEPs of the European People' s Party."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, in your speech this morning you said that the Commission was to become much more open."
"You spoke in this connection of the need, here and now, for glasnost."
"In doing so, you went to the heart of the problem."
"Last year' s conflict between the Commission and Parliament was largely due to the Commission' s culture of secrecy and to the arrogance with which the Commission handled Parliament' s justified concerns."
"I hope all this belongs to the past and look forward with yourself, Mr President of the Commission, to a new beginning."
"I turn now to the Committee' s hearings specifically in connection with foreign affairs, human rights, and the common security and defence policy."
"A general remark, first of all. If we were to set the qualifying standard for Commissioners at the level displayed by my colleague Ingo Friedrich at the hearings and also in today' s debate, we would not have any difficulties with anyone."
"However, Commissioners-designate Günther Verheugen and Chris Patten have no need of formal qualifying standards."
"They have both engaged in an excellent debate in committee and provided real proof not only of their specialist qualifications but also - and this is almost more important - of the new political culture to which you yourself have referred, Commissioner, and of the dialogue between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Of course, we have identified differences when it comes to political opinions."
"It would not be understandable if it were otherwise, but it is precisely that which makes collaboration interesting and preserves us from boredom."
"All the co-ordinators were subsequently correct in agreeing that our committee had gained two valuable and esteemed partners in dialogue."
"Mr President of the Commission, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has also arrived at the same consensus regarding Commissioner-designate Nielson."
"I say this because our committee too was involved in this matter."
"I should like to assure you and also the other Commissioners that we shall offer critical co-operation and engagement in dialogue. I have no difficulty in repeating what my group chairman said a short while ago, namely that we shall be expressing our confidence in you."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, no-one should take the decision regarding the new Commission lightly."
"What the citizens of Europe are expecting is for work finally to begin again after the long months of crisis and paralysis, but under better conditions which increase people' s confidence in the Commission."
"The great weakness in the construction of the European Union is still there, whether or not, at the end of the day, we can only approve the Commission as a whole (and this despite the fact that we have grave reservations, at least about one Commissioner-designate)."
"I am aware of the fact that, as President-designate of the Commission, you have already accepted significant political demands on our part in order to make it possible for the principle of individual responsibility to be transposed."
"I especially emphasise this because this demand for individual responsibility is anchored in a proposal of mine which was included in the European Parliament' s resolution of 23 March 1999."
"What I wish for on behalf of my delegation but also as one of my country' s MEPs is proper supervisory control over the Commission and confidence on the part of the citizens in both the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Confidence of this kind cannot be taken for granted but has to be justified over and over again."
"We cannot just issue a blank cheque, nor would we want to."
"We need strong, functioning institutions. Otherwise, the European idea will not translate credibly into practice."
"I subscribe totally to your programme, which is dedicated to glasnost, which is not about just tinkering with the institutions but about far-reaching reform, which strives for sustainable job creation through consistent liberalisation of the economy, which attaches a high value to the principle of subsidiarity and which considers it necessary to find adequate responses to demographic developments in Europe."
"The European Union must remain attractive as a model."
"The zone of peace and prosperity must, with credibility and a sense of vision, be extended to include the candidate countries for accession to an enlarged EU."
"The European idea which forms the basis of the EU needs a new impulse."
"The personalities who translate this idea into practice must be in a position to do this."
"Individual responsibility and co-operation with Parliament in all phases of the process are indispensable prior conditions of this."
"Mr President, we welcome the opportunity to work with the President-designate of the Commission and with the Commission."
"This is an opportunity to explore their commitment to working in partnership with Parliament and embracing positively our concerns to scrutinise the implementation of the reform process and also their constructive engagement with our concerns as Members for a European economy based on knowledge, skills and creativity and a European society based on inclusion, diversity and cultural wealth."
"What cannot be ignored are the challenges of globalisation now facing our Union, the explosion of the audiovisual and information society, the need for an educational capacity of great depth and breadth and, finally, the need to establish the legitimacy of our institutions and reinvigorate their forms."
"These are challenges that go right to the heart of the reform process and challenges that concern my own committee."
"I hope that the Commissioner-designate will go forward with our confidence but also with the understanding that your success also reflects our own success."
"Together we can work for the future of the European Union."
"Mr President, we now have high hopes of implementing a policy of openness and of carrying through reforms in the interests of efficiency."
"Mr Prodi, your agreement with Mr Poettering points to a new era, the possibility of an entirely new Commission culture aimed at winning back citizens' confidence and interest in our European Union."
"It has been a dizzying but, in my view, absolutely necessary process for the Union."
"Let me go back to December 1998 when we in the Group of the European People' s Party, together with Liberals and the Greens, fought for openness and the need for accountability in the debate for adoption of the budget."
"Then, the Socialists opted for party considerations, evasion and cowardliness in the face of the Council."
"Without the willingness of ourselves in the right-of-centre parties to exercise supervisory power, to take responsibility for this and, in a spirit of openness before all else, to demand to have all the papers in full view on the table, we would never have come as far as we have in fact today."
"Mr Prodi, Commissioners-designate, when it comes to enlargement of the Union, foreign and security policy, strengthening free trade in the world, opening up markets, maintaining a vigorous policy on the environment and continuing to pursue economic liberalisation in Europe and with a common currency that is more competitive, Europe is going to need, for all these things, a very strong and functioning Commission in which you, Professor Prodi, will have our confidence and approval of your legislative arrangements."
"When you obtain these things, you also acquire, however, a responsibility to make sure that each and every one of the Commissioners can live up to the ideals, share the focus and conviction and meet the requirements of justice and propriety that we all demand now."
"I wish you luck."
"You will be receiving the Moderate delegation' s ""yes"" vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, with the approval of the Prodi Commission, the European Parliament will tomorrow draw a line under the scandal of the Santer Commission."
"I hope that in the process, we shall also overcome an understandable degree of mistrust on the part of Europe' s citizens and create a new confidence in the European Union."
"However, drawing a line under the matter does not mean just filing it away."
"The European Parliament will remain alert and keep a sharp eye on the Commission in future too."
"That is why we were elected by the peoples of Europe."
"We shall ensure that, if need be, individual Members of the Commission are removed if they are no longer acceptable for professional or personal reasons."
"I am convinced that, for example, Mr Bolkestein would fail the test tomorrow if, in appointing the Commission, we had the opportunity to vote on individual Commissioners."
"A Commissioner responsible for the internal market who, during the hearings, was forever mouthing the word ""subsidiarity"" has clearly not understood enough about the great common tasks facing Europe."
"The people of Europe expect to benefit from a leadership which focuses upon the common good and not upon the sum total of individual interests in the Member States."
"When Mr Bolkestein learns to understand this, then he may go on to share for a long time in the success which I wish Mr Prodi and his Commission."
"If he does not, then he is a candidate for the sack."
"Mr Prodi, since Mr Bolkestein is still not back yet, I trust you will pass the message on to him."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Belgian delegation, the Belgian Members of the PPE Group, I want to start by driving home the message that the voting due to take place this morning places before us a decision of the utmost importance."
"We have no doubts about Mr Prodi' s Presidency."
"We were impressed by his introduction, we are expecting positive answers to the points contained in our Resolution, and we have faith in Mr Prodi' s ability to lead the Commission in a responsible and professional manner."
"If we had been asked to give our opinion on each of the Commissioners-designate individually then indeed we would have given most of them our support."
"But now of course, we have to give our opinion of the Commission as a College."
"We know that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link."
"Unfortunately, we feel that one particular link in the chain is indeed weak."
"Is the crisis situation in the institutions to continue?"
"Not as far as we are concerned, for it is high time that the Commission was able to get down to work again, exercising its full authority."
"So you will not find us voting against the Resolution."
"The weak link, and everyone now knows who it is, is the candidate put forward by the Belgian government."
"This government could have done its own country a better service."
"The hearing with Mr Busquin was not a great success for the candidate."
"We, that is almost all those present in that committee, were agreed on this."
"But sadly enough, this assessment did not find expression in the letter to the President of the Parliament."
"It is anyone' s guess as to why."
"What is more, Mr Busquin did not show the least sensitivity towards, let alone demonstrate any commitment to, the question of defending the use of Dutch in the European institutions, which was an insult to the six million Flemish people."
"Those of us who represent the Flemish people cannot just overlook this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to learn that the Belgian delegation of the PPE cannot give its approval to this College with one voice, but we do intend to adopt a constructive attitude over the coming years in order to work with the College."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-designate of the Commission, I am now suspending this debate."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Statement by Mr Prodi (continued)"
"In accordance with the agenda, the debate on Mr Prodi' s statement continues."
"Mr President, President-designate of the Commission Prodi, if we are optimistic and confident about the future, we can state that we are now in a perfect situation."
"Now, all the possibilities of steering the actions of the EU are better than ever and the confidence of the citizens is growing in that direction."
"Before us we have a new Commission, which has bound itself in the hearings to making the actions of the Union more transparent, more efficient and more comprehensible."
"We have also heard from each Member of the Commission that the Commission will be getting leaders in each field who have committed themselves to working more closely with Parliament."
"As a College, the Commission has affirmed that it is prepared for real reforms through the mouthpiece of its President."
"The hard rebuke given to us in the parliamentary elections in June by the citizens of Europe is still fresh in our minds."
"We cannot continue on the present course, but the Union must engage in prompt reforms which will transform the procedures of all the institutions of the Union for the next Millennium."
"The Commission has to move forward at the same pace as the reality of the Member States and their citizens."
"Here, Mrs Roth-Behrendt has drawn attention to a particularly important matter: the Commission really must bear in mind the true matters of concern for the citizens when choosing its own priorities and publicising them, such as environmental issues, an enduring development in all areas as well as the need to protect the consumer."
"To this, I would also add equality of citizens and social equality."
"Although I did say that all of the opportunities facing us are better than they have been before, I fear that it will not be possible to make use of them."
"First and foremost, the question is whether the future Commission will have the ability to carry out fundamental reforms instead of just being content to gloss over the real problems with sticking-plaster policies."
"We cannot afford to do this, and I am sure that real reforms are on the way. For the tasks ahead, I also wish the future Commission a long life."
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, if we had to choose here and now between your opponents and the reasons they have given and you, we would find ourselves in a predicament, maybe to the point of abstaining, indeed even to voting for you, as the arguments of the last communists and allies of Milosevic against NATO and our countries and against British conservatives and others are so weak and worthless."
"But we must judge you and decide whether to put our confidence in you on the basis of your statements and what we know about you, leaving these statements to one side."
"As European federalists, we can have absolutely no confidence in you whatsoever."
"The picture you painted of politics and the programme lacked all mention of the urgent institutional problems or supranational issues."
"As liberals and liberalists we know, especially from your references to the programme, that we run the risk of importing the postcorporate and postfascist heritage into Europe which has characterised the so-called mixed economy of Italian party politics."
"Finally, as Italians, we fear that through you on the continental political stage, there will be a return to sharing the spoils of party power which goes against every notion of the Constitutional State, every effective feeling of a Europe which stands for progress with regard to revolution and the reform of freedom and rights, progress in this sense."
"And so I, along with the other elected Members from the Bonino list, announce our determination to vote against you and we clearly refuse to put our confidence in you."
"There are a number of people from my group who have talked on this matter."
"Personally, and on behalf of the group I represent in Denmark, I have to say that I cannot vote for the Commission."
"I shall emphasise two points."
"The first is that the political programme which has been put forward promotes a degree of integration which goes far beyond what there is a mandate for from 80% of the Danish population and, what is more, from the populations of the other Member States."
"It is politically unacceptable."
"The EU is to make its presence more keenly felt across national borders, and, to an extent, that is a threat to our nation states."
"The second point is the background to the Prodi Commission."
"As we know, this was the scandal that was uncovered in connection with the first report by the Experts' group this spring."
"One might have imagined that, as a prior condition of endorsing the new Commission, Parliament might have demanded radical changes to put a stop to the systematic abuses that have taken place and to the consistent lack of proper supervision to be found in the system. However, none of this even enters into the equation."
"In the course of these hearings, a completely perfunctory explanation from the designated candidates for the Commission has been accepted."
"It is especially scandalous that someone like former Commission President Delors' right-hand man, who was responsible for setting up the criticised security services, should have been waved through this Parliament without so much as having to answer a single critical question."
"For these reasons, it is impossible for us to vote for the Commission-designate."
"Mr President, in his speech today, President-designate Professor Prodi quite correctly mentioned how important co-operation is for the Union."
"He mentioned the need for rapprochement with the USA, the Mediterranean area and even between religions."
"I may have misheard, but I did not detect any reference on his part to the Northern Dimension of the Union, the area from the Barents Sea through northern Russia to the Baltic States and Poland, and also from Scandinavia to northern Germany."
"The longest borders between the Union and applicant states are, however, to be found in this area, and in addition there is the only border with the largest European state, Russia."
"I hope that the problems of this area, as well as the opportunities, enjoy the attention of the Commission."
"Likewise, I hope that the renewal of the strategy on Russia will continue although I know that Russia with its scandals and problems is a truly great question mark at the present time."
"The report of the Group of Independent Experts shows that the structures of the EU and the Commission have been confused and obscured with regard to responsibility and power-relations for years."
"Commissioner Kinnock truly has a task as great as that of the fabled Hercules when he continues Commissioner Liikanen' s work reforming the structures of the Commission."
"I wish him success and await the results."
"Professor Prodi was looking for more glasnost."
"This is quite correct when one considers relations with Parliament."
"It must, however, be remembered that Gorbachev' s Soviet Union dissolved into too much glasnost and too little perestroika."
"The word perestroika can best be translated as ""to build a new house on tried and tested foundations"" ."
"The Soviet Union experienced its own disappearance."
"I hope that the Prodi Commission will also focus on perestroika in the Union. Only in this way will the Commission be able to make progress in matters of substance and to ""build a new house on tried and tested foundations"" ."
"Mr President Prodi, I would like to begin by applauding the important reference you made at the beginning of your intervention today to the tragic situation in East Timor."
"I must ask you though, what specific action are you planning to take - in co-operation with the UN of course - in terms of consolidating Timor' s now irreversible independence and making it viable, and in terms of supplying emergency aid to the long-suffering people of Timor?"
"As for your statement overall, I approve the fact that it touched on some very important points but I do not think that it emphasised sufficiently the social dimensions of the objectives of the Commission over which you preside."
"The fact that a word as symbolic as ""cohesion"" was removed from the Directorate-General for Regional Policy strikes me as rather unfortunate."
"I must admit that I was shocked that you were perfectly clear on the freedom of trade and on the demands of competition on businesses, but you were silent or vague on fighting unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, all veritable scourges of the European Union."
"Commissioner António Vitorino, who made an absolutely brilliant statement to this Parliament, highlighted the need to integrate refugees and to give effective protection to ethnic minorities."
"He presented an excellent programme for the area allocated to him and which deserved the agreement and applause of the majority of this Parliament."
"I would like to know if, as President of the Commission, you will attempt to commit yourself to resolving the very serious social problems which exist within the European Union, and which, to my mind, should be an absolute priority for the Commission."
"Mr President, I feel that none of us must lose sight of the fact that the European Union is seen as irrelevant and unresponsive to the crises in our world today."
"The huge problem of confidence in our institutions has been exacerbated by the problems of the Commission in recent months."
"The European Union' s response to the Balkans, on our very doorstep, was generally viewed as too little, too late. On East Timor - and I note, Mr Prodi, what you said this morning - where are we?"
"Two weeks after the world is advised of the most brutal genocide following elections in an attempt to establish the very essence of democracy which we, as Parliamentarians, above all should uphold, we are not yet in gear and not seen as relevant to the solution by any commentators."
"While Parliament must look at its own role very seriously, especially following the poor turnout in the recent elections in many Member States - evidence at best of disinterest but more likely cynicism and disdain by our citizens - our job today is to respond to the hearing of the Commissioners-elect and to the case put by the President-elect, Mr Prodi."
"Yes, Mr Prodi, we need ""ambitious reforms of the European Union institutions"" ."
"I take that to be your perestroika, to match the glasnost which you refer to, but not an everlasting reform, not a constant state of flux."
"We need stability and we need to get down to the business of policy as quickly as possible."
"I support the view of the Commission' s relationship with Parliament being akin to that of a government' s relationship with its parliament."
"But let us reflect that in most parliaments a vote of no confidence in a single member of the government results in the entire government resigning, not just the individual minister."
"Is that what we are asking for?"
"We are giving confused signals."
"In insisting on the political reflection of the outcome of the recent European Parliament elections within the European Commission, how far should we go in restricting the choice of and dictating to national governments their selection of Commissioner?"
"We must learn from our hearings."
"We must never allow a government to use the Commission as a retirement home for politicians past - to use a consumer term - their ""sell-by date"" or for a political pay-off for old pals or indeed to export a national embarrassment to Europe."
"At the same time there is a need for an important balance between the Commission, Parliament and the rights of governments."
"We have no choice, Mr Prodi."
"It is all or nothing in terms of your new college."
"On balance I feel we must accept it and support your team."
"Yes, we have concerns about a few individuals but the responsibility for ensuring that none of them hit the headlines adversely over the next five years is yours, not ours, given the limited scope of the hearings in this Parliament."
"The key to the future of a credible Europe lies in a proper relationship between the Commission and Parliament built on mutual respect."
"I hope you agree with that."
"I wish you all well."
"Mr President, with these hearings we have just carried out an exercise in scrutiny and transparency the like of which exists in none of our Member States."
"Imagine if each of our national governments had to go through a procedure whereby they had to fill in fifty pages of answers to a questionnaire and were subject to three hours of grilling and questioning in public before the national parliaments took a vote of confidence allowing them to take office."
"We have achieved something that we can be proud of."
"Of course this is a new procedure and a young parliament and things were not perfect."
"Some of the questions were less than forensic."
"There are things that could be improved next time."
"Nonetheless, with the outcome of this procedure on this side of the House we are confident that we have a Commission that is a distinct improvement on the previous one."
"Granted there were questions on the past activities of two candidates in particular; but both have been cleared by the national investigations that pertained to their activities and, in the absence of anything new, it would be difficult for the European Parliament to press this issue further."
"But the fact that the President of the Commission has secured a right not available to his predecessors to dismiss any Commissioner, should that ever be necessary, means that we can rest assured - and we shall be vigilant on this - that, if anything new emerges, we will be able to take action."
"We have not tried to play party politics or national politics and petty games of that sort on this side of the House."
"We thought that Parliament should approach this professionally and responsibly."
"We are satisfied with the outcome of these opportunities afforded to us in this new procedure."
"Mr President, a number of hearings have taken place in which the tension between collective and individual responsibility could be felt."
"It is, of course, clear that the question of individual responsibility and how this new Commission will give it shape over the next few years, will become an important issue."
"Great stress has been laid on collective responsibility in the past, but if you read the Wise Men' s report, the last report that has just come out, then the situation has been rather different in practice, with cases being founded primarily on the principle of non-intervention."
"I am not concerned with your affairs, you are not concerned with mine, and ultimately no one takes responsibility."
"That too is the painful truth that has emerged."
"I believe that the need to exchange the non-intervention principle for real collective responsibility represents a challenge."
"How exactly do you give shape to this personal responsibility?"
"I would in fact like to make the following proposition to Mr Prodi."
"He will produce an annual programme and this will, of course, include the things to be done within the various Directorates-General."
"Would it in fact be possible for an annual programme of this kind also to include a number of political obligations in terms of the results to be achieved by the various individual Commissioners?"
"You would continue to be responsible as a collective entity, but even within this context you could specify the results that an individual Commissioner was to deliver that year in more precise terms."
"You could then address him or her on these issues afterwards."
"I would argue in favour of this."
"Then there is the unease over the question of whether it should not in fact be a number of Commissioners, i.e. one or more, against whom criminal proceedings are initiated."
"I take it for granted that Mr Prodi would ask a Commissioner against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated, to resign."
"I also take for granted, and this is also in the Wise Men' s report, the fact that if a Commissioner should be found to have knowingly supplied Parliament with false information, then this same Commissioner would depart."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate Prodi, we Social Democrats are disappointed."
"In spite of announcements, you have not succeeded in achieving a better balance between men and women in your new team."
"The EU Commission remains a male domain."
"The mission conferred in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to oppose all forms of discrimination, is still, for women at least, just a vague hope."
"We may speak the same European language, but you have not in fact understood us."
"A third of your candidates did not answer the question from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities about gender mainstreaming."
"The Social Democrats' demand was and remains - again, I stress the word ""remains"" - to have in future an Equal Opportunities Commissioner with the power to implement equal opportunities."
"We demand that the College and yourself as its head become ambitious about gender mainstreaming, with measurable developments and improvements as a result."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou, whose portfolio includes equal opportunities alongside employment and the social dimension, has in fact shown a lot of commitment but, Mr Prodi, how will she react when she has been gagged by you in advance and when the struggle against violence, as well as the issue of non-discrimination, has been placed in other hands?"
"You speak of a new balance, a new partnership, but do not waste a single word on the women of Europe who, at the end of the day, do represent half of our citizens."
"We want you to take steps to ensure that substantial improvements in income and in access to power and money are achieved, and that you join us in our struggle against violence and against the everyday discrimination faced by women."
"Without the input from women, the idea of the big European family is meaningless."
"Mr President, I would like to make three remarks about the hearings, their results and the elements that still remain to be put in place between the incoming Commission and Parliament."
"On the hearings, I agree with Mr Corbett that it has been a good start, but there are several things that need to be improved when the issue comes up again in 2004, for example, the possibility of our voting on individual Commissioners after a committee or at least an indicative vote to see whether the committee was really in favour or not."
"Secondly, we should have time in the hearings to follow up questions which it was quite clear were treated unevenly by the committees."
"Last but not least, the committees should have equal time."
"The Committee on Fisheries for instance had only one hour whereas other committees had three hours."
"We in Parliament need to sort out these details."
"As for the results, without referring to individuals, many in my Group have already indicated which performers have been good or less good in the incoming Commission."
"Our Conservative position has been set out by the Conservative Leader Mr McMillan-Scott."
"We are left with an imbalance in the Commission and it is there that I believe we need to make some progress."
"Firstly, in the light of our experience from the discharge for 1996 for which I was responsible, can we really be sure that, if we do vote against an incoming Commissioner, that Commissioner will resign?"
"Secondly, how can we be sure that we will get the information which we need?"
"There was so much frustration in the last Parliament about not being able to get the information we required."
"Finally, as regards the codes of conduct, we need to know that promotion will be on merit and that promotion at the highest levels of the Commission will involve managerial competence, which has not always been the case up to now."
"In conclusion, these are important elements, at least for my Group."
"We want to see these included in our operating agreement between the Commission and Parliament because the numbers abstaining or voting against the Commission tomorrow on the final vote will depend on how far those elements are in place by tomorrow."
"Mr President, you have a major task ahead of you and nobody is more aware of that than the Budget Control Committee."
"The number one priority must be the reform agenda."
"If you fail to deliver on this then we will all judge you very harshly and will in fact all suffer as a result."
"But as Mr Kinnock said yesterday, you will be judged on your deeds and not on your words."
"On behalf of the Socialists in the Budget Control Committee, I would like to comment specifically on Mr Kinnock' s presentation at the hearing."
"Mr Kinnock' s record within the Commission is second to none and we accept fully his commitment to accept collective responsibility in terms of past problems whilst agreeing that he bears no individual guilt."
"Performance and management of the transport directorate has been exemplary and we believe that with his experience of modernising the Labour Party in the UK, he has the relevant qualification to undertake this work."
"If you can turn the Labour Party around from the lamentable state it was in the 1980s to getting us to a position in the 1990s where we swept everything away, then you must really be able to perform miracles."
"We note the Commission' s commitment to the reform agenda and, in particular, Mr Prodi, your commitment to consult the European Parliament on the reform programme."
"We expect this to be before its presentation in February."
"We note the commitment to consult us on the reform of the Staff Regulations which addresses some of Mr Elles' concerns, the new commitments given to whistleblowers and the need to develop new disciplinary procedures."
"The idea of giving legal effect to the codes of conduct once established is also something we welcome and the overhaul of the Commission' s management and control systems."
"We expect active consultation with Parliament at all times and we have no doubts that the Commissioner will fulfil his commitment on that score."
"We do have concerns that the Commission must respect the independence of OLAF."
"We will not allow you to play budgetary games on this issue."
"This is the beginning of the reform process and we now look forward to some action."
"Mr Cashman, do you have a point of order to make?"
"Mr President, I am sorry to make a second point of order when I still have not made my maiden speech in this House."
"I would like to point out to my colleague that the Treaty of Amsterdam refers to ending discrimination not only against women but against a whole range of minorities on the basis of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability."
"That is something that I hope the Commission will approach as a whole and not just, on a point of order, the equal opportunities of women."
"Mr Cashman, I must tell you that this was not a point of order."
"Please observe the Rules ."
"Mr President, Professor Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of the 19 hearings of the future Commissioners, we continually heard talk of the fine-sounding concepts of transparency, efficiency, responsibility and accountability."
"Not piecemeal improvements, but root and branch reform is to be carried out, as you plausibly inform us Mr Prodi."
"That is a difficult task for Mr Kinnock, however, because words are not enough."
"Deeds must quickly follow, and in a way which is fully open to scrutiny by Parliament."
"For us, constructive co-operation with the Commission is a prerequisite for achieving a sustained improvement in the regrettable image our citizens unfortunately have at present of Europe."
"Specifically, I should like to touch upon three points relating to budgetary supervision."
"Firstly, it is normal practice to separate the power to spend and the responsibility for supervising spending."
"You, Professor Prodi, have combined both areas in the one department."
"What is your view on possibly separating the two areas, either now or in the future?"
"As matters stand, don' t you fear conflicts of interest?"
"Secondly, I was pleased at what you said about keeping the public informed."
"I also wish to see openness of this kind in relation to our Committee, especially within the framework of the discharge procedure where we are entitled to expect the information we require from the Commission to be of a particular quality."
"In future, we do not want initially to have to find out from the press when there have been difficulties, poor management and so on."
"The third point concerns OLAF, the new office for combating fraud."
"This year' s staffing of the office is quite inadequate."
"Unfortunately, Mrs Schreyer has not expressed a clear opinion about the possibility of a further 15 posts this year, giving a total of 30."
"From the answers at yesterday' s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, there was no evidence of any change to the, so far, secretive attitude of the Commission and its administration."
"There is still a lot to be done here in the services."
"This also applies to work on the 30 cases on the UCLAF-OLAF list which have still to be cleared up, not to mention the 900 other cases."
"I am counting on the fact that some life is going to be breathed into the words ""transparency"" , ""efficiency"" , ""responsibility"" and ""accountability"" ."
"Mr President, much has been said today about the cynicism and hypocrisy of the past, but I want to say to you that there is nothing more cynical or hypocritical than people who have already announced that they were going to vote against the Commission commenting on the process of hearings."
"We had part of this House announce even before the hearings started that they intended to reject the Commission."
"We need the progressive forces of this House - and I say this to people like Mr van Velzen and to others - to unite after the vote tomorrow to work with the new European Commission so that we can actually make progress, because we have had nine months of stagnation."
"We must stop the political guerrilla warfare that is going on in this House."
"We must work together."
"Let me make a comment on the fact that two members of the potential Commission have been criticised."
"We are not offering the European Commission a blank cheque, Mr Prodi; we will be watching very carefully what you and your colleagues do."
"But we will not see members of this Commission hounded by the press in any Member State of this Union."
"If there is evidence, it will be presented, and we rely upon you to take action where it is necessary."
"We will be voting within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament not on a party political basis but on the objective basis of the hearings and the questions that we had answered over the last couple of weeks."
"Let me pick up the point made by Mr van Velzen because I think this process is in two stages."
"We have had the speech by the President of the Commission and we have had the hearings, but the second stage is the work programme of the European Commission."
"The work programme should be an exciting indication of where the European Union is going and of what the European Union intends to do."
"In the past even under Delors and under Jacques Santer it never appeared that way, but the second stage is vital."
"That is why I agree with Mr van Velzen: we must make sure that this work programme is understood by the public, and that it is important to the public; and we have to work with you to deliver that work programme."
"We have made a good start with the hearing and after that vote tomorrow let the progressive forces in this House work with the Commission to deliver what the people of Europe want."
"Mr Prodi, I am not speaking on behalf of any political group or any delegation."
"I speak for myself and all those of us who share certain opinions."
"Certain opinions which we could sum up in the following way: firstly, we know that Europe has been built on the basis of two forces for construction which are dialectically opposed: those who, aware of the weight of history, defend the survival and validity of the national State and those who, with greater courage, imagine a future with greater integration, whose political definition we still do not know, and this is perhaps one of the advantages of construction."
"Mr Prodi, I speak on behalf of all those who share your principles, who share your programme, who share the idea that Europe must establish a new order of peace, prosperity and stability and that Europe must show coraggio, ambizione and visione (courage, ambition and vision)."
"And in their name, Mr President, I understand that we must respect the essential equilibrium laid down in the Treaty."
"In this respect, for example, we must respect the Commission' s right to initiative."
"And, of course, we must ensure that the Treaties, the legislative texts and the activities of the institutions are more in line with the demands of society."
"And society demands something else - you said it yourself, Mr Prodi - it demands realism and demands that we are in closer contact with that society."
"Therefore, all I can do is, in the name of those I speak for, underline the commitment that, at the Intergovernmental Conference, we will carry out the fundamental reform which the citizens demand, the importance of which they have demonstrated through their low turn-out in the elections."
"The texts and our attitudes should be brought into line with today' s society, but we should not lose that which has been the key to the vault of Community construction."
"Mr President Prodi, good luck with next Commission which, with no doubt whatsoever, will be voted in tomorrow."
"I would inform you that, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolution."
"In addition, I have received from the Conference of Presidents the draft resolution for electing the Commission-designate."
"The vote on these motions for resolution and the motion received from the Conference of Presidents will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12.00 p.m."
"Mr Prodi, I address you in my capacity as President of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries."
"We have not heard you speak about fishing and, nevertheless, you must be aware that thousands and thousands of fishermen depend on it, thousands and thousands of families, thousands of secondary businesses and businesses involved in the processing of products which are necessary in the European Union, employment which is furthermore located in European regions and territories which are highly dependent on fishing."
"I want to be very clear in this intervention, Mr Prodi, and I want to tell you that Mr Fischler, who obviously knows a lot about agriculture, nevertheless knows little about fishing."
"He admitted this himself during his hearing and has also demonstrated it."
"However, he made us some political commitments which I would like to remind you of in your capacity as President-designate."
"Mr Fischler expressed orally the political commitment to maintain the current Directorate-General for Fisheries, amending the statement that he had made in writing in his questionnaire and thereby accepting the maintenance of the current Directorate-General for Fisheries."
"And I say current in the sense that we are talking of a specific Directorate-General, for Fisheries, with the status of Directorate-General."
"I say this because this is a sine qua non condition which we have established in our Committee and this is what was communicated to you in the letter which I signed myself."
"I ask you therefore to take good note of it, and I ask the same of Mr Kinnock, who is to the left of you, as Vice-President responsible for reform, since this is a sine qua non condition for maintaining the parliamentary trust which we have granted Mr Fischler in our Committee."
"Secondly, I would like to remind you that Mr Fischler granted us the written mandate for the negotiation of the crucial fishing agreement with Morocco, which is a matter of extreme urgency, so that this Parliament can continue to maintain the budgetary reserve of the item agreed by the Council and that your Commission, Mr Prodi, will not be responsible for the fact that there is no finance for this agreement in the future."
"Mr President of the Commission, I would like to begin from where Mr Donnelly left off, the second stage of your mission - the work programme - because I believe that, aside from the collective and individual responsibilities, which I certainly believe are of the utmost importance, the work in the restoration of the Commission' s credibility and its productiveness will be judged by this work programme."
"This programme will be met with some apathy and reactions as regards the wording and the actual execution of it."
"In order to overcome all that, Mr President, originality and dynamism are necessary of which I hope you have plenty in reserve because many of us believe that these elements appear to have been lacking, judging by your speeches so far."
"Likewise, there have not been sufficient signs of a new attitude of mind emerging, which would be necessary to deal with the deepening confidence crisis facing Europe as regards not only the issue of unemployment but also the issue of security"
"You made reference to the Balkans, Mr President."
"It is a good job that Europe understands the importance of the Balkans and I agree with you wanting to convey the urgency of the matter."
"You are right in saying that the Balkan states cannot import their conflict into Europe, but you are not right in distancing yourself from the problem by telling them that they must resolve the conflict themselves before we can accept them."
"Europe, Mr President, imported the Balkan problems the moment it decided, with the force of weapons, to find a settlement to those problems."
"And it is not only the Balkans, if we are to begin naming names."
"How is it possible that an applicant country, for example, can threaten to attack a Member State without being warned that attacking one Member State is tantamount to attacking all the Member States, just because there is no common European border."
"I hope that at the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr President, you will be able to propose measures for creating such a border and for instilling a greater sense of security into many of us who do not feel secure."
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, the new Commission is faced with a number of big tasks."
"We now have a joint policy on currency which is being managed by the European Central Bank."
"What we now need is a common economic policy."
"This should include consistent application of the rules on competition, including the Stability and Growth Pact. It should also include joint minimum regulations for taxation and a number of basic principles."
"I am convinced that this common economic policy can only succeed if it is designed in accordance with the principles of a social market economy."
"What we need in this connection - and this, Mr President of the Commission, is a further point to which you referred quite specifically - is a number of projects which are visible to the citizens of Europe."
"Firstly - and I know that there are criticisms about this - food safety is one of people' s basic concerns yet also one of the things which stops the Common Market from really working."
"I should like personally to encourage you, Mr President of the Commission, to take up this theme, for it seems to me to be of fundamental importance, on the one hand for our citizens but, on the other hand too, for the proper functioning of the Common Market."
"Secondly: the supervision of air space."
"For this, America has one authority, to which you also referred in one of your initial speeches."
"In Europe we have three authorities concerned with this issue."
"That is unacceptable to the airline companies and is dangerous for the citizens of Europe."
"This seems to me to be a second big priority."
"Thirdly: the further dismantling of monopolies."
"From the costs of telephone calls and of electricity, it appears now for the first time that dismantling monopolies is of practical value to our citizens and also entails tangible advantages."
"I think this ought to encourage us to go further down this road, that is to say, in the fields of postal services, energy, telecommunications and railways where similar conditions prevail."
"In my opinion, dismantling monopolies is to the advantage of the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr Prodi, on behalf of the Dutch Socialists I would like to express the hope that we will be in a position to draw a line under the crisis, with the appointment of your Commission in its entirety tomorrow."
"You have our support, provided of course that the Commission fulfils all those conditions that you yourself have imposed."
"You gave a speech this morning and we have heard a lot in the course of the hearings."
"What is still very much conspicuous by its absence as far as we are concerned, is that element of social concern."
"First and foremost, that element of social concern towards the rest of the world."
"125 million children will not be going to school today, which means they have no future in this world."
"Our world is not millennium-proof. I am so keen to see January' s programme become one of ambitious endeavours on the part of Patten, Lamy, Nielson and your Commission to make Europe really socially-minded towards other countries in this respect, and then towards its own."
"The solidarity, free market and need for reform we have spoken of, will only work if we keep everyone on the same track. Too many people are excluded at the present time, in our own European world too."
"Internal solidarity and solidarity towards others, as I said, that is what we would like to judge you and your programme on in January."
"For our part, we are looking at all the Commissioners and we hope to be able to make a confidence-inspiring new start in Europe, in the way described so effectively by Mr Van Velzen when he set out how the programme could achieve this."
"We would like to hold each of you responsible on an individual basis and achieve sound results working together as Parliament and Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to address matters of procedure and of substance with regard to the hearings of the candidate Commissioners."
"In my view these hearings were flawed because there was insufficient time available to the committees to pursue their lines of questioning."
"I speak from our experience on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Because we had to make time available to delegations from other committees, neither the members of my group nor our committee nor the members of the delegations had sufficient time to put all the questions that they wanted to candidate Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy."
"This is a matter for great regret."
"The second point where the hearings were flawed was in the failure to hold indicative votes at the end of each hearing."
"I know there are different views on this issue but it seems to me that without an indicative vote the key element of whether Members feel the candidate Commissioner is competent or not cannot be determined exactly."
"Let me come to the substance."
"I have mentioned two candidate Commissioners but there was a third who appeared before us, candidate Commissioner Busquin."
"It is no coincidence that this was a hearing where there were no delegations from other committees and we had more time to pursue questioning."
"I am afraid that Mr Busquin did not satisfy a majority of colleagues on the committee either with his answers on his part in past financial scandals or with his answers on his competence with the portfolio and whether he would have a sense of responsibility and leadership appropriate to the tasks facing this Commission."
"Fresh information has come to light since the hearing in The Sunday Times this weekend which casts further doubt on whether Mr Busquin was truthful in his answers to Parliament."
"I have asked the President to consider this matter."
"So, I am afraid he would be a flawed Commissioner, Mr Prodi."
"Mr Prodi, on behalf of the Italian Socialists, I hope that Parliament offers you its broad and unconditional confidence."
"There has been enough evasion and we need a strong Commission."
"Besides, without an authoritative leadership, Parliament is in danger of losing its way."
"This period of adjustment could not have been more difficult."
"The crisis in the previous Commission occurred just at the time when Europe was going up in flames!"
"If it were not for Emma Bonino, in the face of the Balkans tragedy, the Commission simply would not have existed."
"However, the European citizens and peoples have been left with an impression of fragility, if not powerlessness and a sense of weakness in the crucial area - the area Europe was created for - of ensuring peace in our continent."
"You spoke of the Europe of peoples more than the Europe of the institutions."
"It is the view and feeling of the European peoples that Europe is already one from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains, from the tundra to Anatolia."
"You rightly put at the top of the list enlargement of the Union to include those countries that are ready, and then you spoke of the different degrees of co-operation by drawing concentric circles of 'virtual Membership' to include nearby countries not yet ready to accede."
"You also mentioned a partnership with Russia and Ukraine and a cultural partnership with the Mediterranean countries."
"And encompassing all these circles is the joint and strengthened leadership with the United States of America."
"Mr President, are you sure that this view is shared on the other side of the Atlantic? You will no doubt have read yesterday that the American Minister of Defence is already putting obstacles in the way of common European defence."
"And yet Mr CFSP is non other than the former Secretary-General of NATO. NATO' s borders already stretch to Warsaw and Budapest while Europe' s borders clearly end in Berlin."
"Enlargement is the main priority, but it is not without its problems, both for the countries concerned and for the Union itself."
"And I am not only thinking of the disproportion between larger aims and a smaller budget."
"If we do not want to lose in substance what we gain in size, if we want to give a soul to the Europe of the single market and currency, if we want to regain the citizens' and people' s faith, we - Commission, Parliament and Council - must work together on what only a more robust foundation and new energy can bring: European citizenship, a Charter on Rights and a real Constitution."
"What is the point in having ensured free movement within one border yet maintaining fifteen different laws on immigration and political asylum?"
"What is the point in having one parliament that is formed on the basis of fifteen different types of electoral system?"
"A new frontier remains to the South, and a common citizenship: this is the perspective I would like you to focus on between now and January"
"Mr President, one wonders what one can say in two minutes on the appointment of a Commission."
"I want to wish you all well: Mr Prodi, Mr Kinnock and everybody else who is taking on enormous responsibilities on behalf of the people of the European Union."
"They are enormous responsibilities because they relate to the way people will lead their lives over the coming decades."
"There are people in Europe killing each other because of differences over religion, ethnicity and nationality, there are people going to bed hungry, there are people sleeping outdoors and there are people without adequate health care."
"These are all problems that Europe has to solve in partnership, not only between the Commission and Parliament but also between the Commission, Parliament, the Member State Governments and the Member State parliaments."
"One of the things we should try and do over the next five years is to forge a closer partnership between national and regional parliaments and the European level."
"If we are to develop a Europe in which our people have a share, we must give them a role in creating that Europe and sharing that Europe."
"The only way we will do that is if we give the social dimension of Europe - the social convergence that is needed in Europe - the same status as we give to monetary convergence and to economic convergence."
"We cannot create a Europe that the people will feel is theirs if we simply talk about economics and money all the time."
"We have to talk about social issues, culture and what concerns people in their daily lives."
"We have to demonstrate that the politics of this Union can solve their problems."
"Mr President, I too was surprised by my colleague Mr Donnelly' s attack on my colleague Mr Van Velzen."
"Mr Donnelly appears still to abide by the old Marxist principle that the Socialist Party is always right and anyone who disagrees with this is wrong."
"But I did not want to talk about that today, Mr President, I wanted to speak, as co-ordinator of the Committee on Employment, about the hearing with Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The answers provided by this Commissioner-designate were, in principle, satisfactory."
"It is clear that not everyone was in agreement with all her answers, but everyone on the Committee on Employment feels that the answers she gave provide a sound basis for future co-operation."
"The same goes for the vast majority of the European People' s Party."
"This Commissioner is not one of those against whom the PPE rightly raised objections."
"Nevertheless, a few comments need to be made here."
"The Commissioner-designate was not prepared to accept more intensive co-operation with the European Parliament as regards the Employment Pact and its further development."
"I refer now to the celebrated Cologne Summit."
"There is every risk of the successful Luxembourg process that we now have being swept under the carpet by the unsuccessful Cologne episode without parliamentary contribution."
"That is why the Commission must continue to involve Parliament in the process."
"Another critical point, which our British colleagues were particularly concerned to raise, is that concerning deregulation."
"The Commission should also pursue this issue, insofar as it can create employment."
"The position of non-governmental organisations in the social sector still has not been determined."
"A legal basis must be created as soon as possible which will enable organisations for the disabled, the elderly, children and families in particular, to create a real civil society at European level."
"The social dialogue is very important."
"Europe can count itself as lucky that the social dialogue has achieved so much."
"But the social dialogue, Mr Prodi, must never be a reason for the Commission and Parliament to renounce their political responsibilities."
"As long as Parliament' s role in judging the outcome of the social dialogue remains undetermined, there is a need for an interim solution."
"To conclude, Mr President, I very much appreciate the fact that the Commissioner went into great detail during the hearing about my report, the aim of which is to bring about a kind of Luxembourg process in relation to security for the citizens of the Member States."
"Mr Prodi, you are able to represent the aspiration to carry out what this House has been demanding for a long time."
"I was captivated by your comments to this Parliament when you said that you were going to act, that you were not going to be afraid of making mistakes, that you would prefer to get things right but that, if by taking decisions, you make mistakes, you would run the risk of making those mistakes."
"Congratulations."
"These are good intentions which we hope to see shortly reflected in deeds."
"In the Commission on Budgetary Control, the members of the Group of the European People' s Party are primarily concerned with the need to be honest."
"The Committee of Independent Experts says that OLAF must be given the necessary resources to put an end to this aura of corruption which brought about the downfall of the former Commission."
"But I believe that we must go further."
"We must soon adopt a genuine personnel policy which will ensure that those who work in the Commission - on whose successes and failures we depend so much - may work with a personnel policy which values merit."
"I asked Mr Kinnock whether those 500 or so vacant posts in the Commission were going to be filled."
"If you lack resources, why do you not fill the posts which this Parliament has authorised?"
"We want to see action soon."
"In a month' s time, the Council on Home Affairs will take place."
"This could be the moment to introduce those measures which the Committee of Independent Experts proposes, and which on the whole are common sense measures which should have been carried out long ago."
"This Parliament demanded some of them a long time ago."
"Are you, Mr Prodi, ready to include those measures which will be dealt with in Helsinki?"
"We want to see facts because time is at a premium, Mr Prodi."
"If tomorrow you receive the approval of this House - and I hope this is the case - you have a huge job to do on behalf of all the citizens of Europe."
"Make haste, Mr Prodi."
"Mr President, I want to concentrate briefly on three matters. Firstly, Mr Prodi, I would remark that Mr Fischler was very well prepared on the matter of agriculture and provided convincing proof of his specialist knowledge."
"In the hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, probably one of the most important questions was that of Parliament' s participation in decision-making in the matter of Community agricultural policy."
"In this connection, my group expressly welcomes Mr Fischler' s statement that basic legislation affecting the way in which the general direction of agricultural policy is conceived should be decided as part of a joint decision-making process and that he would actively put forward this view at the future Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr Prodi, I am assuming that you support Mr Fischler on these matters."
"Secondly, a lot of time at the hearing was devoted not only to the outstanding questions concerning enlargement of the Union but also to the question of introducing the European agricultural model to the international stage in the future WTO negotiations and, above all, safeguarding it."
"Here too I can state, on behalf of my group, that it is clearly the settled will of the Commission to include such questions as, for example, socio-agricultural standards and European environmental provisions in the Millennium Round."
"Our colleague, Mr Garot, has already referred to this matter."
"Thirdly: if, in the next legislature, the Commissioner-designate for Agriculture succeeds in listening more to the draft amendments introduced by Parliament and to parliamentarians themselves (as long as, it is only fair to say, the latter do not exceed the budgetary limits and do not put existing legislation out of force), then a majority of my group is of the opinion that the Candidate' s experience, skills and commitment suggest that he will do some good work as a Member of the Commission."
"Mr Prodi, I am going to vote for you, but I confess that I am not going to vote very willingly."
"And if you bear in mind that a Spanish politician once said that the Spanish are characterised by their willingness, you can imagine the mood I am in."
"Why am I going to vote unwillingly?"
"Well, because I believe that what Europe needs are three things that in my language begin with ""i"" : ideas (ideas), ilusión (aspiration) and impulso (motivation)."
"I believe that the speech which you have made today has suffered from a lack of all three."
"It has been a speech with no clear political objectives, no edge, and has been downright boring."
"You have said that you want the Commission to be the Government of Europe."
"So do I, but I believe that your speech has not been that of a President of a European Government but more like a speech of a Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"I will give you an example of what I mean by specific commitments."
"The next European Council will cover constitutional reform."
"Mr Barnier made an excellent contribution before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and he made certain compromises, because this Parliament does not simply aspire to co-operating with the Commission."
"What was it that you said today: ""the Commission and Parliament will co-operate"" ?"
"No, we already take co-operation for granted, it is in the tradition of the Community."
"What we have wanted since 1997 is to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference in conjunction with the European Commission."
"The Commission must consider this matter - and this Parliament will do the same thing - and these two institutions of the European Union will together try to produce a preparatory document to facilitate the adoption of agreements."
"You have not said a word about this although it has been the doctrine of this Parliament since 1997."
"Therefore, Mr Prodi, allow me to give you a piece of advice."
"We have to make more commitments, we have to be less prudent, because the Europeans want a strong Commission, which works hard and strives for the interests of Europe."
"Mr Prodi, I believe that our citizens are going to demand this objective more and more every day, and not speeches void of commitments."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I will not repeat what my colleagues in the PPE have already said and, as a member of the Belgian delegation, I will not introduce internal Belgian politics into this debate."
"To my mind, there is a double challenge facing this Commission: winning the confidence of Parliament and also, and especially, that of our fellow citizens."
"As a Member for a border region between Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, I can describe for you the everyday expectations of many Europeans but, in particular, their lack of comprehension concerning the many instances of bullying which affect relations between our Member States."
"Investments, employment protection, health protection and fiscal policy are just a few examples of the points at issue."
"These problems are not those of a minority in Europe. No, Europe' s shortcomings in these areas are particularly sensitive issues on the national borders."
"They are everyday problems which, unfortunately, have only been acknowledged somewhat late in the day as problems for Europe as a whole."
"Devoting ourselves to these problems, Mr President, means winning over our citizens, in their work and with their problems."
"It is in their thinking and in their creative activity that we also have to win them over to the European idea."
"This Parliament has given clear signs to the previous and future Commissions."
"We therefore expect genuine co-operation, and right from the start."
"We expect strengthened supervision, for EU funds are not anonymous in origin but are tax payments from all our citizens."
"We are also awaiting, however, a precise definition of political responsibility from this Commission."
"I shall express my confidence in you and your team because you alone at present bear the responsibility for this College and for its strengths and weaknesses."
"The power is in your hands, Mr President, to ensure that Parliament' s signals are correctly interpreted."
"One thing I know already. A highly critical Parliament will not be fobbed off for weeks with arguments about overall responsibility."
"Our vote of confidence is no blank cheque but an offer of constructive co-operation from many Members of this Chamber."
"Madam President, this is the first or maiden speech that I shall make in this Chamber and in the tradition of the House of Commons from which I came, I should normally spend a great deal of time talking about the beauty of my area."
"But time does not permit it and I shall simply content myself by thanking those who sent me here for doing so and saying that I will try and serve their interests as best I can."
"I shall not vote for the Prodi Commission."
"Firstly, despite my fondness for my former parliamentary colleague, Neil Kinnock, my party and I made a commitment at the European elections that we would not support any Commission which had within it previous members."
"Although I do not expect anybody else to support that, I hope those who disagree will understand that in a democratic society when you make a commitment to people who elect you, you try and comply with that commitment when you get elected."
"Secondly, I shall not vote for this Commission because I do not believe that in real substance anything has changed in the last few weeks as a result of the hearings which we have had."
"We have not had enough time to question Commissioners; we have not had enough time to follow up with an interrogatory process."
"There has been not one individual vote in any committee on any Commissioner, not one Commissioner has been forced to withdraw as a result of the questions as to his suitability and not one Commissioner has accepted any sort of responsibility for the events of the past."
"Because we cannot vote for individual commissioners tomorrow and because I cannot individually record my vote in this Chamber that my colleague Mr Patten would make a fine Commissioner for External Affairs, I am left with simply no choice but to vote against this whole Commission in order to send a message to Mr Prodi and his colleagues that if and when they are elected they will respond to this Parliament; they will accept that it can no longer be business as usual and that we have to change our ways if we are to give the people of Europe the confidence they must have in this Parliament and its institutions."
"Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, I am also among those who tomorrow will vote ""no"" if something decisive still does not happen."
"And make no mistake, the discussion in the PPE Group this evening will still be very exciting."
"These are the reasons why I shall be voting ""no"" if no far-reaching change is to take place. Firstly, your Commission reveals a democratic deficit, Mr Prodi."
"The result of the European election is not reflected at any point in your team."
"I can appreciate why you' ve accepted a ""green"" Commissioner in view of the result achieved by the Greens in the European election."
"People will not, however, understand why ten Socialists are to be represented when they ask what influence their votes have really had upon the composition of the European Commission."
"And let us ask your predecessor, Mr Santer. Who, in this connection, has achieved any kind of success with the various national governments?"
"My second reason is the answers given by the Commissioners-designate at the hearings about the van Buitenen case."
"The citizens of Europe will not understand it if a new strategy is not at last applied here and those who care about transparency do not also finally receive stronger support in the Commission."
"The biggest problem for me and many others, however, is the proposed successor to Mrs Cresson."
"I do not, of course, want to pronounce any legal judgement upon Mr Busquin. I do not represent Belgian justice, and none of us want to put him in prison."
"The question is that of how we can restore trust in the European institutions."
"Do you really believe that we can win the citizens' trust when the only answer we are ever presented with is ""I have not been accused personally"" ?"
"Mr Busquin is involved in the Inusop affair and has not been accused for the sole reason that the case became statute-barred."
"This is an astonishing parallel to the case of the EU' s Balkans Co-ordinator, Bodo Hombach."
"And in the Dessault-Augusta affair it has since become very clear that he knew of an illicit fund."
"I wonder who can guarantee us that we will not have illicit funds in the Commission in future, in the DG XII or elsewhere, if this subject is not tackled in a better way than has so far been the case. So, Mr Prodi, you can still convince me by active intervention, but you must provide a very clear sign to Parliament and to the public."
"Otherwise, I shall be voting ""no"" tomorrow like a lot of other people. It won' t be a ""no"" vote for Europe but a vote for a clean, democratic and transparent Europe."
"Mr President-designate, while I was listening to your address this morning, at one point you made me jump because you said 'the pensioners are here' ."
"I said to myself, ""he has spotted me"" , but you had your back turned to me."
"Thank you, Mr President, for having unintentionally quoted me because I have come to the European Parliament as leader of the Pensioners' Party to represent for the first time the needs of the elderly."
"So this statement by Mr Prodi, in which he went on to say that he will keep matters relating to pensioners in mind, has given me hope for what the next few years will bring."
"I must say that I and the pensioners who sent me here to seat 270 of the European Parliament were pleased by the comment made by Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou. When she replied to one of my questions during the hearings - and we should point out what did not go well but also what did - she said that she is fully aware of the issue concerning the elderly who expect a pension which the fifteen Member States are no longer able to pay because the pension funds are weak and are in deficit."
"The elderly live for too long, and we and our supporters will do our best to make our lives as short as possible, but I am afraid this will not be enough."
"So I hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will finally speak out for the elderly so that the fifteen Member States give them the respect they deserve and, above all, establish rules that ensure that the money people have to pay every month is safe, so that they will have a pension in the future."
"Honourable Members, I should like to thank you for holding this long, interesting and very thorough debate."
"Many of you have pointed out that not much can be said in the space of two minutes, but I have taken full note of your remarks."
"Please excuse me if I am unable to answer all the points raised in depth because of the lack of time available."
"I have tried to group together the most important problems, namely those which may sway votes or determine a change of course by an institution."
"First of all, however, allow me to turn again to the question of East Timor, a problem raised by Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Soares and many others."
"I wish to inform Parliament that at 2 p.m. today, I had a long telephone conversation with President Habibie of Indonesia, following his meeting with the Ambassadors of the 15 Member States of the European Union in Djakarta."
"During this conversation, President Habibie formally undertook - and I repeat, formally - to give all foreign journalists free and unlimited access to East Timor, to give full and unconditional support to the intervention by the United Nations, to create the conditions for this to take place as soon as possible and to make every effort to alleviate the conditions suffered by the population of East Timor, stressing that there are 200 million Indonesians facing difficult circumstances."
"Lastly, he undertook to respect the decisions taken by the people of East Timor."
"For my part, I told President Habibie that we would seek to monitor compliance with these conditions as strictly as possible and I told him that I would report the content of our conversation to the European Parliament, as I am now doing."
"He then told me of his keen desire to maintain good relations with the European Union, a position we reciprocate in our desire to see the rights and dignity of the people of Indonesia respected, a point I impressed upon President Habibie."
"Commissioner Nielson has told me that we are doing everything in our power to provide direct aid and we shall use all possible channels."
"The problem is that it is not easy from a technical point of view and we are using all the organisations which currently have direct access, including the United Nations, the Red Cross and others."
"A second point I should mention, of which I was reminded this morning, is that the committee chaired by Mrs Ana Palacio has called on Commissioner Bolkestein to consider resigning from his position as president of the Liberal International. Commissioner Bolkestein has now done so and has instead become honorary president of that organisation."
"My third remark concerns a matter frequently raised in this House and one which I believe is in the thoughts of all Members of Parliament. I am referring to the important problem of organising measures to combat fraud."
"We have strengthened our anti-fraud campaign and shall continue to do so, but what we need is a specialised body of high-level inspectors - and this is not just a question of increasing the numbers - for I am firmly convinced that this is of crucial importance."
"As in any organisation which has grown, shall we say, more quickly than we would have liked, and has taken on new tasks, what is lacking - and the report of the five Wise Men provides an extremely useful analysis of this question - is an organisational model with the firmness and, above all, the necessary links to ensure that fraud can be prevented."
"Unfortunately the problem of fraud is on a vast scale and I can assure you that it will be the focal point of our activities, not least because these problems tend to occur where there are fewest controls, namely at the new frontiers of the European Union, the very ones which project our image to the outside world."
"Consequently, it is also a very serious problem from a political point of view."
"With reference to other matters raised, such as food safety or air-traffic control, I would remind you of what I said in my earlier speeches to Parliament."
"As this is now the fourth time I have addressed this House, I am trying to avoid boring you by repeating the same things over and over again. Let me repeat, however, that I stand by what I said in my four previous speeches, which can be taken as a single statement of position."
"Today, however, I wish to touch on a number of essential points."
"One vital issue - which everyone has mentioned - concerns transparency and openness."
"I have already stressed the importance of this issue."
"Transparency is an objective which goes beyond the mere fact of mutual openness on the part of institutions; it is the foundation, the social contract of the European institutions."
"On the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we are being asked to legislate on the question of public access to documents."
"We must seize this opportunity - and we intend to do so - to open up this sector and ensure that all institutions and not just Parliament help to define the rules, which must be rules rather than general principles with operating rules derived from them."
"With regard to certain specific documents, the problem remains, for example, of how to obtain documents just released by the Commission, which Parliament should receive before anyone else."
"This is right and proper and whenever the press asks to receive documents before Parliament, there is clearly a problem."
"I am afraid that there may be cases where the problem cannot be avoided because of procedure involved, but I am determined to ensure that it does not happen, while seeking also to speed up the information provided to Parliament."
"With this in view, we have already begun to make extensive use of electronic communications and I would also stress the Commission' s commitment to attend Parliament' s debates and discussions at plenary and committee level, since I believe that exchange of information is of the utmost importance."
"Needless to say, this is a process which we must try out together and it will not be easy to do so."
"It is one of the most delicate issues, because Parliament too needs to be fully and actively involved."
"This means better links with the Commission' s decision-making process, not only at the planning stage but also as regards information and the decisions which each Commissioner - Commissioner-designate today and confirmed Commissioner tomorrow - takes and which must be distributed in an appropriate pre-established way."
"I personally think that there are good reasons for supplying information about the Commission' s work too and, after the event, about the Minutes of Commission meetings, and we must reach precise agreement on this too."
"It has also been suggested that at least during the Strasbourg week, the agenda for plenary should include an item designed to inform Parliament about the Commission' s meeting."
"I shall devote a great deal of attention to these initiatives and I would also like a debate to be launched on the issue of confidential information."
"I consider that considerable progress has been made towards an interinstitutional agreement on this issue - I refer in particular to the discharge - and we ought to continue in this direction in the interests of mutual collaboration."
"With regard to equality of the sexes, I feel it was quite right to raise the question."
"Unfortunately, it is a gradual process - we have made some progress, for example in the cabinets and the administration. I can only assure you that it will be high on the agenda, since it is linked, as many of you have said, to other problems of equality, not only of the sexes, and in the interests of avoiding other forms of discrimination which are habitually practised in our society."
"Another series of questions dealt with the issue of assigning and modifying portfolios."
"The distribution of portfolios raises questions for me too."
"We have split the portfolios in what I myself consider to be an arbitrary way but I also think that it is the best possible distribution at the moment."
"For example, you asked - Mrs Theato asked the question a short time ago - whether it is appropriate for the budget and financial control to come under the responsibility of a single Commissioner."
"I feel that we must discuss these issues further."
"I consider the division of tasks to be sensible, decided in all good faith but on an experimental basis, and since I have the power, under the terms of Amsterdam, to redistribute these competencies, I believe I will be able to do so fairly easily."
"I am therefore devoting particular attention to the critical points; I would only ask you to put forward considered reasons so that a firm consensus decision can be reached."
"Finally, the issue of the answerability of the Commissioners and possible sanctions, a problem which hovered over the hearings and which has come up several times today in your contributions to the debate - the issue of the answerability of the Commissioners and possible sanctions to be adopted in the event of behaviour which does not meet the standards of correctness which must be observed by the Commission, as by any public institution - the issue of fraud, on the one hand, and the issue of the behaviour of the government, hence the Commission, on the other."
"I should like to make a distinction between two aspects: one is Parliament' s loss of trust in an individual Commissioner and the other the relationship with an individual Commissioner accused of criminal offences."
"I believe we must keep these two aspects separate, although they are part of the same set of problems."
"As regards Parliament' s loss of trust, I should like to remind you that each Commissioner has undertaken to resign if I ask him or her to."
"A vote of no-confidence against an individual Commissioner by the European Parliament would obviously for me be a reason for the most lengthy, serious and thorough consideration."
"When I say 'reason for the most serious and thorough consideration' what I mean exactly is that I can undoubtedly not take lightly the wishes expressed by the European Parliament."
"However, I am well aware that politics and political dispute can also have unforeseen results and we must therefore consider the subject in depth and, above all, reflect on the fact that the Treaties do not provide for the possibility of individual sanctions."
"It must therefore be a non-political move, it must be dictated by the relevant authority, not by a legal provision which at present does not exist."
"I obviously undertake to endeavour to ensure that every time this problem arises it will be tackled in the most decisive and clear terms possible."
"Finally, it is clear that in any case I will have to offer an explanation for any decision I take and I must of course offer it to Parliament."
"Now I should like to talk about the other point, that is to say, a Commissioner called upon to answer criminal charges."
"I clearly understand your message and I would say that as far as I am aware, no Commissioner in the history of the Commission has yet been called upon to answer criminal charges."
"However, I do not object to considering hypothetical situations which have not happened but can always arise."
"I must say that, in any democracy, the fact that a member of the government may be required to answer criminal charges would seriously jeopardise the possibility of his continuing to carry out the mandate of minister."
"The same applies to the European Commission and a European Commissioner."
"Today, of course, there has been much talk of criminal charges relating to acts of corruption; other types of charge, which are equally unpleasant, do exist and should be taken into account, but I think the talk has been restricted to criminal offences linked to corruption merely owing to the present context."
"However, we must not - and do not wish to - forget the existence of the rule of law, the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence."
"And let us not forget also the fact that our legal systems, which are so diverse throughout Europe, provide for different procedures between which it is often impossible to draw a meaningful comparison."
"Therefore, all issues of this nature must be approached with the utmost care, considered in good faith and then explained before Parliament."
"Situations of this kind need to be considered in depth so as to ensure that no political decisions are taken until a full and intimate knowledge of the facts at issue has been gained."
"I would therefore assure you once again that in the event of such situations arising, I would examine the facts of each case with the utmost thoroughness."
"I should like to conclude with a general comment."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo said that I would be voted in without any great enthusiasm."
"One could, of course, say that votes are votes, whether enthusiastic or not."
"But I believe it to be extremely important for a vote to be given with enthusiasm, since we are in not just any old Parliament and are about to embark on not just any old political project."
"We are heading in a wholly new direction, and one which has never been taken anywhere in the world."
"When I think about what monetary union really represents, I realise that nothing of its like has ever occurred in the past."
"When I think of these fifty war-free years in all the countries in and around the Union and of the wars outside those countries, I realise that we are not faced with something for which one can vote against one' s real wishes; we are faced with something which we must see as being a new frontier in the history of humanity."
"Will we be capable of taking up this difficult challenge? I do not know."
"What I do know is that I have attempted to do so by adopting the sort of tone appropriate to such moments: a tone of responsibility, in full awareness of the events which have occurred over the past ten months within the Commission, which needs to restore its credibility by keeping its word on each statement it makes and which cannot therefore at this present moment allow itself to make the ambitious pronouncements which are needed - and which I myself firmly believe are needed - and which we will be able to make only if we manage to elicit trust in each of the pledges we are now making."
"These pledges are, Mr Méndez, like all pledges on matters of detail, unexciting, because everyday life is not made up of important issues alone."
"But I can assure you that I am fully aware of the fact that we are faced with what I myself called 'a major project for Europe' ."
"If we do not succeed, it will obviously not take long for the grudging vote in favour to become a quite deliberate vote against."
"But it is this project which must bring us together; a project which you called for yourselves and which many of those who voted against also called for."
"All are looking for an appropriate response to the major challenges ahead; all are looking for a European project, a project for Europe, a project in which the impetus for a new Europe will be found not in the Secretariat or the Council, but in the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"This is what we intend to achieve, and I should like to thank those who have acknowledged that, despite the difficulties involved, we have put together a serious and balanced Commission."
"These are the two qualities on which I want us to base our work for the time being."
"In future, I believe that, starting with our programme in January, which is a strong programme, we shall also be able to offer you a Europe which has moved out of its period of crisis and can start building again, and which can thus be voted for not with a sense of resignation but with joy."
"Madam President, since we still have some money left, I would like to remind Mr Prodi of the earthquakes in Greece."
"I noticed that he listened with some compassion and made some notes, perhaps to remind himself to include the issue in his rejoinder."
"It is a good opportunity, now that we have time, to hear Mr Prodi' s thoughts on a matter which has scarred the whole population of a Member State of the European Union."
"Following your address this morning, Mr Alavanos, I had a long talk with Mr Kinnock about the earthquake."
"He is organising and co-ordinating the report on this subject, so I have not mentioned it now but I have taken steps in the meantime."
"Mr Kinnock told me that on Thursday he will be ready to give us an organised response on this matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if there are no more interventions, I declare our debate closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 p.m."
"(Whilst waiting for the next debate, the sitting was suspended at 4.45 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.)"
"Budget for 2000"
"The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft overall budget plan for the financial year 2000."
"The acting President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Siimes, has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today I have the great honour of presenting Parliament with the results of the meeting of the Budget Council of 16 July 1999 in Brussels."
"Firstly, I would, however, like to congratulate you all on having been elected to Parliament, and I hope that you will succeed when you take on your new tasks in your careers and lives."
"The unyielding Balkan crisis overshadowed the budgetary procedures relating to the fiscal year 2000."
"The preliminary proposal of the Commission for the year 2000 budget had scarcely been completed when it became clear that efforts would be required from Europe to repair the damage caused by the conflict in that area and, in particular, in Kosovo."
"In addition, other recent events, such as the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece and the recent development in East Timor require those having control of the budget to react swiftly."
"Efforts such as these also place huge demands on finances."
"The largest task of this budgetary procedure has been in the development of finances for the rebuilding operations in Kosovo."
"This became clear when the year 2000 budget was considered for the first time at the meeting with the parliamentary delegation on 16 July."
"On the basis of the aforementioned meeting, this matter became the most important issue of the negotiations between the parties with budgetary control in the year 2000 budget procedure."
"If the parties concerned are willing, it is however possible to find a solution which is satisfactory for both sides."
"Both bodies having budgetary control presented their views on rebuilding Kosovo at the meeting held on 16 July. The rebuilding of Kosovo, and the solution to the Kosovo question, is the central prerequisite for the success of the budgetary procedure of the fiscal year 2000."
"The results of the first Conference of Donors held on 28 July are, however, encouraging from this point of view."
"Moreover, the estimates of damage which have been specified point to the fact that a complete financial package needs to be devised."
"Similarly for its part, the Union will respond to the financial needs arising from the earthquakes in Greece and Turkey and the needs in East Timor, as I mentioned earlier."
"Next, I would like to introduce the results of the first hearing of the Council regarding the year 2000 budget, after the fruitful Conciliation Meeting arranged with the parliamentary delegation."
"Our procedure is based on the new agreement between official bodies drawn up on 6 May 1999 concerning an improvement to the budgetary procedure and discipline with regard to the budget."
"It is important to observe both the framework proposed in the new agreement between official bodies concerning expenditure, and also the detailed procedures contained within it to improve co-operation between official bodies."
"Firstly, in the autumn, under the new agreement between official bodies, the letter of amendment is examined. This relates to expenditure connected with agriculture and with the agreement on fishing, so that it is possible to take account of new estimates on the need for grants without, however, excluding a reduction in the level of grants in terms of less agricultural expenditure."
"Secondly, it has been decided to observe commitments as regards construction tasks."
"Thirdly, a clear focus is defined for the budget allocations allotted to other policies, and it is the intention to retain some flexibility within the framework of the maximum figures of the categories of the Financial Perspective."
"When we studied the preliminary draft budget in general terms and also the overall growth, we started from the assumption that in preparing the year 2000 budget, at least the same degree of discipline would be observed as in the preparation of national budgets."
"Our procedure, as regards administrative expenditure, was based for its part on the following principles: firstly, the growth of all relevant expenditures is limited, excluding unavoidable exceptions; secondly, after the possibilities for restructuring of activities have been thoroughly studied, new measures are established in a limited way for known areas and, thirdly, concerning evaluation of those measures, the procedure will not be changed or corrected for reasons of political expediency except in particularly well-founded cases."
"We also consider it appropriate to observe the approach used in approving the 1998 and 1999 budgets and to decide on the total allocations to be bestowed on small official bodies."
"In accordance with the above-mentioned principles, agreement has been reached on a number of important decisions of the expenditure category, which I will briefly introduce now."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, we followed the same discipline in our decision as we applied to other areas of the budget."
"We introduced a fixed reduction of EUR 375 million for allocations relating to marketing."
"We retained the allocations proposed for expenditure relating also to rural development and accession measures which were in the preliminary draft budget."
"The section of the budget relating to agriculture would also be based, as far as possible, on current information and, in accordance with this, the Commission will update the information for the preliminary draft budget during the autumn by means of a letter of amendment."
"We will continue to examine the expenditure associated with agriculture on the basis of that letter of amendment in order that we may be able to draw up a final decision on the matter."
"We decided, with regard to construction programmes, to reduce advance payments of commitments with regard to the new construction programmes by 3.5%in the year 2000 instead of 4% as suggested in the preliminary draft budget, which means that the payments would be reduced by EUR 1,023 million."
"This reduction is necessary in limiting the growth of payments to 2.8% as opposed to the Commission' s recommended 4.7%."
"It does not require any change of regulations nor does it reduce the reserved funds for construction which will be received by the Member States during 2000-2001."
"As regards construction work, we also take into account the request put forward by the European Parliament during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and we decided to create a new point in the budget for Community urban initiatives."
"Commitments for this would be EUR 102 million and actual payments would be around EUR 28 million."
"The commitments which we have allotted constitute one seventh of the sums agreed for the entire fiscal period."
"In discussing the expenditure associated with internal policies, we stressed that it is important to stick to those principles which form part of the discipline of the budget for the new agreement between official bodies, and part of the improvement of the budget procedure."
"We paid particular attention to the estimates of payments for possibilities of use and the size of approved programmes within the co-decision procedure."
"Commitments have also been reduced by EUR 129 million and the allocations for expenditure by approximately EUR 216 million."
"As regards the strategy promoting the accession of new Member States, we have reduced the payments by EUR 121 million."
"We considered that smaller payments were required to promote the strategy for accession, and that it did not call for funding at the levels proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget."
"As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, we determined the total administrative allocation for all official bodies, including the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Ombudsman, to be EUR 4,664 million, which means an increase of 3.6%on the allocation for 1999."
"In accordance with the view of the Council, the resources to be directed towards aid and rebuilding work in Kosovo are definitely to take priority in the draft budget."
"In the view of the Council, they may be taken from the maximum grants of the new financial framework relating to expenditure connected with external actions by redeploying those funds."
"For this reason, we decided to make a provision for rebuilding Kosovo, which contains a commitment of EUR 500 million and EUR 280 million of payments."
"This provision was made by reducing the usual grants which the Commission had allotted to other points of the budget in its preliminary draft for other external actions."
"The Council does not consider it necessary to change the upper limit of category 4 to restrict expenditure for the year 2000."
"The creation of a provision of EUR 500 million, approved by the Council, is based on the preliminary estimates of the amount required, which the Commission presented."
"In the course of time these figures may even prove to be overestimates."
"On the other hand we must be prepared to allocate funds to improve the situation in Turkey following the earthquake, as well as for the needs of the humanitarian aid required for East Timor."
"As for external actions, we decided in the Conciliation Meeting with the Parliamentary delegation on 16 July to increase commitments by EUR 7 million to EUR 40 million which the Council intended to include in the draft budget for the expenditure relating to Community foreign and defence policies."
"We approved the budget structure for the expenditure in question and your proposal relating to the nomenclature."
"I will now summarise the Council' s decisions on the effect on grants included in the draft budget."
"First of all, the commitments total EUR 92.3 billion. This is a reduction of EUR 4.5 billion or 4.7% in comparison with 1999."
"Payments total 87.9 billion, which is an increase of EUR 2.3 billion or 2.8% in comparison to the budget for 1999."
"As a second point, the total sum of payments corresponds to 1.09%of the Community' s gross domestic product."
"Thirdly, the upper limits for external actions and internal policies leave latitude to the tune of EUR 222 million and EUR 22.5 million below the maximum sums of the Financial Perspective."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those members of the delegation from the European Parliament who took part in the discussions of the Budget Council held on 16 July, and also all of those people who are no longer Members of Parliament."
"In addition, I await with interest the continuation of co-operation with the present Parliament, and in particular with Terence Wynn, who I would like to congratulate on being selected as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"I also look forward with interest to a continuation of co-operation with both rapporteurs responsible for the fiscal year 2000, Jean-Louis Bourlanges and Kyösti Virrankoski."
"Our common aim is to secure the successful outcome of the year 2000 budgetary procedure, a task which our official bodies have been capable of carrying out in previous years."
"The successful co-operation of those having control of the budget is based on mutual trust."
"For this reason I hope that both budgetary powers will stick to the these issues for which a consensus was reached in the unofficial trialogue held last week, and that supplementary budget 4/99 can be approved as it is without amendments or delays arising from any amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to express my perplexity and to say that this Parliament is being presented with the budget of the outgoing Commission before we have elected the new one."
"I believe that, within the context of turning the European Parliament into a genuine parliament, we are doing something that never ever happens in State institutions."
"It is the incoming government - which won the elections - which presents the budget and it makes no sense that the Commission that has resigned now obliges us to debate a budget which, in any event, has been initially drawn up by it."
"I say this in the context of European construction."
"Mr Prodi, you have said that you want the Commission to be a genuine European government and Mr Poettering, Chairman of the main political group in this Parliament, has even spoken of this role for Parliament in relation to the Commission."
"I wish to add - and I am sorry to cause any Member uneasiness - that the new Members like myself have felt most uneasy because we are dealing with amendments to a budget which we did not know and approving amendments to a budget which has still not been presented."
"It is an absurd situation and I believe that - although I do not want to request any measures at the moment - legal measures will be required in the near future."
"Sir, I think your question can be answered quite simply."
"The budget procedure for the financial year 2000 does not in fact begin today. Instead, we have already previously had a debate on the subject in this Parliament."
"At that time, the Council had been dealing with the matter, and we are now about to discuss what the results of the Council's recommendations are. Now, it is quite simple."
"We have a Commission which is still in office and of which Mr Liikanen is a member, responsible for the budget."
"The new Commission only takes office when we as a Parliament tomorrow approve its appointment and after the Commissioners, at 12.00 p.m. on Thursday in Luxembourg, have taken their oath of office before the European Court of Justice."
"From that time on, Mrs Schreyer is responsible."
"Until then, Mr Liikanen is responsible, and that is why he now also takes the floor."
"Mr President, the sooner this transition period is over, the better for all of us: as soon as Parliament has confirmed the new Commission, competences can be transferred to the new Commissioners."
"Firstly, I wish to state very briefly that the budget is a legal obligation of the Commission under the Treaty."
"The Commission-in-office must handle the budget - it has no choice but to do so."
"I have only very few comments regarding the draft budget adopted by the Council: it proposes a cut of EUR 430 million in commitments and EUR 1.7 billion in payments."
"While these cuts are quite normal at this stage of the budget procedure, they are this year supplemented by a substantial redeployment of EUR 430 million in category 4 - external actions - to finance the Kosovo reconstruction of EUR 500 million."
"Although redeployment appears necessary to finance this new priority, one must take account of the fact that too great a redeployment risks destabilizing the budgetary and political balance in external relations."
"Redeployment should be the main source of financing of the Kosovo action but it may have to be supplemented by other means."
"As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, the new Commission will come back at the end of October with new forecasts in its now traditional letter of amendment which has been agreed by the institutions."
"I take note of the Council' s overall concern to improve the situation of the outstanding commitments by following most of the Commission' s requests."
"In category 2 - structural actions - where payments can be reduced due to the proposal to adapt the payment on account from 4 to 3.5%: this can be done without major difficulties."
"Finally, however, I would like to draw your attention to an important inconsistency in the Council' s decision."
"The Council proposes to increase the Commission' s administrative expenditure by only 0.9% while it foresees an increase of 3.5% for the other institutions."
"The Council has achieved its reduction by assuming that the Commission would increase the number of vacant posts and thus realise important savings."
"This aim goes against what the European Parliament has wanted for many years and what the Commission has undertaken to do, namely to reduce the number of vacant posts."
"All in all, the key to success in this year' s budgetary procedure is the financing of the EUR 430 million needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo and of Turkey following the earthquake."
"I am sure that the new Commission will look into this matter as one of the first priorities and come forward with a balanced proposal."
"Mr President, can I just make a point to our colleague at the back who came in on a point of order, which was not actually a point of order but a criticism."
"On this occasion the Commission is not presenting anything - it is the Council which is presenting its draft budget."
"And on an occasion like this the Commission is not necessarily the enemy - in fact it is quite a friend."
"The opposition is these people here!"
"Let us not lose sight of the fact that a budget has been presented to us today."
"That is no condemnation of the President-in-Office, for whom I have great regard."
"Also Mr President, as you said, this process has gone on for several months."
"A lot of people have been involved and a lot of hard work has gone into it."
"I want to name two people who have been very much involved."
"One is Mr Samland, the previous Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who left Parliament at the end of the last mandate."
"He worked tirelessly right up to the end to make sure that we could get the cooperation between the Council and Parliament that we need to get the budget we all want in the year 2000."
"The other person I want to thank is Mr Liikanen."
"As Commissioner - or Commissioner-designate - this is probably the last time you will sit here on a budgets issue."
"We have not clashed over the last few years but have had opportunities to try and solve a lot of problems."
"You deserve the praise of this Parliament for the work you have done in the budgetary areas and especially in some of the areas where you have tried to change things within the Commission."
"I should like to wish you well for the future."
"Mr President, that has got the nice bits out of the way."
"Let us now get down to the budget."
"Let us not get this debate mixed up with tomorrow' s debate on the supplementary and amending budgets 1, 3 and 4 for 1999 because, when the President-in-Office says that this spirit of cooperation is based on mutual trust (that is what I wrote down) between the institutions, I only have to remind the Council of what it did with supplementary and amending budgets 1 and 3 and our reaction to it."
"That had nothing to do with a spirit of cooperation and it certainly did not breed mutual trust."
"I am reminded of a story I once told Mr Liikanen."
"Mrs Dührkop, when she was the rapporteur, likened the harmonious relationships to a symphony being played on a grand piano."
"It reminded me of a famous comedy duo in the UK - Morecombe and Wise - where Eric Morecombe was playing a grand piano and making an awful noise and André Previn said to him ""You' re playing all the wrong notes"" , to which he replied ""I' m playing all the right notes, not necessarily in the right order"" ."
"We have to get the right notes between the Council and the Parliament playing in the right order if we are to have this harmonious relationship."
"Madam President-in-Office, you reminded us of those areas where we did get agreement in the trialogues, about the letters of amendment in the autumn, about the commitment appropriations in the Structural Funds and about what our clear priorities should be."
"You also said that the budget should have the same discipline as national budgets."
"We have always considered that this Parliament' s Committee on Budgets and Parliament itself are extremely prudent."
"They do not go out of their way to make problems in the budget or to waste taxpayers' money."
"Our problems are caused in the main in Member States, where 85% of EU money is actually administered and 85% of our problems occur."
"If we had more cooperation with the Member States we would not have as many problems."
"Also, there are many Member States' national budgets which are running deficits."
"That is one thing we cannot do."
"On the different categories, on Category 1 I would agree with the President-in-Office when she said that agricultural expenditure should be based on up-to-date facts."
"That is why we agreed on an ad hoc procedure; that is why we agreed on the letter of amendment in the autumn."
"But for the life of me I cannot see why you have actually made cuts in Category 1."
"If we are waiting to find out what the latest situation is, why have we made reductions in Category 1 already?"
"It just seems to be an exercise of taking money out of the system because that is the thing to do to please the Member States."
"As for Category 2, we may have the commitment on commitment appropriations but we certainly do not have the same understanding when it comes to payments."
"Taking EUR 1billion from payments, once again, is just a burden for the future."
"The Member States have to pay some time."
"It is no use trying to dodge the fact or hide it away."
"It will not go away."
"That money has to be paid for sometime."
"We would argue that now is the right time and that decision should not be delayed."
"Looking at the reductions made in Category 3, there are many areas where we will disagree and agree to disagree."
"In Category 4, the 10% across the board cut - I am now speaking for Parliament before it has decided this - I would assume is absolutely unacceptable."
"Yes, Kosovo is a priority; yes, we do want to make sure that funds are available for East Timor and earthquake victims in Turkey."
"But the way to do that is by a revision of the financial perspective."
"That will be our position, I am sure."
"Yes, we want a solution."
"We do not want confrontation between our two bodies but at the end of the day we want to make sure that development, other sections of Category 4 and external expenditure are not disadvantaged."
"If money cannot be spent then we will look at those areas where it may have to be reduced."
"But a 10% across the board cut is not the way to do it."
"On Category 5, the sad part is that we still see no solutions being proposed by the Council on how to solve the problem of pensions within the institutions."
"I am sure my colleagues Mr Bourlanges and Mr Virrankoski will add to my comments."
"We look forward to our first reading next month when the Council will get a pretty good idea of our opinion of its draft budget."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to express my agreement with Chairman Wynn' s words on the timely nature of this debate."
"This is a debate taking place between the Council and Parliament."
"As far as I know, the Council-in-Office is not currently involved with the appointment procedures."
"I think that this is a shame, because I would have been delighted to appoint Mrs Siimes."
"But this is not our role."
"Tomorrow we will be appointing the incoming Commission."
"I am also delighted to have this last opportunity to deal with Mr Liikanen in his present role, before the metamorphosis which will have taken him, the day after tomorrow to a new post."
"I would like to take the opportunity this debate has given to me to say that although our exchanges have sometimes been rather harsh, we have always appreciated the talent, seriousness and the extremely open and cordial nature which have characterised the way we have worked together."
"Basically, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that the Commission' s draft budget did not really impress us, and that we are disappointed with the Council' s budget proposal."
"The reason this draft failed to impress us is that it was brought in at a time when the Commission was not really in a position to make sound financial forecasts."
"This made its work appear somewhat unreal, particularly because it could not, and with good reason, absorb the crisis in Kosovo and its financial consequence and, finally, for reasons which do not strike us as being particularly satisfactory, because it refused to respond to the concerns expressed by Parliament on the issue of administrative reform. In our budgetary advice, we had asked for a progressive dismantling of the TAOs."
"In our budgetary advice, we asked for a detailed evaluation of personnel requirements and of the capacity to act that the Commission thought it had with its current staffing level."
"We did not find you to be particularly enthusiastic on these two points."
"We were disappointed Madam President, I shall not pretend otherwise, with the Council Budget."
"We found category 1 disappointing."
"We still do not understand why, for what purpose, with obligatory expenditure, you are enforcing massive reductions across the board."
"The argument given to us by certain representatives, according to which this is due to the changing monetary situation, seems to us, I must remind you, to be contrary or opposed to the very precise rules of our financial regulations."
"Nor do we understand why, in category 2, you have reduced payment credits even though there might be several technical justifications for them."
"In category 3, we can see clearly that although you may have performed a good job for the large programmes, which means all those which stopped at the co-decision stage, everything that concerns Parliament directly and specifically, on the other hand, you have sacrificed."
"You defend what is ours, you defend what belongs to both of us, but what belongs to us alone, you hold in contempt."
"In category 4, you know the extent of the problem."
"You have tried to fit into this category a whole range of problems which do not fit: the ""fishing"" agreement on Morocco, and especially the enormous funds, estimated to stand at around 500 million for Kosovo, and that is without expanding the category any further."
"The result of this is that your proposal would be, as we say, robbing Peter to pay Paul - to sacrifice the priorities established by yesterday' s legislative and budgetary authorities for the sake of tomorrow' s priorities."
"We do not feel that this is a good policy."
"In category 5, finally, we note a great reluctance to tackle the problem of pensions."
"We consider this to be a serious matter."
"We would also like to see a little more solidarity in supporting the much-needed changes to the Commission' s administrative structures."
"I think that, to sum up our complaint about your budget proposal, you seem to be simultaneously insulting the past, the present, and the future."
"You are insulting the past, for the reasons I have just mentioned."
"As soon as you think that tomorrow' s priorities should be financed by sacrificing hitherto accepted priorities, you are acting unacceptably."
"We know, and you were quite right to remind us, that the Commission will have greater responsibilities in terms of foreign policy."
"It must fulfil these responsibilities."
"You are insulting the present, because you are making no provision for the efforts necessary for credit payments."
"You are insulting the future finally; by the way you are ignoring or treating indifferently the high stakes which await us in the areas of administrative reform and retirement."
"So we will be having a constructive dialogue, Madam President."
"I have confidence in your ability to co-operate."
"But I want you to know that our dialogue will be difficult."
"We will not accept the interinstitutional agreement that we signed and ratified becoming a yoke around our neck."
"Co-operation, yes. The sacrifice of the European Union' s fundamental priorities, no."
"We will certainly ask you for a revision of the Financial Perspective whenever this proves necessary."
"Mr President, before I start I want to welcome you, honourable Minister, to the European Parliament and to its plenary part-session."
"At the same time I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen especially for his valuable co-operation."
"Your work with Parliament has been transparent, decent and honest."
"My own maiden task relates to the administrative course of the year 2000 budget, which affects more institutions than the Commission and the Council."
"The combined budget for these institutions is EUR 1,288 million."
"This is a 3.66% increase on last year' s budget."
"The addition is remarkably large though it is within the framework of the currently valid agreement between official bodies."
"The budget of the European Parliament does exceed the share agreed by Parliament itself in accordance with the gentleman' s agreement, which is 20% of category 5, because it currently stands at 20.3%."
"This naturally means that some pressure for cuts is directed at Parliament' s budget in the hearing."
"Recently, the European Parliament has observed great discipline in budgetary policy."
"In the staffing policy of the official bodies, great moderation has been observed, which meant that staff increases were less than in the previous five-year period."
"Between 1995 and 1999, Parliament' s staff increased by eleven people, and likewise, the staff of the Court of Justice increased by eleven people."
"The Court of Auditors received a considerable increase in resources in 1997, and it grew to have a total staff of 49 officials."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as the Committee on Regional Policy increased their staff by ten people."
"This has been achieved by employing a deliberate staff policy and by redeployment of tasks."
"We therefore have a good inheritance which we should cherish."
"Now a change is threatening this development, in which the EU is attempting to save taxpayers' money."
"Different institutions are aiming to gain substantial increases in the number of posts."
"In connection with this, it must be stressed that the European Parliament is an important example."
"If the European Parliament attempts to increase its own staff considerably, this is a clear signal to other institutions."
"The same can be said concerning the promotion of grades."
"For this reason, the European Parliament has to create alignment in this budget hearing concerning the budgets for the next few years."
"Now it must be decided what kind of disciplined staffing policy the European Parliament wishes to follow, because it has quite a lot of authority in this matter."
"I want to stress that in leading the way for the other EU institutions, the European Parliament cannot evade its responsibility in this matter."
"My predecessor in this post, Edith Müller, drew attention to activity-based budgeting."
"Put concisely, Parliament directs money to official bodies for administration as a lump sum, and each official body can itself decide on the basis of its own unique organisation about the salary grades to be imposed and increases in those grades."
"I support this idea fully."
"The fact of the matter is that activity-based budgeting is the only sensible way of developing administration of staffing in the different institutions."
"It is not particularly sensible that the Committee on Budgetary Control and the President of the Council discuss the establishment of one C-grade when there are 1,776 C-grades in Parliament."
"It is much better to discuss allocations and grant them without analysing them in minute detail."
"This point of view also accords with the report from the Group of Independent Experts."
"It emphasises the need for personal responsibility as well as economic responsibility at lower levels of the official machinery."
"The only means of stressing this responsibility for improving the administration as well as for improving the supervision of the financial management is to delegate this power and responsibility to lower levels."
"At the same time, we must improve one urgent problem in particular, namely the slow payment transactions of the EU."
"It is incongruous and objectionable that the EU needs longer payment times than Member States or enterprises whose budgets can be many times the size of the EU budget when compared."
"The development of staffing policy must be regarded as an important part of EU policy."
"Activity based budgeting, the division of allocations and responsibility amongst lower levels of the administrative machinery, an efficient monitoring of monetary transactions as well as emphasising personal responsibility still require a lot of work."
"These issues must be clearly borne in mind when staffing legislation is reformed in the next few years."
"Therefore, and for this reason, it is possible to strongly agree with the Council' s demand that the Commission must set about preparing new regulations on staffing."
"With these thoughts in mind, I would like to consign the Council' s budget proposal to a reading in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask the Minister if it has been thought to include the International Monetary Fund in these discussions about financial resources for East Timor, Turkey and Kosovo so that we do not have to bear the burden alone."
"Mr President, this point of view on the inclusion of the International Monetary Fund is the kind of matter which the Council itself must study for its part."
"In general, when assistance is the matter under consideration, it would be a good idea for all of the parties concerned who are, in one way or another, dependent on currents of money flowing in some direction, to assemble around the same table."
"Thank you, Minister."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.53 p.m.)"
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the sad duty of informing you of the death of the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, Yannos Kranidiotis, in an accident, and also that of five other people who were accompanying him, including his 23-year-old son."
"The Minister was on an official mission."
"He was travelling with 12 other people to Bucharest when his plane lost altitude and dropped from 25,000 feet to 3,000 feet without crashing, finally coming to land at the airport in Bucharest."
"Some of you will certainly recall that Yannos Kranidiotis was a Member of the European Parliament between January 1995 and February 1997, when he was appointed as a Minister in the Greek Government, and you will remember that he was, within our Parliament, a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, as well as being the Vice-President of the joint European Union/Cyprus delegation."
"Many of us have memories of our late colleague."
"I shall say that he was greatly appreciated for his qualities as a human being and for his competence in the field of European politics."
"I propose that we observe a minute' s silence in his memory."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, first of all, I must express my appreciation, on behalf of my group, for the tribute which has been paid to the memory of Mr Kranidiotis."
"But I had requested the floor in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure to make an intervention for personal reasons, concerning the accusations made against me yesterday by Mr Galeote during the debate on the investiture of President Prodi."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, this is the appropriate moment in the proceedings."
"As I cannot see Mr Galeote in the Chamber, I leave it to your discretion as to whether I speak now or when he is present."
"I think, Mr Barón Crespo, that the Rules of Procedure envisage that you should make your statement now as a personal statement, even if Mr Galeote Quecedo is not present."
"He will be able to read of it in the Minutes."
"Madam President, Mr Galeote made an intervention which was inappropriate on the grounds that we were not carrying out a motion of censure against myself but rather a debate on the investiture of Mr Prodi, and he criticised my comments about Mrs de Palacio."
"As I have here the text of my intervention, I confirm what I said yesterday."
"I said that we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission despite the reservations which we have in relation to Mrs de Palacio, whose innocence we accept, but whose idea of political responsibility in a matter which concerns the Community budget we do not share."
"Let us hope that, as Vice-President, she offers more trustworthy information than she gave on her exoneration by the Congress of Deputies, since the debate in the plenum of that Congress will not take place until next Thursday."
"This is what I said yesterday and I stand by it."
"And, as he accused me of dishonesty, all I want to say at the moment is that, in accordance with the principles and indications of President Prodi in relation to the responsibility of Commissioners, I believe that, if today this Parliament approves the political resolution, with the consensus of all the groups, on the new Commission, Mr Galeote will find himself part of an Assembly of dishonest people."
"We shall now return to the Minutes, if you don' t mind."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, this is just to say that in the vote on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure I am listed as having voted against whereas in fact I voted in favour."
"The fact is, I was late and I voted in the place of Mr Pasqua."
"I guess that explains why the machine resisted my intentions."
"But I did point it out immediately afterwards."
"Mr Bourlanges, this correction has already been included in the Minutes: ""Mr Bourlanges indicated that he had intended to vote in favour."""
"But you have just managed to advertise your intentions a little more."
"Madam President, I have also had a problem with the machine."
"In yesterday' s Minutes, on the question of the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, it appears that I did not vote."
"I was obviously here and I do not know whether the machine worked."
"I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes."
"Very well, Mrs Palacio, we take note of this."
"Madam President, after the few small criticisms which I have had to make, may I use this opportunity to express my gratitude and praise the support services."
"In today 's Minutes, the remarks I made are correctly reported, in fact almost more correctly than I spoke them myself."
"We appreciate your compliments, Mr Posselt."
"Madam President, the Minutes give Mrs Stenzel as the member of the ACP delegation from the delegation of Austrian Members."
"However, Mrs Stenzel has nominated me, and I would like to request that this is corrected."
"Thank you, Mr Rack."
"I see that Mrs Stenzel agrees."
"We will amend this."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, may I remind all those present, and yourself, that in this week 55 years ago a forgotten concentration camp, located in our immediate vicinity here, was liberated."
"The Natzwiller-Struthof Camp was one of the most gruesome of the Nazi camps, where thousands of people met their death due to medical experiments."
"It also contained one of the few gas chambers not located in the large extermination camps of Eastern Europe."
"I would therefore like to ask whether it would be possible for Parliament to have a plaque made."
"Secondly, I would like to suggest that we send a delegation there on the occasion of the next anniversary of its liberation."
"Mr Sichrovsky, I think you might make this proposal in writing, according to the Rules of Procedure, and we would then see what the best follow up might be."
"Preparatory work for the European Council meeting in Tampere"
"The next item is the statements of the President of the Council - I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Halonen - and the Commission on the preliminary work for the meeting of the European Council on 15 and 16 October in Tampere."
"Madam President, you have already expressed our jointly felt sadness regarding the aircrash and the Greek delegation, but I would still like to say how overcome with grief I was today when I heard of the death of my good friend and colleague and that of other Greek citizens."
"I would ask you to pass these sentiments on."
"I would like to thank you for the honour I have today of speaking to you on the subject of the agenda and the preparatory work relating to the forthcoming Extraordinary European Council meeting."
"At the European Council meeting in Tampere, we wish to take the next big step towards a Union that will provide for the people who live within its borders an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This is a logical and inevitable step in the Union' s development."
"We have built a single market in which people, goods, services and capital may circulate freely."
"We are in the process of adopting a common currency, which will add to the benefit of us all."
"Next, we must guarantee each and every person living in the Union area the genuine right to freedom of movement and, at the same time, the right to security everywhere in the Union area."
"In this respect the Union must, in compliance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, eventually become one united area in which people and business players can enjoy to the full the rights that are theirs."
"At Tampere, we must agree future policy guidelines for co-operation, commit to certain jointly agreed concrete action, and ensure that restrictions imposed by the Pillars do not constitute a barrier to the effective action we wish to see."
"Up till now, the greatest successes of the Union have been based on the adoption of the Community method."
"It last showed its strength in the creation of the single market."
"It may also be feasible to use it now."
"Legislation in Member States must be brought closer in a spirit of impartiality, and harmonised; we have to create common minimum provisions and apply the principle of mutual recognition."
"Above all, I believe that we can achieve a good deal of co-operation by removing the technical, administrative and legal barriers that prejudice it."
"In mentioning this latter area, my comment might sound lightweight, but in practice, it is just that barrier that we have to overcome."
"I myself sincerely believe that if we were to ask the citizens of the Member States what they wished to see, it would be that they expect the Union to become more effective and determined in their resolve to reinforce their rights and strengthen their security."
"Increasing internal security will require a more obviously standardised and consistent policy than exists at present, and that is also true of the Union' s external relations."
"The methods used in legal and home affairs policy as well as foreign and security policy, in the same way as with commercial and development co-operation policy, must be made more uniform so that our citizens may be assured of a secure environment in these respects also."
"I would also like to remind everyone that the Union will be growing in the near future."
"We must keep it very clear in our minds that this geographical area we call the Union will be expanding over the following years."
"Co-operation in the area of internal affairs and legal matters must be developed with the applicant countries so that together we can achieve the goals we have set for Union policy."
"External relations have to be examined as a whole, with the neighbouring regions to the north, east and south having an equal share in the policy."
"Before I go into the details of the Tampere agenda, may I be so bold, although I am at a sitting of the European Parliament, as to remind everyone that, happily, we are not alone in Europe."
"For purposes of co-operation, we can also rely on the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which have meritorious traditions and can offer much expertise in this matter."
"I hope we can bear them too in mind in developing the co-operation I have referred to."
"It is my intention today to inform you of the agenda and preparatory work relating to the European Council meeting in Tampere."
"Before anything else, I would like to outline some of the main aims of the Presidency before the meeting takes place."
"At the same time, I hope your ideas will inspire me in further preparation for the meeting, since we still have that opportunity."
"Firstly then, the Tampere agenda: the European Council meeting in Tampere will focus on three main issues, namely immigration and asylum policy, tackling cross-border crime, and a European judicial area."
"Clearer goals than those that existed earlier for justice and home affairs were created with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The decision-making procedures available to us and the legislative instruments to be used are now more effective and the Community institutions are in a stronger position."
"The position of the Presidency is that the new instruments now have to be made full use of."
"The European Council at Vienna last December furnished us with an excellent plan of action which sets out our work timetable for the near future."
"There is no need, then, to draft a new plan of action at Tampere."
"We are hoping that the Tampere meeting will produce policies and commitments, the necessity for which our citizens in the various countries can also understand."
"We shall pay special attention throughout to human rights and transparency, which are an essential part of the foundations of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I might point out that everyone living within the territory of the Union must enjoy human rights, without discrimination."
"Apart from that, I want to make the point that when we respect the rights of minorities, we not only respect their human rights and dignity but, at the same time, we also increase the stability of our society and, hence, the security of all our citizens."
"Then I would like to speak in rather more detail about immigration and asylum policy which, as I am aware, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice have already given an account of here."
"In my opinion, all who reside or who are hoping to reside in the Union area have a right to security."
"A key aim of the European Council meeting in Tampere should be an agreement to create for the Union a common policy on immigration and asylum."
"At Tampere, we should achieve consensus on the creation of a European asylum system based on common principles."
"And what, then, should it be based on?"
"It should be mainly based on the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and Article 63 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The aim is to offer a high level of protection, common to all countries as far as is possible, to those who need it."
"Our goal must be a single European asylum area, which observes common minimum provisions and procedures."
"In this way, the system will be simpler, clearer and quicker, which is good as far as human beings are concerned."
"At the same time, obviously, we must the whole time ensure that this cannot lead to situations that compromise human rights."
"We must remember that the right to asylum is an individual right."
"The crisis in Kosovo showed that it is high time the Union agreed, inter alia, the divisions of responsibility and principles to follow in times of temporary protection."
"The Union must be ready to offer swift protection in mass evacuation situations."
"The offer of temporary protection relies on the will to be protected and the will and ability on the part of the recipient state to take responsibility."
"I believe that we shall achieve results in this respect at Tampere."
"For me, it seems natural that in mass evacuation situations, Community funds could be used and other Community joint financing measures could be taken to provide economic compensation."
"In this way, solidarity among the Member States would come about in a more natural way."
"Secondly, the basis for allowing immigration and the prevention of illegal immigration must be standardised."
"The rights and obligations of foreigners legally resident in the Member States of the Union must be safeguarded in a more standardised way."
"For me it would be quite conceivable that the rights of someone who has immigrated into a country should be closer to those of the citizens of that country after that person has lived there legally for a certain period of time."
"It would certainly be most important for a migrant to find out, for example, about social services and his or her rights in respect of political activity."
"There is experience of this in certain countries that we can draw on."
"Next, I would like to speak of the Union' s external border controls."
"As this also concerns the country holding the Presidency, we have obviously given consideration to this matter before."
"The Union' s external border controls must be developed so that it becomes better balanced and more standardised, in compliance with the Schengen measures."
"With the next phase of enlargement, the external borders of the Union will once again alter, and the importance of viable surveillance will grow both as far as the security of the public and freedom of movement are concerned."
"It is most important to focus on action to prevent illegal immigration without jeopardising any further the institution of asylum, for example."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam provides new opportunities for planning a policy of repatriation."
"In my opinion, we must take full advantage of these new opportunities."
"At Tampere, we could come to an agreement that Community and other agreements should consistently contain clauses relating to repatriation."
"In certain cases, the Union should aim to initiate negotiations leading to multilateral agreements on repatriation."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam also calls for provisions to be drafted among the Member States of the Community on the subject of repatriation."
"The Union must also actively support those who are willing to return to their land of origin."
"In this connection, we must investigate the means available to us."
"I shall give just one example: the use of development aid could be one way of easing the repatriation process."
"The Union' s immigration and asylum policy must form a properly integrated part of our current, more standardised foreign relations policy."
"We must turn our attention to the conditions prevailing in the most significant countries migrants and those seeking asylum are departing from, conditions that induce or even force them to leave their homeland."
"The Union could try to influence the situation by means of various arrangements for co-operation in the areas of foreign and security policy, development co-operation, economic co-operation and migration policy."
"The Union must also show greater capacity for responding to different crisis situations."
"A report by a top-level working party in the Council, which discussed this issue in full, will be distributed, with its various annexes according to country, to Parliament in the next few days."
"Now I will turn to the issue of tackling cross-border crime."
"The creation of an area of security, where justice prevails, will only be possible if those who abuse its freedoms are brought to justice. We have to remove the technical, administrative and legislative barriers that hamper co-operation among the authorities."
"One real development, which I think could well be raised at Tampere, would be to come to an agreement making it possible to make use of international investigatory teams."
"The police authorities should be given powers to act in cross-border co-operation with the relevant national authorities to resolve any given case."
"Europol is an important tool in this sort of co-operation."
"It must be given the resources it needs to commence operations, and, furthermore, the necessary political support."
"After that, more thorough consideration must be given to the expansion of its operation."
"At Tampere Europol' s field of operation should first be expanded to cover crime relating to money laundering."
"Secondly, the European Council could charge the Council with embarking on the drafting of legislation that would oblige Member States to respond to requests from Europol for investigation and assistance."
"The extension of powers for Europol I hope for must be reinforced by means of legal and political monitoring of the operation."
"These must be equally balanced."
"I also hope that the time is ripe to identify the existence of those types of crime for which more harmonised criminal legislation among the Member States would result in more effective intervention on our part."
"I do not wish to appear too ambitious in these matters."
"I know that it would take any amount of hard work, but I shall list those matters that are of most importance."
"At the European Council meeting in Tampere, we could identify, for example, the following areas as taking priority: the trade in women and children, child pornography, money laundering, making counterfeit euro notes, and safeguarding new, cross-border technology."
"In fighting crime, we must strive for its prevention."
"We have to prevent opportunities for crime and we must make it harder and less tempting to commit crime."
"The aim is obviously to reduce in particular the risk of young people committing crime."
"In this way, we safeguard our future."
"We must pay special attention to the status of the victims of crime and those suspected or accused of crime."
"I want to emphasise that it is necessary to work in each of these areas."
"At Tampere, we should be able to reach a decision on the drafting of a programme of co-operation at Union level to help the victims of crime."
"The rights of victims should be protected in such a way as to guarantee them equal status irrespective of Member State, nationality or language."
"At Tampere, our Heads of State and Government could also ask the Commission for a proposal on a system which would guarantee, inter alia, adequate interpretation facilities and legal aid for those suspected or accused of crimes in different Member States."
"I hope that you will not think I am taking up too much time on these issues;"
"I admit I am a former Minister for Justice, although here and now I appear in my capacity as Foreign Minister."
"Next, I wish to speak of a European judicial area."
"When we discuss the development of co-operation relating to matters of law and internal matters, the main emphasis is perhaps too readily placed on action in connection with security."
"However, it is at least as important to consider how we may improve the situation with respect to human rights in the European Union."
"The creation of the single market and the adoption of the euro have increased dealings among people in many ways."
"The consequences of this new internationalism are plainly visible."
"There are more and more marriages between people of different countries and, similarly, people work and study abroad, buy and sell goods and services abroad, and invest or borrow money in countries other than their own."
"This has become a part of normal everyday life."
"Owing to the different legal, administrative and technical barriers that exist, it is, however, still unduly difficult to make full use of one' s rights."
"We know that the barriers are in certain respects very much due to the differences that exist in national legal systems."
"We also know that in this Union area there are northern, southern and common law systems of jurisdiction, so I do not by any means underestimate the difficulties."
"We are still a long way from being a single European area, although we speak of issues that directly concern the everyday existence of human beings."
"The creation of a European judicial area will be, however, one of the most important challenges for the Union in the next few years."
"Our citizens must be able to put their trust in the workability of legal and administrative systems and the adequacy of legal protection, irrespective of whereabouts in the Union they are travelling or are resident."
"The aim must be to safeguard the fair treatment of our citizens, promote the establishment at national level of less complex institutions for resolving disputes, and ensure basic legal protection."
"Firstly, people must, without undue difficulty, be able to discover what factors mainly affect their legal status."
"They must also have adequate scope for making their rights a practical reality."
"This is a matter for both the legal and the administrative authorities."
"Procedures must not be too slow, complicated or expensive."
"People should be able to take full advantage of existing information technology."
"Heads of State and Government could give their support to a scheme whereby the Union starts to discover how access to legal aid in the various Member States might be made easier and could promote the establishment at national level of less complex institutions for resolving disputes."
"I think Member States should adopt a constructive stance in recognising decisions and judgements made by the authorities in other Member States."
"All of us involved in politics know very well how difficult this sometimes is, and the sort of publicity it leads to."
"We must be able to recognise court judgements and decisions made by the authorities throughout the Union area."
"This would save people from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive costs, and would show that we have confidence in the legal systems of others."
"I would like to remind you all that we have already made significant progress in certain areas (for example, the amendments to the Treaty of Brussels and the Lugano Convention)."
"Government leaders at Tampere could thus commit to a situation that is now making consistent progress."
"Neither should we fear the harmonisation of civil and criminal law, or at least investigating the possibility of it."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam opens up new opportunities in this area for both procedural and substantive law."
"We could have common minimum provisions for certain matters concerning, for example, the admissibility of evidence, legal aid and other aspects of court procedure in cases that transcend borders."
"Then, dare I say it, we could also investigate in what areas of the law of property, contract law and even family law we could make progress in."
"This would increase legal security."
"I know that the law is only an extension of culture."
"There are obviously enormous cultural differences within the area, but nothing should prevent us from exploring possibilities for making people' s everyday existence easier."
"I have spoken very clearly in favour of closer co-operation and the harmonisation of legislation."
"I would like to state just as emphatically that this must not lead to a situation in which we would be bartering away the hallmarks of our various cultures."
"On the contrary, as I said, a legal system is part of a culture; it reflects each country' s own particular culture."
"In a certain way, we must appreciate and respect that."
"Nevertheless, I would also like to remind everyone that we have agreed certain common principles, which we can bring to all our Member States."
"At Tampere, we shall also decide upon the implementation of the decisions taken on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The discussion of the contents of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will, however, take place elsewhere, that is to say by the preparatory body established in respect of the Charter, and in which the European Parliament too will have an important role to play."
"An immediate project to reinforce human rights also constitutes an enforcement of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union."
"That Article obliges the Community to commence action to counter discrimination."
"I shall expect initiatives from the Commission regarding the implementation of this aim, which should be achieved as quickly as possible."
"Chancellor Schröder and the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, sent a jointly signed letter to their colleagues in March, since which time we have been collecting ideas from Member States drafted in their capital cities on the meeting' s agenda, its aims and its main areas of focus."
"The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs whom you have heard speak here, begin their talks on the same subject tomorrow in Turku."
"We shall make a final decision on the Tampere agenda only when the viewpoints of other bodies have also been heard, which the Prime Minister will hear when he makes his tour of capitals at the end of the month."
"In preparatory work for the meeting, we are also making use of, inter alia, the results of the work of a top-level working party on asylum and immigration and the viewpoints of the European Parliament."
"We are also working in co-operation with the UN."
"The UNHCR and numerous NGOs have made an important contribution."
"I believe that you would like to know what my view is of the participation on the part of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has now had a significant impact on the outcome of the Tampere agenda."
"The Finnish Minister for Justice and Minister for Home Affairs attended the Inter-Parliamentary Conference organised for 24 and 25 March this year by the European Parliament on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"They also debated the issue with the Committee on Parliamentary Affairs at the beginning of September."
"I can assure you now that our discussions today will play an important part too."
"I shall convey your views to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Home Affairs who can then take account of them in their own talks."
"The meeting at Tampere we shall organise ourselves in compliance with the conventions established for European Councils."
"The meeting will start with a speech by the President of the European Parliament."
"Many NGOs and the media have long held the view that, whenever we speak of matters of law or internal affairs, we in the Union remain rather secretive."
"We now have to rid ourselves of this image."
"We are taking decisions that will directly impact on the lives of our citizens."
"Then it is a matter of democracy that decisions are taken openly and even if their subject matter is fiercely debated, everyone should be aware of it."
"I am quite ready to discuss this issue here."
"I promise to listen closely to you and reply to your questions to the best of my ability."
"I believe that we shall reach consensus on most issues."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Heads of State and Government took the initiative almost a year ago to call an Extraordinary European Council meeting which would be principally dedicated to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This is therefore an act of great importance which will guide the activities of the Union during the coming years."
"In this context, it is important that the European Parliament, whose activity during this last year has been considerable, ensures that its voice is heard after the resolution adopted in its April plenary part-session which established the political framework which is now required."
"The resolution on what we are debating today, furthermore, will have the advantage that it will be adopted on time so that it will be known in the informal meeting in Turku which begins tomorrow."
"And the fact that you are talking at the same time about the area of freedom, security and justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights illustrates the unavoidable political relationship between the two objectives."
"The area of freedom, security and justice must be backed up by a solid guarantee of the respect for rights corresponding to the realities of contemporary society, which is in line with the open and innovative approach which this Parliament wishes to see."
"The Commission, for its part, totally shares this approach, and will firmly commit itself to the process of drawing up the Charter and, of course, Mrs Halonen, we will communicate to the next Commission your invitation to the Commission to make specific proposals in this regard."
"The European Parliament has given some indications as to the most radical institutional reforms which will have to be taken account of during the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"In this respect, neither must we forget, although there is much that must be changed, the possibilities which the new framework of the Treaty of Amsterdam offers, particularly in relation to democratic control and transparency."
"The Commission fully shares your opinion on the contents you wish to see for the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Some common ground has come into view; for example, with regard to the importance attached to access to justice, the development of a coherent strategy in the field of immigration and asylum, the protection of the weaker groups and those suffering from discrimination, or the strengthening of the mechanisms used in the fight against organised crime."
"These are very sensitive points and they will all firstly require a broad political consensus and a great political will in order to find common solutions."
"As I said before, the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is a basic objective in bringing the Union closer to the citizens, and this matter forms part of the daily concerns of the citizens of the Union."
"It is therefore essential if European construction is to have even more legitimacy."
"For this reason, failure is not an option."
"Therefore the Commission, like Parliament, hopes and trusts that the Tampere meeting will provide an initial impetus."
"The issues are very complicated, very sensitive and, as Mrs Halonen said, very different political cultures will be dealing with the same phenomenon, but it is good that this process has been started."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that this summit in Tampere is an Extraordinary Summit on the subject of making preparations for an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In conclusion you also pointed out that prior to this - tomorrow and the day after - an Extraordinary Council Summit would take place, a meeting of Ministers for Justice and Ministers for Home Affairs in Turku."
"That is why it is so important for us to discuss this subject today here in Parliament, too."
"Against the background of this preparation meeting tomorrow and the day after in Turku and against the background of having to deal in Europe, unfortunately, with a rise in organised crime, drugs-related crime, the criminal trade in human beings and the like, it was incomprehensible to me that we should have to discuss in this Chamber whether we could even have this debate here in the European Parliament."
"I am pleased, however, that we in the European People' s Party, together with the friends of security, have successfully been able to implement the initiative in this Chamber against the Social Democrat Group who did not want this discussion to take place here."
"It is a matter of the possibility and the necessity of giving a clear sign here that we take the sphere of security and justice seriously, that the point is to prepare material for the Tampere Summit in the interests of the security and freedom of the citizens of Europe."
"This is essential."
"The Council keeps appearing here and putting forward great proposals."
"I see that as very positive."
"What is lacking is the translation of these into concrete action."
"What became, for example, of the asylum paper which was discussed about a year ago?"
"What became of the strategic paper on asylum and migration submitted by the Austrian Presidency?"
"We are still waiting for the implementation of EURODAC."
"We are waiting for the harmonisation of data which would make it possible to check which anti-drugs campaigns are successful and which are not."
"Announcements must be followed by action."
"This is what we are waiting for, concrete action in three areas."
"Firstly, we are waiting for comprehensive strategies on the management of migration which, on the one hand, do not make excessive demands on the capacity of Member States and their citizens to integrate but, on the other hand, also help to avoid social conflict."
"We are waiting for lasting instruments for joint solutions to deal with the influx of refugees, unified standards in the field of asylum procedures."
"For us, burden sharing in the reception of refugees is indispensable, as indispensable as the preparation of on-site aid."
"We need permanent solutions here."
"What we also need - I am pleased to see that you mentioned them - are instruments to fight against illegal immigration, the criminal trade in human beings and the abuse of asylum."
"We are therefore waiting for EURODAC to be quickly set up and the Schengen security system to become effective at all frontiers in Europe."
"We are also awaiting effective measures in the fight against organised crime."
"EUROPOL must be fully developed; it must be given operative authority."
"Cross-border collaboration between police forces must be extended to provide co-operation in training and co-operation with applicant countries."
"Naturally, we expect judicial co-operation to guarantee legal protection for citizens while, on the other hand, enabling speedy and effective criminal prosecution across borders, and that means accelerated procedures, the direct exchange of documents, harmonisation of criminal law systems and also assistance for the victims of crime."
"The challenge has been issued to the Council."
"We expect deeds, not fine words and summit photos."
"Madam President, my thanks go to the Minister for her most comprehensive presentation."
"The Social Democrats here in Parliament are very keen to participate already at this stage in the debate on these important issues."
"The removal of obstacles on the road to economic and cultural interaction lies at the heart of European co-operation."
"With the single market we wish to improve Europe' s capacity for responding to global competition and thereby create conditions to improve the welfare of our citizens."
"Free movement also carries with it the threat of a growth in international crime, which citizens in various parts of Europe feel today is one of the greatest causes for concern."
"On the other hand, increased co-operation among the Member States will compel us to examine citizens' rights from a European viewpoint, one that is broader than that pertaining to the individual state."
"In this connection, we must emphasise the importance of non-discrimination and the realisation of the rights of minorities."
"I also wish to express my satisfaction regarding Mrs Halonen' s urgent call in her speech for the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Unity, and I too would like to see initiatives from the Commission on this issue."
"The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October will be a historic attempt to shape EU common policy in the prevention of cross-border crime, and in the creation of a European judicial area and a common policy on immigration and asylum."
"One of the main issues of the meeting is that of fundamental rights as recognised under the Treaty of Amsterdam, including the right of citizens to security."
"Effective crime prevention requires closer co-operation among Member States, which in practice means the co-ordination of legislation and better co-ordination with respect to co-operation with the police and the investigation of crime."
"It is also important to invest in the prevention of crime, which is naturally a matter of considerably broader scope than an issue merely for legislative policy."
"Safeguarding the free movement of our citizens and the flexible creation of legislation on the subject will require the adoption of the practice of majority ruling in Union legislation."
"In reality, it is a question of the implementation, among other things, of the Schengen Convention."
"By strengthening the role of the Union in the creation of a European judicial area, and in the prevention of international crime, we can, at the same time, dispel suspicions that are known to exist regarding closer European co-operation."
"Our job will be to show that this is an integral part of European co-operation and, in this way, we will be responding to the worries expressed by our citizens."
"These matters also concern the period following enlargement; in other words, the demands being made on the applicant countries."
"Closer co-operation will also create a basis for unhampered interaction with the Union' s neighbouring regions."
"Clarity, transparency and ethically sustainable action must be the guiding principle behind European decision-making, whether it is a matter of the Union' s internal administrative culture or of ensuring the rights and security of our citizens."
"We need the co-operation of various players, so that these principles may also reach the attention of the people."
"The NGOs have an important task to perform."
"The fact that Parliament is debating this important subject right now, well before the Extraordinary Summit at Tampere, indicates that the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam is being realised in the way intended."
"In compliance with the same principle, it is important to assure Parliament that it will be represented on an equal basis with the Council when the Union prepares to draft the Charter in respect of the fundamental rights of citizens."
"Madam President, despite the splendid presentation by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Halonen, I have to draw attention to the secretive way preparations have been made for the meeting at Tampere, which last week led to a grotesque incident after the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende published a story saying that a curb would be put on immigration from third countries, even with recourse to scare campaigns and threats."
"A certain Finnish television reporter, who had used a quite harmless memo on the Tampere meeting he had got from a Member of Parliament, received a communication from the Secretary-General and the Speaker at the Finnish Parliament banning him indefinitely from entering the Parliament building."
"Suppressing the free flow of information and bypassing society in this way, whilst preparing for a summit on an area of freedom, security and justice, gives cause to suspect that that area is not free or open to the extent that our traditions would require."
"It gives cause to suspect that narrow, strict security, which is ultimately based on repression, will ignore those very freedoms and fundamental rights of citizens whose enhancement ought now to be on the agenda."
"The Finnish writer, Samuli Paronen, said, ""The more efficient the security systems, the more insecure the people"" ."
"Ignorance is not a virtue; sometimes it may be a questionable blessing. Ignorance due to secrecy has no place in a mature political system, such as the one we should be building for a Europe of the citizen, of the individual."
"In this way, we can also achieve a positive, humane and open policy on immigration and an asylum procedure which genuinely complies with the Geneva Convention and avoids discrimination of any kind."
"Madam President, democracy demands that we take decisions through a system of majority ruling."
"Democracy also demands that people have fundamental rights, which may not be violated by means of majority ruling."
"Such violations must be prevented in a constitutionally governed state."
"Privacy is a human right that cannot be abolished with an EU directive, a convention or national legislation."
"There is legal provision for the protection of privacy in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Representing the Council, Mrs Halonen said that it was necessary to identify certain new types of crime that had come into existence."
"But then it is necessary to recognise the existence also of crimes relating to the violation of people' s privacy, which intelligence agencies in the USA and the EU countries are guilty of 24 hours a day."
"I speak of electronic surveillance."
"In the European judicial area, prevention of this type of crime seems still not to be the object of political and parliamentary preparatory action or control, and merely takes the form of police co-operation."
"There are types of crime that remain outside the democratic system, which the preparation of the Enfopol 19 document is connected with."
"There are undemocratic issues that are connected with the so-called Ilets police co-operation."
"Undemocratic too is the Echelon programme for collaboration on espionage and the bilateral agreements between the security services in the USA and the EU countries."
"It is also a crime that American computer manufacturers and software companies install special ID codes in their products."
"It is a crime against people' s privacy, in addition to which it jeopardises the security of European states."
"We have to fight against such things and crimes of this type with transparency and by drawing public attention to them."
"I hope that Finland will move from words to deeds in this issue."
"At present, there is no visible prospect of an increase in transparency and public awareness during the Finnish presidential term: they only speak about it."
"Madam President, the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group intend to vote against this motion for a resolution."
"The main reason for this is that the resolution aims at introducing a legal situation which goes beyond the EU treaties in force."
"The resolution includes a number of proposals which are directly inconsistent with each other."
"It will not be possible to stop organised crime, the trade in human beings, money laundering and terrorism just through co-operation between police forces if, at the same time, the doors to the free movement of people between EU countries are opened, both for EU citizens and everyone else, and certainly not if controls on the EU' s external borders are weakened, as will inevitably happen when the EU is enlarged."
"As a prior condition of creating peace and security in Europe, the EU' s Member States must work more actively to create this peace, security, economic growth and democracy in the EU' s poor neighbouring countries."
"The solution is not to use resources in a non-prioritised way to move poor countries' populations to Europe, but to employ resources for the purpose of exporting European development to poor countries."
"Immigration to Europe helps only a minority and often a quite random minority, while the majority of people in the immigrants' home countries continues to suffer under existing conditions."
"The motion for a resolution is devoid of any reference to these central solutions, and it is aimed solely at promoting federalist development in the European Union, a form of development which a majority of the population in my country, Denmark, dissociated itself from in the 1993 referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Madam President, the area of freedom, security and justice we have spoken of is a utopia that we will never achieve on this earth."
"The institutions have high expectations in terms of what the further development of the European Union will bring its citizens."
"I think there is a need for a certain amount of modesty when it comes to the things we can achieve, and that we should exercise a certain amount of caution when it comes to extending European competencies in the field of justice and home affairs still further."
"There is certainly a need for this."
"A European policy on asylum is long overdue, for example."
"Opening up the borders has created a need for co-ordination."
"A number of countries, of which the Netherlands is one, have had to deal with a disproportionately large influx of asylum seekers in recent years."
"The reality of the situation is compelling us to bring about substantive harmonisation of legislation in order to prevent a ""race to the bottom"" ."
"The main thing is that genuine asylum seekers should not suffer as a result of the tightening-up of EU legislation."
"The minimum standards must not be allowed to become quite that minimal."
"However, we do not consider it to be a good idea to draw up a European Charter, a new catalogue of civil rights."
"The constitutions of the Member States, the ECHR and other treaties already offer adequate protection to citizens, so there is no need for there to be an accumulation of all different kinds of constitutional systems of government, as the Dutch Minister for Home Affairs said last week."
"In short, there are many items on the Tampere agenda offering us the opportunity to get down to some real work."
"However, the European Parliament runs the risk of putting itself beyond the discussion by straining to achieve its own utopia in which the citizens are enabled, by virtue of the advantages of European citizenship thrust upon them, to at last see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"Madam President, like the previous speakers, I believe that, firstly, the creation of a European judicial area and, secondly, the introduction of general regulations for the control of immigration, will not contribute in any way towards solving the problems of cross-border crime or immigration."
"This is just another decoy being waved in front of public opinion in Europe in order to deceive people into thinking that Europe is capable of solving their problems."
"I would like to speak, anticipating a little bit, about the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference; this conference is actually already on course without us however knowing the exact conditions."
"The European elections demonstrated the very deep disaffection of the various peoples of Europe with regard to the European Union."
"The questions which public opinion has been wondering about may be summed up as follows: where exactly does Europe offer added value and improve these decision-making systems of ours?"
"Has Europe brought us greater economic growth, an improved standard of living in daily life or the expectation of participating in a great adventure?"
"The response given in many countries, starting with the Netherlands - which in fact surprised me a little, because it was in the Netherlands that the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam were signed - has been negative."
"More and more people are starting to have doubts about the value of the fast track to integration and indeed about the value of the Treaties which Mr Barnier, who has moved all the way from Gaullism to centrism finding no middle ground, would like to see enshrined in the constitution."
"But, Mr Bourlanges, thirty years ago you were a Gaullist and now you are the opposite of a Gaullist, since you are a centrist."
"In other words, the subject of the forthcoming IGC should be not to reinforce this institutional process but, on the contrary, to reduce it, that is to say, to limit the scope of activities of the Union, returning to a common market which respects the environment and public health."
"Moreover, Mr Lamy, the Commissioner-delegate, described the building of Europe as a phenomenon without historical determinism, ""a human and fragile endeavour."""
"He doubted that there was really a future..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, please allow me, first of all, as a Greek MEP, to express my sorrow at the death of a former colleague and friend, the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, Yannos Kranidiotis and his entourage."
"The Extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere is undoubtedly particularly significant, since it aims to formulate more integrated policies on freedom, security and justice within the European Union as it is now, a European Union which is expanding and within a European Union which is developing ever closer ties with third countries - policies which, as we all understand, are perhaps more directly related to some of the issues which fall under the headings of justice, security and freedom in Europe, such as the issues of immigration and asylum."
"The Tampere meeting is also being called upon to address the issues of freedom, security and justice for citizens in relation to the new conditions created by the new challenges involved in crossing the threshold from the 20th to the 21st century."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in a few hours, you will have in front of you a resolution of the European Parliament on these issues."
"I wish to ask you to pay particular attention to this resolution, since the proposals of the European Parliament do not aim just to resolve isolated problems."
"On the contrary, they aim to create a new institutional framework which will not only guarantee freedom, security and justice within the European Union, but also put forward recommendations for specific policies on a range of sensitive issues, such as the key issues of immigration, asylum - since, judging by recent events, it is clear that unfortunately we need a new approach to the matter - and crime."
"I believe, as I am sure we all do, that the list is a long one."
"Madam President, the drawing up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for citizens is, of course, also relevant to those issues to be discussed at the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere."
"At this stage, we are, of course, debating the establishment of a body that will deal with this very important matter."
"I would like to ask the Council to review its proposal and to ensure that the European Parliament' s participation in this body is genuinely representative of the European Parliament and reflects all the political forces and all the various political tendencies and beliefs which are currently to be found in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to say something in response to the speech by Mr de Gaulle."
"Now, unfortunately, he has left the Chamber after his speech, which has actually done more to raise the tone of the debate than his presence did."
"The Finnish President-in-Office of the Council has presented her ideas, and I would like to draw your attention, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to one point which I consider essential in connection with the debate on the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Practically all the ideas you have presented, and everything my fellow Members have mentioned here in the debate - as far as the collaboration of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the Council and the Commission is concerned - is within a legal arena, which involves a great danger, the danger of alienating the legislature of the citizens, male and female, of Europe."
"What is this construction of the area of freedom, security and justice about?"
"It is about security and fundamental rights, that is, on the one hand, the immediate rights of the individual and the protection of security and, on the other hand, the protection of these individual rights by state bodies or by state bodies as they should be established in Europe."
"These are two factors, which can affect every individual citizen of Europe, male or female, directly."
"There is thus a direct involvement in almost all subjects, whether it is asylum, immigration, migration, EUROPOL, whether it is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or anything else, there is a direct involvement of each individual citizen, male or female, in this matter."
"But how will legislation be implemented?"
"All the fine words of the Council do not alter the fact that in 90% of all acts which are passed, only the Council is actively involved."
"And how is it involved?"
"Well, 15 executives come to Brussels, perform the function of a legislature in Brussels, and finally travel back home to their capital cities and then implement the laws enacted by the Council alone, which is to say, the executives in this way, as the practise has been until now, increasingly exclude the national parliaments - as can be seen so clearly in the case of EUROPOL and the materialisation of the EUROPOL Convention - and do not transfer the legislative function to the European Parliament."
"In this absence of referral to Parliament, the area of freedom, security and justice, which specifically represents the establishment of a structure of individual claims for protection and of possibilities of intervention in the individual sphere, cannot be established in a way that is really democratically justified."
"The European Parliament must therefore appeal to the Council and the Commission."
"Particularly in the areas which you have already - all too timidly, in my opinion - decided to make the European Parliament a legislative body with equal rights in the foreseeable future, if you wish to establish a democratic area of freedom, security and justice, in Tampere you must ensure that for the next Intergovernmental Conference we will be a legislative body with equal rights, otherwise you run the risk of alienating the European Union further from the citizens in general."
"Welcome"
"It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the European Parliament, to welcome the Committee of Legal Affairs of the Finnish Parliament, headed by its chairman, Mr Henrik Lax, now seated in the official gallery."
"We are delighted to welcome this delegation."
"We hope that the meetings which we are due to have will be useful and productive and this visit, moreover, is part of the pattern of ever closer relationships that we would like to see between the European Parliament and national governments."
"I wish you a warm welcome."
"(Applause)"
"Preparation of the European Council meeting in Tampere (continued)"
"Madam President, what needs to be done to make the Tampere Summit a success?"
"European policy in the field of justice is in a state ranging from bad to useless, a point I want to make to my newly arrived Finnish colleagues too."
"Two examples: massive numbers of people were driven out of Kosovo and, prior to that, out of Bosnia."
"The European Union did not and still does not have any arrangements in place for the temporary protection and reception of these groups of people."
"The relevant proposal was put forward by the European Commission two years ago, and was adopted by the European Parliament last year."
"The national governments have refused up until now to enact the proposal."
"The second example is European fraud; it takes so long to get improved co-operation in the field of justice off the ground."
"The question of a European Public Ministry has been raised."
"This House voted on that in April and was in favour of it."
"The Committee of Wise Men is too, and now it is the Council' s move."
"Madam President, the one thing the Tampere Summit needs above all else is the political will of the Member States."
"We have no need for new plans of action, nor do we have any need for ""soft law"" ."
"We want the national governments to abolish the unanimity requirement in decision-making, for it is this that paralyses the process, and we want steps to be taken towards achieving this end in Tampere."
"May I ask you another question Madam President-in-Office of the Council?"
"Give us here in the European Parliament full control and the final say over legislation."
"Madam President, on a final note: more plans of action, more fancy press releases, they are no use to us."
"Decision-making by majority voting, full parliamentary control, it really would not be all that difficult to bring this about."
"It is a matter of having the political will."
"Madam President, the summit on internal policy in Tampere is a historic milestone in the development of the European Union."
"Only a few years ago, the governments of Member States were not prepared to co-operate with the European Parliament on important matters such as collaboration between police forces, migration or common asylum policy."
"The time has come for the European Union to lay foundations after Amsterdam."
"The results of Tampere will determine how democratic and how just the Union will be, if it is really to be an area of freedom, security and justice for all citizens, male and female."
"As yet I have not seen any documents from the Finnish Presidency."
"Even in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs remain too vague."
"We have not seen much sign of great Nordic transparency."
"I must therefore refer to documents from Germany about Tampere."
"I regret that once again we have to have a debate on internal politics in this Parliament without having the documents of the Council Presidency on the table."
"In this connection, I would like to make it clear that my group is very concerned particularly if, in Tampere, the areas of collaboration between police forces, the fight against drugs, data protection and the democratic control of Europol and the Schengen information system are discussed, because we are again afraid, that it is exactly these important points, which have really great significance for European democracy, which will come off badly and that the citizens in general will find in the end that, as far as their rights are concerned, they are the real losers."
"I am still hopeful, but previous experience has made me pessimistic."
"I hope that the Finnish Presidency of the Council will take our reservations seriously."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we hope that the participants at the Tampere Summit will remember that migratory movements, however relentless, form the basis of the history of humanity and are, in the long-term, the premise for its collective salvation."
"We also hope that, on this basis, in trying to create a common area of freedom, security and justice, they are inspired by the principles of solidarity and inclusion and are not thinking about creating a European Community that is peaceful and wealthy on the inside but which is impenetrable to those pushing to get in from the outside on account of hunger, war or social difficulties."
"Internal peace and well-being cannot last long because the nearby countries cannot resign themselves to living with insecurity, need and chaos for long."
"We would be terrible hypocrites to take up the fight against discrimination, racism, and xenophobia as a founding principle of the European Community and then, in our normal procedure, to implement exclusion policies which heighten the fears of European citizens of being contaminated by people who are different to us."
"Just how they are different is a consideration we willingly leave to the racists."
"We would also like the area of freedom, security and justice to aim to increase the guarantees for everyone - be they citizens of the Union or people from other countries - and that it does not stop at declaring formal guarantees but also aims to put substantial guarantees into practice, such as those concerning work, social security, personal freedom, equality between men and women and many others which nowadays are being sacrificed on the altar of competition - global competition - so close to the heart of the Commission and its President."
"This neoliberalist strategy, a typical exclusion strategy, makes us sceptical even of the Tampere Summit, and we would be naïve to hope that our scepticism will be proved groundless."
"Madam President, after employment, the most pressing issue that European citizens bring to the Community' s institutions is the security emergency which, because of its nature, cannot be solved by the Member States on an individual basis."
"We must commit ourselves fully to this issue, with the aim of strengthening the faith that the European citizens have in Parliament."
"However, I think that the idea of creating a Charter of Fundamental Citizens' Rights does not go far enough."
"We already have a lot of written declarations which often are not implemented."
"What we really need is the will to use all the practical means necessary to ensure genuine co-operation on legal and police matters."
"I think that nowadays, the lack of a European strategy on immigration is unacceptable, with regard to dealing with both legal migration and illegal immigration"
"In conclusion, the concept of Europe as not only a single market and currency is very appealing, especially as an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is important for this challenge to become reality through progressively strengthening the Community institutions and developing the collaboration and co-operation between the Member States, rather than resorting to decisions taken by qualified majority, which in itself does not constitute the solution to the problems."
"There is one paragraph in the motion for a resolution which I have a lot of sympathy for, and that is paragraph 7 b, in which the criticism is made that the texts to be decided upon within the context of the Schengen collaboration have still not been made public, in spite of the fact that they have been Union law since May of this year."
"It may then be asked how and in what form the citizens of the Union can take their stand on provisions which are in practice inaccessible."
"This is the only paragraph which can be supported."
"Other than in this respect, however, both the report by the Council and the Commission and the proposal prepared by Mr Watson head off in a political direction."
"Under cover of the concept of an area of security, peace and justice, what we have here is an enormous leap forward in the development of the Union."
"It is a question of the EU' s making its presence felt to a much greater degree than there is a mandate for among the populations of Europe. The point is that this House suffers from the obsession that more power to Parliament means the same thing as more democracy."
"If I may say so, that is a very restricted understanding of democracy."
"The crux of the matter is that the proposal and the reports from the Council and the Commission, as well as the motion for a resolution under consideration, contemplate a massive transfer of powers to the European Union."
"We are talking here about the judicial system, criminal law and police powers."
"In part it is about constructing a Fortress Europe, necessitated partly by the EU' s own policy, but what we are concerned with in particular here is the fact that these parts of the legal culture represent our democracies' central nervous systems."
"These, if the proposers have their way, are to be subjected to a supranational system in which dislike for the EU' s Third Pillar is encouraged."
"Co-operation between States is not working, so a supranational authority is needed."
"What is being proposed here is the dismantling of a range of democratic mechanisms and, in their place, the construction of supranational systems which will create democratic problems with a vengeance."
"Madam President, our Parliament, though it may not be aware of it, is not without a sense of humour."
"In the Watson resolution, it says it is convinced that European citizens are tired of proclamations and fine declarations, and in the Napolitano resolution, it proposes nothing less than to carry out a purely stylistic exercise, grabbing the bone which the Council offered its pet dog, in the form of the writing of this great Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We already have a Charter, the European Convention on Human Rights, we have constitutions, but, otherwise, as a number of Members have pointed out moreover, we have no Communitisation of the Third Pillar, we have no democratic policy as regards foreign affairs."
"Let us move in this direction then."
"I think that this is just one more in a series of great exercises in mental masturbation, such as Parliament has been familiar with."
"For two or three years, or perhaps a little less, this Parliament will debate this great Charter, thereby affirming its own European view of human rights, while we know full well that the Chinese have a quite different view."
"All we are doing is promoting these mechanisms."
"There will be a lot of talking and a lot of self-congratulation, as we have seen some Members doing already - and I am sorry that Mr Schulz dropped the debate in the end by leaving the sitting - but I would like to say that perhaps this Parliament should look into democracy in its own house."
"Yesterday, we witnessed, and I thank the 90 Members who did not go along with this reasoning, we witnessed, once again, the denial of the rights of minorities in this Parliament."
"We could carry on in this way, and crow over the minorities of the whole world."
"But perhaps we would be better advised to start to realise that the construction of Europe rests upon foundations which are so undemocratic that there is nothing to choose between the many states in the world which we often criticise and this so-called democratic system we have today."
"So, perhaps, we should go back to the basics, reject this bone the Council tossed to us, as its dog, and get down to asking for fundamental reforms, especially the reform we ought to require of ourselves, so that this Parliament may become a true Parliament and not the instrument of bureaucracies which it is increasingly becoming."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in fact, in these matters of European policy on rights, even with reference to the considerations for a Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have entered a decisive phase of the development of the European Union."
"We all know that this concerns questions which have to do with the core area of national sovereignty."
"For this reason we must be mindful of the fact that many Member States have difficulties with this."
"On the other hand, it must be seen that in the meantime a process of development has taken place in the European Union, with a European agreement on rights and with the responsibilities of the European institutions."
"This should put an end to inconsistency, which has its starting point in the wrangling about competence among the institutions at different levels."
"This means nothing other than that, with the transfer, for sensible reasons, of responsibilities to a given level, the legal obligations and responsibilities of parliamentary co-operation and decision-making rights on this same level must also be connected because otherwise a legal vacuum is created where Parliament is not present."
"In this crucial area of the law, involving not only the protection of citizens with regard to the outside world, but also the protection of citizens against state institutions, a situation whereby protection from incorrect executive measures and corresponding control in the interest of the citizens is not provided must not be allowed."
"For this reason, it is extraordinarily important to close this gap."
"It is not just a question of general matters which may crop up in future, instead I would like to expressly challenge the Council, because of current developments to do with refugees and asylum, to introduce majority decision on these matters of the scheduled period of five years, by simple resolution of the Council, and with the automatic consequence also envisaged there, i.e. the co-decision rights of the European Parliament."
"I would also like to mention the matter of fundamental rights."
"I find that the Cologne resolution to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is of unusually great significance."
"But it does have limited legal validity."
"In time, we must achieve a situation where the citizen may present claims on the ground of fundamental rights at the European level if European administrative and legislative procedures go against his interests."
"But the crucial issue in what has been put forward in Cologne is the method, i.e. not having national governments prepare such things any longer but having a sort of convention in which national parliaments, the European Parliament and governments are represented."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, there is a tremendous opportunity here, if we are successful, to find the right composition for this convention, with the appropriate participation of the European Parliament, which must be equal in proportion to the other two areas."
"From experience with this operation it may then perhaps be possible using this method at some point, in the interests of the citizen, to lay down the main cornerstones of the process of European unification."
"This is not just a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but rather a rehearsal in the new meeting procedures between national parliaments, national administrations and the European Parliament, which can provide the European Union with great legitimacy for these cornerstones."
"Please, do not get too caught up in these less important, self-interested aspects, but rather see this great opportunity."
"Our first concern here is the Charter alone."
"In Tampere, then, you should be generous and allocate the European Parliament the number of seats which will enable it to legitimise this body."
"Madam President, in my opinion the proposed resolution contains all the assessments and proposals which it is appropriate for Parliament to approve in order to make a timely contribution that will enable the Tampere Council to start implementing the formal promises that the Treaty of Amsterdam makes to the European citizens."
"The aim is simple: what the individual Member States would do less well on their own, we need to do together."
"Nobody fools themselves anymore that the battle against organised crime, where fraud and the cruel trafficking of children, women and refugees do not respect borders, can be fought effectively by individual countries."
"We have to do this together, but if we give greater powers to the Union with regard to the prevention and repression of crimes, then this must happen in a framework where every individual is sure that his or her rights will be respected."
"There is no freedom without security, but there is no security without justice. In the first instance, justice means respect for the principle of equality, for the principle of non-discrimination, for the equal dignity of each person and for diversity."
"The Union' s policy must draw on this principle."
"The proposed document draws on it."
"We know how much resistance the Member States put up, including the countries which do not admit to it, in this field which is traditionally a national competence."
"But resistance, failure to act and delays are harmful, and we cannot afford to put it off."
"Enlargement of the Union to include the new applicant countries requires talks to start now on the progressive adoption of common measures and appropriate standards of guarantees."
"I hope that the Finnish Presidency, whose statements I welcomed this morning, wishes to take the credit for having started the implementation of the promises enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Madam President, speaking for the first time here I want to insist that this summit be more than a committee on public safety."
"It must have a balanced agenda."
"The Treaty prescribes the creation of an area of freedom, justice and security, but the Tampere summit is in danger of turning only into a security summit."
"Of course we want prime ministers to provide protection from threats like organised crime, drug running, terrorism and sex crimes, but let them also focus on the threat of discrimination and racism."
"Let them also tackle the problems of banking secrecy and tax havens which provide cover for money laundering."
"They should seek to provide European citizens with protection from injustice so that those arrested away from home can get legal representation, interpretation and bail."
"Instead of trying to harmonise European legal systems, just start with getting cross-border justice for individuals caught up in expensive red tape."
"And while countering illegal immigration and abuse of asylum laws is important, governments must respect their obligations under the Geneva Convention to grant asylum to genuine refugees and treat them with compassion and dignity, not demonise them."
"The Treaty stresses liberty and respect for human rights as fundamental principles."
"We should insist that the Charter of Fundamental Rights not only be drawn up with this Parliament as equal partner but also be legally binding and not just a pious declaration without teeth."
"Some of the rights we need as citizens are against our own governments, such as checks on our police, customs and intelligence services."
"Freedom of information ought to be a summit priority and so should ratification of the international criminal court and pursuing perpetrators of crimes against humanity."
"The message we must send today is that Tampere must be a summit for citizens, not just the bureaucrats, and democratic accountability must increase."
"Finally, if our national leaders want to set an example of justice and good governance let them disown their own foreign ministers who disgracefully want to put the Agency for Reconstruction of Kosovo in Thessaloniki."
"This shabby fix is the opposite of what the European Union should stand for."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the holding of a European Council dedicated in part to the area of freedom, security and justice, testimony to the recognition by the European institutions and States of the importance of these essential questions to the future of Europe."
"These questions are important for all citizens living in this area, since they affect their individual and collective freedoms."
"Tampere will also provide political orientation on such sensitive questions as immigration policies, which will necessitate a new look at North-South relations, and freedom of movement, which will necessitate real harmonisation of visa policies in Europe, such as the right to asylum and the right to health for all refugees."
"Other important questions include integration policies, which also affect the cultural rights of minorities, the right to family life with dignity and political rights for all citizens residing in Europe."
"All these rights must, of course, be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Charter which must address all these men and women who live in Europe and thereby enrich it."
"It is, therefore, necessary to reinforce democratic control of the choices which we are going to make, as today there are still too many shady areas such as Europol."
"That is why the European Parliament, the product of the will of the people, must be closely associated to meetings such as Tampere."
"The choices of the European Council must be transparent, in accordance with human rights and the wishes of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, the European Union is now quickly on the way to developing a common policy in the legal field by means of a series of different measures and programmes."
"Large common registers of personal details are being established for refugees and for the purpose of combating crime."
"This raises important questions about legal security and personal integrity, not least for the most vulnerable refugees of all."
"Experience so far is not so good."
"Supervision of the Schengen Agreement' s register, SIS, has been poor and, where the SIRENE structure is concerned, it has been even worse."
"In the SIS register, details of asylum seekers who have been refused entry have been mixed up with those of criminals and stolen goods."
"The Joint Supervisory Authority has been severely critical in connection with the misuse of information in cases where refugees have not been informed of their rights and where the authority itself has not had proper access to the register."
"The proposal concerning the EURODAC register is worrying, not least when it comes to demands to register groups in addition to asylum seekers and when it comes to the rules about when information is to be deleted."
"It will be possible for very sensitive personal information, for example about political views, to be entered in Europol' s search register."
"It will even be possible to register people who have not been convicted or directly suspected of crimes."
"The proposal concerning the ENFOPOL Convention is worrying because certain Member States will be able to engage in wire-tapping in other countries without the latter' s permission."
"In view of all these considerations, it is therefore a disappointment that Tarja Halonen and the country which holds the Presidency of the European Union had so little to say about questions of legal security and personal integrity which ought to be major issues."
"Madam President, the people that I represent have no confidence whatsoever in Commissioner Patten as far as law and order is concerned."
"Mr Patten has just recommended what could be called a terrorist charter for Northern Ireland."
"Our police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, has had 302 of its members savagely murdered and 8 700 of its members brutally maimed."
"Yet Mr Patten insists that the police must be responsible to a new ruling body on which the IRA will be represented."
"If the Commission is going to adopt this sort of thinking in the field of crime and drugs etc., what will the future of this European Union be?"
"It has within it the seeds of its own destruction."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I appreciate that the task is very difficult."
"As for you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that we are talking about an area in which an obdurate attachment to sovereignty is in evidence which, in my opinion, should be totally banished."
"It is with good reason that we identify nationality with the flag, the police and the judge."
"And that is what we are talking about: the policemen, the judges and what is behind the flag, at least the flags of the States of the European Union, which is the defence of human rights."
"There is no doubt that you are experiencing difficulties because the functioning of the Presidency of the Council is complex."
"There is no doubt that you are experiencing difficulties as well because taking decisions in the highest body, the European Council, means starting with general principles, and the will to act."
"In other areas, such as building roads or establishing Trans-European Networks, these general principles make sense."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, at this summit we want something more specific, especially in the area of justice."
"It cannot only be a summit on immigration nor, of course, only on security."
"Of the three areas - freedom, security and justice - the one which is furthest behind and needs most promotion is the area of justice."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, there is a lack of specific proposals."
"It is not a matter of providing access to justice or legal aid to victims."
"It is a matter of proposing a uniform procedure for small-scale actions."
"Talk about this, do not talk about general principles or simply the fact that we all have to co-operate, because if we carry on like this, the Tampere Summit will not be a success."
"Madam President, the decision of the Council of Cologne to proceed with the drawing-up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will involve our Parliament in a long and complex process."
"We will have to discuss the nature of the Charter, its contents, the relationship between the Charter of Rights and the process of creating a Constitution for the Union."
"These issues will form the basis of a report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in co-operation with other committees, to be prepared over the coming months and which will be submitted to you during a plenary part-session."
"At the moment, however, we must urgently take a position on the procedure to follow in order to draw up this Charter."
"This is the limited but important aim of the resolution put forward by Mr Watson and myself."
"Before the Council decides on the nature of the body responsible for drawing up the draft Charter, Parliament must state today that we cannot accept fewer representatives of the European Parliament than representatives of the Heads of State and Government. Parliament should also state that we are pressing for in-depth talks before deciding if the essential contribution of the national parliaments should be ensured through the participation of a certain number of their representatives at the appointed body or through other, more efficient channels."
"And now a personal view on the fight against crime and the challenge posed by immigration."
"The time I spent as Italian Minister for Home Affairs leads me to say that it is essential to speed up the move towards common rules and policies, which is just the opposite of the adoption of strictly national policies."
"As for immigration and asylum, the best basis is the document resulting from the Austrian Presidency in autumn 1998."
"Welcome"
"It is my great pleasure to welcome the members of the delegation of the Turkish Grand National Assembly to the Joint European Union/Turkey Parliamentary Committee, chaired by Professor Kursat Eser."
"Please applaud them, especially as we are particularly sorry to hear the news of another serious earthquake in the north-west of Turkey on Monday, only a few weeks after the tragic events which have struck this same region."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest sympathy to the Turkish Grand National Assembly and to the people of Turkey for the tragic losses which this natural disaster caused."
"In the spirit of solidarity, I am pleased to note that the Council and the Commission have taken the action necessary to assure the Turkish authorities of the aid of the European Union and to co-operate with these authorities in order to relieve the suffering of their people."
"Finally, I would like to express the hope that the debate which you will be having today and tomorrow with the members of the European Parliament delegation will be productive and that dialogue between our two Parliaments will continue in the near future within the framework of the joint parliamentary delegation."
"Preparation of the European Council meeting in Tampere (continued)"
"Madam President, many thanks for your tolerance and patience!"
"A fellow member of the European People' s Party described his Party as being friends of security, as if there were any enemies of security in this House!"
"I think the problem is rather that many are not the friends of freedom and the law to the same extent."
"Therefore, I also believe that the most pressing task consists of achieving the prerequisites for an area of freedom, security and justice, specifically a Charter of Fundamental Rights in Europe, because the important thing is not only to centralise the sensitive application of State and police authority, but also to europeanise the rights of citizens."
"Now the Cologne Summit has decided upon the proclamation of just such a European list of fundamental rights, a laudable intention."
"But when one looks at the manner in which this has been planned, then one can only, as a Member of Parliament, be shocked."
"The Council has - for what reasons, I do not understand - assumed total responsibility for this list of fundamental rights."
"There was no dialogue with the European Parliament."
"This is unacceptable, given that the European Parliament has the role of representing the peoples of Europe and is thus the original authority for such a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"There can be no question of equivalence of legislative institutions in this process."
"The inclusion of national parliaments has involved only individual representatives, so there can be no question either of plurality of political tendencies in this process."
"What is most worrying and most alarming is the scope of the undertaking."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe there is one thing we should not do and that is to fulfil the fundamental requirements of the citizens in appearance only."
"A proclamation of already existing rights is no Charter of Fundamental Rights, but political versemongering!"
"Madam President, may I congratulate the Finnish presidency on this initiative in which I fully support him."
"I hope that at the end of the temporary conference all Member States will ratify the setting up of the International Criminal Court so that the war criminals who are so prevalent today throughout the world can be prosecuted."
"In July 1998, 83 countries agreed to the establishment of an international court at a conference sponsored by the United Nations in Rome."
"Only four countries to date have ratified the Rome Statute: Trinidad and Tobago, Senegal, San Marino and Italy."
"Above all, the International Criminal Court will encourage states to investigate and prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity and will itself investigate and prosecute these crimes in certain circumstances."
"By addressing the issue of impunity and providing a fair forum for prosecutions, the court will help ease international tensions and promote peace and security, domestically and internationally."
"Madam President, Commissioner-designate Vitorino pointed out at the hearing that the purpose of preparing a Charter for human rights should not only be that of finding a common denominator between Member States. Rather, the Charter should be an independent declaration of rights."
"When the Charter is drawn up, it is important to bear in mind that immigration policy within the European Union must take account of the Member States' various social systems and educational opportunities."
"This applies especially if the Charter is to include citizens from non-EU countries who are resident within the European Union."
"In that way, the particular level of social protection is related more clearly to immigration and asylum policy."
"If too great a proportion of publicly financed social and economic entitlements were introduced, the walls shutting off the outside world would also be raised at the same time as the level of social provision in the European Union increases."
"This would mean that a caring approach to EU citizens would be to the detriment of those who really need protection within the EU' s borders, namely refugees."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam introduces the concept of a European judicial area."
"If it is to be possible to use the term ""judicial area"" , then legal security must prevail there."
"To be able to measure how far along this road the Member States have come, criteria must be established and efficient methods of measurement created."
"It is a question of establishing convergence rules for legal security."
"Once convergence is established, a table of results ought to be drawn up for the purpose of making the Member States' progress public."
"This would make the differences between the Member States clear."
"Group pressure is a strong social force which can contribute to voluntary harmonisation."
"If evaluation of this kind is fully open, efforts by the EU institutions may be that much more effective by promoting voluntary forms of harmonisation along the same lines."
"Once a process like this, aimed at establishing minimum rules, has begun, it should be possible to combine it with time limits and, in that way, provide the impetus towards creating a reliable area of justice which is a prerequisite if citizens are to be able to move freely, safely and securely and also a prerequisite for creating guarantees of security when the European Union is enlarged."
"This demands more effective safety and security measures, balanced with clearer definitions of personal integrity and human rights."
"Madam President, the President-in-Office has said that if you were to ask the people in Member States what they want you would get a clear message."
"This Tampere motion is, I believe, part of that message."
"It is one example of the people' s agenda."
"If enacted at Tampere and enforced by Member State Governments it will show to some of our more Eurosceptic citizens that real progress is being made."
"Many of them are not really concerned about the extension of qualified majority voting, important as that is, but they are anxious for progress on citizens' rights, progress on free movement, progress towards a real integrated Europe where people know and understand their rights and responsibilities."
"You pointed out the importance of this agenda when we are moving towards a successful enlargement of the European Union, setting our own House in order."
"Freedom, justice, security and transparency before we enlarge is, I am sure many would agree, absolutely crucial."
"It is a Europe that builds on what we have in common and does not set up barriers to highlight our differences."
"Earlier Mr Camre spoke against support for poorer countries."
"I say to him and others that you cannot have real prosperity and real security for 350 million people in 15 countries if you deny hope and similar rights to your neighbours."
"Walls, weapons and iron curtains are not the answer to asylum-seekers and refugees."
"That is why the success of the Tampere Summit and this resolution are so important."
"Some UK Members on this side of the House may have reservations about one or two points but we fully believe in the principles of this resolution, the points that are practical and enforceable."
"I feel very optimistic that the Tampere Summit will not just be a positive step forward but will become a historically significant summit."
"I wish the Finnish presidency every success."
"Madam President, I wish to underline the point made by Mr Napolitano and Mr Voggenhuber that it is absolutely vital that this Parliament be fully and properly represented in the preparation of the Union charter of rights."
"May I also say to Madam President-in-Office that subsidiarity must be as vitally respected at Tampere as in all aspects of the work of this Union."
"I represent an electoral region which has had an independent legal system with a distinct tradition in justice and home affairs for over 500 years."
"It is not a Member State itself, but we in Scotland now have again a parliament which legislates for our justice and home affairs."
"It is vital that this and other such regions are fully and properly borne in mind when policies are developed dealing with these matters."
"Finally, I agree very much indeed with what Madam President-in-Office said about making rights effectual."
"It is no use having charters of rights and having rights enshrined in treaties if these are ignored in practice."
"It has been drawn to my attention, in the short time I have been in this House, that there are foreign language lecturers in Italy who for eleven years have had rights declared by the European Court of Justice effectively denied by a Member State of this Union."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will take the strongest measures to ensure in this and other cases that we do not have rights and then see them rendered ineffectual by state action."
"Madam President, I hope that, following the declaration which the President-in-Office of the Council has made, this Tampere Summit may lead to a firm commitment of political will on the part of the Union, and that we will adopt a whole series of clear and necessary positions which will allow us to move forwards."
"I believe that this is what our citizens expect. They do not want to hear any more declarations, but they want us to take specific steps in order to allow progress in this direction."
"In attempting to do so, with regard to the area of freedom, I believe that there are two issues which warrant preferential treatment: the harmonisation of asylum procedures and illegal immigration."
"To these two matters we should add temporary protection, which is an issue with great currency given the recent Kosovo crisis, and the internal solidarity between Member States of the European Union."
"With regard to the area of security, I believe that it is reasonable to concentrate initially on those types of crime which are of a truly international nature."
"I refer to terrorism, drugs, organised crime and the trade in human beings."
"In my opinion, Madam President, the means which should be used are three in number: police co-operation - bearing in mind the progress that has been made through the Schengen Agreement - the prevention of crime and external relations, given that security in the Union cannot be isolated from security in the rest of Europe and throughout the world."
"The European Union must pay very special attention to the South, as well as to the countries adjacent to Russia."
"Lastly, with regard to the area of justice, our aim should be to do everything possible so that citizens have the sense of being, throughout Europe, within a framework of justice which is appropriate and within which their rights are protected in a similar way, not only with regard to criminals, but also with regard to the possible abuses of public power."
"The European judicial network is, undoubtedly, the least developed of the three areas we are dealing with and, in this sense, I believe that the creation of a stable unit, charged with giving continuity to legal co-operation and acting as the judicial counterpart of Europol, would be appropriate."
"I believe, finally, Madam President, that the objectives of the European Council meeting in Tampere are very ambitious, but I believe that by simply being ambitious in our efforts to turn this area of freedom, security and justice into reality, we will persuade the citizens of the European Union to see our work as an effective instrument with which to confront their problems."
"Madam President, there is no doubt, I consider it desirable - quite the opposite of many of the previous speakers - that the European Union should now be starting to turn its attention to its own Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"With a common general system of values it can create for itself the thing that people first look at when they meet, a face."
"It is therefore more than disappointing that this new face for Europe should have no binding nature for, at the present stage of development, the Charter will not form part of the Treaties."
"The modest will say, ""well, at least we are creating a model"" ."
"However, we in the European Parliament should not be modest and we should maintain that a Charter opens up the opportunity of forming part of the Treaties, of becoming part of an all-European constitution and even possibly becoming the forerunner to it."
"In any case, the question of who is to formulate the Charter is of outstanding significance."
"We well know that institutions have their own intricacy and each their own political motivation."
"There is then an obvious difference, whether an executive body or the administration work on the fundamental rights, or whether a Parliament does this."
"Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs demands, therefore, that the European Parliament should not collaborate as a mere accessory in such an important process, but as a generator of ideas and decision-maker on the same level as the Council."
"It is an important sign that this is precisely how so many national governments have come to see it recently."
"At the same time, we are aware of the gap in credibility we have with the citizens of Europe which we still have to eliminate, for there would be the opportunity of also consulting, in a quite original form, non-governmental organisations and individual citizens in the process of development of the Charter."
"From this, we could envisage organising public hearings together, even in non-conventional meetings with citizens from the various national states."
"In this way, work on the face of fundamental rights could give new strength to the whole body of Europe."
"Freedom and equality, human dignity and social justice cannot be achieved until they are perceived as an issue of the peoples."
"I am therefore of the opinion that if we cannot have a Charter with the full participation of Parliament we should rather have none at all."
"Madam President, here we stand in Strasbourg, in the unique tradition of Robert Schuman, whose European Coal and Steel Community was not only a step towards economic integration, which has now been crowned with the euro, but also a step towards political integration."
"The Council now has the opportunity, at the Tampere Summit, to achieve something like a Coal and Steel Community of freedom, security and justice within this European Union."
"My only fear is that this may not be the case, and my scepticism is based on a number of points."
"Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Madam President, I am of the view, that it is in fact necessary, for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work together on this on an equal footing, in the manner in which such a Charter of Fundamental Rights should be created. The principal role here must be that of the European Parliament."
"I find it unacceptable for us to have to act, so to speak, as mere decoration for the national parliaments."
"In internal committee we were very critical of the composition of this planned body, and we were told by the Presidency of the Council that it was not possible to deviate from the mandate."
"I find that scandalous!"
"The Council grants itself a mandate and then declares that it cannot deviate from this mandate!"
"I consider that to be absolutist in the extreme."
"I am therefore of the opinion that we should use today to bring this procedure back to Parliament."
"The citizens of Europe are represented by the European Parliament."
"If national parliaments co-operate, so much the better."
"But I would ask you, please, as the Council, to seek dialogue on this matter with the European Parliament on both the content and the procedure."
"Secondly, Tampere will also discuss the question of burden-sharing for civil war refugees and applicants for political asylum."
"I consider it scandalous that we have not yet decided to introduce set quotas."
"The Kosovo crisis has shown that, unfortunately, burden-sharing on a voluntary basis does not work."
"People have maintained that it was used in Kosovo and that it worked there."
"We were only lucky that thanks to the Nato intervention and thanks to the return of the Kosovo Albanians prepared to rebuild their lives, the flow of refugees was soon brought to a halt again."
"But we must see quite clearly that in the next crisis we would slip into a catastrophe if we approached that crisis with the same set of procedural instruments as in the Kosovo affair."
"We therefore need set burden-sharing according to quotas. European solidarity required clear, set rules which must be determined before the crisis arises and not in a mad rush once it is already underway."
"I would therefore like to say quite clearly, please use this opportunity to make Tampere a real new departure which will bring Europe real political integration beginning with internal security and co-operation in justice, because these are the core elements of statehood and also of the Community."
"Madam President we do not know if Tampere will be a success or not."
"We feel though, after the speech that we have heard here this morning, that it may be because that item in the Treaty of Amsterdam which was, of necessity, destined to be almost a dead letter or just hot air, is now gaining a certain visibility, creating greater consensus and asserting itself naturally, thereby making the path towards a common area of freedom, security and justice seem much more credible."
"Both in your speech today, Madam President of the Council, and two weeks ago, during the hearings of Commissioner Vitorino, we MEPs, used to the waffle of the Council and the Commission, found some philosophically rigorous elements concerning the fundamental assumptions about this real internal market of freedom and justice; that is, the market of values, no longer the market of goods and services - which have caused us to be quietly optimistic about Tampere and its consequences."
"Why should this be?"
"Of course, because the basis for legal measures which we can implement is found within the framework of a Charter of Freedom and Fundamental rights."
"This is also because the Community method is favoured over traditional intergovernmental co-operation which will bring about a new European institutional or legal system, which, in turn, will be more efficient, modern, and closer to the problems still festering today. These are still unsolved and caught up in the web of sovereignty and of obsession with laws and nationalism."
"Finally, why not make the visibility of this new European area the benchmark of citizens' trust, not by reducing the problem to the age-old argument of ""freedom versus security"" , but instead by taking on the whole range of new challenges and concerns for which European citizens hope Europe will actually find solutions?"
"Madam President, Madam President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the increasing sophistication of international crime means that the efforts to combat it within the confines of individual countries are becoming insufficient."
"Although much has been done relating to the economic aspects of the Union and the strengthening of its political dimension, there remains a great deal to be done in the area of genuine freedom of movement for our citizens."
"Not only because the Treaty of Amsterdam enshrined the right to security, but also because the concept of European citizenship will not become real without a genuine area of freedom, security and justice."
"What is required is the abolition of internal borders, care for citizens' security, harmonisation in terms of allowing into the European Union nationals of third countries, and allowing them freedom of movement once inside the Union, thereby creating an immigration and asylum policy which will be more coherent and unified. We also need to co-ordinate action on the prevention of crime and in the fight against it, particularly against organised crime (especially terrorism, trade in human beings, crimes against children, drug and weapons smuggling, corruption and fraud) and finally, we need laws and fundamental freedoms to be guaranteed at a European level."
"This is why this Parliament, with the new responsibilities conferred on it by the Treaty of Amsterdam, must make its objective to move towards implementing this area of freedom, security and justice whilst respecting national differences and always attempting to bring Europe closer to its citizens, clear in the objectives it is trying to achieve and in the way they are conveyed to the general public."
"In order to achieve all of this, for the sake of Europe, for the sake of our fellow citizens and for the sake of the strengthening of freedoms, of security and justice, we must work together in a spirit of efficiency and interinstitutional solidarity."
"We in the European Parliament have the will to do this, we expect a great deal from the work of Commissioner Antonio Vitorino on the Commission, and from the Council. We expect to see signs of this and decisions on these matters by the time of the Tampere Council meeting."
"Madam President, the Finnish Presidency of the Council has a very great responsibility."
"Many are looking towards Tampere with great hopes and are expecting considerable steps towards a Europe for the citizens."
"Here, I believe that the Charter of Citizens' Rights is a unique opportunity to say to people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean that this Europe is not only a single market."
"It is not only a single currency. Rather, this Europe is a community of values designed to defend and promote the achievements in terms of civilisation which we in Europe have fought for over recent centuries."
"The Charter of Citizens' Rights can only be of interest if the method behind its preparation is open and transparent."
"This should not therefore entail a traditional Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors."
"This Charter must be drawn up openly in dialogue with the citizens."
"I believe that citizens' rights is an original theme for the European Parliament and national parliaments alike."
"In this regard, I am of the opinion that the Tampere Summit should make considerable strides forward and allow the European Parliament a greater involvement than was agreed in Cologne."
"It is certainly a question of European citizens' rights."
"In this respect, we should really ensure parity between representatives of this European Parliament and representatives at a national level."
"I believe that citizens will only take an interest in this Charter if it amounts to more than a solemn proclamation."
"Citizens' rights must also be binding in law."
"I hope that this debate points the way ahead as to how these rights can be incorporated in the next treaties."
"Open debate and legal incorporation; then we will have the opportunity to get to know Europe' s citizens once again."
"Madam President, we find ourselves, in this legislature, with a momentous challenge with regard to the construction of the European Union."
"During the previous legislature, this Parliament said ""yes"" to Monetary Union, ""yes"" to social integration, making employment the centrepiece and the motor of European social policy, and now we must also say ""yes"" to a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"The European Council of Tampere, which is the result of the initiative - it must be said - and the efforts of the President of the Spanish Government, José María Aznar, must confront this issue with the same political will that it displayed at the Extraordinary Summit in Luxembourg when it confronted the serious problem of unemployment."
"The phenomenon of migration is a challenge which we must face with courage, realism and a deep sense of humanity and understanding."
"Solidarity and integration must be the two fundamental cornerstones of our immigration policy."
"As has been said here, any solutions which are legal, economic, social or based on controlling the flow of migration, should be adopted according to a common approach, in accordance with a common policy."
"This is not a Spanish, German or Italian problem, but rather a European Union problem."
"To this end, the very concept of immigration should be defined at the next European Council meeting in Tampere."
"Immigration for political reasons is one thing and economic immigration is another, and the two things do not require the same solutions."
"Furthermore, we should define the concept of asylum which is very often confused with illegal immigration and the problems relating to the status of foreigners."
"We should also establish, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam itself, a balanced effort amongst all the Member States to confront the consequences of accepting refugees, displaced persons and the powerful migratory pressure which is of an exclusively economic nature, such as that which originates from non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or the Southern flank of the Union."
"To this end, it is important that we analyse the political, geographical and economic circumstances of each crisis and each type of immigration."
"It would be neither reasonable nor efficient to distribute responsibilities in a uniform way, especially with regard to the distribution of displaced people."
"Finally, Madam President, social integration will be the shield, or protection, in the face of the racist or xenophobic attitudes which are currently appearing in some European countries"
"I shall end, Madam President, by appealing to the countries from which the migratory flow originates."
"It is not enough for the European Union..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, as I am taking the floor just hours after the terrible accident, I must say just how distressed the Greek representatives are and how much they grieve the tragic loss of the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, Yannos Kranidiotis, killed while performing his duty: he was a remarkable politician and European visionary who worked hard for peace and co-operation in the Balkans and for reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and who was once himself a Member of the European Parliament."
"I personally succeeded him in February 1997 in the European Parliament when he assumed his services as Deputy Foreign Minister."
"Madam President, please forgive me for intervening in this way and for being so overcome by emotion."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Halonen, I found your speech, which included specific recommendations, particularly satisfying, since it strengthens my conviction that Tampere may prove to be a key event, a landmark on the way towards European integration."
"We hope that, like the European Parliament, the Council will send a clear signal to the citizens of Europe, reassuring them that the European Union is indeed interested in and seeks to promote their vital interests, such as heightened internal security, freedom of movement, free access to justice, the fight against international organised crime, cross-border controls and respect for fundamental freedoms and rights."
"The Tampere Council meeting can and must take advantage of possibilities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam. It must make substantial progress on vital issues such as, firstly, the harmonisation of immigration and asylum policy, with a view both to securing better protection for immigrants and granting them rights; secondly, the issue of equitable burden sharing amongst Member States in hosting displaced persons, particularly from crisis areas, a very recent example being the Balkans; and thirdly, the issue of reinforcing internal security for EU citizens not only by police measures."
"Finally, I believe that the time has come to adopt the relevant proposals put forward by Greece, which include the introduction of speedy access to justice for citizens, using alternative means such as arbitration and pre-trial conciliation, and also by creating a harmonised system of public order and a way of resolving differences, based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and rule of law."
"Mrs Karamanou, we understand your distress at the announcement of the death of your Deputy Foreign Minister."
"The President has had the opportunity to express Parliament' s sharing in your loss and that of your people."
"Madam President, Mrs Halonen, security is one of the main causes of concern for the citizens of Europe."
"The Tampere Summit will attempt to respond to this important challenge: the creation of a more secure Europe."
"One of the most important questions at the meeting will be the EU common immigration policy."
"The idea of a common policy on asylum and supranational burden sharing sounds fine, but it will be very difficult to put into practice."
"Instead, voluntary burden sharing would serve very well as a basis for Union action."
"If the desired results are not achieved with voluntary burden sharing, we might consider compensating Member States for costs incurred in respect of refugees flooding into the countries in question."
"This is something that you also proposed, Mrs Halonen."
"Otherwise, the use of measures for economic guidance should be approved as part of the policy on refugees practised by the Member States of the Union."
"For example, in my country, Finland, which is a very long way from places recent crises have focussed on, there is very broad support for the idea of effective aid for destitute people as close as possible to their homes."
"Recently, there have been suggestions that responsibility for co-operation in police and legal matters should be transferred from the Third Pillar to the Community."
"This would, I imagine, make co-operation easier."
"The proposal, however, will very clearly interfere with the essential authority of nation-states, the right to determine the maintenance of the judicial system, and monitor compliance with the law in their areas."
"For that reason, we should consider at greater length the good and bad aspects of the proposal."
"Co-operation under the Third Pillar must be made adequate as long as the EU lacks its own police forces, and co-operation is always therefore based on action by the police forces of the Member States, which a Europol system would attempt to aid."
"Furthermore, as for the investigatory teams that were suggested, the situation is the same."
"The question of transferring responsibility to a common authority will become of serious interest only if we want to establish supranational police squads for the Union."
"The creation of a European judicial area and establishing a working party to discuss the idea has my full support."
"The right of our citizens to fair treatment - access to justice - must be ensured and the public must be guaranteed adequate aid if they have to confront the legal authorities of a foreign Member State."
"I warmly support the idea to set up a working party to discuss the issue."
"The creation of a European judicial area has to be part of the new people' s Europe."
"Madam President, García Márquez, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, wrote a book entitled ""The General in his Labyrinth"" ."
"It referred to the life of the liberator, Simón Bolívar."
"Reading Annex IV of the European Council of Cologne gives the impression that, on the subject of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Council is also in the middle of something of a labyrinth."
"I am sure that the institutions will be capable in the end of finding their way out of the labyrinth, more or less willingly."
"The problem is not with the institutions which in the end will be able to find their way out of the labyrinth of the Council with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The problem is with the citizens, with the frustration which can be added to that which they already feel with regard to certain issues relating to European construction."
"I therefore believe that it is essential that in Tampere decisions are taken to clarify the situation, that they be steps forward with regard to the already positive decision taken in Cologne on the character, the content, the relationship with the Intergovernmental Conference and the procedures for the drawing up and approval, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This Charter must be binding and actionable."
"It must reinforce the rights of the citizens and, at the end of the day, of European citizenship."
"It must encompass all those who live and work in the Union."
"It must be connected therefore with the Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Treaty of Amsterdam may be revised."
"This Charter must benefit from the active participation of the European Parliament, involving a sufficient number of its Members so that all the political tendencies of the Union may be represented."
"And above all, the Charter must be approved."
"The term ""proclamation"" , which was used in Cologne, is clearly insufficient."
"From here on - I repeat - we must ensure that the Council finds it way out of its labyrinth."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the President for his remarks on the tragic event and death of the Greek Deputy Foreign Minister."
"We wish, as the New Democracy Party and Greek Opposition Party, to express our profound and sincere condolences and our deep sorrow at the death of a former colleague and, I must say, a very good politician in his capacity as Foreign Minister."
"The Tampere Council is extremely important, Madam President."
"We largely agree with the President-in-Office of the Council. However, she failed to show any clear political will, for example, in the area of harmonisation."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, of course, immigration policy is an integral part of external policy, but on many occasions external policy gives way on grounds of expediency, grounds which ultimately go against the humanitarian aspect related to immigration and asylum policy."
"Of course, Europe cannot close its doors, but neither should it open them so wide as to create ghettos or open them without having laid down the necessary preconditions beforehand."
"These policies will have to tie in with development and co-operation policies which, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, have been largely unsuccessful in the delivery of the financial aid they promised."
"The biggest problem, however, is that ""dark side"" - the amalgamation of organised crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, and other activities. We are reaching the point where we are simply observing from a distance the activities of these people, especially those involved in organised crime, and cannot confront them."
"Justice and security are absolutely essential, Madam President, and harmonisation is absolutely essential, but to make all that happen, the necessary political will is essential."
"I have received two motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Situation in East Timor"
"The next item is the Council statement on the situation in East Timor."
"I must remind you that the debate on this statement will take place this afternoon after the debate on the report by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés."
"Votes"

"Pannella (NI)."
"(IT) Madam President, I would just like to give you and the House what I think is some urgent and useful information."
"In Rome, the third parliamentary group, which comprises 130 Members, is a group which unites Members to the right of Le Pen and to the left of Cossutta."
"We have examined yesterday' s decisions, and we are not monkeys who will do what a Parliament based on party politics expects of us!"
"Emma Bonino will explain later why, in the name of the political affinity of those who believe in parliaments, in democracy and in law and of those who abhor party politics, bureaucracy and falsity, we are not voting and will not vote."
"Emma Bonino will have the time to explain."
"Thank you, Mr Pannella."
"It is very kind of you to give Romano Prodi time to join us."
"I hope he is not trapped in a lift, in which case there would be extenuating circumstances."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution) (Applause)"
"President."
"I really think, ladies and gentlemen, there must have been a quite serious problem, because I did intend, and I still do intend, to allow Mr Prodi to take the floor..."
"(Seeing Mr Prodi arrive)... Mr President, do tell us which lift you were trapped in."
"I can inform you that the European Parliament has just voted by a very large majority in favour of the resolution concerning the Commission, and I give you the floor immediately."
"Madam President, I am sorry for my late arrival, which I can, however, justify."
"As is often the case in the European institutions, the Italian version of the speech has got lost in the hyperspace between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"I was waiting for it because I have here the speech in a foreign language which I was using to make notes."
"I have been here since 9 a.m. but I realise that I will have to make this address in Italian, but by translating from the foreign language. So please excuse me if occasionally the translation is not perfect."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the decisive moment of what has been, in my opinion, a good exercise in democracy."
"I have been given many occasions to stand before you recently and present both my policy ideas and the key guiding issues of our future relations."
"You have questioned the Commissioners in writing and orally."
"We are pledged to transparency, efficiency and to accounting in an absolute and clear way for all our actions."
"These principles of transparency, accountability and efficiency are echoed in the resolution you have just adopted."
"The centrepiece of your resolution is the commitments I gave to the Conference of Presidents last week. I am pleased to repeat my full commitment to these five points this morning on this formal occasion."
"They represent the basis of a new start in relations between our two institutions, a new culture of openness and above all, mutual co-operation."
"A key element in those points concerns the question of the individual accountability of Commissioners."
"I have already repeated, clearly and honestly, my position on this matter."
"I believe that the recent observations we have made together will enable me to deal effectively with any problems which may arise."
"Let me be clear: our firm commitment to the principle of collegiality - which is the cornerstone of the Commission' s role - will not become a shield for the individual accountability which all of us have to assume as politicians, before this House and before the European public."
"I believe that these principles are essential for a strong Commission. Even if a strong Commission will sometimes disagree with you - we will often say no - I think that it is better for all of us to have a strong partner rather than a weak one."
"Let me turn to the content of your Resolution."
"I am in full agreement that organising relations between us can only be one element of European construction."
"We have to engage the citizen, and this is a fundamental challenge for all the institutions."
"And one of my first major tasks is to present, in January, my policy guidelines for the five years of the Commission' s mandate. Together we must give a high political profile to the consultation in January."
"I repeat what I said in this House yesterday, that I have made a meaningful commitment to sustainable development, to responding to environmental concerns and I believe that the issue of quickly restoring consumer confidence in the safety of the food we eat and safeguarding our health is our first priority."
"I recognise the fundamental importance of the preparation behind the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to the European Parliament."
"I reiterate the commitments I have made to you, for a strong and decisive Conference."
"I also want to be sure that there are no misunderstandings on the nature of the report I have commissioned from Mr De Haene, Mr von Weiszäcker and Lord Simon."
"This is not a Commission report and you will receive it at the same time as I do."
"In the light of the report we will receive, I understand the need to organise a discussion which will start in Parliament and move on to the Commission on the preparation of an effective Intergovernmental Conference for the Helsinki Summit."
"In view of this, the dialogue that has started between us is very important."
"You have asked for an Interinstitutional Agreement as a framework for the Code of Conduct to govern our relations."
"I totally agree."
"We should now sit down and see how we can put our principles into practice."
"I also accept the commitments you have requested regarding the five points referred to in the preamble to your resolution."
"They have of course to be worked out in detail in the future Code of Conduct."
"I would, however, remind you that as President of the Commission, I will exercise my responsibilities to the full."
"There are two points regarding your resolution which must be changed in some way."
"Firstly, you are asking for a Member of the Commission to be suspended from office where a serious charge is brought against him or her. I do not have the power to implement this."
"I have already said that should such charges be formally laid against a Member of the Commission, I would have to examine the implications of this very seriously. And I can imagine circumstances in which a Member of the Commission would want to take leave from office while awaiting judgement."
"I can even imagine circumstances in which resignation could be an issue. But this would have to be a matter of political judgement for the Member of the Commission concerned, and, ultimately, for me as President."
"But the rule of law has to prevail and we must respect the presumption of innocence."
"The fundamental freedoms apply to us all, but I assure you I would take firm action."
"Let me add a further comment on this."
"As far as the crucial element of accountability and responsibility is concerned, I will never accept that any Member of the Commission knowingly misleads, or lies to, Parliament."
"Our relations have to be founded on mutual trust."
"Secondly, you want to give your views on the Codes of Conduct for Commissioners and for high level appointments before they are implemented by the new Commission."
"As President, I have to say that I need these rules in place on day one of the new Commission."
"I do not want any ambiguity on the immediate commitment to the reform process that these codes signal inside the Commission."
"This does not mean, however, that they are set in stone."
"You have received these codes and I will listen attentively to your observations."
"These codes are not unchangeable."
"Several of the points you wish to see included in the new Framework Agreement relate to transparency."
"I have told you that the new Commission will be open to your suggestions."
"It is committed to attendance at Committee or plenary part-sessions to deal with all important policy issues. It has also made strong commitments, within its sphere of competence, to see how we can improve the involvement of Parliament in all policy areas."
"I recognise the importance you attach in particular to international agreements."
"You will nevertheless agree that our commitment to consultation has to be worked out in a way which will be consistent with the efficient conduct of negotiations."
"I can assure you that I will undertake to see this is done."
"You also mention foreign and security policy and the Third Pillar."
"The Commission will work with you to see how we can best ensure that information reaches you quickly. I am ready to announce important Commission decisions directly to a plenary sitting when necessary and when you think it appropriate."
"We have to see how practical it is, for you as well as us, to organise this information on a weekly basis when Parliament is not in session."
"The availability of documents is important to you."
"This is partly a question of transmission. It is also a question, as you say, of establishing firm rules where access may need to be restricted."
"I agree that we should make special arrangements for the transmission of sensitive documents regarding fraud to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I have to issue one caveat in relation to internal documents on fraud."
"Great care has been taken to establish an independent OLAF."
"I cannot therefore speak for their documents."
"I believe there will certainly be a need for transparency but we will have to ask OLAF, if not I would contradict the view I have of this body."
"I can, however, confirm that it is essential, particularly in public administrations, that members of staff have a duty to report alleged fraud, impropriety or irregularity."
"It is equally essential that they can fulfil that duty through a coherent system which firmly guarantees their rights and the rights of those against whom accusations may be made."
"The new, independent OLAF is duty-bound to resolve each case. I also agree that the duties of officials in this regard and their protection should be enshrined in proper regulations."
"Mr Kinnock has already given you a commitment in this regard."
"I am very encouraged by the experience of working with you and the setting-up of the new Commission."
"I feel that we are working steadily towards a good political atmosphere of mutual understanding and to setting the foundations for a strong relationship."
"With good will on both sides, we will work together well and constructively."
"I have prepared this reply in an attempt to really get into the operating contents that you asked for."
"I know that today' s vote does not concern only these aspects of our work together, but also what we must do together for Europe."
"We have made commitments, and I can assure you that they go right to the heart of three important areas that concern both Parliament and the Commission."
"We have pledged to give Europe a new institutional order and prepare us for this Intergovernmental Conference which is of fundamental importance for our future."
"It is fundamentally important because we have been preparing for a second goal, a goal which in some way really will change our policies: the goal of enlargement."
"Enlargement will encompass countries with history, customs and income that are completely different."
"This choice has been made to guarantee the Pillars of Europe - peace and freedom. We cannot guarantee these Pillars unless enlargement occurs in a strong, open and constructive way."
"Finally, we have made commitments on a third goal - to support the new economic upturn and put it to the service of the European citizens. This also means using it to boost employment, to improve social justice, to reform but also preserve the great cornerstones of the welfare system that Europe invented and which has suffered many reform problems over recent years but which must not be abandoned, leaving citizens unprotected."
"These are the three important tasks we have taken on together."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this vote will allow us to make progress in what - rhetoric aside - truly is a great historic task. It will be an overhaul of the institutions that the world has never before seen."
"Nevertheless, when we have to tackle together those tasks which are groundbreaking and mark a break with the past, we must proceed as the united Parliament and Executive which all modern democracies need."
"The future of this, our Europe, is grounded in our brilliant dialectic but also in our spirit of co-operation."
"I thank the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and, in accordance with what we agreed, each group chairman may make a speech lasting three minutes."
"Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats yesterday had a passionate debate about how we should vote today."
"The previous President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, made a remarkable and impressive contribution to this debate."
"I would like to begin this short statement by giving a heart-felt word of thanks, respect and acknowledgement to our colleague and friend, Jacques Santer, for his wonderful contribution to Europe as Prime Minister of Luxembourg and as President of the European Commission."
"In this debate among our group, questions were also put and doubts expressed, both of which remain."
"This fact cannot be concealed and because of this we also have respect for the stance adopted by those who vote differently to the majority of our group."
"The overwhelming majority of our group will say ""yes"" to the Commission of Romano Prodi."
"But this is neither a blank cheque nor carte blanche."
"We will take you at your word, Mr Prodi, in other words, we will follow very closely whether, following your confirmation of appointment before the European Parliament, you fulfil the obligations you entered into prior to that confirmation."
"We expect you to discuss your programme up to the year 2005 with Parliament and that it will be a politically balanced programme."
"You have committed yourself in this regard and, above all, you have once again committed yourself to the five points."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues across all the groups, Mr Hänsch, Mr Costa, Mrs Hautala, Messrs Collins and Bonde, for the fact that we succeeded, after yesterday' s two-hour debate between our group' s chairmen, in today passing a resolution with such a large majority."
"It is our duty, as the European Parliament, to speak with one voice when talking about the key questions surrounding the future of Europe."
"The resolution would have been approved with an even greater majority if the translation had been available in a certain language for one of the groups."
"Because it was not, this group did not give its assent."
"You can see that the problems faced by Parliament are similar to those of the Commission, but that also gives a human side to the European Union."
"Allow me one final observation."
"In recent weeks, we have made great strides in co-operation."
"It is now our task to continue along this path towards democracy and parliamentarianism and, above all, to satisfy the hopes of the countries in central Europe of being able to join our community of law, peace and freedom."
"In this sense, we say ""yes"" to the Commission-designate."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the time for speaking is drawing to a close and the time to decide is at hand."
"From the outset of the recent period of crisis the ELDR Group has played a central role, leading from the front and insisting on greater parliamentary accountability on the part of the Commission as executive."
"All the trauma we have gone through will have been worthwhile if the correct lessons are learned and applied."
"We believe that the Commission, now to be voted, wishes to be more open, transparent, rigorous, reformist and accountable than any of its predecessors."
"We believe that the message is understood that such parliamentary accountability is both collegial and individual in nature."
"We believe the past nine months in and through the European Parliament represent a milestone in the democratisation of the politics of the European Union."
"Today we vote in two parts: a political resolution and on the Commission."
"The political resolution supported by more than 500 deputies foresees a new accord between Parliament and the Commission for the new millenium."
"We have promoted and support this idea."
"We have insisted on emphasising greater transparency, greater access to documentation and the necessity for individual responsibility and accountability of Commissioners."
"We are conscious of the delicate sensitivities and prerogatives surrounding these questions, but our bottom line is clear."
"In demanding these reforms we believe that they strengthen both our institutions in our common European vocation."
"The message should go loud and clear from this House today to the capital cities of the Union in particular, that the rules of engagement have changed utterly."
"Never again can the diktat or presumption of capitals with regard to preserving individual Commissioners be allowed to bring an entire Commission to its knees."
"Collegiality cannot be a shield to cover all behaviour, including unacceptable behaviour."
"Reinvigorated by the crisis we have passed through I believe there is a new energy and that there shall be a new synergy between our institutions to put the Union to work."
"My group - the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Group - should vote unanimously for the Commission and its President."
"We are pledged to making a fresh start for Europe."
"Let the work begin."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, at this, the final stage of a long process, I am obliged to report on the debate which my group held last night and to make a comment on our appreciation of your speech today."
"We voted unanimously on the joint resolution which has just been adopted by this Parliament."
"Our concerns were met, and I was pleased with Mr Prodi' s speech and his commitment regarding the content of this resolution."
"I therefore believe that I can say, on behalf of my group, that we are satisfied on this aspect."
"Having said this, although the way the institutions are run is one of the most important issues at stake, the political future of the European Union and its role in the world is just as important."
"The European Commission is the driving force of the Union and in this capacity has the power to steer the general policy of the European Union."
"We cannot be content with a vision of the Commission as a clerk' s office, making it a mere executor of orders from elsewhere."
"We must establish the vision of an ambitious European Union."
"Our group defends the idea that the Union must offer added value to the quality of life of our fellow citizens and that is why I welcome Mr Prodi' s proposals on food safety, even if these proposals do not seem sufficient to me."
"Indeed, quality of life also covers, in my view, security of employment, working conditions, public liberties and employment."
"Unfortunately, at the present time, the majority of citizens do not actually receive this added value."
"Furthermore, the Union must implement fundamental action on a world-wide scale to ensure that the differences in living standards between North and South stop increasing and that globalisation is not synonymous, as unfortunately it is today, with ecological and social damage throughout the world, including within the European Union."
"Appealing for growth and greater liberalisation with a hint of sustainable development is not an adequate response."
"But it is, unfortunately, the one which emerged, Mr Prodi, from your speech yesterday."
"Within our group we were unanimous in deploring it."
"It would, admittedly, have been ridiculous to expect that the incoming team would have a political plan which reflected our own, but we did think we were entitled to expect some indication of an ambitious vision of the role of Europe."
"Unfortunately this was not the case."
"In spite of your speech today, we are all disappointed by your pronouncements and by your vision."
"This observation which is positive towards all matters of institutional reform and negative regarding the political plan is not shared unanimously within our group."
"We have, therefore, in all transparency according to the current trend, allowed everyone a free vote."
"We shall vote according to our own consciences."
"Some are betting that, thanks to some of its members and thanks to the changes in the attitude of the Commission to Parliament, the incoming team is capable of instigating significant political reorientation."
"Others think, on the other hand, that a vote in favour would be tantamount to giving a political sign that would be contrary to public opinion since it would give prior sanction to the lack of clear plans."
"This is the message which I have been entrusted to give you, Mr President of the Commission."
"I hope that you will accept it as constructive criticism, and that our unanimous desire for dialogue will not be in question."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, in the course of the debate yesterday, I presented the reasons why my group could not affirm its confidence in the Prodi Commission."
"While highlighting the interesting ""shift"" in the relationship between this institution and Parliament, as well as our desire to work towards the success of the administrative reform announced, I expressed the conviction that in order to respond to the urgent expectations of our fellow citizens it would have been necessary to take the initiative on significant changes affecting not only the operation of the Commission but also on its political orientations."
"Unfortunately, I have heard nothing of this ilk in the various hearings of the Commissioners-designate or in the speeches of Mr Prodi himself."
"At a time when the Commission is just emerging from the most serious crisis in its history and the European Union as a whole has food for thought, given the unprecedented alarm signal which millions of voters, male and female, have just given it, the time seemed ripe for strong action likely to open up new perspectives, action likely to regenerate hope."
"Experience has shown that the European Union cannot be built simply by the market and by directives."
"It is forged above all by means of living relationships between people who are carrying out projects which motivate and unite them."
"My conviction is that Europe will win back credibility in the eyes of many of the peoples of the world, and their sympathy, by clearly stating, in the face of the advancing tide of neo-liberalism, its own values and plan."
"It is this ambition, Madam President, which, in our view, is lacking today."
"This is the reason why my group cannot affirm its confidence in the Commission."
"Madam President, Commission President, 1999 has been a difficult year for the mainstream EU institutions in that problems which surfaced over issues such as the accountability about the administration of various EU initiatives had strained relations between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"I would like to impress upon the new college of the Commission and all Members of the European Parliament that the events of this year must be put behind us as a matter of urgency."
"We must all reflect on the difficulties of the last twelve months in particular and learn from the mistakes that were clearly made."
"We must ensure that decision-making structures are put in place at EU level which will guarantee that all decisions are accounted for."
"In the resolution tabled today by my political group, we stress that there must be sound management in the administration of all EU programmes and initiatives."
"Because the Commission is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of so many EU-sponsored policies, it should take particular note of its Treaty obligations in this regard."
"The challenges facing the European Union are too great for institutional deadlock to hamper the Commission and the European Parliament in dealing with their legislative programme."
"The European Union cannot operate effectively unless there is cooperation and understanding between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"I am not interested in promoting European Union decision-making founded on institutional stalemate."
"I believe that the Commission too must recognise that the expanded remit of the codecision procedure means that Parliament has an equal say in the enactment of EU directives and regulations encompassing 38 different economic and social sectors."
"The codecision procedure covers a wide range of activities including those in the transport sector, regional affairs, social matters, employment initiatives, structural funding, consumer protection, public health and environmental concerns."
"If the codecision procedure is not operated in an effective manner, then inefficiency will take root in the internal decision-making procedures of the Union."
"That is the last thing we need at this challenging time."
"The single greatest challenge facing the European Union is to prepare for the enlargement process with the accession of six new countries to the Union by the year 2004-2005."
"There are currently 37 different chapters of negotiation to be discussed between the Union and the new applicant countries."
"These are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the EU if the enlargement process is to be successful."
"In conclusion, the Commission and Parliament must ensure that tough decisions are worked through in a spirit of understanding and common purpose."
"I hope that all of us have learned this lesson from the events of the last year."
"Our Group does have a group position."
"Each national delegation will vote as it thinks fit."
"The Irish delegation will vote for President Prodi and the Commission."
"Madam President, with Mr Prodi' s Commission, the EU is getting a real government for the first time."
"It is a product of the fifteen Prime Ministers, but it has now come into its own, freed from supervision by the Member States, removed from national parliaments, light years from ordinary voters and tax payers, but still not subject to supervision by the EU Parliament."
"The voters and the national parliaments are forfeiting power to Mr Prodi, but this power is not being picked up here in this House."
"Voter influence is being limited again."
"The executive is again being strengthened at the expense of the legislature."
"Mr Prodi promises he will listen and despatch a Commissioner every time we ask for one."
"He will seriously consider firing Commissioners if Parliament expresses its lack of confidence in them."
"But it is Mr Prodi and the Commission itself who decide."
"It is they who decide whether they have confidence in us, in the electorate and in the national parliaments, and they are still the only twenty people in the EU who can propose a new law or propose that an existing law be removed."
"In the Commission itself, the directors-general have again taken power."
"While Mr Prodi promises openness, answers concerning this are emptied of content by the directors-general."
"A lot of answers at the hearings were prepared by the old officials."
"In the draft version of Mr Kinnock' s response the officials had even written that the problem was that the Dutch official, Van Buitenen, had given too many documents to the group chairmen."
"The problem was not that the Commission had covered up the misappropriations."
"Clearly, there are still officials with things to learn."
"The Experts' Group is therefore proposing a prosecuting authority and more supranational supervision in the Member States."
"The Commission and the majority here will have Brussels impose more rules and manage more projects."
"The result will be more centralism and more fiddling and, in five years' time, a new Committee of Wise Men will be preparing a new report on increasing fraud within the EU, for it is secretiveness and centralism which give rise to fraud."
"Supervision can uncover a small amount, but the solution is a radical curtailment of assignments and projects in Brussels so that, instead, the focus is upon those things that extend beyond national frontiers and can no longer be solved on a national or regional basis."
"We must move in the direction of a slimmed down, open and democratic EU."
"My group, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, cannot offer the Commission political support but, instead, hard-working, critical and constructive opposition."
"The democratic dream is that people' s conditions of life should be equal. This must not be confused with treating everyone the same, for we are different in our diversity, and that is our strength."
"Madam President, I am taking the floor on behalf of the seven Radical Members and thank the Non-Attached Members for giving me this time."
"Mr President of the Commission, we seven Radicals stated yesterday what our position is but neither have we taken part in the previous vote nor will we take part in the forthcoming votes until, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament settles the issues of Members' dignity, rights and duties."
"With the unprecedented decision you took yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, you decided that there are some Members who belong to the First Division - your Members, the respectable ones, the ones from your bureaucracies, the ones who love divisions and sharing-out power. Then there are those Members who are not respectable, that is me and those of us who are simply independent of your bureaucracies and party politics."
"This is hardly dignified."
"It is not dignified for the elected Members and, dear Mr Barón Crespo, it is not dignified for the voters."
"You have decided that there are First Division voters and Second Division voters."
"We cannot accept this."
"Today the battle commences."
"It is such hypocrisy, such conformism, ladies and gentlemen!"
"You Italians live in a country whose Parliament has a mixed group, the second group, where Members from the extreme Right, extreme Left and the Greens all happily co-exist."
"But when you come here to vote, you vote as you did!"
"You Members of national parliaments have no problems in sharing out money from public funds among yourselves."
"It is such hypocrisy then to prevent us, but from doing what?"
"Prevent us from doing our parliamentary duties. We cannot - because we are inconvenient Members whom you do not like - table resolutions or amendments."
"Basically, all we are allowed to do now is press a button."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will not obey."
"We seven Radical Members will not comply with this empty posturing."
"Look at your groups!"
"A group is a work tool. Look at them, they do not have a political position."
"Three groups said they did not have a common political position."
"So, groups are only there to assist the sharing out of funding and staff, my dear colleagues."
"Parliament must stop being like this!"
"Starting today, we are beginning a crusade for dignity, legality, the Rule of Law and the rights and duties of a Member of Parliament elected by the citizens, who voted for us as they voted for you and who have the same rights and duties as you and the same dignity."
"I hope that very many of you, ladies and gentlemen, will defend the dignity of Parliament and its Members against bureaucracy and party politics."
"We will fight on until this Parliament restores the rights and duties to the elected Members by creating a mixed group."
"Draft Decision (B5-0064/99), by the Conference of Presidents, on the election of the Commission-designate"
"(Parliament adopted the decision)President."
"I believe that I can now congratulate you, Mr President, Romano Prodi, and congratulate all the Commissioners who are now no longer Commissioners-designate but full Commissioners."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, we have a new Commission for a five-year term, and I would like to clarify somewhat my group' s attitude towards it."
"Many of us believe that we are creating a new relationship with the Commission, and that really does mean that Parliament and the Commission will, in future, work in very close co-operation with one another."
"Some of us therefore decided to grant the Commission a vote of confidence, as we consider that we have made a remarkable start in this relationship."
"We also value the broad co-operation among the political groups in the adoption of the resolution calling for the Commission to take seriously the responsibility of individual Members of the Commission."
"We are most satisfied that Parliament as a whole stresses the importance of public access to documents and information."
"We have also emphasised that Parliament and Europe' s civil society must in future be more seriously involved in amendment procedures relating to the Treaties and Intergovernmental Conferences."
"Some of us, however, have said that they do not expect very much in the way of green policies from the new Commission, and our whole group will, in future, also see to it that the Commission gives sufficient weight to the principles of the creation of a social Europe and sustainable development, so that they have a serious part to play in all decision-making."
"Nevertheless, we are sure that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has listened to Parliament, and we are now embarking on a process of co-operation with the new Commission."
"Mr President, the French delegation of my group, like the Danish delegation, have already presented, in the main debate, the fundamental reasons why they could not support a Commission which believes itself to be the government of Europe even though the citizens have never expressly approved any such status."
"The European Parliament, for its part, seems happy to play along since the text on which we are voting is entitled ""Draft Decision on the Election of the Commission-designate."" Whereas, obviously, there is no election involved either at the level of our House, where in legal terms it is a matter of the approval of the appointment of the Commissioners, or, to an even greater extent, at the level of the voters who, in France at least and no doubt in many other countries, have never even heard of Mr Prodi."
"But I would also like to take advantage of this explanation of vote to mention the parallel resolution combining a number of the undertakings made by the Prodi Commission in areas that were often technical, but important, relating to the Code of Conduct, ethics and transparency."
"We can do no other than to approve most of them, especially concerning the proper distribution of information."
"I hope that, thanks to this, the Members of Parliament will, for example, be better informed regarding the negotiations of the Millennium Round than they were for the Uruguay Round, although this Europe has to date been obedient to the powerful forces which want free trade to prevail absolutely, but which prefer to act in secret."
"Unfortunately, this resolution is contaminated by a number of irregular conditions, for example, the one which stipulates that the Prodi Commission undertakes to include on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, in addition to the three points already determined, an important programme of institutional reforms."
"Of course, the Commission has no power, until further notice, to itself decide the agenda for the forthcoming IGC."
"This phrase at least has the merit of showing that the European Parliament and the Commission are going to back each other up in order to increase their respective powers and trample on the decisions of the Council."
"But really, in this matter as in that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the foolishness of the Council prevents us having any compassion for them."
"In any case, we are voting against the resolution which includes this condition."
"Mr President, it is a disgrace at this vital time in the history of Europe that a shadow lies over the Commission."
"No matter how much Mr Prodi protests, he and his college are seriously flawed."
"Blackmailing threats of resignation indicate a weakness which is a running sore already and will develop into a festering boil."
"If this vote had been taken before the elections I am sure the vote would have been somewhat different."
"As I have already stated in this House this morning, the people I represent especially have no confidence in Commissioner Patten."
"His insult to our honoured police dead and to our honoured police maimed is something we will not tolerate."
"Mr Patten may forget, we will not forget."
"Mr Patten may bury their heroism, we will see to it that their heroism still lives."
"Solemnly I salute them today in this House."
"Mr President, the United Left has already voiced our objections to the neo-liberal intentions of Mr Prodi' s proposed team."
"These objections relate in particular to the Dutch candidate Mr Bolkestein, for he is the most outspoken proponent of policies for effecting cutbacks, privatisation, deregulation and the lowering of taxation."
"A few months back, during the election campaign for this Parliament, the people heading the list of candidates of almost all the Dutch parties were quite vocal in saying that Mr Bolkestein should not be permitted to become a Member of the Commission."
"His attitudes were often provocative, which led to him being labelled a euro-sceptic."
"I do not actually think that he has ever been one."
"It is true that he is keen for the Netherlands to be a tax haven for large companies and high incomes and he does not want the European Union to hinder him in this."
"That is why he certainly would not be the right person to take on the taxation harmonisation portfolio."
"But now, the vast majority of Dutch MEPs have voted for a Commission of which Mr Bolkestein is a Member, thereby completely breaking their promise to the Dutch electorate."
"My party, the Socialist party in the Netherlands, does not go along with this."
"Mr President, I am sorry that almost no Members of the elected European Commission are present."
"This is an explanation of vote directed at Mr Prodi."
"I hope that somebody will take note and pass the communication on."
"According to many historians and anthropologists, the Basque people form the oldest nation in Europe which, in spite of its limited population, has maintained its own ancestral language for centuries and millennia, as well as a distinct culture and traditions."
"But, despite all of this, there are many other manifestations of the Basque uniqueness, not only in social, biological, civic, legal or administrative terms, but also, and above all, economically and fiscally."
"The gradual historical absorption and integration of the Basque Country into the Spanish State, which has always been the result of military defeats in the past, as well as the mass arrival of immigrants from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula, has resulted in the blurring and dilution of our personality and of native Basque uniqueness."
"For this reason, the Basque country maintains a political conflict with the Spanish State which has manifested itself in a violent way, a violence which the majority of us reject, but which, nevertheless, has left a trail of deaths, injuries, pain, extortion, fear and many innocent victims."
"Much has been snatched from us for reasons of state interest."
"But there is a distinguishing mark, a clear tendency towards self-government and sovereignty which has resisted all the historical upheavals and misfortunes."
"I am referring to the full autonomy, to the exclusive capacity and competence which the Basque Country enjoys from a fiscal point of view, from the point of view of the collection of taxes, rates and public levies, as well as with regard to budgets and public spending."
"Fortunately, today in Euskadi, as in Northern Ireland, we live in times of hope."
"The armed organisation ETA has declared a cease-fire and the majority of Basque political parties, unions and civil organisations have signed an agreement in Lizarra-Estella (Navarre) which aims at dealing with the Basque conflict through dialogue and negotiation."
"That is to say, by taking an exclusively democratic path."
"Well, the Commission of the European Union has called into question and cast doubt upon certain fiscal measures which are designed to promote economic activity and reduce our high level of unemployment, measures which were adopted by the Basque institutions by virtue of their sovereignty and autonomy in this area."
"This is a right which not even the Fascist dictatorship of General Franco dared to interfere with or violate in the historic Basque territories of Navarre or Álava."
"In these historic days when the Basques are opting for European construction as a democratic path to understanding, conciliation and peaceful co-existence with all Spaniards, as well as all the other peoples of Europe, the thing that we need least, the thing that could affect the peace which we are seeking and which we yearn for is for our remaining fiscal sovereignty, our economic harmony, not to be respected."
"We would have liked to have voted positively, in the affirmative, for this new European Commission which you have presented to us."
"But the replies given by those responsible for competition and other issues relating to the European regions have caused disquiet and concern in the Basque Country, and for this reason we have not been able to put our trust in them."
"But neither have we wanted to say no."
"We have not rejected your candidature or your proposal, since we prefer to seek opportunities for the future."
"For all of these reasons, Mr President Prodi, I ask for your support for the peace process in Euskadi, in the Basque Country."
"To this end, there are some proposals concerning programmes and actions which will benefit the peace process, which have been presented to your Directorate-General responsible for human rights."
"But, above all, there is one thing you can do for the sake of our peace and that is to promote the respect for the historic rights of the Basques, amongst which is fiscal sovereignty, which is the right of any other Member State of the EU."
"This is a sovereignty which we are willing to harmonise with everybody else, as long as it is through dialogue, understanding and agreement."
"Not through disrespect, inconsiderateness and even less, through imposition."
"We believe that peace warrants reflection with regard to all these issues."
"Thank you very much, Mr Prodi, for your attention."
"We trust that your well-known democratic disposition will help to find a satisfactory solution for all of us."
"Mr President, in the vote I registered an abstention."
"My reason for doing so was that the case for the appointment of this Commission needed to be proved ""beyond reasonable doubt"" and in my view, and that of my colleague Mr Hudghton, the correct verdict would have been ""not proven"" ."
"I recognise the quality and ability of many of the Commissioners and acknowledge that the majority in this Parliament has, on balance, decided to confirm the whole Commission."
"We shall therefore work with them gladly."
"However, I am still of the opinion that there are too many doubts about particular individuals and about the leadership of the Commission as a whole."
"These have persisted."
"I cannot, in all conscience, justify to my constituents in Scotland the casting of an affirmative vote today."
"On the other hand there is not yet compelling evidence to justify the total rejection of the Commission."
"In these circumstances a positive abstention seemed to be the right vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that four members of the old Commission have reappeared in the new Commission, despite the fact that they were part of that collegiate body which, on account of mismanagement, was forced to resign, is one of the reasons why we have refused to give our approval to this Commission for the current period."
"We were also not in a position to grant our approval for the period following on account of the fact that several of the candidates have not unequivocally declared themselves fully and individually responsible, as required by their office."
"Mr Prodi has therefore passed up the opportunity to usher in a new start for the Commission, which is needed."
"He would have had a green light to replace the members from the previous Commission and thereby give a signal of transparency and integrity to the citizens of Europe."
"In the end, it is the aim of this Commission to consolidate its power base in terms of a European supergovernment."
"We do not agree with this development, nor does it correspond to the will of the citizens of Europe."
"Even if the resolution required for approval is to be regarded as a task conferred upon the Prodi Commission, which we certainly reject, we cannot agree to this because in this way, the fundamental responsibilities of this Parliament are allocated to one of the EU' s administrative bodies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are a plethora of reasons for rejecting the Commission."
"First of all, I would like to again recall the political imbalance of the Commission."
"Following the landslide election victory of the Christian Democrats, this Commission does not reflect their majority standing in Parliament."
"As far as I am concerned, this is simply not acceptable."
"Furthermore, in Mr Busquin from Belgium and Mr Lamy from France, we have two people in the Commission who, it has been proven, are embroiled in scandal."
"If we here today want to embark on a new beginning, then, as I see it, such a new beginning will just not be possible with both of these gentlemen, and the citizens of Europe have a right to expect that we parliamentarians ensure that only persons of impeccable character feature in this Commission."
"This is not the case in this instance."
"Here, it is again a question of, if I may put it this way, cast-off national politicians."
"As a Parliament, we did not act the way we did in January so as to elect people in September who are worse than those whom we sent packing in January!"
"Mr President, I would like to explain why I abstained during the vote on the resolution."
"The resolution includes one point (b) which, in my opinion, undermines an essential foundation block of European institutional architecture: the Commission' s right of initiative, since the Commission must act as a College and have the sole right to put forward European legislation."
"Parliament believes it has won a great victory since it has obtained the guarantee that President Prodi is going to take account of the legislative initiatives of the European Parliament."
"This initiative of Parliament' s will surely not fail to elicit requests for the same consideration from Member States and national bureaucracies."
"You will see that as soon as this happens, the pressure exerted by the capitals of Europe upon the Commission will become greater than the pressure exerted by the European Parliament."
"I believe we must do all in our power to defend the Commission' s right of initiative, otherwise it will be no more than a mailbox, a merely executive body."
"This Parliament has considerable political influence on the Commission as long as it remains a political body, but this will no longer be the case when the Commission' s right of initiative is weakened."
"Mr President, one question before I give my explanation of vote."
"I would like to know in what capacity Mrs Schreyer is present."
"She has been approved, I voted for her, but she has not yet been appointed, it is absurd."
"Having said that, I am very happy for her to hear what I have to say."
"(Interjection by the President: There is one day of transition, Mr Bourlanges.)"
"Precisely, I think that all this is absurd, and this is the point of my explanation of vote."
"I have voted four times in favour of the Commission, as I have confidence in Mr Prodi and his team."
"I wanted, in my explanation of vote, to draw attention to the fact that this Parliament has not proceeded correctly in legal terms."
"Rule 214 is strict on this point: it stipulates the precise sequence of procedures and a distinction between the time when the President is nominated and the time when the College is approved."
"This is intended to protect the political authority of the President."
"By voting in this way, what we were doing was to approve the Commission each time before actually nominating the President."
"With our first vote we approved the nomination of Mr Prodi, whilst the Act of 19 July had already nominated the prospective Commissioners."
"We then went on to the third and fourth votes on the basis of the earlier decision of 19 July."
"I find that Parliament has not made itself look any better in this matter."
"We should have been more scrupulous than the Council in respecting the very strict terms of Rule 214."
"Mr President, today I would have liked to have approved the Commission without any reservations."
"Unfortunately, however, I have to register a reservation by abstaining since, although there are good Commissioners - Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Wallström have convinced me - I must say that I found the interventions of Mr Prodi more than disappointing."
"I do not consider it enough that he only presented declarations of intent, when really what he should have been talking about was the direction in which the reforms in the European Union are heading."
"For me, there were too many fine words, too little of substance and, therefore, through my abstention, I wanted to express my feeling that this is not enough and that over the next few years, the Commission must succeed in carrying out its promises as far as possible and not stand still on its words. Hopefully, Mr Prodi will then succeed in becoming a stronger figure within this European Union."
"Let me make it clear that I have not voted with a ""no"" , I would have preferred to give my approval with an unequivocal ""yes"" , yet I found Mr Prodi' s statement too disappointing."
"Mr President, I shall begin in French, in that beautiful language of yours, to say that it is my duty to inform you of my intention to stop speaking this language until such time as France recognises the Basque language."
"And neither will I do it in Spanish, in this Chamber, while the Basque language does not enjoy full recognition in our country."
"(FR) I must add that the spectacle offered this morning was shameful, particularly before Mrs Halonen."
"It shows a total lack of respect for a lady of this calibre."
"Euskal Herritarrok, the Basque Left, has voted against the appointment of the Commission even though we knew that Mr Prodi had succeeded in winning the confidence of the majority of this Parliament."
"We know now that the new Commission most certainly does not have the confidence of the majority of Europeans."
"After this morning' s spectacle I doubt that Parliament has the confidence of most Europeans, in other words those who believe that it is still possible to build a new European Union in which freedom and justice are the guiding principles."
"Mila esker"
"- (FR) Like my comrades in the European Socialist Party, who have been particularly attentive and assiduous on the occasion of the hearings of the candidate Commissioners, I am pleased with this procedure which has offered us a wealth of information regarding the personalities and intentions of these people we are to liase with."
"This ""final examination"" of the future College of the executive body before the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe is an important phase in the democratisation of the European institutions which the Socialists have made their key issue."
"The low-key performances of some of the candidates, still apparently reticent whenever they have to mention social or employment conditions in Europe, and even the most unconvincing hearing with Mrs Palacio, do not cancel out an overall impression which is generally satisfactory."
"Unlike the European Right which manifestly sought to conceal its divisions by the very virulence of its attacks, occasionally personal and insulting attacks, on some Commissioners, I intend to promote the path of dialogue and collaboration with the future Commission."
"The main thing is, in my view, to find once more a credible partner, putting an end to this interminable state of transition, and enabling the European executive to resume its onerous duties and finally make progress, in close consultation with the Members of the European Parliament, on the crucial matters of concern to Europe and its citizens."
"In this spirit, I am voting in favour of the appointment of the new Commission, without thereby offering them a ""blank cheque"" ."
"I mean to give myself the option of assessing the quality of the work done on a ""piecework"" basis."
"- (FR) I have personally listened to all the speeches by the President, Romano Prodi, and I have participated in all six hearings of the candidate Commissioners."
"The first conclusion I draw from this is that we are faced with a reliable team of Commissioners who, by and large, are competent in their own areas."
"The second conclusion is that the ideology expressed by this team and also many of their proposals are far removed from my own ideas regarding the construction and management of Europe, with an extremely worrying predominance of Liberalism over social aspects and citizen' s rights."
"This is why, even though I shall be voting at noon, with no qualms, in favour of the appointment of this Commission, wishing it every fortune and good luck, nonetheless in a few weeks I shall be paying particular attention to the programme which will be announced for the year 2000 and the legislature."
"My vote on this occasion, and any subsequent votes, will depend on the extent to which the proposals made to us reflect the propositions on the basis of which I was elected on June 13."
"For me, more than ever, the stakes of the next five years come under four items:"
"1 - a political Europe which is democratic, transparent and efficient;"
"2 - a social Europe which is solid and fair, and which defends those most at risk;"
"3 - a citizen' s Europe where every citizen feels completely European in everyday life;"
"4 - a Europe which is capable of expansion with grit and determination in order to guarantee peace."
"- The parliamentary group I belong to is leaning towards voting against Mr Prodi."
"I share a lot of the concerns and reservations expressed by the majority of my parliamentary group regarding the Commission' s programme and composition."
"However, I do not agree with voting against him."
"I know Romano Prodi well and greatly appreciate his leadership qualities and his democratic aims."
"President Prodi was head of the Italian Government at a decisive moment for Italy' s entry into Europe."
"At that time, I firmly supported the work of his government and I tirelessly fought to prevent his centre-left government from entering a crisis - just about a year ago - through an initiative of the political group led by Mr Bertinotti."
"I did not lose confidence in him them, and I do not intend to deny him my confidence today."
"Romano Prodi was nominated President of the Commission by the current government of the Italian Republic, which my party is an active member of. And I confess that his strength of character can guarantee strong leadership of the Commission, overcoming the limitations and inadequacies we have noted in the programme and the composition of the Commission."
"And so, in contrast with the positions taken by the majority of our parliamentary group GUE/NGL, we Italian Communist Members make a reasoned and vigilant abstention."
"- (ES) I have given my positive vote to the Commission presided over by Mr Prodi, firstly, because the President clearly has the characteristics required to meet the challenges which the European Union must face on the threshold of the third millennium, and because, in general, the Commissioners have given evidence of their ability to respond to those challenges in an effective way."
"It is not simply a matter of ensuring, within the framework of economic globalisation, a degree of growth which is capable of creating lasting and sustainable employment, or proposing profound institutional reform at the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"Nor is it just a matter of going forward with the issue of enlargement of the Union in order to contribute to the well-being of Europe as a whole, despite the undeniable importance of these challenges."
"What is needed, above all, is the advancement of the process of European construction with regard to feelings and conscience."
"It is a matter, as Prodi said himself yesterday, of creating one soul and one heart: the European heart and soul."
"It is also a question of offering genuine peace and prosperity to the neighbouring populations and establishing links of co-operation on a global level in order to create a decent society for all, a world which enjoys peace and liberty."
"Mr Prodi, both through his loyalty to the principles which brought about the current European Union and through his proven capacity for management, will, I am sure, lead the new Commission along the path and at the pace which current circumstances require."
"Therefore, in spite of individual questions which concern certain Commissioners which, in any case, belong to the past, I have given my vote of confidence to the new Commission in the knowledge, furthermore, that Parliament has the necessary mechanisms in place to withdraw that confidence in the event that it is betrayed."
"The restoration of the hope and confidence of the European citizens now depends on the Commission which, under the direction of President Prodi, today embarks on its course."
"This Commission has been granted, by this Parliament, the democratic legitimacy and transparency which the citizens demand."
"The President of the Commission' s intervention sums up all of the committees' work which provided the opportunity to assess the political positions of the various Commissioners."
"On the whole, the fundamental political positions which have been responsible for the current problems were defended, particularly those on unemployment and social exclusion."
"The complete lack of confidence that our citizens have in the European institutions, which was clearly demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections, requires not only ""a modern and efficient administration"" , but new policies which will respond positively to the socio-economic problems currently experienced by the European Union' s Member States."
"This is why the central features of the positions held are still neo-liberal and federalist policies, although in a few cases, there were hints of social concern in the speeches, but without any concrete suggestions as to how they might be implemented."
"Only yesterday, Romano Prodi clarified his position when he claimed that it was necessary to ""restructure the single market and to promote liberalisation"" , and deliberately emphasised the need to continue the process of liberalisation in the goods and service sectors."
"If we maintain the criteria of Maastricht and the Stability Pact, the European Employment Pact loses any credibility it might have had, and this, together with the insistence on the flexibility of working conditions makes it clear that what is at stake is an increasing deregulation of working conditions."
"In turn, no progress has been made on the need to assess the movement of capital, in terms of national social programmes having to adapt to current demographic trends, which proves that, in fact, their objective is not greater social justice, but quite the opposite: greater social inequality."
"In the area of farming, there was still an insistence on the great objectives of the CAP - common agricultural policy - and on a greater liberalisation of the markets, which upholds the injustices in the distribution of aid and subsidies, with an obvious bias against family-based farming and against countries such as Portugal where small-holdings represent the most common kind of farming."
"Concerning foreign and defence policies, the insistence on the federalist approach was emphasised, as was the strengthening of the CFSP' s militaristic positions, instead of a decisive pledge for policies of co-operation."
"These are the main reasons for a vote against the new Commission."
"- (FR) I would like to report my great satisfaction at having been able to participate in the great democratic event we have just experienced, which is unparalleled on the European political scene."
"The European institutions, particularly the European Commission and the European Parliament, emerge with increased statures from the hearings of the Commissioners-designate, and the European citizens who followed them (in the press) may find in them, I hope, good reasons to become more interested in the building of Europe."
"For these reasons, taking account of the generally acknowledged competence of the Commissioners and the intention expressed by the majority of them to work in close collaboration with Parliament, I voted in favour of the appointment of the European Commission."
"It was all the easier for me since the procedure selected for these hearings provided an opportunity to remind the Commission of its undertaking to present, by the end of 1999, a raft of proposals intended to finally give substance to Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam which establishes the specificity of the most remote regions, and their right to specific conditions of exemption, to enable them to deal with their structural problems."
"In addition, with regard to the OCT associated to the European Union, Commissioner Nielson acknowledged the need to present as quickly as possible a wide range of proposals intended to give these countries a status appropriate to their current situation, with a view to the forthcoming Association Agreement and, in particular, the consequent renewal of the financial instrument allocated to their development."
"On both these subjects, which I attach particular importance to, the proposals of the competent Commissioners seemed to me to augur well for the future collaboration between Commission and Parliament."
"- (SV) In spite of the fact that some of the Commissioners-designate have shown that they are well qualified and ecologically aware and would certainly make good Commissioners, for example Margot Wallström and Michaela Schreyer, we cannot support the Prodi Commission, to some degree because of the total lack of ecological and social awareness in Romano Prodi' s manifesto and in other respects because of the presence of Commissioners-designate who have not been completely convincing as to their suitability and readiness to act with complete honesty before Parliament."
"What is more, there have been elements of Romano Prodi' s conduct which, with good reason, have been interpreted as his striving to establish himself as a sort of head of government, something which has no basis in the current EU treaties and which would mean going further down the road to turning the EU into a state."
"We are therefore voting against the Prodi Commission for the period of 23 January 2000 to 22 January 2005."
"On the other hand, we will not oppose there being a sort of ""caretaker"" Commission for the period up until 22 January 2000. This ought not, of course, to be the present Santer Commission, which must withdraw immediately."
"We have therefore abstained in the vote concerning the remainder of the present period of office."
". My main consideration in passing judgement on the Prodi Commission is whether this team of 20 has convinced me of its ability to significantly restore public confidence in the European Union and its institutions."
"Regrettably, following the individual hearings and the various statements of Mr Prodi, I remain unconvinced."
"The strong pressure on MEPs to approve the new Commission, thus allowing a return to 'normal' business, must be balanced against the many doubts and reservations which surround aspects of the Prodi team."
"Mr Prodi views the Commission as a Government for Europe."
"That concept is not one which I would be inclined to vote in favour of, but even if I did feel so inclined, I could not give a positive vote for this Commission-Designate to fulfil such a role."
"I want to see real and radical improvement in management and financial control within the Commission."
"I want to see genuine change in the Commission' s attitude towards the European Parliament."
"I want a Commission which is seen to be relevant to the lives and aspirations of our citizens."
"The only verdict which I can apply to Mr Prodi' s team is 'Not Proven' and accordingly register my abstention."
". Over the winter of 1998/99 the European Parliament came of age, bringing about the resignation of the Santer Commission and in so doing established its proper place in the European political order."
"I fear however we have failed as an institution in the manner in which we have scrutinised the Prodi Commission, which has been unstructured, insufficiently in-depth and inconsistent."
"That has made it impossible for me to endorse the Member States' nominations."
"Before the next Commission is scrutinised I believe Parliament must instruct the Rules Committee to draw up comprehensive procedures covering all aspects of a much more thorough and in-depth series of hearings."
"Unless that is done we shall destroy public confidence in us and let down the European public whom I believe have not been well served by Parliament' s actions in respect of the Prodi Commission."
"- (FR) The vote on the ratification of the Commission is not a vote of approval for the Commission' s programme, since Parliament will be consulted on this at the end of the year."
"What we have to do today is to assess whether the Commissioners-designate are up to the task of fulfilling their assignments competently and with due seriousness."
"There is nothing in what we have learnt during the Commissioners' hearings to justify, at this stage, a veto on any one of them in particular."
"Let us say that they can enjoy the benefit of the doubt at this early stage."
"The fact remains that, in his speech to the European Parliament, Romano Prodi made statements which can only disappoint and worry those who are waiting for rapid and bold responses from the European Union in order to re-align Europe to be at the service of people and humanity rather than of finance and of the great God, money, for Europe to put itself forward as an alternative to world-wide liberalisation."
"Mr Prodi' s silence on the subject of the need to defend the European Social Model, his irritating reticence, his frequent omissions on the subject of a European policy to promote employment and his tentative generalities on institutional change, give us rather more than reservations."
"This is why in the vote on the nomination of Mr Prodi, I voted against."
"In anticipation of the essential reorientation of the political paths of the Commission and of the debate on the action to be taken, a vote in favour today must be interpreted as a choice not to multiply crises, blockages, in our institutions, and as a refusal to look for individual scapegoats when it is the orientation of Europe in terms of politics and civilisation which is in question."
"This vote is, to some extent, purely administrative."
"My vote is not therefore a challenge to the Commissioners-designate. Nor is it a vote of confidence."
"I expect the new Commission to earn this confidence."
"The Commission must be aware that there are many of us who will not hesitate to penalise it if its actions should prove to be as disappointing as its current political performance."
". My decision to vote against this Commission was not taken lightly."
"But having listened closely both to the debate here today, and to the answers we have been given from the Commissioners designate in the Parliamentary Hearings over the past few weeks, I still have a number of grave concerns and reservations."
"There are two aspects to these concerns: on the one side, the political side, of course we could not expect a Green Commission."
"But what we did expect was the demonstration of a greater awareness of how to prioritise and implement key issues of social justice and environmental sustainability."
"On the other side, the assessment of the Commissioners' ability to live up to the enormous expectations that now lie upon them to introduce a very different kind of behaviour and culture in the new Commission, we did expect the demonstration of an ability to introduce genuine, far-reaching, radical reform."
"And so, in order to be able to vote in favour of this Commission, I would need to be able to say that, as a bloc, these are Commissioners whose commitment to introduce exactly such fundamental reforms I can endorse."
"I would need to be able to say that these are all Commissioners whose integrity and good judgement are beyond reproach."
"I would need to be able to say that these are Commissioners whom I, and the citizens of Europe, can wholeheartedly trust."
"I greatly regret that what I have heard and read over the past few weeks and months means that, for a number of Commissioners in the proposed new Commission, I cannot yet say these things."
"And because I cannot say these things, I cannot justify to the electorate who voted for me a vote in favour of this new Commission."
"- (DE) I have just voted against the composition of this Commission and abstained from voting for Romano Prodi."
"My reason for this: in May of this year, Commission President Prodi received a convincing vote from the European Parliament to initiate a comprehensive reform programme with a new team for a Commission in need of cleaning up."
"Yet the Commission is already tarnished."
"Mr Prodi did not react to the outcome of the hearings."
"In view of the considerable doubt expressed as to the competence of the Belgian Philippe Busquin for the research department and the plethora of accusations regarding his affairs, he should have rejected the candidates."
"Furthermore, he accepted without reservation the proposal from the French government to nominate Pascal Lamy as Commissioner responsible for foreign trade, even though he is the architect of the ""Jacques Delors System"" , and therefore responsible for the emergence of a completely confusing financial structure within the Commission."
"This system is the real reason behind the serious lack of organisation which led to the resignation of the Santer Commission."
"Nothing has come of the grandiose promise of ""a fair balance across the political spectrum"" ."
"The majority of the Commission is from the Left."
"Romano Prodi did not raise any objection to the German Chancellor when the latter nominated a Green and a Social Democrat purely on the grounds of party political affiliation."
"Word has now got out about Schröder' s lack of any definite line and sheer power tendencies, and Germans the length and breadth of the country are now making him pay."
"In contrast to his predecessor Helmut Kohl who, five years ago, accepted the opposition' s nomination for the Commission - and it was not easy for me to vote for Monika Wulf-Mathies in 1994 - Schröder was not prepared to give consideration to the views of today' s opposition, the CDU/CSU, the victors in the European elections in Germany."
"Elmar Brok would have been a more excellent nomination and one capable of winning a majority."
"It is intended that Michaele Schreyer will take responsibility for budgetary issues, an area in which she can only supervise and not shape policy; she could do nothing to alleviate misgivings relating to her ability to take responsibility for budgetary issues."
"Günter Verheugen is being pushed into the sphere of enlargement where the decisive steps have already long since been taken."
"He will not even be responsible for his own Directorate-General and is, therefore, only a junior Commissioner."
"I cannot accept this second-class arrangement for the largest Member State in the EU, no doubt a result of Schröder' s pigheadedness."
"The upshot of all this: I have to reject this Commission."
"This vote does not concern expressly the Italian Mario Monti (Trade), the Luxembourger Viviane Reding (Culture and Education) and the British national Chris Patten (External Affairs) who, and I myself am convinced of this, left behind an indelible impression of competence and an ability to communicate."
"In spite of the misgivings mentioned, I did not say ""no"" to Romano Prodi. Instead I abstained."
"I recognise that he has taken on board five demands from the Group of the European People' s Party, inter alia, with regard to the legislative right of nomination of the European Parliament, the conduct of the Commissioners in the case of a vote of no-confidence and the necessary permanent dialogue concerning Commission reform."
"I hope that Mr Prodi will become someone who is willing and able to undertake reform and who will give Europe' s citizens new confidence in clear and efficient European institutions."
"- (NL) Yesterday, I referred in my statement to how positive we consider the approach of Mr Prodi and his new team to be."
"Nevertheless, I abstained from this vote."
"After all, the representatives of the European Free Alliance want a Europe which is not just one made up of States."
"Moreover, I personally cannot place my trust in certain Commissioners because I have doubts as to how effective the fight against fraud will be under their leadership."
"That is why I abstained from the vote."
". I will be voting for the new Commission."
"The Commitments given by Mr Prodi to change the culture in the Commission to ensure more transparency and better financial management are very welcome."
"Mr Prodi' s desire to pursue enlargement of the Community, to give job creation the highest priority and to work closely with a the Parliament on the Intergovernmental Conference are also encouraging."
"The individual commissioners' acceptance of their personal responsibilities and commitment to work closely with Parliament show they understand the new environment within which the Commission will have to operate."
"The new Commission has not been given a blank cheque; they have been judged fit to be appointed."
"Their ability to do their job will be judged later."
"That judgement will be based on whether this Commission brings Europe closer to the people, tackles fraud and inefficiency within its own service and above all equips Europe for tackling crime, unemployment and social exclusion."
"- (DE) Along with the rest of the CSU European Group, I voted against the Commission twice because its composition is lop-sided and in no way reflects the clear electoral will demonstrated on 13 June."
"In addition, there are misgivings relating to individual Commissioners, above all strong misgivings were expressed against Mr Busquin, the replacement of whom ought to have been a matter of central concern for Mr Prodi as well."
"As regards the second vote concerning Mr Prodi himself, I abstained because, whilst admittedly wanting to give him my full backing for the rest of his term of office, I did not want to vote on the coming five-year period until January and I am extremely sceptical of the procedure adopted here today."
"I would like to wish President Prodi, Vice-President Palacio, who is responsible for Parliament, and whose qualities I have every confidence in, and all the other Commissioners who will have responsibilities in my areas of activity - Mr Patten, Mr Verheugen and, above all, our long-serving colleagues Mrs Reding and Mr Vitorino - the best of luck and much success and I would like to offer them good and constructive co-operation."
"- (FR) Mr Prodi spoke of the Commission as if it were a real government."
"Mr Poettering, on behalf of the PPE, welcomed this drift in direction."
"For our part, we condemn it resolutely."
"What, in fact is Mr Prodi asking for?"
"Ever greater powers, ever more areas of competence for the Commission, that is to say, ever greater centralisation and ever more regulation."
"Mr Prodi is, in fact, recommending continuing and amplifying the drift in direction which resulted in the proliferation of irregularities and fraud denounced by the Committee of Independent Experts and which was behind the resignation of the Santer Commission."
"Far from proposing to correct this drift in the direction of the institution, far from refocusing the Commission on the limited tasks allocated to it by the Treaties and on the organisational strictness with which it should acquit itself, Mr Prodi' s attitude conforms completely to the customary approach of perpetually exceeding the areas of competence enshrined in the Treaties to the advantage of the Commission."
"Worse than this, he is proposing, like Delors before him, to accentuate this divergence."
"This is the first reason for our refusal to vote in favour of a Commission which defines its objectives with scant regard for the Treaties."
"The second reason for our vote against is related to a number of worrying statements made by the Commissioners-designate during the hearings before the European Parliament."
"What Mr Prodi and some others complacently presented as a model democratic exercise (Mr Prodi even spoke of an impressive exercise in democracy) was in fact a great bout of mutual congratulation on Federalist one-upmanship."
"A number of candidate Commissioners - and the prize in this respect surely goes to Commissioner-designate Barnier - blithely disregarded the Treaties in order to recommend, firstly the general application of co-decision (in particular, Mr Fischler), then the development of a European constitution intended to replace that of the Member States, then the replacement of national sovereignty by ""European sovereignty"" (sic)."
"Are we dreaming here?"
"These calls to free ourselves from the institutional balance decided by the governments of our states, these undertakings in favour of permanent institutional instability, to the benefit of supranational European bodies and to the detriment of national democracies, are grounds for serious concern."
"It is not healthy for democracy for these hearings to have been twisted into massive schemes of political blackmail, with the Commission and Parliament undertaking to back each other up in their insatiable thirst for power, subverting the frameworks established by the national governments elected by the people of our states."
"We cannot sanction such drifts in direction."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Draft supplementary and amending budgets (SAB) 1/99, 3/99 and 4/99"
"The next item is the report (A5-0009/99) by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft supplementary and amending budgets 1, 3 and 4 to the budget of the European Communities for the 1999 financial year. (C5-0021/1999, C5-0074/1999 y C5-0130/1999)."
"Mr President, please allow me to highlight a few points as rapporteur of the 1999 budget."
"Firstly the 1999 budget was defined at the time as a ""bridge"" towards the new financial requirements, that is towards the financing of Agenda 2000."
"Secondly, it was also a bridge with regard to the political priorities which this Parliament wanted to establish with a view to the future, with a view to the new millennium, especially in category 4 - external activities - where the European Parliament made an effort to increase the commitment appropriations."
"And finally, the European Parliament also increased the payment appropriations in the 1999 budget in view of the clear shortfall of one billion in payment appropriations, a shortfall which had appeared, above all, in the Social Funds."
"Now, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves with four supplementary and amending budgets (SABs), with 41 transferrals and a fifth amending budget."
"This is a record."
"It is also a record that we have taken less than 150 hours to arrive at the first and only reading of this SAB 4."
"On the one hand, we have amending budget no."
"1. This does not cause any problem, it is a normal procedure, it is the surplus of the 1998 budget which, normally, is returned to the Member States."
"But it deserves to be taken into account when we speak of the other amending budgets."
"As for SAB 3, I will leave it to my colleague, Mr Fabra Vallés, to go into more detail. I will turn directly to SAB 4, which proposes 137 million in commitment appropriations for the creation of an Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, for macro-financial aid for the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and 30 million in humanitarian aid for Turkey as a result of the earthquake."
"And, in payment appropriations, aid of 180 million for PHARE, the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo."
"And, apart from that, 15 posts for OLAF."
"Mr President, once we have looked at the fact that all the contents of SAB 4 were to be reallocated within category 4, in view of the fact that Parliament and the Council have decided to finance these within title B-1 Agriculture, I will change the subject a little because my problem is not with the SABs."
"My problem is not the urgency, and is not the fact that we have to provide aid through finance which was not anticipated."
"I have another pressing problem, Mr President."
"It is that when I read page 12 of the Spanish version of the preliminary draft supplementary and amending budget no. 4/99, I realise that we are only dealing with the tip of the iceberg."
"Because here the Commission tells us literally that, despite the fact that we have made this financing effort through reallocation, a further sum of 570.5 million is required, which the Commission intends to reallocate in the global transferral or in a supplementary transferral during this financial year."
"The Commission also recognises that the reallocation of this sum is not yet possible in category 4, but says that an extensive effort should be made to make a reallocation within the budget as a whole."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this terrifies me, because at the end of the financial year of the 1999 budget - to refer to a Spanish proverb - ""not even the rapporteur is going to recognise her own budget"" ."
"With so many reallocations, the most serious matter is the fact that the European Parliament' s own priorities, voted for in December, no longer exist."
"They have been totally changed because the budgetary authority of Parliament has been undermined by this continuous reallocation."
"I warn you of this, Mr President, in consideration of the 2000 budget."
"On pages 8 and 12, there is an equally terrifying problem: we have increased the payment appropriations."
"In this case, the Commission says that even so it is calculated that we are still missing 650.5 million in payment appropriations."
"Add to this the fact that an SEM 2000 forecast says that the possible shortfall in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds in 1999 is going to be even greater than in 1997 and 1998."
"Mr President, this ""burden of the future"" which you talked about years ago in the Committee on Budgets, is now the burden of the present, because I believe that we have ignored your ""warning"" and we have not been sufficiently strong as a Parliament to prevent this false saving on the part of the Council, which presents a payment budget while carefully forgetting that the commitments have to be fulfilled."
"This is the plea I would make with regard to the 2000 budget: we must not carry on like this."
"As rapporteur for the 1999 budget, the 2000 budget must - as I see it - anticipate a review of the Financial Perspective."
"It has been announced and the figures are there."
"It must include a considerable increase in payment appropriations, not only to prevent the burden from becoming even heavier, but also to prevent the paralysing of payments in the Community' s programmes."
"I hope that the 1999 budget will serve at least to prevent these mistakes in the future."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you - if I am not mistaken - on your first Presidency."
"The truth is that it appears that you have been doing it all your life."
"Therefore, congratulations."
"With regard to the SAB 3/99, Mr President, there are two cases, which are not of that type which we have often criticised in the Committee on Budgets for the use and abuse of the supplementary and amending budgets, but which I believe are well justified cases."
"On the one hand, the Court of Justice, which is going to renew its entire informatics system with regard to word processing."
"This is totally justifiable, not only because it is currently a system which is not prepared for the ""year 2000 effect"" , but also because the new system takes into account the compatibility of systems and, what' s more, it is a complicated system which will cover the whole process from the beginning, from the conception of the text up to its publication, without any other system being involved, and I believe this will put the Court of Justice in the best possible position to carry out its work."
"This increase which has been requested in this supplementary and amending budget amounts to EUR 1,675,000 which is not all for equipment, since a proportion - EUR 135,000 - will be dedicated to the training of staff."
"This is all that would remain in this SAB if it had been taken into account earlier, since we began to speak about it in 1998, but it could not be covered in the 1999 budget without recourse to an SAB."
"Well, this is due to delays because, firstly, an auditing company which understood the matter had to be used and the best system had to be chosen and also an invitation to tender had to be issued."
"This has led to the delay and we therefore are faced with this supplementary and amending budget which the Committee on Budgets is fully prepared to grant."
"The second case refers to the Committee of the Regions."
"We all know that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee has a common organisational structure, the COS, but that as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam and its implementation, it was decided that this common organisational structure would be dismantled."
"Therefore the Committee of the Regions ended up without a financial controller or an accounting officer, and it is very difficult to function without a financial controller or an accounting officer."
"This is why the Committee of the Regions has requested an A3 as a financial controller, an A5 as an accounting officer and a C5 as a secretary."
"The Committee on Budgets fully agrees with the Council and believes that we should allow an A4 as financial controller, an A5 as accounting officer and for the moment not allow this C5."
"I would ask the person responsible for the 2000 budget to bear in mind the needs of the Committee of the Regions and consider whether this post can figure amongst posts included in the 2000 budget for that Committee."
"We have often been a little mean in the granting of staffing increases but it is also true that sometimes we do not allow the institutions to function totally efficiently through a lack of personnel."
"This is therefore an issue which should be looked into thoroughly."
"I do not wish to end, Mr President, without addressing a few words to the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, whom I believe to be on his last day in charge of budgets."
"I can only say two things to him: one, that the task has been difficult and, two, that the result has been good."
"I would not say very good, but I would say good."
"You have played your role in the task and how many people would want to do the job you have done?"
"Therefore, I would like to express my thanks and my congratulations."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fabra."
"I am grateful for your opening words."
"Actually, after 14 years as a member of the Committee on Budgets, this is the first debate that I will follow as President."
"But this is my second Presidency in this Chamber."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a couple of basic observations regarding this matter of supplementary and amending budgets."
"It is surely correct and necessary to react to urgent and pressing demands relating to financial policy, in particular as prompted by the situations we are faced with in Kosovo and also in Turkey."
"Nevertheless, one cannot help thinking that we are faced with a certain amount of confusion."
"Parliament, understandably, given past experiences as well, is always very quick to suspect that conscious redistribution from sections of the budget where funds are still available is actually practised since the budget undoubtedly contains unpopular priorities on the part of Parliament which other institutions do not necessarily remember to transpose."
"The worse thing is actually not supplementary and amending budget no. 4, but the fact that I cannot today make any assessment whatsoever whether we are to end this year with the fifth supplementary budget or whether we will not get to no."
"7 by December, for the Commission itself in its working document regarding the setting of borrowing requirements provided very different estimates."
"It is not possible to estimate what payments may still have to be made to the PHARE programme."
"Madam rapporteur has already mentioned the 650 million."
"In this respect, we should all actually feel uneasy. Commissioner, I believe that in order for us to arrive at a well-ordered and rational procedure, it is absolutely necessary that the Commission gets down to clearing-up operations by December, before the second reading, so as to avoid finding ourselves in a similar situation next year to the one we have this year, particularly as the Commission itself is saying that it can certainly not be estimated what payments will be needed for the year 2000."
"I would also like to set great store by the fact, Commissioner, this being a matter of concern for the Committee on Budgetary Control, that the Commission declares itself ready, in presenting the fifth supplementary and amending budget, to introduce the extra 15 posts called for in the agreement by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"As far as we are concerned, this is one of the prerequisites if we are to come to a decision in October."
"I would also like to establish a connection with tomorrow' s debate, Mr President."
"Tomorrow, we are discussing and voting on the proposal relating to the Agency for Reconstruction for Kosovo."
"I would like to make it very clear that we, through the fourth supplementary and amending budget, were spontaneously and quickly in a position to increase the appropriate resources and to make said resources available."
"But it is also in the interests of the Commission itself that the proposals, both with regard to financial responsibility and as regards the structure of the Agency for Reconstruction, are urgently revised by Parliament, for making the resources available is not in itself sufficient to make the undertaking efficient, transparent and responsible."
"We will come back to this point tomorrow."
"Mr President, when I came in I was immediately confronted by three surprises."
"Firstly I saw you sitting there, instead of out here for our budget debate."
"The one great advantage of that is that because you are there and not here the Socialists now get more speaking time since you would have had speaking time in this debate."
"The second surprise is to see Commissioner Liikanen, after I praised him yesterday."
"I was about to welcome Mrs. Schreyer to her first debate and all of a sudden I see him there."
"The third surprise is the fact that there is no one here from the Council, because this debate is on SABs."
"I say that with a lot of sadness because the Council deserves to be criticised over SAB1 and SAB3."
"I have said this at a trialogue meeting, we have said it in our committee and I now wish it to go on public record."
"The way the Council behaved over SAB 1 and 3 was nothing short of disgraceful."
"It was a slap in the face to this Parliament."
"For those who do not understand what I am talking about, I am referring to the timing of their submissions for both the supplementary and amending budgets, which meant that we would not have the chance to debate them in full."
"We will vote on them this week but it will be to all intents and purposes a formality."
"I hope it does not happen again."
"If I thought they were going to do the same thing next year, i.e. submit an SAB at the end of July, I would not hesitate to call a special meeting of the Budgets Committee within the 45-day timetable to make sure that we blocked it so that we could discuss it in full."
"It did nothing for the trust that we are trying to build up between the two institutions."
"It just led to antagonism and suspicion."
"Having said all that, when it comes to SAB4 the speed with which the institutions have worked has been quite commendable."
"The Council took on board what we were asking and got it through within a week and tomorrow we will be voting on SAB4."
"This is indeed encouraging."
"We welcome the cooperation that has gone on in SAB4."
"We welcome the use of category 1 funds for external expenditure and we welcome that speed."
"However, two things need to be said about SAB4."
"One is that the 15 extra posts for OLAF are there, which we accept, but we need to stress that there has to be an SAB5."
"SAB5 should be imminent because of the Commission' s needs for payments but within the resolution that we will vote on we will insist on an SAB5 and an extra 15 posts for OLAF."
"This is a political decision which the committee and the Budget Control Committee have to make and the message that therefore needs to be taken to Mrs Schreyer, if not from you, Commissioner, then at least from the Commission services, is that we would want an early meeting with Mrs Schreyer to talk about the contents of an SAB5 to be placed before Parliament as soon as possible and, more importantly, to include the extra staff for OLAF."
"I believe that we all share the surprise of the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"And I hope that the officials of the Council who are present will take note and communicate it to the relevant minister."
"Mister President, amending budget 4 proposes that hundreds of millions of euros should be reallocated."
"This newcomer had to make up her mind on the matter based on this little piece of paper."
"It seems to me that that is not an exercise to be repeated."
"The proposal provides for the reallocation of commitment appropriations to the value of EUR 137 million, 30 million of which is for Turkey, largely for relief action in the form of temporary accommodation now that winter is on its way, emergency aid in other words."
"Yet only 15 million in payment appropriations is being reserved, and under certain conditions at that."
"Therefore, we can expect another amending budget soon. Otherwise, companies and organisations are going to have to wait rather a long time before they are paid."
"There will have to be another amending budget for Kosovo, too."
"30 million is now being released in payment appropriations, but we need 50 million."
"Plugging holes and robbing Peter to pay Paul creates a lack of transparency in relation to the budget and also compromises budgetary authority, a point clearly made by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop."
"Turning now to the content of amending budget 4, the original proposal provided for a reduction in the amount spent on co-operation with Latin America and Asia."
"This was certainly unacceptable as far as we were concerned."
"What we want is to see that this money is actually spent, and to see the Commission do its best, put its shoulder to the wheel, create the posts and ensure that the money is indeed spent on those things that the budgetary authority intended it to be spent on."
"Our group welcomes the fact that, as Mr Wynne said, the Council has certainly been quick to take up the Committee on Budgets' idea and to look into the agricultural guarantee fund' s underspending."
"But soon, when the time comes to deal with Budget 2000, the same discussion will start up again."
"Once again, the Council and Parliament will have to reach agreement on expenditure on external activities, and the reconstruction of Kosovo will feature here again, too."
"It is likely, under these circumstances, that the Council will place the money set aside for co-operation with Latin America, Asia and Africa, in jeopardy for good."
"Cutbacks are also being made in spending on projects for furthering the peace process in the Middle East, and on projects for reintegrating demoralised soldiers and refugees into society."
"The support for NGOs is on the decline."
"I want to take the opportunity now to say that the Green Group will not support this."
"Consequently, some of the 500 million needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo will be borne by those countries for which the European Union is providing development assistance. We do not believe that to be fair."
"The Green Group does not support the short-sighted slogan: ""I want my money back"" ."
"We want to ensure that the people of Europe get value for their money, and we are quite prepared to discuss making cutbacks in, or abolishing, aid programmes that are not going well."
"But the 10% linear reduction, the drip-feed method, shows that there has been no serious weighing up of priorities."
"Kosovo is a special case."
"Even at the time when the Financial Perspective was being discussed, people said that it would probably be necessary to increase spending in category 4 for the purposes of the reconstruction work there."
"I think we are indeed going to have to lay the Interinstitutional Agreement on the table for a short and limited period of time."
"In view of this discussion, I would like to remind you that one of the matters we are dealing with this week concerns actually giving back 1.6 billion in payment appropriations to the Member States."
"Surely it would not be an insurmountable problem to devote part of that surplus to Kosovo."
"The Greek version did not reach us until just an hour ago, and I believe that it is something that we must pay particular attention to. I understand that it may have been due to the urgency of the procedure, but we are a new Parliament, we are just starting out, and I believe that some principles and procedural mechanisms must be upheld."
"I would also like to make two comments on the amending and supplementary budget 4/99 and I believe that the matter should be discussed with a representative of the Council."
"We see various activities: for example, we have been informed that the Yugoslav Opposition is organising conferences and demonstrations in Brussels."
"My question concerns how these activities are being funded."
"These Parliament-approved appropriations are reserved solely for Yugoslavia for strictly humanitarian action, but on what political criteria do the Commission and the Council of Ministers base their decisions as to when and how they should be used?"
"Other fundamental issues, however, such as the continuing phenomenon of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, directed against the Serbian, Gypsy and Turkish communities, are not being addressed at all."
"The second point I would like to make concerns the EUR 30 million which is being given to Turkey as humanitarian aid."
"It is a sound move, a positive act, as is the involvement of the European Investment Bank and the use of other programmes."
"However, we must not forget the principles laid down by Parliament as regards relations with Turkey and which the Turkish Government should be taking into consideration. We saw no signs of this in the meeting two days ago with the Turkish Foreign Minister."
"Mr Alavanos, I am sorry that the text is not available in all language versions."
"You know that the Committee on Budgets discussed this report last night, but I can guarantee that, before the vote, you will have it in all versions."
"I am sorry that this has not happened yet."
"Mr President, these supplementary and amending budgets relate to urgent problems, of that there can be no doubt."
"Both the reconstruction of Kosovo and the provision of humanitarian aid to north-west Turkey must be undertaken without delay in view of the disasters that have taken place in those regions, and it is the European Union' s moral duty to provide the financial means for doing so."
"Hence the resolution put forward by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés deserves all our support."
"Amending it will lead to unwelcome delay."
"Nevertheless, we have a problem with certain aspects of the package."
"For example, we are not at all happy that the extra appropriations for Kosovo, Turkey and the Republic of Macedonia are to be financed in full by appropriations from category 1, agricultural expenditure."
"That is at odds with the spirit of the Financial Perspective."
"Additional appropriation requirements should, in the first instance, be met by making economies in programmes which come under the same budgetary heading, i.e. category 4 in this case."
"Initially, the Commission took this line as well, but came to abandon it under pressure from the Committee on Budgets, even though there is a great deal of scope for making economies within category 4."
"The MEDA programme, among others, comes to mind here."
"This programme' s low rate of utilisation gives cause for concern."
"At the beginning of September, only 24% of the payment appropriations for 1999 had been spent."
"Given this fact, it would surely be appropriate to reallocate this money."
"It is clear from the current state of affairs as regards these payment appropriations in category 4 that a thorough and on-going discussion between the Commission, the Council and Parliament needs to get underway."
"How is it that practically all the payment appropriations for 1999 for programmes such as TACIS and the programmes for former Yugoslavia have been used up now, when this is by no means the case as far as MEDA is concerned?"
"Can it be put down to poor administration on the part of the Commission?"
"Or, and I suspect this to be the more likely scenario, does the budgetary authority fail to take adequate account of the actual appropriation requirements and absorption capacity of the various programmes when it adopts the budget?"
"Bearing in mind that we are due to embark on the budgetary procedure for 2000, this must be resolved as soon as possible."
"One of the new Commission' s first challenges."
"Mr President, life is indeed not always easy."
"As a new Member of Parliament and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I discovered relatively quickly that the organisational arrangements and support offered to new Members are distinctly lacking."
"In order to be able to vote ""yes"" or ""no"" in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would have to familiarise myself with several years' worth of Budgets of the European Union in a few days, and this without the support of this Chamber."
"I could not do this, of course."
"I am basically an optimist and believe that it is very feasible to familiarise oneself with this subject matter, although I am conscious of the interventions of several Members, the gist of which is that in the Committee matters are handled like in a cattle market, where funds are passed back and forth, and that documents are, to some extent, prepared worse than in a good many municipal councils."
"I would propose, however, that, in future, new members are quickly provided with the necessary information and training which will allow them to carry out their duties in the respective Committee and participate in voting."
"The citizens of Europe expect this of us, even those taking up office as new Members and, at the end of the day, will thank us if you take up and transpose this initiative of mine."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"Before proceeding with the next item, I would like to remind you that Mr Liikanen is here today for the last time as Commissioner for Budgets."
"I hope that we will continue to see him in his new role."
"Given that we have had our quarrels over the last five years as well as some excellent co-operation, I would like to say good-bye to him and to wish him every success in his new task."
"Until the next part-session, Mr Liikanen."
"Situation in East Timor (continued)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the declaration of the Council regarding the situation in East Timor."
"Mr President, I was a member of the European Parliament' s delegation which observed at first hand the referendum in East Timor which took place on 30 August."
"There, I was able to acquire up-to-date information and to witness the bravery and conviction of the people there and the extent of their resistance."
"They have resisted 24 years of Indonesia' s violent occupation; they have suffered and died for wanting to be themselves."
"They have never given up the struggle nor bowed their heads."
"As the international community finally woke up to Indonesia' s oppression, the idea that freedom was on its way grew in their minds."
"They registered in droves and 98.6% turned out to vote."
"They did so in a disciplined way, visibly happy, trusting the international community' s guarantees, thinking that they would be able to freely express their will and that this would be respected."
"The demonstration of the people' s desire for independence was clear, broad and unequivocal."
"The following day was not the peaceful day that it should have been."
"Indonesia did not want to fulfil the formal commitment it gave in New York to guarantee security."
"This is why thousands of deaths were recorded, hundreds of thousands of refugees left without protection, starving, many of them wounded or ill."
"Twelve days of genocide is too long to wait for the international community to reciprocate the trust placed in it by the Timorese - and also in us, Members of the European Parliament."
"The people of Timor have the right to expect that the aggression to which they have been subjected, just because they legitimately demonstrated their will, should stop immediately."
"They have the right to expect that those responsible for these crimes, both morally and physically, are charged and brought before an international court."
"Not even the churches and those who sought refuge in them were spared, and it became clear that the militias, rather than just created by the Indonesian armed forces, have been inspired, trained, armed and even joined by them."
"I saw all this with my own eyes."
"Humanitarian aid must be guaranteed, and the European Union must play a leading role in this."
"The European Union must support reconstruction and participate, in joint action with the Commission, in the development process of the new independent state, which must be recognised immediately."
"What all of this entails, of course, is the immediate dispatch of an international peacekeeping force to Timor, and the withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers when this force arrives."
"Time is at a premium, as rumours abound to the effect that every day, boats are leaving Timor full of passengers and arriving at their destinations without them."
"Why should there be mass graves?"
"We share responsibility for what has happened, for what is taking place and for what will happen in East Timor."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Costa Neves on the intervention he has just made, which I endorse wholeheartedly."
"There really has been a spirit of co-operation and total unanimity on the part of the Portuguese MEPs here on matters relating to East Timor."
"We are very familiar with this problem, as everyone knows."
"In unison with what is happening in our country, where the people have taken to the streets en masse, in order to demonstrate and to show their complete repudiation of what could be called Indonesia' s betrayal and of the atrocities experienced by the long-suffering people of Timor, (there has been a unanimous reaction in my country, and fortunately in many other countries too), we are working here, in our various political groups in order to draft a document which this Parliament can approve with a huge majority, if not unanimously. What we are doing follows on from this expression of popular feeling."
"Mr President, I should add that an agreement was signed under the auspices of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in May of this year, precisely in order to conduct a serious consultation with the people of Timor."
"The United Nations sent a mission there, and these people were followed by international observers and hordes of journalists. The referendum was carried out, and was unequivocal, given that, as my colleague pointed out, not only did 98% of registered voters participate, but 78% showed that they were in favour of independence."
"This was completely unequivocal."
"After this, Indonesia was bound, by the agreement made under the auspices of the United Nations, to maintain order and to guarantee the transition to democracy."
"Not only did it fail to do this, it turned Timor into a veritable hell, by means of the militias and the Indonesian armed forces who make use of them, and they subjected the population to the situation we see now which has become extremely critical."
"We have now had a statement from the Security Council of the United Nations which condemns what has taken place in Timor, recognises the rights of its people, and orders the dispatch of a peacekeeping force."
"In addition to this peacekeeping force, help for the population, many of whom are sheltering in the mountains and are starving, must get there as quickly as possible, via humanitarian corridors."
"Children are dying, women are dying, priests have been singled out - because unfortunately, the repression has also had a religious angle - and they are the chosen victims of the Indonesian torturers acting freely in Timor."
"In spite of the fact that President Habibie himself has admitted that Indonesia was not capable of maintaining order, and that he invited a United Nations peacekeeping team to go into Timor, for various reasons after this, the arrival of this team has been delayed."
"And therefore, the whole international community, and therefore the European Parliament too, must demand that these two things be done; that the peace corps go as quickly as possible in order to re-establish peace in East Timor, and so that humanitarian aid should get there."
"In addition to this, it is essential that journalists, who are the world' s eyes in terms of what is taking place there, should be allowed to return to Timor, since they were forced to leave, as were the international observers."
"I hope that the European Parliament can match up to its responsibilities and is able to condemn what has happened in East Timor and to come to the rapid and efficient aid of its people."
"Mr President, to begin with, I would like to express my regard for the statement made by the President-in Office of the Council this morning."
"It underlined the urgency and importance of what is happening in East Timor, where militias continue their endeavours to smother the struggle for independence in blood."
"We received information only the other day, both from Human Rights Watch and from Oxfam, and of course we have been able to see it with our own eyes on television."
"As we speak, it is evening in East Timor."
"It is precisely when it is dark, when night falls, that the civilian population is most afraid."
"Therefore, as a Parliament, the least we can do here is to express our support for that civilian population and for their legitimate aspirations."
"And that is why we support the idea of an international tribunal for calling the guilty to account, and why we will take action to protect the refugees."
"Mr President, I would like to join our parliamentary delegation of observers which was sent out on the initiative of the President of our Parliament and under the excellent leadership of the Vice-President of our Parliament, Mr José Pacheco Pereira."
"The Finnish Presidency is deserving of praise here too, for it initiated the idea of sending a delegation on behalf of the European Union."
"Whereas up until recently Portugal was practically the only country to carry this torch, now all the countries of the European Union are rallying behind the East Timorese struggle for independence."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, involvement of this kind comes at a price."
"We went to East Timor to reassure the population that they could vote in safety, and overwhelmingly large numbers of people have done so."
"But after we left, these same people were again put to the sword by the pro-Indonesian militias."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot stand by and let this happen."
"If we were to do so, it would mean that our delegation had been nothing more than a pointless exercise in referendum tourism."
"I would also like to draw your attention to developments in East Timor in the longer term."
"There has been an immediate and generous response from the European Union in terms of humanitarian emergency aid, but once the country has gained its independence it will be necessary to provide support for economic development and it will be at least as important to give our support to the establishment of democratic institutions."
"There is absolutely nothing of that kind in East Timor."
"No political parties, no system for the administration of justice, not a single functioning institution apart from the Church."
"I believe that a programme along the lines of the one we undertook in South Africa would be appropriate."
"Mr President, the campaign for the referendum was the most one-sided campaign I have ever experienced."
"Every attempt to pursue the campaign for independence met with violence."
"Yet still the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favour of this independence."
"The protection that the Indonesian authorities were unable or unwilling to provide must now be immediately provided, without prior conditions, by an international peacekeeping force."
"We owe that to the people of East Timor, we owe that to UNAMET, which has carried out such excellent work, and we owe it to ourselves."
"Mr President, the people of Indonesia are themselves, or at least we hope this is the case, on the road to democracy, and have more than enough problems to come, even without East Timor."
"In future, we must turn our attention to these problems too."
"Nevertheless, it was right to suspend the bilateral aid for Indonesia for the time being, as we have learnt from recent experiences that pressure must be kept up until the whole process reaches a satisfactory conclusion."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Council for the determined action it showed in connection with the referendum on independence for East Timor, for example, by sending there a prestigious delegation, made up partly of our colleagues representing Parliament."
"I myself was able to be part of the presidential delegation, which I greatly appreciate."
"In May, we discussed here what sort of international presence was needed in East Timor."
"Some of us considered whether something other than a regular police force was perhaps needed there, or whether peacekeeping forces were required."
"It would appear that the biggest mistake was that the whole international operation was aimed only at allowing people to vote."
"That was the great challenge, as people were being intimidated and, since April, the terror had been really appalling."
"People went to vote; it was a sunny day, and I will certainly never forget how many people came to thank us, the international observers, for having come there."
"The joy, however, was short-lived."
"Already the following day, paramilitary forces began to rampage through the streets and villages, and we received news that, in particular, local people in the service of the UN were being persecuted and killed."
"Now I wish to add three demands to the list already presented."
"Firstly, we must demand that the commanders of the army, who are known to have taken part in this outrage, withdraw immediately."
"Secondly, we must send, through the ECHO programme, humanitarian aid as soon as possible and, obviously, the aim should be in the long-term for a programme of development."
"Thirdly, as the paramilitaries are still terrorising the people, international human rights monitors must inevitably be sent there"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I agree with most of the interventions which have already been made by my fellow MEPs."
"It is well known that East Timor has been illegally occupied by Indonesia for around 24 years, which has resulted in successive resolutions by the UN demanding Indonesia' s withdrawal and restating the people of East Timor' s right to self-determination."
"Even here, in this Parliament, similar positions have been taken on a number of occasions."
"The truth is that throughout this period, the Indonesian occupying forces were claiming hundreds of thousands of victims, inflicting immense suffering on the people of East Timor, who have never wavered in their heroic struggle for freedom and independence, a struggle which we acclaim."
"But with the signing of the New York Agreement between Portugal and Indonesia, under the auspices of the United Nations, it was thought that the way was finally clear for the resolution of all these problems."
"The turnout of 98.6% on 30 August, in the referendum which was held with the overwhelming majority of the people of East Timor, with over 78% coming out in favour of independence, showed clearly that its struggle deserved to be recognised by the whole world."
"The truth is though, that later, both the UN, and international observers and the Indonesian authorities themselves, who thought that the elections had been held in a free and fair way, in spite of the pressure and the campaign of intimidation carried out by the pro-Djakarta militias, the truth - as I was saying - is that when the results were made public, terror was once again given free rein in East Timor."
"Once again, the people were, and still are, threatened with genocide."
"It is therefore essential that we urgently and immediately put a stop to this situation, and that the people of East Timor are helped, using all possible humanitarian aid."
"It is essential that the militias, the police, and the Indonesian army stop sowing terror in the area."
"We must also recognise that Indonesia did not fulfil the commitments it accepted in the New York Agreement, which required the intervention of the UN Security Council through the dispatch of a peacekeeping force, with a clear mandate and a defined time-scale, to guarantee security and peace in the territory and to prevent further genocide."
"It was a long time before this decision was actually taken."
"Finally, it was taken, and the UN Security Council eventually decided to intervene, but incidents are still occurring, and it is crucial that they do not continue, that this intervention is not delayed any further."
"The people in East Timor - but also those who have fled to other parts of Indonesia - need this support."
"Something else which should also be done urgently is to ensure their safe return (of the refugees and displaced people) and that non-governmental organisations, international observers and journalists can enter East Timor as quickly as possible."
"As we stated in our motion..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Timor has come two weeks after the terror began, in this new phase of the territory' s history."
"This is what must be noted first of all."
"The speed of the genocide has not been matched by the delay in international decision-making."
"Where Timor is concerned, we must be aware of the fact that East Timor has suffered two genocides in twenty-five years: that of the occupation, and the one which was planned down to the last detail for the referendum."
"It has been abandoned twice in twenty-five years: once by Portugal in 1974 and, until now, by the international community which has been unable to honour the commitments it made to the Timorese people."
"It has known two diasporas in twenty-five years: firstly the exile of those who did not accept the invading force and now, the exodus of those who have fled the terror."
"There is, therefore, no time to lose."
"The terror in Timor is widespread, and these people, as far as we Portuguese are concerned, deserve the particular consideration of those who see them dying, praying and suffering in Portuguese."
"At the first opportunity, the Timorese had to set themselves free, they came down from the mountains, they came out of their houses, they went to the churches and sought out the ballot boxes in order to regain, peacefully, their freedom."
"This is an extraordinary lesson, which should calm and relieve the Western World: a nation which still believes in the ballot box as a liberating force."
"What happened after the referendum deserves greater condemnation."
"This is because Indonesia carried out a plan for genocide which can leave no doubt as to its true nature: demographic genocide, because it caused hundreds of thousands of Timorese to flee; and cultural genocide, because from the first day of the terror, the main target in terms of institutions, was the Catholic Church."
"In short, the whole traditional institution in which the Timorese placed their trust. The full extent of the extermination carried out in this genocide has not yet been discovered because, as everyone knows, both the remaining international observers and journalists were forced to leave."
"We feel therefore, that there are two clear conclusions to be drawn."
"The first is that this Parliament must also understand that Portuguese colonisation never did to the Timorese what Indonesia has done to them."
"This is why Portugal' s flag in Timor is much loved."
"This is why it will take a very long time for Indonesia' s flag to be respected again."
"On the other hand, although de-colonisation under the auspices of Portugal was a rushed affair, this self-determination, without making provision for the consequences and under the auspices of the international community, has not prevented deaths and bloodshed either."
"These people have suffered twice and this suffering was caused entirely by others."
"Just because they wanted to be free."
"What can be said then about the conduct of the international community in the days following the terror?"
"Let me put a question to your conscience. Would the international community have taken such a long time to help the Timorese if they had been English- or German-speaking?"
"If it were not necessary to ask the Security Council' s permission where Kosovo was concerned, nor to wait for Milosevic to allow us in, why is it that when it comes to East Timor, we have to wait for the Security Council to give their authorisation, and for Mr Habibie to give his consent?"
"Would governments have been so slow to provide aid if the Timorese were a politically correct minority?"
"The tragedy of the Timorese, the tragedy in which they have been caught is that there are few of them, that they are poor and Catholic... and that they have oil, which is too serious a matter in the eyes of some international powers to be left to the Timorese to decide on."
"Here are two more questions for your consciences."
"Look at the list of countries which supported Indonesia in the United Nations: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Sudan."
"A coalition of dictatorships formed straight away to protect the freedom of tyrants!"
"How long did it take to form a coalition of democracies?"
"One other thing: the European Union has just declared an embargo on supplying military equipment to the Indonesians."
"What are four months after twenty-four years of the compulsive arming of Indonesia in full knowledge of the genocide which has been taking place in Timor for the last twenty-four years?"
"I have four requests to put to you, friends and colleagues, on behalf of the whole of my group: for international peacekeepers to be sent quickly and in force to Timor; for humanitarian aid; for a court of law to try the criminals, and for economic and financial sanctions."
"Long live East Timor!"
"Mr President, the population of East Timor has endured and continues to endure truly tragic events before the eyes of the world."
"We have the courage of various reporters to thank for the fact that the world is adequately informed of what is going on."
"The reason for the current great suffering of the East Timorese people is clear: pro-Indonesian militias are endeavouring to smother in blood the desire expressed by the vast majority of people for political independence, and take careful note, this is a downright denial of the outcome of the referendum which took place on 30 August 1999."
"The army units present on the spot, as well as the official local police forces, are direct accessories to this orgy of violence."
"Nor, however, have the Indonesian military leadership nor the Indonesian government kept their hands clean in this respect."
"In fact, the latter bear full responsibility for what, according to reports, are thousands of dead, hundreds of thousands of refugees and hundreds of thousands of East Timorese deported to West Timor."
"After all, in a civilised country politics presides over guns, the former instructs the latter."
"The next obvious step is to prosecute those responsible for the crimes recently committed in East Timor, indeed President Habibie' s pledges support this."
"Therefore, the task that needs to be attended to by Djakarta as a matter of urgency, in anticipation of the arrival of a UN peacekeeping mission to East Timor, is to call an immediate halt to the wrath of the militias."
"Only action of this kind would bear witness to an intention to truly serve the interests of the country."
"It is precisely at a time like this, when Indonesian national pride is so openly at issue and stirring up phoney feelings over the country' s sovereignty, that restoring the constitutional state in the Molucca Islands is entirely appropriate in this context."
"Following heavy international pressure, President Habibie has at last said that he will accept military intervention in East Timor."
"Now then, the great need of the indigenous population cannot brook any further diplomatic procrastination on the part of the UN Security Council."
"What is more, Djakarta has made official the fact that it does not intend to impose preconditions on a mission of this kind."
"In other words, the peace mission can begin its task in East Timor without delay."
"In view of the lawlessness that now prevails in East Timor, only a powerful military mandate can offer political prospects to the East Timorese, who have long been terrorised, in which case, the financial aid that the European Union has already undertaken to provide, will be every bit as worthwhile."
"The tragic events in East Timor have shown the cowardice and opportunism of the international community."
"We need the courage, following the clear results of the referendum, to immediately implement the principle of peoples' self-determination by recognising the independence of East Timor, without waiting for problematic concessions by the Indonesian Government."
"I extend this invitation especially to the governments of the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"Above all, this would mean that the intervention of an international peacekeeping force could be considered not as interference with Indonesia' s sovereignty, but as assistance offered by the international community to an independent and sovereign state."
"Mr President, the horror in Timor has illustrated many things."
"Firstly, the ineffectiveness of the United Nations which, unfortunately, is nothing new."
"Secondly, the inhibition and passivity of the international community, which initially did not want to complicate its relations with other regional powers which - clearly - have little respect for human rights."
"And the result has been that the entire world has had to remain impassive in the face of ""plan B"" which was not much different from the ""operation horseshoe"" led by Milosevic."
"And today, the genocide of the Christians of Timor is beginning to be as well recorded as that of the Muslims in Kosovo."
"As for the European Union, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we cannot and must not - and it has been said here - have double standards with regard to humanitarian intervention."
"Human rights and the right to life cannot be preached with regard to one region, one country or one continent, but rather they are of a global or universal nature."
"We must therefore welcome the brave approach of Portugal and other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia."
"And this is the time to act."
"It is late, too late, but, on a Community level, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must ensure that the humanitarian aid, mentioned this morning by the Minister, of EUR 8 million, and the aid to follow, arrive at their destination immediately."
"Secondly, the European Union must support the arrival, as soon as possible, of the international force which can guarantee the life and rights of this tortured and martyred population of Timor and finally put an end to this nightmare."
"Mr President, as we now know, what is happening in East Timor is both a crime and a tragedy."
"This has been said several times here."
"A crime, because Indonesian colonial occupation has lasted for 24 years."
"On-going human rights violations, terror inflicted on a people that is peace-loving, unhappy and defenceless have become widespread, but have existed there for 24 years, as I myself have seen."
"The UN organised a referendum: there was 98% participation, with more than 78% in favour of independence."
"This was a perfectly transparent democratic vote."
"Well, far from finding peace again, the Timorese are now suffering a real tragedy."
"We are witnessing serious violation of East Timorese sovereignty by a state of siege imposed by Indonesia."
"In international law, from the point when the Timorese people chose independence, it became effectively sovereign on its own territory."
"It becomes sovereign in law as soon as it sets up representative institutions which it has chosen."
"There is only one sovereign authority today in East Timor, and that is the people of East Timor."
"You are aware of the facts which flout this law: the deportation of more than 80,000 people to West Timor, where they are held in pens, starved, beaten and held hostage by the Indonesian army."
"Mass terror everywhere else."
"The people responsible have been identified: the militia, the army and the civil authority of Indonesia."
"We are told that Mr Habibie' s government is the prisoner of the army in Djakarta, that the Army High Command no longer has any control over the troops of East Timor and that the militia are getting out of hand everywhere."
"But I ask you, friends, who then is responsible?"
"If it is not the civil government, then we should denounce a bloodless coup in Indonesia."
"If it is not the army, we should denounce the disappearance of any representative institution in this country."
"It is clear what action must be taken."
"The UN must intervene under Chapter 7."
"The UN must define the composition of the intervention force."
"The Indonesian army must withdraw from East Timor."
"The militia must be disarmed."
"And the Indonesian State must be held clearly responsible for its present prevarication."
"An international commission must be set up to look into the acts of violence in East Timor and the people responsible for these crimes must be brought before the International Criminal Court."
"All trade with Indonesia must be conditional upon the definitive restoration of peace in Timor."
"The Timorese must be given the means to establish themselves as an independent state and to be recognised."
"In this tragedy, Mr President, there is no question as to our right to interfere."
"It is a matter of respect for international law."
"I appreciate that this is a very emotional debate, but I would be grateful if you would limit yourselves to the allotted time."
"Mr President, can I put this debate in context?"
"After the Indonesian invasion in 1976 the UN did not recognise the Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor."
"Let us get that straight for a start."
"Only the Australians recognised it and even they, after a while, decided that they were wrong, so legally we did not have to ask permission to send in an international peacekeeping force."
"However, we did."
"And now, at long last, they have agreed."
"But when will it go in?"
"Hopefully, by this weekend."
"Who will head it?"
"Hopefully it will not be the Indonesians."
"I heard on the television this morning that one faction within the Indonesian army was actually saying that it wanted to lead the multinational peacekeeping force!"
"Fortunately the foreign minister had other ideas, but obviously there is warfare between them all at the moment."
"But whoever leads it, it must go in now, immediately, before we see any more atrocities."
"They are happening on a daily basis."
"Churches and schools are burnt."
"People are hacked to death."
"Yesterday I heard of a nun who was told she was being rescued and she should not look at the church."
"She tried to see it and saw blood seeping in front of the church door, the blood of women, children and priests."
"What had they done?"
"Nothing."
"And that was not an isolated incident."
"UN workers were attacked when they tried to move food and the army just stood by."
"If food and shelter cannot get through, there is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe, not just in East Timor, but in West Timor as well."
"The latest story is that refugees were put on to ships and told they were being rescued."
"The ships then came back a short time later with nobody on board."
"That is genocide in anybody' s terms."
"And that is why we have to have a war crimes tribunal: to bring these people to justice."
"What else can be done?"
"A military embargo yes, but it should have been done sooner."
"The Hawk jets from Britain should have been cancelled sooner."
"I am glad they have been cancelled now but it is a bit too late."
"The peace-keeping force must go in now."
"Humanitarian aid and human rights monitors for West Timor and East Timor must go in now but more importantly the Indonesian Government must be held to account."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors, as a Member for the Basque Country I would like to believe that raising our voices and asking for intervention and aid for Timor will be one more step towards ending, not only the killing by people protected by the Indonesian military, but, above all, the hypocrisy which dominates international politics."
"Enough of bad dictatorships and good dictatorships, of the theory of ""he' s a son of a bitch, but he' s our son of a bitch"" - if you will excuse me, Mr President."
"Enough of doctrines of the lesser evil, which imply that we can accept the rights of a few being trampled on in order to preserve the security of certain areas which are of interest to the powerful nations for geo-strategic reasons."
"Enough of the speed of intervention being determined by the level of underground oil reserves."
"But let us look inwards as well."
"Let us look at ourselves."
"Within the Union, we are witnessing the last two conflicts: Ireland and the Basque Country, which are in deadlock because of political and electoral party interests."
"Peace, human rights and prosperity, inside and outside the European Union, cannot wait for days, weeks and years while we come to agreements amongst ourselves."
"If only we could understand this once and for all."
"Mr President, it is not in a spirit of sterile recrimination but because of our concern and alarm about the way the situation is now developing that we feel compelled to recall and stress the direct and indirect responsibility of the United States of America for the massacres, the ethnic cleansing, going on unabated at this very moment in East Timor."
"We share some of the relief felt by many when the Clinton Administration, in an apparent turnaround, finally criticized the Jakarta Government and let the United Nations take control of the crisis."
"Anybody in this House who is not familiar with Washington' s role in the tragedies in Indonesia and Timor, from 1966 to the latest genocide unleashed by the military on 30 August, should read the analysis published today by the Washington Post and the Herald Tribune under the banner headline 'Pentagon defends Indonesian military contacts as useful' ."
"We are reminded of the close personal friendship between the Chairman of the United States Chief of Staff, General Henry Shelton, and the butcher from Jakarta, General Wiranto."
"The top military man in the United States aiding and abetting the violence in East Timor and last Monday ordering his Indonesian pal to accept an international peace force."
"Mrs Halonen stated this morning that the terror unleashed on 30 August took the Council by surprise."
"It should not have."
"May we suggest that in order to avoid future surprises, the Council and Parliament monitor very closely the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations, the humanitarian aid plan by Europe, the integrity of any present or future programme designed to put an end to the suffering of the Timorese to guarantee their full independence and sovereignty free of any threat, interference or pressure by the Indonesian military and their American mentors."
"Mr President, of course we are committed to supporting the efforts of the people of East Timor in their fight for independence and democracy."
"But what form should this support take?"
"As Europeans, we cannot behave like schoolmasters in a conflict in South-East Asia."
"In so doing, we will not engender any trust on the part of those people in Asia who would be important partners as regards the democratisation of this country."
"Above all, the disintegration and balkanisation of South-East Asia can surely not be Europe' s goal."
"The question was therefore asked in the leader in today 's issue of the Herald Tribune: ""Who are these Western crusaders to be lecturing the Asians?"" - a question that may be a bitter pill for us to swallow."
"Our responsibility, as Europeans, is to support democratic development, which will also result in an improvement in the living conditions of the people."
"Perhaps, we will first have to learn as Europeans how to support a people in a foreign land in their fight for independence, as well as along their path to a democratic form of society."
"Mr President, I would like firstly, as a member of this Parliament' s mission sent to observe the elections in Timor, to tell you of something I witnessed myself, so that you will all be able to understand what has happened in Timor."
"Almost all the buildings used by the European Parliament' s delegation in Timor - the houses we slept in, the places where we ate or held meetings - have now been destroyed."
"Maybe this will give some idea of the scale of events in East Timor."
"Secondly, from the political point of view, there are various decisive factors in determining our action as an international community."
"For the international community is not an abstract concept, it consists of us ourselves."
"The first factor is understanding that what is happening in Timor is not a civil war."
"Indonesia tried to take us along that path, and only failed because of the presence of international journalists and observers."
"There is no civil war in Timor."
"There is a conflict between the Indonesian army and its cohorts - the militias - and the majority of Timor' s population."
"The second factor is that the Indonesian army has no problems keeping the peace and security situation in Timor under control and never has."
"We could see that the Indonesian army could quite easily have kept the peace and security situation under control if it had wanted to."
"The truth is that the army simply did not want to, as it was itself part of the conflict."
"Finally, - and this is the important thing for the future - the Timor question is not over just because the Security Council has decided to send in peacekeeping forces."
"We must be aware - and I speak as someone who knows the area - that these forces are going to face opposition, and will probably encounter a much more serious conflict situation than the one encountered by forces in Kosovo."
"This is why there must be strong political will to support the international community' s next moves to ensure that Indonesia does not impose any conditions on the intervention by these forces and that, however serious the conflict in the region may be, the peace and security of the Timorese should be guaranteed, as well as the humanitarian aid and the development that Timor so desperately needs."
"This factor of political will is decisive because unfortunately, we will be hearing about Timor for much longer than we would probably like to."
"""Whether you live in Africa or central Europe or any other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background or their religion and it is within our power to stop it, we will stop it"" ."
"The words were President Clinton' s and he was talking about Kosovo."
"But they must also apply to East Timor which has now become a moral test for the whole world community."
"We are talking about humanity and human rights, politics and international law, but also about economics and credibility."
"If we do not contribute to solving the tragedy in East Timor, the message to East Timor' s people and to others is this: democracy is synonymous with death."
"Democratic efforts supported by other countries in the world and by the United Nations are synonymous with massive, unchecked massacres."
"Countries' credibility is therefore at stake."
"From an economic point of view, we in the Socialist Group demanded early on that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should stop supporting the regime in Djakarta."
"I am not talking about humanitarian support and support to democrats."
"Normally, political considerations are not taken into account in financial dealings."
"Even in the Emperor Vespasian' s time, when he introduced tax on toilets, it was said that money had no smell."
"But billions of dollars in support of the regime in Djakarta stinks and must be stopped."
"This has actually happened now."
"The lessons of the tragedy in East Timor are that politics and economics are interconnected and that compassion and credibility demand that countries intervene on humanitarian grounds."
"Mr President, what is happening now was predicted well before the vote."
"The people of East Timor were encouraged by the UN to go out and use their democratic right to vote and they are being persecuted for doing so."
"The international community was warned well in advance."
"What has it been doing for the last 14 days?"
"It has sat and twiddled its thumbs, waiting for an invitation from Indonesia, the country that has been illegally occupying East Timor for the last 25 years, whose Foreign Minister has stuck his fingers up at the UN General Assembly when the issue was raised."
"One-third of the population has been massacred and here we are waiting for an invitation from Indonesia."
"President Clinton' s hypocrisy, which has already been highlighted today, is unacceptable."
"Tony Blair' s wonderful new government, with its ethical foreign policy, has continued sending its arms to Indonesia."
"These are the hypocrites, the so-called moral police forces of the world who put profit before people."
"It is completely unacceptable."
"What we want to see now is a complete arms embargo on Indonesia and also an economic embargo."
"We want an international peacekeeping force."
"We want to see independence for the people of East Timor, which is their democratic right."
"We want an end to the tyranny that has been perpetrated on the people of East Timor for the last 25 years with the help of EU countries, America and all these hypocritical people who want to sell arms to tyrants in Indonesia and other countries around the world."
"It has to stop."
"The hypocrisy of the European Union' s arms industry has to end and this is the best example we have had so far of what the end result is."
"Mr President, we do not yet know how the steps adopted by the Security Council are going to be applied, but we do already know that assistance will arrive too late to save a great number of lives."
"On the one hand, irreparable damage has already been done."
"The disaster was not unexpected."
"The Timorese resistance had given the alarm signal, demanding that the United Nations oversee the safety of the ballot on self-determination."
"The crime was that of failure to assist a people in danger."
"The East Timorese are paying a high price for earlier compromises."
"The Indonesian army, the body chiefly responsible for the current massacres, was set up, trained and equipped by the major powers of the West in 1965 in order to massacre the Indonesian population itself, in order to eradicate a Communist Party whose influence was troublesome."
"Today, there is unanimous outrage, but there is great hypocrisy."
"Who is going to be made to believe that the United States, but also France, which signed a military co-operation agreement with Djakarta, did not have the means to exert sufficient pressure to stay the arm of the killers?"
"At the time of the bombing raids on Iraq or the former Yugoslavia, the great powers spoke of human rights."
"It would seem, from this case, that for some people, defending human rights takes second place to defending financial interests."
"Mr President, we were right to call for this urgent debate."
"The Security Council of the United Nations yesterday adopted a decision which, I hope, will be up to the task and adequate for the seriousness of the situation."
"Three or four weeks have elapsed from the start of the massacres until this decision."
"This is, of course, far too long."
"But I would like to highlight the fact, since there is much talk of hypocrisy in this Chamber, that in other cases, we have wasted not months, but years."
"Even this year, we had the case of Kosovo and many of the Members who spoke to request, to loudly demand, military intervention were those who had previously opposed any military intervention in Kosovo."
"If a different international law must be created, with a real duty to intervene incorporated in it, not because Indonesia is right-wing or allied to Clinton, whereas Milosevic is supposedly left-wing, but a true right to intervene like the one we have just seen emerge, then we should draw our lessons from this in order to set the right of the individual before even the right of peoples, and to ensure that such massacres cannot be repeated in future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is one thing to look back, and that is surely sensible, but it is another thing to look forward quickly."
"Let us not try and kid ourselves."
"Even if UN troops move in at the weekend, perhaps without the co-operation of the Indonesian army and the national authorities, we will not be able to bring about peace at the drop of a hat."
"For the marauding gangs, which are still roaming through East Timor and the army, which still has a presence there, cannot be kept in check by a six or eight thousand strong UN force."
"The East Timorese who have fled, and who are now in West Timor, must be able to return home."
"They must be protected in West Timor where they are now staying."
"Therefore, we must give a clear signal to those parties who have responsibility in Indonesia."
"I am no longer sure whether the government still has responsibility and control."
"Perhaps this now rests with the army."
"We must say to all those parties who have responsibility: if Indonesia' s policy does not change, and quickly, then we, and I am addressing the Council and the Commission here, will have to seriously threaten them with all the economic means at our disposal and force those who have the power in Indonesia to co-operate."
"Otherwise, what we will see is that although our troops are stationed there, people will continue to be murdered and driven out."
"Therefore, we have to send out a clear signal."
"Indonesia still has the opportunity to maintain good relations with us over the coming years."
"But if it does not change its policy, then it will no longer have partners in Europe for as long as those responsible for the current situation are still in power, whether they be in the army, the parliament or the government."
"Therefore, we are also appealing to the Council, along with the Member States, to send clear signals to those responsible in Indonesia in the next few days."
"They must co-operate, otherwise a UN peacekeeping force will be defenceless."
"We need strong action on the part of Europe, the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is some unanimity in this Parliament in our attitudes - although not in the nuances - on the Timor question."
"As this is the case, I would just like to say a few words, as I was a member of the parliamentary delegation of observers who went to Timor."
"I must tell you that we did our duty, and added to this Parliament' s good name because we visited, I believe, more of the area than any other delegation (we went 200 kilometres to the East), and checked more polling stations than anyone else."
"It was useful for us to be able to bring you this news which we expected to describe in quite different terms when we left Timor and which was of interest to the Timorese, who, at least at that time, felt supported and who still are being supported."
"This referendum was an impressive sight, really quite impressive!"
"An entire people - for nobody was to be seen in the streets - an entire people turned out to vote, expressing their national feeling, their bravery, their sense of democracy and their love of freedom."
"Anyone who prides himself or herself on being a defender of democracy would have found it inspiring to witness that scene."
"The Timorese created a flower, a castle of hope which, in one outburst of violence, was brought down and destroyed in blood, violence and death."
"Once again, it is not politicians but the Timorese themselves, with their cries and their pain who have drawn attention to their just cause."
"I think that this time, Timor will not be forgotten again and I think that the ever growing support for the long-suffering and heroic people of Timor will remain strong until they are free and until Timor is a happy nation - one that is moving forwards."
"Mr President, as an MEP for Galicia, I would like to express my solidarity with the people of Timor, my total condemnation of Indonesia' s genocidal repression and my concurrence with all those who recognise and defend the Timorese people' s right to self-determination as expressed today in favour of independence."
"I request that the institutions of the European Union support the extremely urgent dispatch of a civilian mission and a UN security force, of a size which reflects the gravity of the situation, to ensure that Timor is established as an independent state, which will require a great deal of time. During this time, the UN must maintain its unequivocal support, and the European Union its vital political and economic assistance."
"In accordance with its historical responsibilities in Timor, the UN and the European Union' s protection of Timor is imperative, not just in the face of the current aggression, but also in the face of any future threat by Indonesia."
"Mr President, I began my military career as a British army officer in the mid 1960s, engaged on military operations against the Indonesian Army in Borneo in defence of the newly created State of Malaysia."
"It is perhaps appropriate that I should now begin my parliamentary duties with reference to Indonesia and another State that is in creation - East Timor."
"It is over two weeks since the referendum took place in East Timor."
"The outcome of the referendum and the terrible consequences were very predictable."
"Yet the international community, with certain exceptions, seems to have been taken by surprise by the way in which this tragedy has unfolded."
"Quite clearly international pressure had to be put on Indonesia and many of us have called for the early suspension of World Bank and IMF financial assistance and the suspension of arms exports and military cooperation."
"We therefore welcome the albeit belated common position adopted by the General Affairs Council."
"If resolute action had been taken earlier, then maybe the Indonesian authorities would have responded differently."
"The immediate need now is for the rapid deployment of a peacekeeping force and the delivery of humanitarian aid."
"I do not necessarily think it is appropriate for the Europeans to react militarily to crises in areas far from their borders."
"But the crisis in East Timor has highlighted the difficulties for Europeans in responding to yet another peacekeeping task."
"The fact is that there is little scope for this, even if it was desirable."
"Capabilities are limited."
"EU Member States do not spend enough on their armed forces and what they spend is often not spent well."
"Over the years the United Kingdom has developed a highly effective military capability and yet the United Kingdom armed forces are now desperately overstretched and most Member States of the European Union spend a smaller proportion of their GDP on defence than the United Kingdom."
"The most useful European Union contribution in a situation such as East Timor is more likely to be civil rather than military. That is the right sort of focus for us in this situation."
"We heard from Mrs Halonen that the Commission has been asked to prepare a socio-economic programme for institution building in East Timor."
"This is most welcome but the programme will require early implementation once the security situation permits, coordination with contributions from other institutions and countries and very careful management to ensure effectiveness."
"Finally, there is yet another aspect of this tragedy which we must not forget."
"Over the past few weeks the most horrific crimes have been committed against Timorese and others, and those responsible must be brought to justice."
"Mr President, this is a timely debate."
"As we speak, the UN Security Council has passed a resolution under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter to allow a peacekeeping force under Australian command into East Timor."
"It is two weeks too late."
"The UK, US, New Zealand, Canada, Philippines and Thailand have now committed manpower and material to the peacekeeping force."
"They are too late."
"China, Russia, South Korea and Malaysia have indicated their commitment to help."
"They too are too late."
"The international community has woken up at last."
"As usual it is, and always will be, giving too little too late."
"Since the East Timor referendum, up to 10 000 people have been slaughtered for voting for independence."
"300 000, including children, out of a total population of 800 000 have been displaced and made homeless, hiding without shelter, food and sanitation in the jungle."
"What surprises me is that the international community and the United Nations never manages to learn, to anticipate from the experiences of Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, and now East Timor."
"What is wrong with us?"
"The international community, time and time again, is called upon to clean up the mess left by brutal tyrants, so-called ethnic cleansers and the genocide of dictators."
"Under the Montevideo Convention, we are compelled by international law to recognise these brutal regimes as sovereign independent states."
"Perhaps we should now reconsider this definition and encourage an international debate on whether democracy such as ours should give equal recognition, treatment and respectability to regimes throughout the world which refute democracy and the rule of law, human rights and good governance."
"Surely the time has come now to differentiate, to redefine, to tighten up the criteria as we do now in giving aid."
"If good governance is a fundamental prerequisite for development aid, why should good governance not also be a fundamental criterion for international recognition, bilateral relations and trade development?"
"The IMF has recognised this recently in Indonesia and it is time that the European Union' s Member States also recognised it."
"Mr President, we were told by Council this morning that East Timor deserves our full support."
"We were told that we supplied observers that were crucial to the success of the referendum when the East Timorese said a very loud and very large ""yes"" to independence."
"We were told by the Council that the Commission is preparing social and economic assistance for a newly independent East Timor, all of which of course we welcome."
"But we are also told by Mrs Halunen that she was surprised at the terror that took place after the referendum."
"I am surprised that she was surprised."
"I was in Jakarta in August, as a special representative of the UNDP working with the Indonesian Parliament, the DPRK, on new rules for that parliament."
"It was clear to me then and more importantly to everybody else in Jakarta that firstly there would be a resounding yes in a referendum and secondly that the army, or at least large sections of the army, would try to subvert that process by engaging in and encouraging terror."
"We have seen that happen, but why we are surprised I do not know."
"I welcome the peacekeeping force."
"I welcome the humanitarian aid that is going to go in to help the 200,00 to 400,000 refugees."
"I welcome the fact that we were told that EUR 8 million would be available for that humanitarian aid."
"But it must be delivered quickly."
"I accept that in the interim it may be delivered by air."
"We are told it is going to be dropped in by helicopters from 1,500 metres."
"If you remember the aid we saw being airlifted in and dropped to some of the Kurdish refugees from the air, it was not very successful."
"If I recall correctly, some of the refugees were actually killed."
"As soon as possible that aid needs to be delivered on the ground."
"We need to make sure that it happens within days rather than weeks."
"I accept the need for the ban on arms."
"We need to stop arms sales to Indonesia and I welcome the four-month ban."
"It may be that it needs to be continued but at the same time we also need to be helping the Indonesians by providing them with assistance to ensure that very fragile democracy elected in the last general election is able to establish itself."
"Unless we do that in November or December we will be having a similar debate about Indonesia, telling each other how we knew it was all going to end in tears."
"Mr President, the referendum in East Timor, which was supervised by the United Nations, has turned into a drama."
"After more than twenty years of violence and repression, the people there were able at last to choose their own future; yet, the choice they made in freedom, to go down the road of independence, was punished with a brutality of which history has scarce seen the like."
"Murdering, setting fire to things and deporting people as they went, the pro-Indonesian militias left the country in a state of chaos, plundered and burnt to the ground."
"The images have been there for all to see."
"The Indonesian army failed to take action to protect the population."
"The UN, the NGOs, the observers were all powerless to do anything."
"There have been instances of death and wounding in these quarters too."
"I count myself as one of those that know Indonesia well."
"I hesitate a little to address Indonesia in harsh terms, representing as I do, a country that held sway as a colonial power there for 300 years."
"But these events transform any hesitation on my part into outright criticism and severe reprimands directed at the Indonesian government and the Indonesian army."
"What happened in East Timor is serious and requires us to impose sanctions and take international action with all haste."
"Sanctions have now been approved, also by the EU, and I welcome this with open arms."
"I regret that France and the Netherlands tried again in Council to prevent the weapons embargo from going ahead, and admire the Finnish Presidency for pushing it through nonetheless."
"The second step that must now be taken is to send an international peacekeeping force, preferably from within the region, so that the people can be protected and the independence of East Timor can be implemented"
"The third step is to set up a tribunal for the purpose of punishing those who have committed such cruel acts, so that law is upheld and justice is done."
"The fourth thing that needs to happen is the delivery of aid to the region."
"Once independence has been implemented, which is undoubtedly going to happen now, East Timor will need an enormous amount of help."
"And we must be generous in providing this help too."
"On a final note, the violence meted out by the militias in Indonesia has not been confined to Timor alone."
"They murder and plunder in the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya too."
"Hundreds of people, especially Christians, have already died in the Moluccas in particular."
"Last week, Dutch citizens of Moluccan extraction demonstrated in Brussels in a dignified manner."
"We believe that attention should also be given to what is happening there."
"If the murder does not stop in those other regions too, and if the Indonesian government doesn' t offer protection, then, in our view, the United Nations should also take action in those other regions of Indonesia."
"Mr President, human rights and democracy are at stake in Indonesia."
"Let us deal with the situation as an international community."
"Mr President, I would like to read out a few lines: ""in 1975 Indonesia took control of Timor, beginning the oppression which led to the death of a third of the population through hunger, epidemics, war and a reign of terror."""
"This is not a piece of journalism or a summary, but the statement that was made when Ximenes Belo and José Ramos Horta were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 11 November 1996."
"The holocaust which led to the death of 250,000 people in East Timor is already history, with the last ten thousand killed over recent weeks."
"Regarding this holocaust, I do not think that our institution or any European citizen can afford to feel astonished: we do not have the right to, we have definitively lost our innocence."
"For a long time, the international community has allowed the so-called development dictatorships to survive, from Indonesia to the Chile of the Chicago Boys, to China and Korea, those countries where, for the sake of macro-economics, we have tolerated market interests prevailing over the interests of human rights."
"We have tolerated intolerance and violence."
"I hope that our guilt will not now be added to the international community' s guilt."
"I am happy that the Council has decided on a common position, a symbolic four-month embargo on arms, ammunition and military equipment."
"I hope that this embargo will be extended to supplies now being prepared so that we can avoid feeling even more remorse in the future. I want to point out that at this time, my indignation has nothing to do with the language that the inhabitants of East Timor speak."
"My problem is that for twenty-five years, the population of East Timor has not had a voice."
"Mr President, who can forget the tragic images of Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia-Herzegovina and more recently, Kosovo that are still fresh in our minds."
"We have now added to that list the ongoing humanitarian plight of thousands of displaced East Timorese as a result of the well-planned and systematic policy of killings, destruction of property, and intimidation carried out by the militia and elements of the Indonesian security forces."
"In most of these situations it must be said that timely action by the international community based upon assessments and early warnings of situations could undoubtedly have saved many lives and greatly reduced human suffering and misery."
"I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deny that recent events in East Timor were totally predictable and therefore to some extent preventable."
"The international community, in particular the United Nations, has to ask itself some searching and probing questions."
"I also believe that we in the European Union must put our house in order."
"Today, we have just approved the new Commission and in the light of recent events in East Timor, Kosovo and elsewhere I would like to address my remarks to the new Commissioner responsible for the common foreign and security policy."
"I would like to ask would he assure this Parliament that the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit as envisaged under the Amsterdam Treaty will be given top priority?"
"In addition, will he guarantee that this unit will provide the appropriate parliamentary committees with all the relevant information including analyses, recommendations and strategies on any potential crisis which should be monitored by this Parliament."
"The provision of such information would greatly enhance Parliament' s contribution to the development of a more effective and cohesive EU foreign policy, which is long overdue."
"We must ensure that the EU responds urgently and effectively to potential crisis situations and thereby helps prevent the recurrence of the sort of tragedies that we have recently experienced in East Timor."
") Mr President, I would like to add my voice to the condemnation and the words which have already been expressed by my colleagues, but I would like to state here that death did not suddenly strike in East Timor after the referendum."
"Before the referendum, more than two hundred thousand Timorese were killed, whilst the international community did nothing, taking the view that the people of East Timor were expendable."
"We feel that no nation is expendable, and this is why we are speaking out now."
"Speaking out in order to save lives and to ensure that the free will of the people of East Timor is respected."
"This is why we feel that the European Union - and we are appealing directly to the Council and the Commission - must take the decision to move forward with an initiative which will ensure that this process towards independence for the people of East Timor is respected."
"The most urgent matter though, is to save lives, because in East Timor, it is not just bullets that kill; hunger also kills. It is therefore necessary that we arrange for emergency humanitarian aid and an international peacekeeping force."
"We must also cease negotiations with Indonesia. We must do this so that the international community understands once and for all that Indonesia is not part of the solution in East Timor."
"The Council and the Commission must extend the suspension of support in terms of economic and military co-operation because the human rights argument makes no impression on Indonesia, Mr President. The arguments that really affect them are those of economic sanctions and military concerns."
"Mr President, I will refrain from adding to what many Members have said very effectively on the subject of East Timor."
"Instead, I would like to ask a question about it - 'build peace without opportunism' - what does that mean?"
"In short, after 24 years of this tragedy, and after 24 years of the international community avoiding imposing economic sanctions, what does 'make every effort' now mean?"
"On this, I add my voice to the request already made in this House and by the Senate of the Republic of my country, asking for European governments and the UN to recognise, as soon as possible, the sovereign state of East Timor, and the fact that it is no longer an issue dealt with exclusively in this House does credit to my Portuguese colleagues and colleagues from certain other countries."
"I would like to add another consideration to this."
"In addition to the debt we have owed to East Timor for 24 years, there is the fact that, while there have been demonstrations about East Timor, we are not taking into account the political hypothesis that we must in any case once again beg the United States for the favour of possible military intervention."
"This forces us to re-examine the subject of common defence."
"One final point."
"It is still possible for us to do what is right for East Timor, to do it immediately and with determination."
"The credibility of this institution depends not only on endorsing the Commissioners of the Commission, but also largely on the question of East Timor."
"Mr President, a feature of the current situation is the anger and the frustration of the men and women of all our Member States."
"They are angry and frustrated at the sclerosis that exists in the decision-making processes of the European Union and indeed the United Nations."
"It is time we got our act together and resolved these decision-making problems."
"The President-in-Office here this morning declared that the Council was surprised at the events of the last two weeks."
"I cannot understand how the Council or anybody else could be surprised."
"Has no one in the Council been reading the paper for the last 25 years?"
"Do they not know that we have armed the perpetrators of this genocide for the last 25 years?"
"The people of East Timor believed us when we told them we would protect them if they voted and they came out in their thousands and thousands to vote for independence."
"We failed to protect them."
"How many more times do we say ""never again"" before we actually take a decision to ensure that when we make a promise like that we will keep that promise and plan to keep that promise?"
"It is not good enough for us to wring our hands and declare we are sorry."
"We have to make sure it never happens again."
"Mr President, you will note by the number of Irish people wishing to speak in the debate today that this is an issue very close to our hearts."
"For many years Mr Tom Hyland, an Irishman who has made this the cause of his life, has led international demands for action on East Timor."
"In Ireland we care very deeply about East Timor and we have been extremely active; as the President-in-Office noted this morning, our Foreign Minister, Mr David Andrews, was the special EU Overseer of the recent elections in East Timor."
"But in the context of the current disaster there, Indonesia has become a symbol of the lengths to which a brutal, weak and unscrupulous regime will go to further its power and control over those it perceives as challenging its authority."
"Unfortunately this government has had many friends in this Parliament over the years and many EU governments have put the profits of their arms industries above those of the basic human rights of the unfortunate people of East Timor."
"Events of the past month have graphically illustrated what many have sought to highlight over the years about the reality of life in East Timor."
"The President-in-Office spoke very passionately this morning about her concerns but, as Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out, these concerns were no surprise to a great many of us."
"Perhaps it is because East Timor is very far away and a very small country, that the crucial issues at stake in this dreadful catastrophe engulfing the country at the moment have been of little concern either to ourselves within the EU or, of course, to the United States."
"What we have seen is a brutal regime taking a terrible revenge on a small country that dared to say it wanted to be independent and we must support it."
"Mr President, as a little boy growing up in Portugal I collected Portuguese stamps and particularly remember the colourful and attractive ones from East Timor."
"The província esquecida, or forgotten province of Portugal, as it was then known, conjured up a picture of a beautiful, remote Pacific island, an exotic mix of East and West producing a unique Catholic cultural heritage."
"Sadly, I have never been there but I feel passionately for the Timorese people suffering since Indonesia' s annexation in 1975 with almost one third being killed - an even greater proportion of deaths than in the former Yugoslavia."
"The UN recognises the right of the Timorese people to self-determination and Portugal' s sovereignty in its territory."
"In the West we did not seek a UN resolution to bomb the former Yugoslavia over Kosovo which still remains part of Yugoslavia, and yet we have felt willing, for whatever reason, to avoid any military intervention on behalf of the Timorese in the past."
"I have always believed that foreign military intervention should only take place in the national interests of the nation-states concerned, yet the serious deterioration and spiralling violence in the region demand action and meet the test of the new ethical foreign policy of which Portugal is a full Member State."
"As a Briton, I am happy to support Portugal in its attempts to secure a just outcome, not only because Portugal is Britain' s oldest ally, but also because Portugal should be given the opportunity to grant independence to all its colonies, including its last colony now, other than Macao, namely East Timor."
"We in Britain had that opportunity."
"We granted self-determination to all our colonies where it was legally possible to do so."
"Human rights, if they are to be considered a casus belli as over Kosovo, must be universally and consistently applied."
"Therefore I fully support and welcome the UN Security Council resolution for the establishment of an international peacemaking force involving willing and principally neighbouring countries such as Australia and New Zealand."
"This will enable the 78% of East Timorese who voted on 30 August to establish their own independent sovereign state and to look forward to a peaceful and prosperous future within their own homeland."
"Lastly, but not least, I salute the courage of the East Timorese people."
"Mr President, like other speakers in this debate I wish to draw the attention of this House to the appalling double standards and hypocrisy displayed throughout the tragic crisis now unfolding in East Timor by the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook."
"When Mr Cook was appointed Foreign Secretary he launched an ethical foreign policy containing amongst other things a commitment to a stringent code of conduct on arms export controls."
"Nevertheless he has allowed Hawk ground attack aircraft to be exported to the Indonesian military in breach of his own ethical foreign policy and arms export guidelines."
"Because the contract had been signed by the previous Conservative Government, Mr Cook claimed it could not be broken."
"He even gave repeated assurances that contractual clauses ensured that jets would not be used for aggressive purposes against the people of East Timor."
"Now, in the face of spiralling atrocities in that country and hard evidence that the aircraft in question have been used in attacks on the East Timorese, Mr Cook has performed an amazing U-turn: last Saturday he finally cancelled the contract and introduced a temporary arms ban."
"We will never know how many East Timorese died as a result of his refusal to cancel this contract at an earlier stage."
"This House has a right to an explanation from Mr Cook of how something which the UK Government insisted could not happen suddenly became possible."
"We should also ask Mr Cook why British taxpayers' money was used to fund this scandalous episode and indeed, why the UK Ministry of Defence specifically intervened to ensure an invitation was extended to the Indonesian military to attend a major arms fair in Britain next week."
"Again, only after international pressure has Mr Cook been forced to withdraw this invitation."
"We should insist that Mr Cook is brought before this House to provide us with an explanation on his extraordinary collaboration with the oppressive Indonesian regime."
"Mr President, the only issue left to address at this stage, given the broad range of contributions from all sides of this House, is why we are surprised about what has happened in Indonesia, why we are surprised at the impotent response of the European Union to the tragic genocide of the last two weeks in East Timor."
"If we were unable to intervene and intervene promptly and properly in Kosovo, on our own doorstep, without weeks and months of prevarication and legal consultation to see what we could or could not do, how could we really expect the EU to respond as we would wish and the citizens of Europe would wish to the tragedy in East Timor?"
"What is it about the institutions of Europe - about the European Parliament, about the European Union collectively - that makes us unable to respond to the crises in the world as our people, our voters, our citizens would want us to do?"
"We need urgently to examine why our response is always - as I said yesterday and others said today - too little, too late."
"We are a multi-billion pound, multi-billion dollar talking-shop, as far as the citizens of Europe and the world are concerned."
"We are never there when it counts."
"We always respond several months too late, we spend hours debating crises in this House and in other institutions, but we are not there, when it counts, as quickly as we should be."
"Why?"
"Maybe the answer will come from the next two speakers."
"Why is it always too little, too late?"
"Why was it a surprise that there was genocide since the referendum two weeks ago?"
"Why was the UN Council taken by surprise?"
"We had guaranteed these people that if they exercised their democratic rights and voted we would protect them and see it out to the end."
"We failed, and failed miserably."
"The international community should hang its head and the European Union along with it."
"What is wrong?"
"What needs to be done to enable us to respond as we should?"
"That is the only question that needs to be answered because we are too late now."
"Others have taken up our cudgels."
"Let us not be caught in this position again."
"Pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolution to close the present debate."
"Mr President, I would just like to let you know that today a consultative meeting was held, and that these motions for resolution will be replaced by a single motion for a joint resolution."
"Thank you very much, Mr Seguro."
"The Presidency has received a request for permission to make a statement from the Commission and the Council."
"Commissioner Liikanen will therefore speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr Cushnahan asked the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy a question."
"Unfortunately, that Member of the Commission is not here; he will assume office tomorrow."
"I can inform you that the new Commission meets for the first time on Saturday this week."
"The situation in East Timor, and three issues in particular, are on the agenda."
"Mr President, I was asked a question which was addressed to Mr Patten, who is responsible for foreign and security policy."
"He is not here today."
"He will assume office tomorrow."
"The Commission will have its first meeting on Saturday."
"In that first meeting the situation in East Timor will be on the agenda."
"There will be three basic issues: how to re-establish peace; what the urgent humanitarian needs are and how they can be met in the area; how to prepare a multi-annual programme to build institutions in East Timor."
"As far as the ECHO' s activities so far and at the moment are concerned, Mrs Halonen, the Foreign Minister of Finland and President of the Council would like to say that the ECHO humanitarian aid office has been present in East Timor since 15 July."
"There have been six partners in East Timor."
"They were fully in action until 9 September when they had to be evacuated for security reasons to Australia."
"All these people are returning to East Timor as soon as the security situation improves."
"We hope that the recent UN Security Council resolution allows the situation to develop so that all the humanitarian aid activities can be restarted soon in East Timor."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mr Sasi will speak on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate for their opinions and also for the questions they have asked."
"I am convinced that, with all of us working together, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we can participate, with maximum effectiveness, in a solution to the crisis in East Timor and the arrangements that will need to be made afterwards."
"The resolutions approved on Monday by the Council are an indication that we feel a special sense of responsibility towards finding a solution to the issue of East Timor that will benefit its people."
"One key principle of international law is the right to self-determination of nations."
"This issue is about establishing that right."
"Another principle is insistence on compliance with agreements."
"That we are demanding unconditionally from Indonesia."
"Indonesia must respect and comply with essential commitments to human rights, and, above all, the UN agreement made in New York on 5 May on the question of East Timor."
"This being the case, the Union will continue its forceful action in the United Nations, the Security Council and in Djakarta."
"An international presence is the only immediate way of improving security and safeguarding it besides, so allowing sufficient humanitarian aid to be delivered to the region."
"A decision was taken this morning by the Security Council to send an international peacekeeping force and an advanced guard to East Timor immediately."
"The meeting at which the decision was approved was a long one: it began yesterday at 18.00. local time and ended today at 02.00."
"We can feel satisfied that the mandate that has been given is a so-called strong mandate."
"We expect the first troops to arrive in the region before the weekend."
"The Australians have announced that they are on twenty-four hour alert."
"We consider it important and positive that no preconditions were imposed in the decision to become involved."
"The primary criterion - the best and fastest way of restoring security - is an important one."
"In the long-term, we must allow other Asian countries, and especially those in ASEAN, to participate fully."
"In addition, the Member States of the Union have been asked to participate, and we know that many countries are now doing so."
"We also know that France, Great Britain and Portugal have announced their readiness to send troops."
"The new problem that appears to be emerging now is the situation of the East Timorese in West Timor."
"The region is a part of Indonesia, and we trust that Indonesia will guarantee the safety of all those in the region, and I also hope it will."
"At the same time, we have to unconditionally ensure that the international humanitarian organisations and, above all the UNHCR, have safe access to the area."
"To show that the international community is in earnest in this matter, we are recommending a visit to West Timor in the next view days by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata."
"Humanitarian action is urgently needed and its main priorities are the protection of refugees in West Timor, access to the area by the UNHCR, and the commencement of airdrops of food and other supplies to take place as soon as possible."
"Regarding the airdrops, we can state that apparently they can start on Thursday through action on the part of the World Food Aid Programme and UNICEF."
"For this we must ensure there are sufficient supplies, and we will use Union relief funds to purchase these supplies."
"I believe humanitarian action will be in capable hands with the UNHCR, the UNDP and the ICRC."
"The Union and its Member States will also have a considerable part to play in the operation in the future."
"Furthermore, ECHO has all the while been involved in assessing the size of the aid package needed and co-ordinating Union aid so that it gets to where it is needed most right now."
"The question of sanctions has been raised here, and I would now like to say that the ban on the export of weapons approved in the Council on Monday will come into force immediately."
"This decision will mean we will stop the export of arms to Indonesia by any Member State, and the ban will be in force for the next four months, after which it will be up for review."
"The legal aspects of the decision are to be finalised by the relevant bodies, and I shall not go into further detail as far as that is concerned."
"Much emphasis has been put in our discussions here on the fact that human rights are being violated. We strongly condemn a state of affairs in which these violations have been carried out on such a large scale and so flagrantly."
"It has been said here that no one could have failed to predict that things would turn out as they have."
"It is absolutely true that we knew beforehand that there would be problems in the region after the referendum."
"However, I believe that the extent and intensity of the terror carried out came as a surprise to all the observers."
"The Union and the whole international community had had an assurance from the Indonesian government that they would be capable of keeping order and maintaining security in the region."
"They had also legally committed to this in the New York Agreement."
"As Mrs Halonen said, it is probable that people in the region are also guilty of crimes that violate international human rights."
"For this reason, the Council has decided to give its support to the organisation of a special convention of the Commission on Human Rights and the appointment of an investigatory delegation to be sent to the region."
"It is also very important that we discover who is responsible for criminal acts in this crisis."
"I would like to draw attention to the absence of the Commissioner for External Affairs who has already been appointed."
"If Timor is an urgent matter, his appearance was to be expected."
"Thank you very much, Mr Portas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"Mr President, the procedures used in Member States to effect deportation do not fall within the scope of Community legislation."
"Neither has the Community drafted any provisions for the temporary protection of nationals of third countries."
"The Member States themselves have authority in procedure relating to deportation."
"In carrying out their tasks, the authorities in Member States must act in compliance with their own national legislation and be subject to legal and political monitoring by national bodies, and also act in compliance too with the relevant international provisions relating to the safeguarding of human rights."
"The death of a child is always a shocking event."
"Being a father too, I am touched by the case."
"However, the Council, unfortunately, has no knowledge of this case, so it cannot take a position on the matters raised by the Honourable Member in her question."
"I regret the so-called reply which has been given to me because are we to conclude from the words of Mr Sasi that the Spanish authorities were acting correctly on 8 July when they expelled those 100 Romanian Gypsy families?"
"No, we do not conclude that."
"They did not act in the defence of public order, they did not defend human rights and they did not safeguard national security."
"They did not act according to principles of justice and fairness, nor did they act with respect for human rights."
"No, the Spanish authorities only gave one response: the violent response towards refugees, the unacceptable response, democratically unacceptable."
"The Spanish authorities acted against that European spirit which is the driving force behind the European Charter of Fundamental Rights which affects all of us, Members of the Council."
"They acted in a way which shames and embarrasses us as Europeans and democrats."
"Facts such as these once again illustrate the urgency with which we require a common policy in this area; an equitable and basically civil common policy for the control and acceptance of immigrants."
"For this reason, we eagerly await the Tampere Summit. We require an initiative and a commitment which affects all of us, even the most reluctant of governments, which is, unfortunately, the case with the Spanish government in this field."
"I will go further."
"We hope that any abuse and any violation of human rights will be punished, and that we do not fail to respond when the responsibility falls to us, which is currently the case."
"Furthermore, if the perpetrator of the violation, Members of the Council, is a democratic government, ladies and gentlemen, there is no third way or means of escape in the defence of human rights, not even by giving a reply in this Parliament."
"We are either in favour of human rights or, quite simply, we are against them."
"Mr President, I do wish to state that we strongly condemn situations in which people die as a result of certain action."
"On the basis of the question, however, it would seem that this is more a case of a traffic accident, rather than a problem of action on the part of the Spanish police."
"This is a matter more suited to the Spanish Parliament' s Question Time, although we must remember that each institution has its own powers and this case comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish authorities."
"I am ashamed to hear what I have heard from the mouth of the President of the Spanish Socialist delegation."
"I must remind her that one Socialist Minister has been found guilty of kidnap and the Socialist Government of her leader, Felipe González, was found guilty by the Court of Human Rights for the expulsion of 103 immigrants on the border of Melilla."
"But, furthermore, I believe that the Council has responded correctly and it would be a good thing if the Socialist Member, who is also spokesperson for her delegation, would do her duty and study this thing called European construction in a little more depth and not make fools of her parliamentary group with questions concerning issues which are not within Community competence and which need to be resolved on a national level."
"If her strategy consists of discrediting the Spanish Government with falsities and furthermore displaying a deceitful, irrational and irresponsible sectarianism, she is showing a clear incapacity to understand her mission in this Parliament - which is not to exploit the tragic death of a child - then it is truly worrying that her job has started in this way."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you what policy of economic and social solidarity the Council intends to propose in the case of the numerous families that move from one country to another for purely economic reasons."
"Mr President, the question is a very far-reaching one: what can be done in this respect?"
"Certainly it is clear that if it is a question of a country, for example, that has applied for membership of the European Union, the negotiations for membership may cover discussions on how people' s living conditions may be improved."
"In addition, it is certainly appropriate that, in the case of the Phare programme, for example, ways are found of funding projects which may result in improved living conditions, and in this way reducing pressures on migration within the Union."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like you to go into a little more depth, given that we are not at all satisfied with the reply that you have given, even taking into account the limitations of the Council in this area."
"But we cannot forget that not only in my country but also in the rest of the European Union, in the years to come, we will continue to experience migratory pressure from nomadic groups, which is the case in Spain with the group of Romanian and Gypsy origin."
"And faced with this pressure, which we all know will continue to increase on our borders and within our countries, we believe that it is essential that we develop a general plan to attend to these populations."
"A general plan in which the competences and responsibilities of the European Union are defined, as well as those of each Member State."
"It is absolutely necessary to co-ordinate actions to the benefit of these groups so that at all times, in all circumstances, the human rights and dignity of people are respected."
"But the required co-ordination can never allow any Member State of the European Union to shirk its responsibilities: neither the State nor any of the administrations into which that State is divided, which has happened in the case that has been mentioned in my country."
"We therefore demand a response from the Council to this problem which we will face with regard to the nomadic migratory population in the whole of the European Union, a co-ordinated response of the Member States, which at the same time involves everybody taking their own responsibility."
"Mr President, first I would like to say that the Union aspires to a more uniform immigration and asylum policy and this is the subject intended for discussion at the Tampere Summit in October."
"I shall not go into greater detail, as Mrs Halonen has already given an account of the meeting to Parliament in its sitting today."
"I would like, however, to stress that it is important that the demarcations regarding authority that exist between institutions and bodies in Europe are relatively clear so that each one knows its business and where its ultimate responsibilities lie."
"Mr Carnero has the floor for a very brief procedural motion."
"I hope that it is a procedural motion."
"Mr President, since you know me, you will have no doubt that this is going to be a procedural motion."
"Because I am attending this debate not as a Member who simply asks questions, but as a Member who is interested in the fundamental issues in the affairs dealt with by the Council, and I witness with amazement the contents of some interventions of other colleagues, in particular Mr Hernández Mollar."
"It seems to me that he, as well as the spokesman of his delegation, Mr Galeote, has highjacked questions to the Council to discredit, in a personal and unacceptable way, a colleague who has expressed completely respectable political opinions."
"I believe that this is a very pertinent procedural motion."
"The President, without calling you impertinent, considers that the motion is not pertinent and asks that others do not use the floor in this way."
"Mr Korakas has the floor for a procedural motion."
"He will lose the floor immediately if it is not a procedural motion."
"Mr President, today I received a letter from the services department informing me that the question which I submitted to the Council will be answered alongside another question submitted by another colleague."
"However, the issues in question are completely different, because our question does not cover the general issue of nuclear power plants."
"Our question concerns a specific nuclear power plant which the Turkish Government wishes to establish in an earthquake-prone area and we are correlating this issue directly with that of the terrible earthquake which took place in Turkey."
"Should, in your opinion, two completely different issues be discussed together?"
"The nuclear power plant which will be established in Morocco concerns the desalination of water. I do not know if Morocco' s problem can be likened to the one we are raising in our question as regards the station which is to be established in Turkey; that is, the problem of seismicity, particularly in view of the terrible earthquake in Turkey a few days ago."
"Mr Korakas, when we reach the questions which we have decided to respond to jointly, I will give you an explanation, but we must follow an agenda, we must follow this agenda so that the sitting may be satisfactorily completed and I am not prepared to allow any more points of order or procedural motions which disrupt the normal functioning of the question time."
"Question No 2 by (H-0407/99/rev. 1):"
