"It dared not do so in the past, and I expect it would not dare do so now concerning Britain’s occupation of approximately 300 square kilometres of Cyprus as a colony, where thousands of Cypriot civilians are governed by an administrator appointed by the Queen of England."
"Before I become too controversial for my honourable British colleagues, let me finish by saying that in this resolution we call for the setting of a timetable for the election of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive by universal suffrage."
"Nevertheless, we should, in the near future, pass a resolution calling for an end to Britain’s colonisation of Cyprus."
", . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can finally be certain that the yeti does not exist, because if it did the Chinese authorities would already have made it sign, as part of their patriotic education programme, a statement describing the Dalai Lama as a dangerous individual, and they would have publicised it."
"I consider the Dalai Lama to be a tremendously honourable man and I would be very honoured if he were to come to speak in this House."
"More seriously, faced with a dictatorial regime which restricts, imprisons, tortures and kills its people, how can we express our indignation beyond our little debate this afternoon?"
"Given that, in 30 months’ time, the world’s young people will gather in Beijing for the Olympic Games and that the Chinese Government intends to take advantage of this event to celebrate its pseudo-democratic model, I would modestly suggest that we should allow our athletes to bear a message of peace, democracy and freedom so that they can be the champions of the Tibetan cause, otherwise we will do a great disservice to everyone in that part of the world."
", . Mr President, the British colonial government did not leave behind a parliamentary democratic structure in Hong Kong but, rather, created the expectation that the People’s Republic of China would introduce that system over there."
"When Hong Kong was handed back to China, the formula of two systems in one country was devised."
"People laboured under the illusion that, for Hong Kong, this would mean that, unlike in the rest of China, a parliamentary democracy on the basis of universal suffrage and a multi-party system could exist."
"It was thought that it could thus be a trial area for future developments in the rest of China."
"We now know what those two systems come down to: capitalism under the control of the governing party in the largest part of China, and capitalism without that control in Hong Kong."
"There is a lack of democracy in both cases."
"The situation in Hong Kong, where a small selected group has been given the responsibility of self-government, is of course preferable by far to the situation in Tibet, where violence, intimidation and re-education are the instruments employed by the central authority."
"Although my group has not been among the signatories of the resolution, I am prepared to endorse it."
"Moreover, I should like to remind you that the Dalai Lama has already addressed this Parliament’s plenary."
", . Mr President, today’s debate on violations of human rights centres on Tibet."
"On 23 November, officials from the Public Security Bureau closed one of the oldest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on the orders of the Chinese authorities."
"They arrested one of the most senior monks, and four others whose fate is unknown."
"A policy of ‘patriotic education’, which amounts to indoctrination, has been introduced in the country in order to boost support for the Chinese Government among the Tibetan monks, and to combat the influence of the exiled Dalai Lama."
"Tibet has been brutally occupied by China since 1950."
"The Tibetans have not given up their peaceful fight for freedom, however, even though at least one fifth of the country’s inhabitants have died of hunger, been tortured to death or been executed."
"Nearly all of the country’s monasteries, which once numbered over 6 500, are in ruins."
"The Holy Father John Paul II reminded us that the seeds of destabilisation, rebellion and violence are inevitably sown when human rights are neglected or even abused."
"There is an urgent need to restore people’s awareness of the dignity of every human being, made in the image and likeness of God, so that it can be used as a sound foundation for freedom, justice and peace on earth."
"The Government of the People’s Republic of China, however, even imposes strict controls on religious practices and places of worship."
"It limits the number of monks and uses exile as a punishment, especially for anyone who is not suitably submissive."
"Yet notwithstanding the massive scale of the tragedy in Tibet, it is worth noting that the problem of human rights violations, which is an issue that has already been raised in this Chamber, affects the Chinese nation as a whole."
"The people of China have been repressed for years, and all manifestations of civil independence in the country are stifled."
"There is detailed documentary evidence of the methods and instruments used to inflict torture on prisoners and of the brutal treatment they receive, even if they have merely voiced their discontent."
"Such practices are proof of the cruel barbarity that prevails there."
"The situation in China in recent times can be described as a highly explosive mixture of Communism and capitalism."
"The laws of economics have become the only driving force behind development in the country, and there is no longer any place for human rights or moral standards."
"While it may well be the case that those in power are responsible for human rights violations in individual countries, we should not forget that the moral relativism of the Western world is also partly responsible."
"Adamant claims are made that this latter promotes human rights, and yet companies from more or less every country in the world find it hard to resist the huge consumer market and the cheap workforce, especially in the ‘reeducation through work’ camps."
"The prospect of enormous profits helps them to shut their eyes to the tragic situation of prisoners, and to the fact that the materialistic civilisation that is emerging is heading for disaster, at the same time creating poverty and hell on earth for some and paradise for the rich."
"We are therefore calling for the international community to stop treating China as if it were a giant labour camp and a cheap workforce, and for human rights to be respected not only in Tibet and Hong Kong, but throughout China."
"Mr President, one of the problems in connection with the persistent violations of human rights in Communist China is the lack of credible, consistent and firm protest from the European Union."
"We are always paying lip service to human rights, but we do not act on the basis of what we say."
"The European Union and most Member States are more interested in China’s economic potential than in having human rights respected."
"Just think of the European Council’s attempts to lift the arms embargo against China or the way in which European trade missions get in each other’s way in China these days."
"I was also embarrassed when I heard a while ago that the Belgian Government had denied the Dalai Lama access to its territory, because this could be harmful to our contacts with Communist China."
"We are currently debating the situations in Tibet and Hong Kong, but we could also debate the threats to Taiwan or the existence of the lao gai concentration camps in China."
"It is time Europe sent a strong message, for example by inviting the Dalai Lama to visit this House."
". Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in China, in particular the detention of monks and closure of monasteries in Tibet, as well as constitutional developments in Hong Kong."
"These issues are very high on the agenda of our dialogue with China."
"The Commission also welcomes and supports the General Affairs and External Relations Council's conclusions of 12 December, which voice strong concern over China’s human rights policy – in particular, with respect to the rights of minorities."
"On 12 December, the General Affairs and External Relations Council also approved the Commission’s negotiating mandate for a new partnership and cooperation agreement with China."
"The mandate also stipulates that a partnership agreement with China will contain a standard clause on human rights."
"I wish to stress that, for many years, we have not concluded agreements with other parties without such a human rights clause."
"As regards Hong Kong, the European Union supports democracy throughout the world as the best means of creating legitimate, stable, accountable and transparent government, of protecting rights and freedom, and of upholding the rule of law."
"It supports early and substantial progress towards the ultimate goal of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, as set out in the basic law, in line with the wishes of the people of Hong Kong."
"It is important that we maintain pressure on China to work towards universal suffrage in Hong Kong."
"As regards the situation in Tibet, the European Union has put Tibet very high on its agenda with China."
"It has, in particular, mainly focused its attention on the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"The present situation in the region, which we follow very closely, raises grave concern, especially with respect to the exercise of religious freedom."
"We are worried to see that the local authorities have imposed a strict framework setting limits on the exercise of this freedom, and we deplore the recent cases of detention of monks and, in particular, the blockade of the monastery of Drepung in Lhasa."
"We hope that a solution compatible with both Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon."
"In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative but a peaceful process based on dialogue."
"We have called for years, and will continue to call, for the establishment of such a dialogue."
"We, therefore, fully support the process which has been taking place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"We firmly believe that only such a direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue."
"In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be made subject to any precondition."
"On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of the climate of confidence that appears indispensable, if a solution is to be reached."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Russia."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for having made it possible for us to arrive at a joint resolution on the position of NGOs in the Russian Federation."
"Consensus is also important because that way it is easier for us to influence the decision-makers in Russia."
"As now these are particularly urgent matters, we Social Democrats wanted just to focus on this issue covered in the statement."
"The issue is also an urgent one for the Duma, which will return to the matter in five days’ time."
"In the next parliamentary sitting we will be debating the resolution on Chechnya."
"We fully agree with Russia’s human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin that the draft law goes against Russia’s own constitution."
"It also goes against international law."
"I hope that Lukin’s opinion carries weight, because he has chaired the European Parliament-Duma joint delegation for many years."
"The freedom of NGOs to operate is an essential part of democracy and stable civil society, which the Russian leadership had said it supports."
"As a member of the Council of Europe, Russia has committed itself to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and, for example, its plans to restrict freedom of association conflicts with that totally."
"Parliament is worried about recent developments in Russia, and now the Duma has an excellent opportunity to contribute to the development of democracy."
"It can show that changes can be made."
"Obviously we hope that that will be the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is alarming to observe the changes in Russian society, with the grossest human rights abuses exemplified by the new law intended to make NGOs dependent on the state, the ongoing repressive measures directed against the former Yukos bosses Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, and by the state of war in Chechnya."
"Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are being held, contrary to Russian law, in prison camps in Siberia, a long way from Moscow and north of the Arctic Circle, in temperatures of - 50°."
"Lebedev is seriously ill. Contact with their family members and lawyers has been made extremely difficult; they have no access to information and are not allowed newspapers."
"Their defence counsel, Yevgeni Baro and Yuri Schmit, are themselves facing trial next week on a charge of defamation."
"The Russian justice system’s denial of human rights is made all the worse by the ever-tighter restrictions placed on the freedom of the press."
"We should be clear in our own minds as to what is going on here and call upon the Council and the Commission to use their influence on Russia to get human rights respected."
". Mr President, it is only true and fair to say that in recent years, Russia has, overall, made significant progress towards the respect of human rights, and this we must praise."
"Unfortunately, there are still a number of areas where progress is much needed in this vast country, with its very long and unique history and culture, and it must be encouraged to proceed with the outstanding issues, where reform is necessary."
"Such an issue is that of NGO legislation."
"It is a well accepted fact that NGOs and non-profit-making organisations are often key to developing a strong and well functioning civil society."
"Such organisations, ranging from children's charities to consumer groups, are not present in very large numbers in Russia."
"It is, of course, a fact that Russia has suffered severely from terrorism in the last few years and public sentiment, expressed through elected representatives, may, when dealing with certain NGOs, especially those in Chechnya, border on the extreme and tend to be unduly legalistic and severe."
"Although this may be understandable under certain circumstances, it is not acceptable in terms of proper respect of human rights."
"We therefore call on the Russian Duma to listen to our advice and take the necessary time to review and impose the amendments concerned with the legislation, in the light of the recommendations expressed in the Presidential review, the Council of Europe provisional opinion and this resolution."
". Mr President, for years, the point was driven home in Western Europe that Russia was undemocratic and that a very great deal needed to change there, and, indeed, sweeping changes have taken place in Russia over the past 14 years."
"Its economy now resembles America’s to a greater degree."
"The discrepancies between rich and poor that have come about as a result are now more pronounced than in the European Union."
"In the areas of democracy and human rights, the situation is certainly no better than it was in the final years of the Soviet Union under Mr Gorbachev’s leadership, and the oppression in Chechnya outstrips the crimes of Stalin."
"Where democracy and human rights are concerned, Russia is continuing a bad tradition."
"It is not so much Russia that has changed, as the perception of that nation in the countries of the European Union."
"Before, we in Western Europe saw the East, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, as an economic rival and military opponent."
"These days, we consider Russia to be an ally and supplier of energy."
"According to the former German Chancellor, who is now on Russia’s payroll, Russia now boasts a flawless democracy."
"In those circumstances, it hardly comes as a surprise that there is increasingly less room for independent television stations and that freedom of association and assembly is being curbed."
"The citizens are given less and less opportunity to get involved in government policy."
"The return to a blemished past is hastened by a law that places non-commercial organisations of citizens under government control and that has the power to suspend their funding and to dissolve them."
"This House therefore has every reason to endorse the criticism made by the Council of Europe."
". Mr President, Russia remains the largest country in the world and because it is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE it is under greater scrutiny and criticism by the EU in terms of fundamental democratic rights."
"It currently enjoys privileges, such as the PCA Agreement, a strategic partnership based on the Four Common Spaces Agreement, and eventual ENPI and EIB funding benefits."
"Russia continues to be a democracy, albeit an imperfect one."
"However, for some time now, concerns have been expressed that the Kremlin and the , so-called men of power close to President Putin, have been attempting to restrict freedom of the media and NGOs, in particular, where it was felt that they were interfering with Russian strategic interests, such as the bloody conflict in Chechnya, or the strategy of reversing some of the controversial sell-offs of the oil and gas sector in the early 1990s in order to increase the patronage of the state."
"A handful of men, such as Khodorkovsky, benefited enormously."
"He was convicted of several criminal offences and had his extensive Yukos holdings renationalised."
"His controversial trial followed with accusations internationally of political manipulation of the judicial system."
"More recently, on 23 November, the Duma approved the law restricting freedom of association and the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in Russia by imposing fiscal and residency requirements of registration, which the Council of Europe, in a provisional opinion, has seriously questioned as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."
"However, much to his credit, President Putin has listened to the objections and asked to rewrite aspects of the bill which infringe fundamental human rights and which are not legitimately necessary to fight terrorism, as was mentioned in Chechnya in particular, and money laundering."
"I hope reason prevails."
"We all wish to see a democratic, European Russia with whom we can all share fundamental common values of basic human rights."
", Mr President, my group welcomes this resolution, especially Recital I and paragraphs 8 to 13, which take the broader view of the issue that Mr Horáček and I wanted to see."
"It is often the case in these debates that we take up the cudgels against small-time dictators and neglect to address the human rights situation in major states that are of strategic and economic importance to us."
"I am glad that we are, today, spelling out how things stand in China and Russia, for if we do not, we run the risk of our economic dependency on them – for it is a regrettable fact that we are economically dependent on them in some areas – causing us to take a one-sided view of human rights or making us blind to the issues at stake."
"For years on end, the German Government minimised the importance of such things as the war in Chechnya or the smothering of human rights in Russia, or even passed over them in silence, and when you see the position that the former German Chancellor, Mr Schröder, has now taken on, you can quickly understand why they did so. We must take care that Gasprom, the partly state-owned Russian energy giant, does not start to play the sort of role once played by the United Fruit Company in Latin America."
"While we must cooperate economically and politically, we must not mince words when telling what is really going on as regards human rights."
"I am thinking here not only of the prisoners languishing under unspeakable conditions in Siberia, about whom Mr Horáček has had something to say, but also of the attempt at silencing independent organisations – NGOs, in other words – as successfully as the Russian media already have been."
"I am very much obliged to Mr Deß for seeing to it that we end up using more renewable energies, for Europe’s dependency on Russian energy is bringing us to the point where we start keeping our mouths shut about things that must not be hushed up."
",. Mr President, I should like to draw the House’s attention to a dangerous trend in Russia."
"The public prosecutor’s office and the judiciary in this country are increasingly being used as political weapons by President Putin’s regime."
"On 9 December 2005, the Russian public prosecutor’s office charged the Neftyanoi Bank with money-laundering and tax fraud."
"The Bank’s director, Boris Nemtsov, is one of Russia’s most able liberal politicians, and a key member of the anti-Putin opposition."
"This is particularly significant in view of the forthcoming presidential elections, which will be held in 2008 and which will determine the future of democracy in Russia."
"In a statement given to my party’s headquarters for its November 2005 newsletter, Mr Nemtsov said that there was a risk that a state-controlled and monopolistic capitalism could be established in Russia."
"He also expressed his belief that the country is currently undergoing a process of, and I quote, ‘Lukashenkisation’."
"The European Union should waive the requirement for Russian citizens to hold visas before they can enter EU Member States."
"The abolition of visas would serve as a guarantee for Russian civil society that the country will become more democratic."
",. Mr President, every normal democracy has what is known as a fourth estate: a collection of critical journalists and citizens, active NGOs and non-profit organisations which, as representatives of civil society, monitor the authorities, the government, the administration and parliament without any constraints or censorship."
"Except in Russia, where people or groups, business people and journalists that are too critical of the Kremlin’s and Putin’s policy are gagged."
"To top it all, the Russian authorities now also intend to silence domestic and foreign NGOs."
"I am delighted that six of the eight groups have managed to table a joint resolution that will allow us to dot the i’s and cross the t’s."
"It will give people like Mrs Alexejeva and Mr Gari Kasparov a shot in the arm and will also give a boost to the many who are active in NGOs, like Mr Nikitin at Bellona, and to NGOs like Immemorial, Greenpeace, Social Verdict and the Civil Society Contact Group."
"It also backs up the words spoken by the previous co-chairman, with myself, of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, Mr Lukin, who emphatically condemns the draft legislation in question."
"The resolution before us deserves our overwhelming support."
". Ladies and gentlemen, democracy and freedom are under threat in Russia."
"This is the main thrust of the resolution, which is a response to new rules according to which it will no longer be possible in future to bring any amount of money into the country provided that it is used to support the development of civil society."
"The second reason for the resolution is the influence exerted by the government over the majority of media outlets."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Duma will soon adopt a similar resolution on the European Union."
"Freedom, and consequently democracy, are after all also under threat here following the adoption of a proposal for the mandatory retention of telephone calls, text messages and emails for the police."
"In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi controls a decisive share of the television market, and indeed of the media market in general."
"Foreign owners clearly dominate the media in the Czech Republic, where 80% of the press is in the hands of two German groups."
"This constitutes a clear threat to the freedom of information, and the situation is similar in Poland and the Balkan States."
"Is no one in the House concerned in the slightest by this state of affairs?"
"It is my belief that this House will unanimously reject this motion for a resolution once it has given a small amount of thought to the matter."
"If it does not, our electorate’s opinion of us will be far from flattering. Unless, of course, Members of this House have drafted a motion for a resolution condemning media monopolies in EU Member States."
"Mr President, it is a shame that we are discussing human rights violations in Russia on a Thursday afternoon."
"This is particularly regrettable as we spent a great deal of time debating Tunisia on Wednesday, when all the Members of the House and the media were present."
"Freedom of speech and thought is one of the European Union’s fundamental values, and it is the cornerstone of democracy."
"This is reflected in the activities of the hundreds of thousands of NGOs that constitute the third most powerful and influential force in Europe."
"Yet it is an unfortunate fact that laws are being adopted in Russia which are alien and incomprehensible to us in Europe."
"Russia is moving ever further away from democratic standards, and we cannot stand idly by and watch fundamental rights being denied in a country that has a privileged relationship with the EU."
"We cannot remain indifferent in the face of changes that are so blatantly undemocratic."
"Russian NGOs will find it more difficult or even impossible to obtain foreign funding."
"The new restrictions will apply to as many as 450 000 organisations in Russia, including foreign and international organisations operating in the Russian Federation."
"The new law prohibits the activities carried out in line with the rules previously in force by Russian branches and representations of foreign and international organisations."
"What this means is that they will have to shut down their current branches, and submit applications to set up new organisations that will be independent of the parent NGOs."
"Foreigners who do not have permanent residency in Russia will lose the right to form civil organisations, as well as the right to sit on the boards or be members of such organisations."
"Certain Russian politicians have claimed that NGOs are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia, but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy."
"The European Union should make known its strong opposition to such a reprehensible attitude, which is symptomatic of the increase in xenophobia among Russia’s political elite."
"The existence of 450 000 NGOs in Russia, and the fact that they are so active, testify to the popularity of this aspect of public and social life in Russia."
"The European Union should support this manifestation of civil society."
"Mr President, although I fully support the proposed resolution, I would just like to point out that the Council and the Commission are applying double standards in respect of the Eastern States."
"Here is a concrete example: the widely known and regular violation of human rights in Belarus and Russia."
"Russia, furthermore, is engaged in the genocide of a nation, which is something that is not happening even in Belarus."
"Nevertheless, the Council and the Commission treat the two States completely differently."
"The doors to European Union States have been slammed in Lukashenka’s face, yet President Putin is welcomed with open arms."
"If these double standards are only being applied because of Russia’s oil and gas, resources that Belarus does not have, then such a policy is immoral, although the European Union is supposed to be the standard-bearer of human rights, as well as moral policy."
"I do not believe that the Council and the Commission are unaware of the principles of moral policy; however, these principles should not be sold for oil and gas."
"Mr President, I hope that this empty Chamber does not reflect our lack of interest in what happens in Russia, however understandable the situation is here on a Thursday afternoon."
"What happens in Russia is in our interests; its interests are our interests."
"Sadly, the clock in Russia is now being turned back nearly to Soviet times."
"There is, at the moment, no independent judiciary, there is no free television, and the political opposition has been totally marginalised."
"I will not even talk about what is happening in Chechnya; human life is very cheap there."
"Regarding NGOs, what happens to them is another link in this far too long chain of sad events in Russia."
"We cannot be the victim of the ‘NIMBY’ syndrome: not in my back yard."
"Indeed, it is all in our back yard."
"It concerns us all."
"Old habits die very hard in the Soviet Union, but we have to help Russia to come back towards democracy and universal values."
"First of all, it is in the interests of the Russian people: they deserve liberty, democracy and transparent governance."
"We also cannot work with a partner who does not adhere to international rules."
"We have to help Russia become a confident nation which sees that there is no conflict between strength and a democratic, thriving civil society."
"We have to speak with one voice; otherwise, we reduce our position to something insignificant."
"We cannot have a good Christmas, we cannot have a good conscience, if we do not see what is happening to our near neighbour."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"It is an undeniable fact that organisations known as NGOs and MPOs have a vital role in our civil society, both in large countries such as Russia, as well as in small countries such as where I come from."
"In Russia, the number of the many organisations which exist is around seventy thousand."
"Less than three weeks ago the parliament known as the State Duma passed some amendments, through the first reading, which had an impact on these organisations."
"One must appreciate the thought both within Russia as well as outside Russia about these amendments which can have an impact on human rights."
"However, one must mention that in certain countries there was a small number of these organisations which were abused for illicit and illegal aims."
"On the other hand, the amendments proposed by Russia have a negative impact on those organisations known as ‘buona fide’."
"On a positive note, the Council of Europe was asked for guidance and even the President of this country, Putin, made some proposals to the new chairman."
"To conclude, I would like to say that the solution is not to place these organisations in the same category, but to have the necessary legal tools within the parameters of the European Convention so that those which are not genuine will be identified."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commission’s view on human rights in Russia."
"There are a number of issues which give us cause for concern and which we raise regularly with Russia within the framework of the existing strategic partnership."
"Let me begin with Chechnya."
"We were glad that the elections took place there on 27 November, and that they took place without violence."
"Given the troubled history of this region that in itself is an achievement."
"We hope they will be a step in the process towards peaceful democracy there."
"However, there are a number of reports of irregularities, and we expect that these will be properly investigated."
"But much more needs to be done if Chechnya is to progress to democratic stability."
"Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation, a culture of impunity remains."
"It is essential that the authorities fully investigate cases of disappearances and allegations of torture and bring the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, to justice."
"Russia should also implement its expressed willingness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Rapporteurs."
"It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya is seen to be carrying out his duties impartially and effectively."
"I should also express our concern at the evidence of continuing harassment of NGOs including those receiving support from the European Community, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod."
"This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme."
"In that context, I should draw attention to the proposal for amending Russian legislation on NGOs which is currently before the Duma."
"We have been concerned that it could make the operations of many NGOs, especially foreign ones, more difficult, and could therefore potentially jeopardise the Commission’s efforts to help build up civil society in Russia, as well as our humanitarian aid programme in Chechnya."
"The amendments have been presented as necessary to enforce Russia’s right to protect itself from terrorism."
"Of course, we respect that right, but action taken must be proportionate and must respect international commitments regarding civil society, notably those relating to the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"My colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner raised these concerns with Foreign Minister Lavrov during the Russian Government’s visit to Brussels on 7 December."
"He expressed understanding and said that amendments would be made to the bill to address these issues."
"We were, therefore, pleased to note that changes to the draft law have now been sent from the presidential administration to the Duma and welcome the prior consultations held with the Council of Europe on the matter."
"However, we remain concerned that the present draft law could still lead to constraints on the legitimate activities of NGOs."
"We urge the Russian Parliament, therefore, to use the second reading on 21 December to take the Council of Europe’s opinion fully into account."
"We will continue to follow this matter closely, including the implementation of any new law adopted."
"Finally, let me say that we want to address these issues in a spirit of cooperation with Russia."
"The EU-Russia human rights consultations, which began this year, are now a regular feature of our dialogue and provide an opportunity for frank and open exchanges."
"In addition the Commission, as well as being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the North Caucasus through ECHO, has agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socio-economic recovery there – a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region."
"We will continue to take all opportunities to contribute constructively to that process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Ethiopia and new border conflicts."
". Mr President, as head of the European Union Election Observation Mission in Ethiopia, I helped to persuade Ethiopian opposition leaders not to boycott the May elections, assuring them that the world and the European Union in particular were watching."
"They felt that the electoral process had been set up by the regime not to achieve democracy but to fool the international community."
"Despite being elected by the Ethiopian people, they are now in jail."
"They have been on hunger strike since 28 November, face a possible death penalty, and yet are neglected by European leaders."
"This is in spite of the fact that, in early September, I warned European governments, the Commission, the US Government and the UN Secretary-General that the regime might be planning the selective repression of Ethiopian opposition leaders."
"How could European governments fail so miserably those who trusted the European Union, those who fought and continue to fight for democracy in Ethiopia?"
"How could European and American leaders fail so miserably the Ethiopian people and such an important country: the second most populous in Africa and the headquarters of the African Union?"
"What message are they sending to all Africans?"
"How can the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council continue to turn a blind eye to massive human rights violations inside Ethiopia, forgetting how this could lead to another devastating war with neighbouring Eritrea?"
"How can Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council, continue to allow in his Commission for Africa Mr Meles Zenawi, who is keeping imprisoned and threatening with the death penalty the elected opposition leaders, journalists, human rights and development campaigners and even the Ethiopian representatives of the Global Call to Action against Poverty?"
"This is the third resolution since July in which the European Parliament, across all political groups, has expressed its deep concern about the situation in Ethiopia."
"How can European leaders fail to act upon repeated appeals from this Parliament when the lives of Ethiopian prisoners are at stake?"
". Mr President, Ethiopia is one of the countries that receives most international economic aid; the European Union alone provides almost $500 million per year."
"We cannot therefore remain on the sidelines in view of the events that are taking place in that country, particularly following the brutal and entirely unjustified policy of human rights abuses and mass imprisonment of opposition leaders, human rights activists and NGO workers implemented by the Ethiopian authorities."
"The extremely harsh and unjustified repression of people who were protesting against what they believed to be electoral fraud cannot go unpunished."
"Firstly, therefore, the European Union must demand of the authorities in Addis Ababa the immediate unconditional release of all political prisoners, as well as the journalists and editors being held."
"Secondly, it must be ensured that humanitarian aid, which is still so necessary to the population, is channelled via NGOs and the United Nations and, thirdly, that the maintaining of the arms embargos on the region is guaranteed, as well as strict compliance with the code of conduct on arms exports."
". Mr President, I shall begin with the Eritrean border."
"The Ethiopian Government’s decision to move back its forces has been very welcome."
"This is a highly tense situation and it is not helped by Eritrea’s eviction of members of the UN mission."
"When we were in Edinburgh, the Eritrean Ambassador to the EU told me that Eritrea wanted the situation resolved, but Ethiopia was refusing to take action."
"This morning the First Secretary at the Ethiopian Mission to the EU told me that Ethiopia wanted the situation resolved but needed channels of discussion on the process of implementing the boundary commission decision."
"If it is fundamentally the case that, despite past animosity, there is now the will for peace on both sides, could the Commission and Council not play a more active role in bringing the two sides together?"
"Secondly, on the situation inside Ethiopia, the Council will be aware that a cross-party group of us who observed the 15 May elections wrote to Hilary Benn, the British Secretary of State for International Development, on 23 November."
"We detailed our concern at the loss of life and the human rights abuses which have taken place there since June."
"I am told that an answer is awaiting the Minister’s signature."
"This may be the political equivalent of a cheque in the post, but I understand that the Council and Commission are committed to pursing a robust discussion on democracy and human rights issues under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"I hope it will indeed be robust and that the option of initiating urgent consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement will be borne in mind if progress is not forthcoming."
". Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I should like to ask the Commissioner, in connection with the resolution on the situation in Ethiopia, whether the European Commission, or any other aid donor, has suspended aid to Eritrea following the latter’s flight ban on UN helicopters monitoring the situation on the border between the two countries."
"This ban is a gross violation of the terms of the truce, and it would only be sensible to take clear action on this matter."
"I realise that Ethiopia, all valid criticism notwithstanding, has made more progress towards what we call democracy than its rival in East Africa, but I cannot help but wonder why the authors of this resolution have not called for talks to be held with the descendants of the dynasty that previously ruled the country, and for the restitution of the property of this dynasty and of the old hereditary aristocracy."
"It would be only logical to do so, in view of the fact that we have adopted resolutions today calling for the future EU Member States to make such restitution."
"Today we have adopted resolutions that call for restitution, but I would ask whether this is not a clear-cut case of double standards."
"We are unyielding in our calls for restitution only where Bulgaria and Romania are concerned."
"We do not make similar calls in the case of Ethiopia, since it would be all too obvious that they are pointless."
"I support the resolutions, but I am astonished that neither the current head of the Imperial Family of Ethiopia or even President Putin will be asked to appear before the European Parliament, even though His Holiness the Dalai Lama was called on to do so in the resolution on Tibet."
"I am sure that it is only me that thinks that the European Parliament may well be applying double standards."
"Incidentally, I should like to ask the Commissioner what the Commission’s response is to the recent adoption by members of the Australian Parliament of a law which curtails civil liberties and which, , allows people to be detained for 14 days."
". Mr President, if you look hard enough on the map of the Horn of Africa, you find a little island of stability called Djibouti."
"All around it, the situation is precarious."
"Somalia scarcely exists as a state any more; the domestic situation in Eritrea is highly critical, with the opposition suppressed, and in Ethiopia, the situation after the elections is exactly as the EU’s principal observer, Mrs Gomes, has described it."
"Not only that, but Ethiopia is subject to the destabilising influence of Eritrea, which we know to be supporting guerrillas fighting in Ogaden, and the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia is still threatening to erupt into open warfare."
"Today, here in this House, we are focusing on the domestic situation in post-election Ethiopia, and so the demand we have to make is no vague one: we must call upon the government to desist from deploying disproportionate force to suppress the opposition and the general population, and must release all political prisoners and journalists without delay."
"I heard recently that three more had been arrested, so the most up-to-date state of affairs is that 15 journalists are in custody."
"The International Red Cross must also be given access to the camps in which so very many people are being held."
"The country’s prime minister has again said that he will not only put the political leaders on trial, but also the 3 000 other detainees with them, and that there would be no mercy whatever – not even a Christmas amnesty."
"As the Ethiopian Government is quite clearly bent upon confrontation, we call on the European Union to give thought to the possibility of imposing – as we already do against other regimes – targeted sanctions against those in power in Ethiopia, which would, I believe, send out a clear signal."
"If these people are no longer permitted to travel to Europe on shopping trips, perhaps it will also dawn on them that they can no longer count on our support, and that we have no confidence that they are leading their country in the right direction."
". Mr President, the fact that we, in this House, are already adopting the third resolution on Ethiopia in less than half a year shows how grave and disturbing the situation in that country is."
"Heartening though it is that the Ethiopian authorities have set 8 000 people at liberty, the figure does demonstrate that mass arrests have taken place, while the government has hitherto always declined to make known either the total number of persons actually detained or the locations at which they were being held."
"Our resolution therefore demands that the Ethiopian Government give information as to the total number of persons detained and the places where they are being held, allow access to them by the International Committee of the Red Cross and their families, and ensure that they get legal advice and medical care."
"."
"Mr President, human rights violations in Ethiopia are not a new thing."
"Nor is condemnation of these violations new."
"Twice in 2005 this Parliament passed resolutions on the situation in Ethiopia, and twice we were disappointed by the response."
"Recently the Ethiopian ruling regime undertook an alarmingly gigantic crack-down operation against political leaders, human rights defenders, independent journalists, NGO workers and young people voicing opposition to the government in Addis Abba."
"Thousands of civilians have been arrested and detained without trial."
"About 8 000 have now been released, but an unknown number still remain in custody."
"We are also most concerned about troop movements on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean sides of the border."
"The fear of a new war is now real and the devastating hostilities of the recent past may once again become a nightmare reality of the present."
"We call on the Ethiopian Government to respect the human rights of its citizens and we also call on both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Governments to show restraint, abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and, in the spirit of good faith, resolve their border differences peacefully."
"I will conclude by saying that what we heard from Mrs Gomes was most disturbing and serious and I hope the Commission will be able to give answers to the questions she posed."
".Mr President, yet again we turn our attention to Ethiopia and yet again the situation has not improved and if anything got worse."
"Reports get worse and worse."
"We now hear that some eighteen thousand youths have been arrested in Addis Ababa and have been taken to an open field by the Dedesa River and imprisoned."
"It will need to be a very big field."
"The Ethiopian authorities must be put under strong pressure by us to reveal how many of their citizens they are mistreating."
"This motion for a resolution has a number of ideas as to how, but I would be grateful for your update, Mr Commissioner, on what your plans are and what action you will be taking."
"The government must disclose how many, particularly how many young people, have been imprisoned and how many killed."
"Also, what is the Commission's view of the prospective establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into this whole business?"
"We have much to do on this, colleagues, so I would, in closing – as I believe the last MEP speaker of 2005 – wish you all a restful holiday, a happy Hogmanay as we call New Year in Scotland, and I look forward to seeing you in 2006 when we will be able to redouble our efforts on this dreadful situation."
"Mr President, although I hope our wishes for a joyful Christmas will also reach the people of Ethiopia, I believe that the holiday season will be a sad time for many of them."
"I say this because a not insignificant number of Ethiopians are Christian, and Ethiopia, which is one of the two largest countries in Africa, has Christian roots."
"As I see it, this is a further reason why the many EU Member States that share these Christian roots should defend human rights in Ethiopia."
"I trust the Commissioner will not act like a certain African bird today."
"I refer to the ostrich, which is known for its habit of burying its head in the sand."
"I hope that Mr Verheugen will speak boldly about the will and determination of the European Commission and of the EU authorities to stand up for human rights in a country in which such rights are indeed being violated, whatever anyone may say."
"I have faith that the Commissioner will do so, and this faith gives me hope."
"I should like to wish both him and the House as a whole a merry Christmas."
". Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the internal political developments in Ethiopia since the elections on 15 May."
"The democratisation process has come to a difficult crossroads."
"The Commission condemns the killings of innocent civilians by the security forces on the streets of Addis Ababa and in other cities of the country in July and November."
"The arrest of thousands of people for sympathising with the opposition parties is unacceptable."
"The Commission also condemns the arrest of opposition leaders who have completed three weeks of hunger strike, putting their lives in danger."
"The Commission’s concern has been expressed in writing by Commissioner Louis Michel, as well as in Addis Ababa by the European Union and United States' ambassadors, and by the Donor Ambassadors Group."
"The Ethiopian authorities have been duly notified of our concerns but have not yet reacted in a constructive manner."
"As an immediate reaction to the events, the Commission and other donors have agreed to reconsider the implementation of development aid."
"Budget support is already delayed, whereas humanitarian aid, food aid and other programmes continue at present."
"On the political front, the European Union Heads of Mission will launch a structured political dialogue with the Ethiopian Government, according to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The Heads of Mission in Addis Ababa have proposed to the government a detailed structure for the dialogue and performance indicators to measure progress on the political and human rights situations."
"These indicators mainly relate to progress in the democratisation process, the respect for human rights and the rule of law, as well as issues of regional peace and stability."
"At this stage, the Commission does not consider that consultations, as foreseen in Article 96, should be opened because there is still hope that political dialogue can achieve positive results."
"In the longer term, the Commission will need to work on the strengthening of democratic institutions in Ethiopia and the promotion of open dialogue between the government and civil society."
"Currently, the Commission is promoting the advocacy role of Ethiopian civil society with the aim of enabling them to play a stronger role in the democratisation process."
"In our view, these efforts must be continued, despite setbacks to the democratisation process."
"On the Ethiopia/Eritrea peace process I would like to recall the European Union position on this matter."
"The European Union encourages the parties to abide by the Algiers Peace Agreement, as well as by the final and binding decision of April 2002 of the Ethiopia/Eritrea Boundary Commission."
"Eritrea and Ethiopia should respect and implement UN Security Council Resolution 1640(2005)."
"Furthermore, the initiative is with the United Nations Security Council because the United Nations is the guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and can enforce international law."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
". I am concerned about the deteriorating situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea which threatens to lead to a new war."
"It took the Eritreans decades and the deaths of tens of thousands of freedom fighters to achieve independence."
"Since then the human rights situation in Ethiopia has remained dire, while in Eritrea it has deteriorated from adequate to very poor."
"Nevertheless the shadow of conflict hanging over the region makes it even more difficult to see human rights significantly improve in either country."
"Therefore it is important that the Commission and Council press both countries to return to the troop deployment levels of 16 December 2004, and for Eritrea in particular to reverse its decision to ban helicopter flights by the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea and to ask some members of the Mission to leave."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, it was a request for a split vote on paragraph 14, but having discussed it with some of my colleagues from other groups, we can make it very simple."
"It is a split vote on the word ‘address’."
"If that falls, then we will be able to support the resolution."
"It will then read: ‘Urges the Conference of Presidents to invite His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament during 2006’."
"I hope that split vote will go through so that we can support the resolution as a whole."
"Mr President, I just want to ask about the split vote from a procedural point of view."
"Is it in order to have a split vote when it has not been put in writing before the actual part-session begins?"
"I just need a ruling on that and to know which rule you will be speaking to."
"Mr President, this matter should not be treated as more important than it is; the word ‘Head of State’ is nowhere to be found in the resolution."
"The Dalai Lama has addressed the plenary before, and we can, for once, leave the practicalities of the arrangements to the Conference of Presidents and the Bureau."
"That concludes the vote."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 December 2005."
"Colleagues, the new year is usually a time of optimism for the future, but this year we were all saddened by the tragic and untimely death on New Year’s Eve of Phillip Whitehead, the wise and able Chairman of our Committee on the Internal and Consumer Protection."
"Phillip was highly respected across this House."
"He arrived here in 1994, bringing with him his experience as a producer of television documentaries and as a national politician, together with his strong and unwavering support for an active role for his country in the European Union."
"Today, I would like us to remember him and his achievements here, from laws on the media, to others on food safety; from his tireless defence of the rights of consumers, to his work in helping to make the historic enlargement to central and eastern Europe a reality."
"I would also highlight the wisdom, political skill and good humour he brought to bear in piloting the controversial and complex services directive through his committee."
"Dear Phillip, we will all miss you."
"I ask all of you here today to share a minute’s silence in his memory."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of labour mobility and the mobility of students is very important for my country, Slovakia, as well as for other new members of the Union."
"At this point, I do not intend to speak about transitional periods, through which other Member States of the European Union have imposed considerable restrictions on the movement of labour."
"However, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to Austria, the country currently holding the Presidency of the EU, to amend its laws on the admission of foreign students, including those from Slovakia, to Austrian universities and to repeal the ‘Numerus Clausus’ provision in favour of the principle of equal opportunity."
"This could be achieved, in my view, by introducing admissions exams or probationary semesters."
"This would be a step towards attaining the pan-European objective of building a knowledge-based society."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the group of European Socialists, I wish to express our deep sorrow and disenchantment over the senseless deaths of eighteen civilians in the Pakistani village of Damadola as a result of bombing by American aircraft."
"I would like to state here that I fully respect the efforts undertaken by the United States in the fight against global terrorism, as well as the joint actions of the US and EU in tracking down the masterminds and perpetrators of terrorist attacks against civilians."
"On the other hand, there is nothing in our democratic societies that precludes us from expressing reservations about attacks that cause the deaths of civilians in any country, especially if the victims are women and children."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Russian-Ukrainian energy crisis has exposed the true face of Russia as an economic partner – a hidden threat to use the energy sector for political purposes."
"When my country, Lithuania, decided to restore its independence and secede from the Soviet Union 15 years ago, it experienced similar behaviour on the part of Russia – an economic and energy blockade."
"By repeatedly emphasising the significance of Russia as a strategic partner and its exceptional position among other countries, the European Union is offering Russia concessions."
"The main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the European Union energy sector on Russian resources."
"Is it not obvious, however, that Russia could resort to the same tactics it used on us in respect of the European Union if it experiences difficulties?"
"Therefore, I invite everyone not only to discuss the development of a common energy policy, but also to take actions to develop such policy immediately."
"Mr President, four years ago, the United States was transferring its first prisoners of the war against terrorism, hooded and chained, to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay on its naval base in Cuba."
"Around 500 people, from 35 countries, are still being held, without charge or sentence, deprived of the rights recognised by international law."
"There are an increasing number of reports of torture and of poor treatment of the detainees in this centre."
"In fact, the prisoners remain in a ‘lawless’ situation."
"They are often put in isolation, sometimes for months on end, for having infringed the camp’s strict operational rules."
"Several have attempted suicide."
"The United States’ plan to have the detainees tried by military commissions will only heighten the injustice because these commissions are not independent and because they admit statements obtained through the use of force or torture."
"In these conditions, is it not about time we lent our support to those in Europe who are calling for the closure of this centre?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that we all want to reinvigorate the debate on European policy, but that does presuppose not only the political will, but also a comprehensive information and communications campaign extending throughout Europe and tailored to the various target groups."
"Awareness is, after all, dependent on information."
"There is no single reading and exercise book for all schools throughout the EU; with the support of the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, the Austrian journalists Wolfgang Böhm and Otmar Lahodynsky have written one that could, with only a few amendments, be used in all the EU Member States."
"I ask you, Mr President, to see to it that this book is published and made available in all the EU-Infopoints and EU information offices."
"We have also produced an EU pocket quiz aimed at young people, with 40 questions and answers, and that, too, does not need much adaptation to make it suitable for all the EU’s Member States."
"I ask you, Mr President, to do your part in getting these two publications included in Plan D and hence in making it possible for a single European reading book and an information campaign to be kicked off."
"Mr President, a short while ago we received a delegation representing the port workers who held a massive demonstration today in our town."
"Trade union representatives have condemned the violent acts carried out by a few uncontrolled elements, right here in Strasbourg and towards our Parliament, but they have drawn our attention to the dangers posed by the port services Directive with regard to the status of port workers, and to the quality and security of port services."
"The representatives have called on MEPs to do as they did two years ago and reject this directive that is both pointless and harmful, when it comes back to Parliament."
"This directive is both harmful and pointless because, as the port workers have pointed out, European port services are the most competitive in the world, and there is no need to intensify competition in our ports."
"Mr President, we started this year with an urgent meeting of the representatives of the EU States concerning the supply of gas from Russia."
"The Russian-Ukrainian energy crisis served as a wake-up call for the European Union."
"The dependence of the European Union energy sector on Russia, where from 50 to 90 percent of all energy resources of the States of the European Union originate, has long been a reason for concern to the citizens of the European Union, as well as residents of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is an open secret that the EU energy sector is still being managed and regulated in such a manner that some members of the European Union often gain at the expense of other states, at the expense of other EU States or in violation of those States' interests."
"This should not be the case."
"Therefore, considering the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the growing demand placed on energy resources, I invite you, Mr President, to endeavour to develop a single European Union energy policy, while making the drafting of the project a priority on the agenda of both the Commission and the European Parliament."
"– Mr President, last week the Austrian Presidency announced that the period of reflection on the European Constitution was closed and that it intended to present a new proposal at the June summit."
"On the other hand, in France, the Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Sarkozy, proposed an original method for reviewing the proposed text, which would be based on a study by a group of experts, which would tour the European capitals and set its conclusions out in a short text that could be passed by the national parliaments."
"I wish to draw your attention, Mr President, to the fact that neither proposal makes any provision whatsoever for the grass-roots verdict which sparked the review of the road being taken by the European Union."
"Some months after the Dutch 'no', it would be a good idea if we were to study the experience we have acquired and how we can put it to optimum use, in order to remedy the democratic deficit which has developed between the institutions and the citizens."
"Inflammatory statements, therefore, and anti-democratic processes will certainly not create a European Union of the citizens."
"Mr President, a radio station owned by the Catholic leadership in Spain has embarked upon a campaign of apology for Francoism and coups d’etat."
"The European Union has been built upon the values of freedom and plurality, and in several of our countries holocaust denial or advocating Nazi-fascism are crimes."
"It is not a crime in Spain to defend the crimes of Francoism, but those people who do so must be morally reprimanded."
"As a final example of that radio station’s crazed attitude, one of its so-called ‘journalists’ passed himself off as President Zapatero in order to secure a fraudulent interview with the President-elect of Bolivia, Evo Morales."
"Masquerading as the President is a crime punishable by ten years in prison in the United States, but we are not calling for prison sentences or precautionary closure; we are asking this Parliament to apply a moral penalty, which could perhaps consist of one hundred Our Fathers and fifty Hail Marys in penance for their sins."
"Mr President, an investigation in Poland has revealed that the driver responsible for the accident that claimed the lives of six people, including the MEP Dr Filip Adwent, had traces of amphetamine in his blood at the time."
"This affected his ability to control the lorry he was driving."
"I refer to this tragic accident in the light of the report recently published by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"It emerges from this report that drug addiction is one of the most serious threats we face, and that it is becoming a particular problem among the younger generation."
"As we have seen, it is no longer only addicts that are put at risk by this problem, but society as a whole."
"How many more people, whether addicts or innocent victims such as our colleague, must die before the European Commission, Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States react by drafting tough anti-drugs legislation?"
"The latter is what is needed instead of the texts tabled to date, which provide a greater level of protection for the free market than for precious human lives."
"The report sets out proposals regarding the effectiveness of measures to prevent drug addiction and tough regulations, and I would call on all legislators to ensure that these proposals are incorporated into both Community and national law."
"Mr President, the recent dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas supplies and the relentless rise in oil prices are indications of how vulnerable Europe is when it comes to supplies of these vital commodities."
"Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on imports, which often come from regions that are highly unstable."
"We already import 60% of our oil, for example, and this figure will rise in the future."
"It is becoming apparent that no EU Member State, no matter how large, will be able to tackle such problems by itself in future."
"I should therefore like to call once again on the European Commission and the European Council to speed up preparations for a proposal on a common energy policy, which should also tie in with the common foreign and security policy."
"I do not believe that we can continue with the present situation, dependent as we are on the good will or otherwise of certain authoritarian or totalitarian regimes in our vicinity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to condemn the fact that this weekend the terrorist organisation Batasuna, the political wing and cradle of the criminals of ETA, intends to hold its congress in the Basque Country."
"As you will know, Batasuna has been illegalized in Spain and appears on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations, and it would be truly scandalous for Batasuna to hold this event, because it would constitute a direct affront against the rule of law and freedoms of a Member State of the European Union, Spain."
"It would be a democratic indignity for Europe, a surrender to the thinking of the ETA-Batasuna terrorists and, above all, a betrayal of the victims of terrorism and an insult to their memory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine an illegalized party such as the Nazi party wishing to hold a congress in Germany or Austria? Can you imagine Al Qaeda wanting to hold an event in New York?"
"It is unimaginable."
"Well in Spain, the terrorists want once again to side-step the law."
"Over recent days, regrettably, there have been comments from the Basque nationalist government and Spain’s Socialist government aimed at rolling out a red carpet for these terrorists, which they can walk unhindered at their coming congress."
"The European Parliament must condemn this event that ETA-Batasuna wants to hold and speak out in favour of strict compliance with the Law on Parties."
"Mr President, I hope you will send a message of congratulations to the Council on its decision to meet henceforth in public when discussing codecision legislation."
"This meets a long-standing demand of the European Parliament, and the British Presidency is to be congratulated on achieving this breakthrough."
"The UK Presidency was quite a good one for the European Parliament in other respects too."
"It agreed, firstly, to reopen Council discussions on the comitology system in order to give Parliament the same rights of scrutiny and call-back as the Council."
"Secondly, it agreed to take the data retention proposals as first-pillar legislation under codecision rather than as an intergovernmental third-pillar fix, as some other governments wanted."
"Finally, it set an example as to how presidencies should deal with Parliament, with a record number of ministerial appearances, including no fewer than four by Prime Minister Blair himself."
"I hope the Austrian Presidency will do as well."
"It has not started well on the institutional front, with Chancellor Schüssel’s quite ill-informed attack on the Court of Justice."
"– Mr President, there are a number of national governments which do not accept the institutional role of the European Parliament."
"They believe that the European Parliament 'moves' on a smaller scale than the national parliaments."
"Let us make one thing clear: our role, our institutional role, is as important as that of the national parliaments."
"The Greek government is reviewing the Constitution."
"It has called on the parties of the Greek parliament, but it has not called on the parties in the European Parliament."
"This is clearly a slight."
"I should therefore like you to intervene, so that the national governments see the role of the European Parliament which befits it, by which I mean that its role must be similar to that of the national parliaments."
"It is unacceptable for the Greek government not to accept as a debater our party, which obtained 4.5% here and 6% in the opinion polls, precisely because it feels threatened by our ascent."
"We therefore want the right to democracy."
"We want the right of coexistence."
"Please contact the president of the Greek parliament and make him understand that this is illegal and reckless."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating the Year of Mobility."
"Mobility is understood to mean a change of workplace and place of work."
"In order for this change to succeed, certain means are required, the most basic of which is multilingualism."
"We therefore fail to understand why a knowledge of the language of the country of origin of European citizens living in other countries in the European Union is not maintained with lessons in the mother tongue right from nursery and school age, so that this can be maintained and developed, both by the specific host country and by the country of origin and the European Union as a whole."
"I trust that the European Commission will strengthen the teaching of the mother tongue of migrant workers."
"Mr President, I agree with Mrs Flautre’s condemnation of the scandalous fact that Guantanamo Bay has now been in existence for four years."
"Several dozen legal residents of the EU are still incarcerated there, including some of my constituents: Bisha al-Rawi, Jamil al-Banna and Omar Deghayes."
"The EU needs to exert united and cohesive pressure on the United States, which it has never done before."
"Citizens of future EU Member States are also incarcerated there."
"I refer specifically to five Bosnian citizens and one legal resident who were abducted by United States agents in January 2002, in defiance of Bosnian court orders, and held incommunicado for two years."
"I call on the Bosnian Prime Minister, Adnan Terzic, to press for their release and for the EU to encourage and support him."
"Also in the context of the so-called war on terror, it is shameful that the British Government withheld from the British Parliament for six weeks a letter from Louise Arbour, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, expressing deep concern at some of the proposals in the current anti-terrorism legislation going through the UK national parliament, despite a request that the letter be brought to the attention of the House of Lords."
"Everyone must heed what the United Nations says."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for Austria, for the second time since its accession to the European Union in 1995, to hold the presidency, in which capacity much will be expected of it in terms of initiatives."
"I thought it was particularly good news that, just before the beginning of the Austrian Presidency, some of the export refunds for live animals were at last done away with."
"I now want to appeal directly to the presidency, and in the strongest terms, to urge it to abolish all export subsidies for live animals in short order, while, in the medium term, imposing restrictions on live animal transports within Europe and ultimately to establish that animals are a core object of European legal protection."
"Even today, even in Member States of the EU, all kinds of animals are being transported or kept under appalling conditions – one example recently reported by an Austrian animal welfare organisation was in an animal sanctuary in Italy."
"This sort of thing needs to be stopped with the utmost speed."
"Mr President, to some people’s annoyance it would seem, there has been press freedom in Spain for a long time."
"While some radio stations invent suicide bombers, therefore, others are busy providing serious information."
"I am aware, thanks to COPE, that on 29 November of last year, the President of the Autonomous Community of La Rioja sent you a letter, Mr President, asking you to cooperate and actively to defend Spanish, in the knowledge that the Commission had cut the number of translators and interpreters in that language by 33%."
"That letter was sent to President Zapatero, as well as Commissioner Almunia, but none of you have done anything to defend Spanish on this occasion."
"I would therefore ask you, in order not to discriminate against the Spanish compared to the other citizens of the Union, to do something in support of the language you and I share, because you have been elected to this House on a Spanish list."
"Naturally I have been elected from a Spanish list."
"I could have been elected from a list from any other country of the European Union, as you know."
"But I do not believe, Mrs Herranz García, that Spanish has in any way been discredited in this Parliament."
"If you know of any specific case that I must deal with, I would ask you to tell me about it, but I do not believe that anybody has noticed any undervaluing, insult or lack of consideration towards the Spanish language in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, there are currently 84 Lisbon directives which the European Parliament has adopted; 63 of them should have been implemented by 1 June 2005, but only 13 have been fully implemented by all Member States."
"The Biofuels Directive should have been implemented by the end of 2004, but the following Member States have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing that directive: Estonia, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia."
"The Lisbon Strategy is in dire straits because of the failure to implement legislation by Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to write to the Commission, on behalf of Parliament, to ask what it is doing to speed up the implementation of the Biofuels Directive and what action it is taking against Member States which fail to implement and take seriously the Lisbon Strategy."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan, I shall communicate that to the Commission, which, incidentally, will present its new proposals for the Lisbon Strategy at the next Conference of Presidents."
"That will be a good opportunity for the political groups to draw attention to the issue that you referred to in your speech."
"Mr President, please allow me to clarify to this Parliament that the decision on the request to hold a meeting referred by Mr Iturgaiz earlier is currently in the hands of the Spanish justice system and it therefore falls to the public prosecutor and the judge to make the decision, in a country under the rule of law, such as Spain, in which the justice system is independent, and furthermore according to a procedure that has been debated and agreed in the Spanish Parliament; it is therefore an entirely democratic decision."
"Finally, I would just like to point out that this Parliament has historically supported processes aimed at peace and the eradication of violence."
"We hope and we are convinced that this will continue to be its practice."
"Mr President, the recent human cases of bird flu infection in Turkey show that the risk of a pandemic has increased, and a majority in the Dutch parliament has now decided that it would be useful to introduce disinfectant matting at airports."
"Although the Minister, Mr Veerman, has rejected this proposal, arguing that this should be done at European level, I myself welcome the Dutch parliament’s initiative."
"The minister is, of course, right that it would be better to regulate such matters at European level, except that the problem with discussions on bird flu at European level is that people are always full of good intentions, but when push comes to shove, the Commission would not in any case be able to take action within 24 hours of a crisis."
"Secondly, in both the British and Belgian press, a discussion has been started as to the extent to which businesses are prepared for a possible pandemic, and I think this also begs the question of to what extent the European institutions and also this Parliament are prepared for one."
"I think there is absolutely no reason to panic, but if there was a pandemic with travel restrictions, then this would also have implications for us, of course, and I wonder to what extent any consideration has been given to this."
"Mr President, President Barroso’s final proposal for the 2007-2013 financial perspective contains the following, seemingly contradictory, proposals."
"In general point 4 it is stated that: ‘the maximum total figure for expenditure ... for 2007-2013 is EUR 862.363 million’ and that ‘all figures are expressed using constant 2004 prices’, but that ‘there will be automatic ... adjustments for inflation’."
"The British rebate under point 78 is qualified as follows: ‘During the period 2007-2013 the additional contribution from the UK shall not be higher than EUR 10.5 billion’."
"These two points seem to be in conflict and raise the question of whether the EUR 10.5 billion is subject to an automatic annual technical adjustment for inflation."
"If so, there will be a substantial extra cost."
"British Parliament votes are expressed in current sterling values and are not subject to automatic adjustments for inflation."
"Exactly how much is the EU expecting the British taxpayer to pay, and is this legal?"
"Mr President, the Groups of the European Parliament have debated the decision of the European Council of 16 December 2005."
"The various political Groups rejected it, and their criticism is justified in many respects."
"At the same time, I would very much like to warn the European Parliament not to throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"A great number of agreements have been reached on the rules of the utilization of funds, which are considered positive by the ten new Member States."
"What we failed to agree on in the European Parliament is the issue of non-refundable VAT, the application of the n+3 rule for cohesion funds, that PPPs and the involvement of private resources have become possible and that assistance for housing refurbishments is becoming possible."
"These are all very important issues for the new Member States, and it would be very important that the interests of new Member States are not damaged in the course of the Parliamentary Debate."
"Mr President, I wish to inform my colleagues of an unhappy event that happened to me over the festive season."
"On New Year’s Eve, I was abducted in Nicosia by Turkish occupying forces and accused of trespassing over the Turkish army line of separation imposed on Cyprus after the Turkish invasion of 1974."
"I was lucky to be arrested and not be killed: the orders given to Turkish guards are to shoot anybody seen near this line."
"A number of innocent civilians have already died in this way over the last few years."
"Subsequently, I spent three days in jail in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in atrocious conditions, and no permission was granted to the United Nations, my relatives or the European Parliament’s representative to visit me."
"I was presented handcuffed on two occasions before a Turkish military court and on one occasion before an illegal civilian court in the Turkish-occupied sector of Nicosia."
"I was eventually released on bail of over EUR 25 000 and am summoned to appear before the Turkish occupation courts on 20 January; otherwise a warrant for my arrest will be issued."
"If found guilty, I face a three-year jail sentence."
"This very morning, in fact, I signed a letter addressed to you in response to what you had told me about this matter."
"Mr President, I should like to alert the House to violations of human rights by German officials and courts."
"The problem relates to Poles who were previously married to German spouses but are now divorced, and who are treated as no better than paedophiles."
"The courts invariably award custody of any children to the German parent, and take it for granted that the German language and culture are superior to their Polish equivalents."
"‘Early Germanisation’ and ‘children of German descent’ were phrases used in Nuremberg by criminals charged with the Germanisation of Polish children."
"Similar phrases are used today by officials working for the , the German Child and Youth Welfare Office, to justify German-imposed bans on meetings between Poles and their children."
"Even if such meetings do take place, speaking Polish is strictly prohibited, and it is instilled in the children that everything associated with the Polish language is inferior."
"The claims that the Polish language has a negative influence on the children’s education, but such assumptions are racist."
"Poland has already experienced a German education system claiming to be superior to all others at earlier stages of its history."
"Is this what passes for respect of human rights in Germany?"
"Such practices violate one of the European Union’s basic principles, namely the promotion of the linguistic and cultural diversity of its citizens."
"Mr President, I wish to return to the subject of today’s demonstration by port workers against the proposal for a directive on access to port services."
"The demonstrators included dockers from both the old and the new Member States."
"I myself represent Western Pomerania, a region in Poland that includes ports such as Szczecin and Świnoujście."
"In common with my political group, I am opposed to the proposal for a directive that the House will consider shortly."
"Yet something odd is going on within the Commission."
"Even though there is little public support for this proposal, which was rejected by Parliament during its previous term, and even though there is no convincing evidence that a regulation of this kind is the right solution, the proposal has been tabled at the last minute."
"I very much hope that the present Commission in general, and Commissioner Barrot in particular, will not make the same mistake when it comes to other economic sectors."
"Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the deplorable situation of migrant workers in the Union and the legal limbo they often find themselves in."
"I am not talking about illegal or economic immigrants, but legal migrant workers from Member States of the EU, new and old, who in my own region are predominantly Portuguese and Polish."
"I want to illustrate the situation by referring to my own country, but the situation is the same across the European Union."
"We in the United Kingdom have a workers’ registration scheme whereby individuals can register upon payment of GBP 70 (EUR 100), so that after 12 months they are entitled to draw social benefits."
"To do that, however, they need a national insurance number."
"We have a Catch-22 situation here: to get a number you need to make an appointment, but the phones go unanswered; so, no appointment, no national insurance number, no signing up for the workers’ registration scheme, no legal basis for work, no protection and no benefits."
"– Mr President, on Tuesday 12 January, a major rally was organised in the town of Rethymnon, in Crete, against racism and xenophobia, following the murder of a young Albanian economic immigrant."
"A rally is being organised in a few days' time in Barcelona against racism in sport, and in football stadia in particular, which is taking on dangerous proportions."
"I propose, Mr President, that you take an initiative towards the Austrian Presidency and the European Commission and suggest that the spring Council in March discuss an integrated strategy on combating racism and xenophobia which includes measures and short-term and long-term policies."
"This will be a symbolic and material initiative to combine policies on economic development and on combating unemployment and poverty with policies against racism and xenophobia."
"– I am grateful, Mr President, to have the opportunity, in the Chamber, to salute the port workers, including a hundred Portuguese workers, who are today holding a demonstration at Parliament and are staging a blockade in a number of EU countries ."
"The port workers are fighting for, among other things, job protection, job security, vocational qualifications, collective work contracts and union rights. Accordingly, they are demanding that the directive on port services be rejected, a directive that has already been rejected by Parliament and yet has inexplicably been re-submitted by the Commission."
"I therefore call on Parliament to do its duty and reject it again."
"Mr President, I too agree with Mr Liberadzki’s objections to the Port Services Directive, although I would have preferred this battle to be fought with words rather than stones."
"Two French policemen have been seriously injured today."
"I rose to speak about another issue, however."
"The recent gas crisis involving Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the need for a common energy policy."
"There are a great many risks associated with a situation in which individual Member States take measures on their own initiative that serve the sole purpose of enhancing their own energy security, by which I mean gas, oil and electricity supplies."
"It follows that what is needed is genuine cooperation and the establishment of harmonised measures in this field."
"I am not talking about excessive and overly bureaucratic standardisation, but about a realisation of the fact that the EU Member States form a community that shares common goals and threats."
"Economic measures that are justified and understandable at national level should be seen in the broader context of political, geopolitical and energy security concerns."
"This is a task that faces the European Parliament too, and so I welcome the fact that the President of Parliament has decided that Council and Commission statements on this issue will be included on the agenda."
"Mr Czarnecki, we shall examine your proposal."
"This morning I received some representatives of the workers and I have asked them to put an end to the actions that are taking place around Parliament."
"The delegation of dockers, of the workers who were demonstrating, entirely agreed with me on the need to try to prevent these demonstrations of a violent nature, and I am sure that they are doing everything they can to control their troops."
"It is never easy; as we know from experience, every organisation has its percentage of rebels."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the Commission statement on homophobia in Europe."
". Mr President, Community competence with regard to the measures necessary to combat discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"Furthermore, the Commission would point out that the ban on this type of discrimination is explicitly provided for in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"On this basis, the Commission endeavours, and will continue to endeavour, within the framework of its powers, to take a hard line against homophobia."
"Combating sexual orientation discrimination is a crucial element in the fight against homophobia."
"Directive 2000/78/EC, which paves the way for a general framework promoting equal treatment in employment and occupation and covering all the forms of discrimination included in Article 13, is a practical example of this action, and the Commission is ensuring, and will continue to ensure, that this directive is implemented in the Member States."
"The Commission is nonetheless aware of the fact that legislative action must be backed up by other initiatives aimed at combating de facto discrimination, humiliating practices, prejudice and stereotypes."
"Allow me to mention two practical measures taken by the Commission."
"The first measure consists of an information campaign, launched in 2003 and entitled ‘For Diversity – Against Discrimination’."
"This campaign is currently under way and is aimed at promoting a positive image of diversity, as well as informing the public about anti-discrimination laws."
"Organisations defending the rights of homosexuals are among the partners involved in this measure, and several initiatives have accordingly been taken, such as an information campaign and an effort to raise the public’s awareness of the forms of discrimination suffered by homosexuals."
"The second initiative lies within the framework of the recent proposal aimed at making 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"The objectives will be to inform people of their rights, to promote diversity as an asset and an opportunity for the Union and to highlight equal opportunities for all, whether in terms of economic, social, cultural or political life."
"The Commission considers that organisations involved in combating sexual orientation discrimination will be able to benefit a great deal from this last measure."
"The fact remains that the Union and the Commission can only act within the framework of the powers granted to them by the Treaty."
"For example, the Commission can open a possible infringement procedure against a Member State, but it can only do so if a violation of fundamental rights has been observed with regard to the application of Community law."
"It is, however, the responsibility of the Member States to exercise powers over and above those possessed by the Union and to take the necessary measures to combat homophobia."
"In any case, whether it is a question of situations falling within, or outside, the framework of Community law, it is clear that the Commission totally condemns any demonstration or expression of homophobia."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all the political groups involved in drawing up this resolution."
"I pay tribute in particular to Mr Cashman, Mrs in 't Veld and Mr Romeva i Rueda for their work."
"I wish to raise three issues on behalf of myself and my group."
"The first is that this resolution is not about homosexuality as such but about homophobia, and for us this is really an issue about human rights and whether you approve of beating other people because of their sexual orientation."
"We all agree that there is a lot to do in all Member States and within the institutions."
"A lot of pressure needs to be applied."
"Commissioner Frattini referred to Article 13 of the Treaty and Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I agree with that; but the key here is to get the Member States to abide by them."
"That is really why we are having this debate: to get the Member States into line."
"The second issue concerns the two problems we are facing in fighting homophobia."
"The first is the inequality in the legislation of the Member States."
"We have all heard of the problems linked to free movement: one couple being accepted, for instance, in the Netherlands but not being accepted and getting the same rights – social or otherwise – for instance, in Italy."
"The second problem is a worrying development in many Member States – I do not want to pinpoint any one in particular."
"We all see and face the problems of hate crimes and discrimination."
"We must also remember that this is not only about sexual orientation; it is also about gender identity and gender expression."
"My final point – which goes slightly beyond the scope of this matter – is that we must remember that there are still 75 countries that consider homosexuality to be illegal and 9 countries which impose the death penalty for it."
"We must get rid of that."
". Mr President, Europe is, in fact, built on absolute principles: equality, tolerance and humanism."
"No exception can be made to these fundamental principles; they are simply vital, and the authorities must defend them at all costs when they are attacked."
"Verbal abuse is hurled at some of our fellow citizens, and real forms of discrimination are emerging."
"The most appalling thing of all is the fact that outright beatings have led to several deaths in various Member States of the Union."
"What have the victims of these vile acts done?"
"Nothing."
"They are simply of a different sexual orientation - they are homosexuals – and the text before us, which we are debating this evening, provides for an important bill."
"By voting in favour of this resolution, we are saying loud and clear that we wish to put a stop to the difference in treatment suffered by homosexuals on EU soil and to see them guaranteed the same rights."
"We emphasise this point: the laws must be the same for everyone."
"Finally, we solemnly call for an end to the homophobic remarks that stir up hatred, especially when these condemnatory words are uttered by the highest State authorities. These authorities are the guarantors of equal treatment for all."
"It is our duty, under Article 13 of the Treaty, to safeguard each person’s fundamental rights."
"This is our common vision of democracy and of our values."
"We need to be vigilant on a daily basis."
"The fight against homophobia must, if necessary, be conducted through the use of legislative provisions, such as already exist, I might add, in several Member States of the Union."
"The Europe of 25 means fraternity and equality."
"Let us waste no time in eradicating the bad seeds sprouting here and there."
"We have a duty to oppose hatred and the rejection of others."
"I can only repeat today the words of the German pastor, Martin Niemöller, who resisted the Nazis: ‘When they came to arrest my Communist neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not a Communist."
"When they came to arrest my gypsy neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not a gypsy."
"When they came to arrest my Jewish neighbour, I did not speak up, because I was not Jewish."
"When they came to arrest me, there was no one left to speak up for me’."
"Thank you."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in times of growing intolerance, an overwhelming majority of this Parliament have sent a very clear signal, and that is cause for rejoicing."
"All too often, homophobia is justified under the banner of other fundamental rights, namely freedom of religion and freedom of opinion."
"Some Member States hide behind the principle of subsidiarity in order to legitimise discrimination and, with all due respect, Commissioner, even the Commission often uses this faint-hearted excuse to look the other way."
"I expect the Commission to be right behind the fundamental rights of all European citizens, irrespective of where they live, for that is what we in this Parliament do too."
"The fundamental rights are not a matter of subsidiarity."
"They are indefeasible and universal for all citizens of the European Union."
"Solemn declarations and moral indignation are not enough, though; they also, as is specified in our joint resolution, have to be backed up by a whole host of things."
"We must invest not only in information and education, but also in improving the legal position of homosexuals."
"While I am on the subject, I should like to insist once more – and I would like to hear from the Commissioner what plans are under way in this respect – on what is referred to as the horizontal directive that prohibits all forms of discrimination, not only in the workplace, but everywhere."
"Furthermore, it is scandalous that some Member States should still not have fully recognised the fact that homosexuals were the target of the Nazi regime."
"I hope that the Austrian Presidency will be able to put this to the Member States in the Council and can subsequently recognise homosexuals as being the victims of the Nazis."
"Finally, I should like to hear when the Commission will at long last do as it has repeatedly been asked to do and table proposals for removing obstructions for the free movement of persons for married homosexual couples."
"It is unacceptable that Europeans, when crossing the border, should lose their rights on the grounds of their sexual orientation, including rights of ownership, pension entitlements, social security, even custody over their own children."
"I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it will table further to a request by the European Parliament to this effect that dates back to October 2004."
". Mr President, Commissioner, more than a year ago, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, gave a plenary speech in response to statements made by Mr Buttiglione, a candidate Commissioner, in which the former made a number of clear promises."
"I have read up on this speech once again."
"Anti-discrimination and equal opportunities were to be a top priority for this Commission, with a group of Commissioners to monitor all Commission action and major initiatives in this area."
"It will act as a political driving force."
"Well, my question to the Commission is what exactly this working party has achieved over the past year, for the disappointing list drafted by Commissioner Frattini does not really do justice to this enormous pledge and there is plenty of work to be done."
"As Mrs in 't Veld has already said, it remains unacceptable that there should be European rules that prohibit the discrimination of people on the basis of the colour of their skin, say when renting a house, but that homosexuals are still outside of the law."
"Why is the right to equal treatment of people, irrespective of their sexual orientation, restricted to the labour market?"
"In Poland, a number of freedom demonstrations have been banned, and there is every indication that the authorities want to stand in the way of gay emancipation over there."
"My group is concerned about this, as it is about a number of developments in Latvia and Lithuania, and also in other countries."
"It is worrying that the groups often do not dare speak out on this issue."
"Take the Liberals."
"Where inefficient spending of European subsidies is concerned, they insist on naming and shaming, but when we talk about basic European values, nobody says a word, and that I believe to be wrong."
"I therefore hope that individual Members will now vote in favour of the amendments so that we can address the issue as a whole."
"Mr President, I too am opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but we should exercise caution in granting ever more rights to homosexuals."
"I am delighted that we are holding this debate today."
"The rights of homosexuals must be defended wherever possible."
"It is not that long ago that homosexuality was removed from the World Health Organisation’s classification of diseases."
"I am all in favour of such a move, but I am not sure whether it is a good idea to legalise homosexual unions."
"These latter should perhaps be given backing for the purposes of inheritance law, but homosexual couples must not be allowed to adopt children."
"Such practices are distasteful, outrageous and scandalous, and there have not been any psychological studies showing that they can be regarded as normal."
"Mr President, there can be no question that we are faced in Europe with a situation in which homosexuals sometimes suffer violence or contempt at the hands of the police services."
"That much can be learned from reports on such matters."
"Nevertheless, I cannot help but think that this debate is largely a waste of time."
"My opinion stems from a belief that it would be a very good idea indeed to restore a sense of proportion to this heated debate, and to avoid succumbing to hysteria when describing the situation of homosexuals in Europe."
"‘Hysteria’ is the only appropriate word for descriptions that paint a picture of resistance movements, arrests and war."
"Mrs Roure provided us with a good example of such descriptions in her speech."
"I should like to draw the House’s attention to two facts."
"Firstly, violence against homosexuals represents only a fraction of the violence which is endemic in our societies, and which is a problem faced by every EU Member State."
"We have seen one example of it today, and we saw further examples a few months ago in France."
"This is only one aspect of a much larger problem."
"Another facet to this question is that every EU Member State, whether old or new, has its own institutions."
"It has become apparent that these latter, by which I mean courts, ombudsmen, and even public opinion, are capable of providing effective protection for the rights of minorities."
"If we were to approach this debate from a legal perspective, we would come up against a whole series of problems and obstacles in the shape of Treaty law."
"Fortunately, we will not be able to do anything to change this."
"There is no consensus in Europe that the Treaties should be amended in order to give the EU jurisdiction over such key matters as the recognition of homosexual unions and their implications outside the borders of the Member State that has authorised them."
"It therefore follows that there is no reason why the EU should be called to act on such issues such as homophobia."
"There would be an inevitable consequence of doing so, however. The credibility of the integration process, which is already being used by some as an ideological weapon, would be undermined."
"Mr President, in my opinion it is legitimate to ask whether Mrs Buitenweg’s approach to the issue of homophobia in Europe is one that should by adopted by any politician."
"Do we have the right to impose our way of thinking on voters, or to tell them how they should approach the problem of sexuality and sexual minorities?"
"It is my belief that sexuality is a private matter for every individual, and that everyone should exercise this sexuality in line with their own morality, religion and culture, and in accordance with local customs."
"The European Parliament cannot therefore set itself the goal of winning general approval in Europe for homosexuality, and it should not expect such a thing."
"We must not forget that while some countries in Europe are more tolerant, others have more conservative social norms."
"Yet homosexuals are attacked and beaten up in even the most tolerant countries, such as the Netherlands and France."
"I need only mention the case of the homosexual Sebastian Nouchet, who was doused in petrol and set alight in France."
"If we are going to hold a debate on such matters at all, we should therefore focus our attention on ways of preventing an escalation of homophobic hatred."
"We will not succeed in doing so, however, unless we manage to draw a line between protection of the right to sexual privacy, and violation of the right to displays of this sexuality."
"I should therefore like to make it quite clear that any minority that feels the need to demonstrate the fact that it is different is naturally free to do so."
"No minority may be discriminated against in this regard."
"As a matter of fact, a whole system of judicial and constitutional bodies, including an ombudsman, has been set up in Poland to protect this freedom and to ensure compliance with European legislation."
"Any bans on homosexual demonstrations are of an incidental nature only."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that the law should benefit sexual majorities as well as sexual minorities."
"Mr President, I wish to express my disappointment at the statement made by Commissioner Frattini, which was more a repetition than a statement."
"Commissioner, we know you are concerned and we know the Commission is concerned, but the Commission should be judged on what it does."
"Infringement proceedings must be brought against any Member State that fails to transpose or implement the appropriate directives already in force in a number of Member States."
"I agree that we must campaign and educate, but that in itself is not enough."
"A proposal for a horizontal directive directly related to the race and ethnicity directive promised by President Borroso must be brought before this House."
"I am saddened by some of the contributions this afternoon."
"This is about equality, not about promoting homosexuality."
"It is about giving homosexuals the equal rights and equality that others take so much for granted."
"I am gay."
"I am a homosexual, born to an ordinary man and woman."
"Because of that some people will wish to take away my right to talk about my sexuality, to celebrate my 22-year relationship and to be part of a wider community."
"Some would vilify me, take away my democratic rights and use hate-speak against me."
"I could decide to go on a gay pride march, but that gay pride march could be banned."
"Why?"
"Because society is preoccupied with what it perceives as my sex life."
"A judgement has been made on it."
"Where is the morality in that?"
"Where is the morality in preaching and promoting discrimination and hatred, sometimes behind the shield and the excuse of religion or belief?"
"I say to Commission Frattini and the entire Commission, as well as to this House, that if we do nothing when we see people beaten to death, vilified and discriminated against then we are condoning and becoming complicit in those beatings, in the hate-speak, the defamation and the ill-treatment."
"Even in the United Kingdom, where enormous advances have been made, a young man was kicked to death just before Christmas for no other reason than he was homosexual."
"If this House does nothing then it is party to every single blow that was rained upon that individual and other men like him and on gay women across the European Union."
"That I should even have to make such a statement here in Parliament makes this a day of great sadness."
"Mr President, I have to acknowledge that, as Mr Cashman has said, even in my own constituency of London we continue to see prejudice and homophobic crime."
"Just recently a gay man was killed purely out of murderous prejudice."
"A few years ago we had a hate-crazed bomber who specifically intended to kill gay customers of a bar."
"Of course he killed others too."
"But we are largely looking at private hate and prejudice."
"What is so shocking about developments in some Member States is the crude official intolerance: the banning of Pride demonstrations, inflammatory language even by Prime Ministers, police failure to protect marches, and so on."
"We need European legislation to outlaw hate crime on grounds not only of race – which we have still not achieved – but also of sexual orientation."
"And we need to equalise the treatment of race, gender and sexual orientation in generalising the ban on discrimination not only in the workplace, but also in the receipt of services and in the supply of goods."
"The patchwork that we have at the moment is not good enough."
"I look also to Commissioner Frattini to lead the effort to greatly improve the generalised protection of both women and minorities."
"Mr President, now that we are well into the 21st century we cannot just condemn homophobia: we must fight it politically and legally."
"The only way to look at homophobia is as a combination of ignorance and impunity."
"According to the Treaties, the European institutions are responsible for ensuring respect for the rights and freedoms of its Member States."
"This means combating ignorance and the impunity of homophobic statements and actions, which are not just taking place, but which are increasing in some European countries."
"I profoundly regret statements such as those that have been made in Poland or decisions such as those taken in the Latvian Parliament, which fundamentally violate the principle of equal rights, a principle which must prevail in the construction of the shared values upon which the European Union is founded."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to condemn homophobia and to set up legal and political mechanisms so that this problem will one day be confined to history."
"Mr President, I do not think there is anybody in this House who would accept homosexuals being discriminated against, attacked, intimidated or whatever on account of their orientation, but that is not, in fact, what today’s discussion is about."
"The question for discussion is whether it is still possible to criticise the spirit of political correctness that is gradually suffocating the free expression of opinion."
"Although the time when homosexuality was a taboo subject is fortunately in the past, these days it has become taboo to raise objections about some types of behaviour or complain about some homosexuals, even though this is completely unrelated to discrimination, hatred or whatever."
"The Buttiglione case is still fresh in the memory."
"For example, anyone who is opposed to homosexual marriage is promptly written off as homophobic and criminalised."
"Commissioner Frattini talked about diversity a moment ago, but it is important that we remain open to diversity of opinion, for the sanctimoniousness of 19th century sexual morals is gradually giving way to the sanctimoniousness of political correctness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has prided itself on having spearheaded the fight against discrimination where equality between men and women, the status of ethnic minorities, the situation of disabled people and, more recently, respect for people’s sexual orientation are concerned."
"Article 13 of the Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and numerous directives make it not only the right, but also the duty, of our Assembly to continue to fight for the equal rights of homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals."
"In view of the substantial progress recorded in this area in many Member States, some people had hoped, if not for this matter to have been settled, then at least for it to have died down."
"No such thing has happened, and a real upsurge in homophobic language and violence can even be observed."
"The recent remarks made by Polish political leaders dismayed us, with the European Commission, I am afraid to say, only reacting to them in a very half-hearted manner."
"Other unacceptable speeches of this kind have been made in other countries, including France."
"Violent acts, ranging from insults to torture and murder, are to be deplored everywhere."
"These crimes are taking place in a particularly worrying international context, in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Senegal."
"Homosexuals are being persecuted because of the way in which they live their lives."
"Worse still, in Iran, two have been executed."
"We are therefore delighted to welcome the Commission statement on homophobia in the European Union."
"Our colleague from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Stubb, had prepared a resolution, on behalf of our group, calling on the Commission and the Member States to take practical legislative and operational measures to combat these forms of discrimination."
"Today, it is a resolution common to five political groups that we are examining."
"One can only be delighted to see that, in this Chamber, the fight for human rights has transcended partisan borders."
"The pious hopes contained in the Commission’s statements must now be very swiftly replaced by a practical and comprehensive directive."
"Equally, it is up to each one of us to continue this fight in our respective countries for a form of equality that consists not only of the right to other people’s indifference towards their sexuality, but also of the right to be different."
"Mr President, attacks on homosexuals are bad news, and we are getting that news from every corner of the European Union."
"The Vice-President, Commissioner Frattini, has told us what means the Commission has at its disposal to deal with homophobia and what it is actually doing with them, but what I should like him to tell us is whether that is meant to be enough."
"Are we really meant to find it acceptable that discrimination in the Member States should go unpunished and that they should fail to transpose the anti-discrimination directives?"
"That is why there is a need for a build-up of political will, and this debate helps to bring that about."
"Five groups have come together and agreed on a text that denounces discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and which is intended to protect homosexuals, lesbians, transgendered people and bisexuals."
"The fact is, though, that more needs to be done; transposing the anti-discrimination directives cannot be something that Member States are left to do as and when they feel like it, and – as has already been said – if their authorities interfere with the right to demonstrate by, for example, banning gay pride marches, then they have to be called to account."
"Fundamental rights need to be reinforced and must apply not only in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, where the rights of same-sex couples are fully recognised, but throughout the European Union too."
"I am absolutely outraged by what I have just heard said about the right to adopt being under attack."
"What determines whether or not a child will develop and flourish is the parents’ love and devotion, not their sexual orientation."
"That is where discrimination starts, and, although – thank God – we punish it, there are powerful voices in places like the Vatican who speak out in its defence, thereby encouraging even more flagrant manifestations of homophobia."
"I will therefore close by saying that morality is a private matter for private citizens themselves, but what we in this House have to do is defend the law, and that is what five groups are doing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether I will live to see homosexuality accepted and lived as something completely normal."
"I wonder whether the time will come when politicians will no longer be able to make political capital for themselves with discriminatory comments about homosexual people, and I wonder when same-sex partnerships will be recognised as sharing responsibilities and enjoying equal rights."
"There is something about the view – as expressed in the Pope’s definition – of homosexual couples as merely convenient arrangements for the purpose of pursuing meaningless sex that betrays a contempt for people, and it bears no relation to the reality of life as lived by homosexual couples."
"Discrimination against homosexual lifestyles and their marginalisation begins in people’s heads, and our adopting a directive on the subject will not put a stop to it."
"The events in Poland are no more accidental than the latest utterances of one Italian minister are slips of the tongue; rather, they are expressions of an attitude of mind."
"Combating homophobia is an educational task, and it is intended that 2007 should be the Year against Discrimination."
"The Commission needs to give the fight against homophobia the same level of priority among its activities as the combating of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion."
"– Mr President, I am disappointed by Commissioner Frattini’s speech, for what he is doing is retreating and saying we will intervene only when rights are infringed, but if the core principles of the European Union are violated, we will do nothing – indirectly admittedly, but that is what you said, Commissioner!"
"The fact is that sexuality and sexual orientation are fundamental rights too, and they too are in the Treaty."
"Where the violation of those rights is on an official footing, in Poland, for example, where these people are on the receiving end of enormously discriminatory utterances on the part of leading politicians, and persecuted and injured when they take part in these demonstrations, which is an offence against these young people’s human dignity, the Commission stands by and declines to intervene, on the grounds that European law has not been broken."
"Your written answer to my question was couched in precisely those terms, and that, Commissioner Frattini, is just not on!"
"What is going on in Poland is a departure from the observance of the Copenhagen criteria and from the core principles of this European Union, and so we have to make it clear at European level that this is unacceptable and that changes must be made without delay."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to recent and repeated manifestations of intolerance in my home country, Poland, which frequently take the form of incitements to violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation."
"I should also like to alert the House to the state authorities’ failure to respond appropriately to these and other displays of homophobia."
"Examples include the banning of Equality Marches in Warsaw and Poznań, and the fact that the measures provided for in Polish law have not been taken against groups inciting others to intolerance and to violence against people who promote equal rights for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation."
"We are faced with the authorities’ acceptance of what amounts to political thuggery directed at the gay, lesbian and bisexual communities."
"On 13 January 2006, a court in Elbląg opened proceedings against Robert Biedroń, the head of the Campaign against Homophobia."
"The public prosecutor’s office has charged Mr Biedroń with insulting Catholics, even though he has stressed that he never intended to insult Catholicism or to put it on a par with fascism."
"It is worth emphasising that the same public prosecutor’s office refused to institute proceedings following the insulting references to homosexuals contained in an article in the publication , in which it was stated that ‘homosexuality is a disease and a threat to the family."
"Mr President, homophobia is not only a big problem in some Member States, but also in the rest of Europe too."
"I am therefore pleased that my proposal for the monitoring of hate crimes against homosexuals and lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, has been included in the joint resolution against homophobia in Europe."
"This is new and I am pleased that Parliament wishes to support this fresh initiative."
"I should now like to hear from the Commissioner how the Commission intends to carry out this monitoring in practice."
"We gain our knowledge through measuring, and this is certainly also true of the extent of violence and hostility on the basis of sexual orientation or in respect of transsexuals."
"I think that too little attention is being paid to transsexuals."
"Unfortunately, transsexuals still face exclusion, violence and lack of understanding in all EU Member States on a regular basis."
"The European Union still does far too little to protect the human rights of homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals."
"The European Union has the opportunity of flexing its muscle, and it is therefore high time it did."
"You either protect human rights or you do not."
"The time has come to translate this fine theory into practice and use the means which the EU has at its disposal, such as suspending a Member State’s right to vote."
"Mr President, I just wish to add a few brief words at this point in the debate, the length and depth of which has shown that, regrettably, homophobia is still a serious and current problem throughout Europe."
"Your words, therefore, Commissioner Frattini, have not been very convincing, given their coldness and their lack of a full and proactive commitment to combating this scourge."
"We need much more vigorous action on the part of the Commission and on the part of the Member States, the latter led by the Commission."
"Homophobia is there, in customs and traditions, in language, everywhere."
"Not just in the countries in which the incidents that have led to this debate have taken place, such as Poland, but also in countries such as my own, Spain, where much progress has been made on this issue, but in whose society, authorities and certain professions this homophobic attitude still exists, and we must continue actively to fight it."
"I agree with the words of many fellow Members, in particular the very moving words of Michael Cashman."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Martin Luther King said when launching the campaign for African-Americans’ rights, either we achieve freedom together or not at all."
"What he meant was that there are no black people’s rights or white people’s rights: there are just human rights."
"Fighting homophobia does not mean showing understanding towards a specific group in the population: first and foremost, it means upholding human rights."
"I am frightened by the arrogance of those who deny homosexuals the chance to give blood; I am frightened by the discriminatory campaigns of those who are unable to talk about high-risk behaviour yet still allude to high-risk individuals in the fight against AIDS; or those who ban people from driving just because they are gay."
"I cannot silently accept the attitude of a Commission that behaves like Pontius Pilate, in that it does not try to enforce a directive that already exists against discrimination; a Commission that ought to start infringement proceedings against countries that do not respect people’s freedom to choose their sexual orientation – that happens in Italy, Poland and a number of other countries."
"This is not an issue that just affects a particular group of people, but one that involves the dignity of the whole European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have spoken."
"However, I feel obliged to repeat certain information in greater detail, because some speakers have clearly shown – and I say this with the same frankness that you have shown towards me – that they are not familiar with what the Commission is doing."
"I must emphasise – and I do not believe there can be any doubt about it – that we are talking about homophobia, which is a violation of human rights, and that is the only point on which I agree with Mr Agnoletto."
"Homophobia is not about protecting certain categories of people, but it is essentially an issue about absolute rights, which can never be interpreted otherwise."
"I should, however, like to clarify a few points."
"Some of you – Mrs Bozkurt was the last – asked whether or not we would guarantee that the status of homosexual protection and the fight against homophobia in the Member States would be monitored."
"I can assure you, Mrs Bozkurt, not only that such monitoring will be guaranteed but that it has already been done!"
"You should be aware of the report drawn up a few weeks ago by an independent specialist group – which I have of course made available to Parliament – which illustrates what kind of behaviour in each country runs counter to our common desire to fight discrimination."
"That report has been officially passed on to Parliament, and it is obvious that the only reason why I – and no one else – decided to have it prepared on a country-by-country basis was to provide you and us with the information we need to be able to form a judgment."
"That monitoring, Mrs Bozkurt, will continue: any actions that run counter to this guiding spirit will be exposed in public."
"Governments too, which are required to take the first step and to report what their national, and not just European, rules are on freedom of assembly, for instance, may draw all the necessary conclusions if they read the relevant documents."
"Transparent information is indeed a priority."
"Other speakers mentioned a promise by President Barroso to adopt a horizontal directive – that was the term used – on the strengthening of and respect for rights in the area of non-discrimination."
"That too has been done, ladies and gentlemen!"
"In 2005 the Commission adopted a formal communication entitled ‘Non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all’, which clearly indicates what is expected as regards guarantees of greater protection of equal rights."
"In that communication to the European Parliament, however, we were duty-bound to point out what everyone knows, which is that when the Commission puts forward a proposal based on Article 13, that proposal must, by law – according to the Treaties and not according to our interpretation – be adopted unanimously by the Council."
"There is, however, no unanimity within the Council as yet, although I hope there will be."
"In any case, the 2005 communication very clearly states our intention to harmonise the field of legal protection against all kinds of discrimination, including that based on sexual orientation, which is what some of you claim we have not yet done, ladies and gentlemen."
"I shall now turn to another subject, which concerns the powers of the European Commission."
"I am quite sure that the Commission does not currently have the necessary powers to take action against violations of a right that affects people so deeply, as you rightly said, Mr Cashman."
"It is precisely to strengthen Europe’s powers, however, that this Commission and I myself have once again proposed that a European agency for the protection of fundamental rights should be set up."
"The agency would be endowed with the powers that you propose, since it is the European Parliament’s duty to give its opinion on the subject and perhaps increase its powers of intervention. If you accept that proposal and if there is agreement in June, the agency will be a tool aimed precisely at tackling discriminatory behaviour."
"This proposal is already on the table: it just needs examining, and I have said before and I repeat that we shall listen to any request by Parliament to improve it."
"That, however, is just one of the tools available."
"There are, of course, the usual instruments, such as Article 226 of the Treaty, infringement proceedings, and also a good deal of Court of Justice case law, according to which the Commission is unfortunately not empowered to intervene if the actions lie within the competence of the Member States."
"I hope that the agency will be active soon, because it will perhaps be the first instrument to meet the demand for such powers."
"Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, you mention a right to diversity, and I once again reply that we are already working on it."
"You should, I believe, be aware of the information campaign programme named precisely ‘For diversity’."
"Our aim in this programme, which began in late 2003 and is still ongoing, was to put together positive information to explain that diversity is a value for Europe."
"All the major European gay rights groups are involved in this programme."
"I believe you are keeping abreast of all these activities, and it is our intention to continue to work hard in this field."
"I must therefore reject the accusations that the Commission has done nothing."
"We intend to carry on with our work in this area and to do so in a spirit of mutual openness."
"I felt that I should provide you with some facts, and not merely ideas, about initiatives that are already in place and which will improve our determined fight against all kinds of homophobia."
"– I have received five motions for resolutions(1) under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The June List believes that the EU is a union of values that must operate on the principle that everyone has equal value and equal rights."
"This principle is fundamental to all activities and has also been laid down in the UN’s General Declaration on Human Rights."
"The EU Member States have ratified a number of legally binding international agreements based on this principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination."
"The right not to be exposed to irrelevant special treatment on the grounds of sexual orientation is, then, a fundamental human right."
"In the debate, this right is sometimes regarded as a negotiable benefit."
"It is important for us always to have the UN’s declarations on human rights in mind when we debate legislative proposals in this Chamber."
"It is only in more recent years that the EU Member States have seriously begun to deal with the issue of homophobia."
"According to Swedish statistics, the average citizen has a 4% to 6% risk of being exposed to what is referred to as unprovoked violence."
"Among lesbian and bisexual women, the corresponding figure is between 15% and 24%, while between 28% and 36% of homosexual and bisexual men have been exposed to unprovoked violence."
"The fact that sexual orientation determines to what extent someone is in danger of being exposed to violence is, of course, unacceptable."
"It is important for us, as politicians, to make it clear that all human beings have equal rights and obligations."
"If we tamper with that principle, we bring fundamental human rights and the UN’s declarations into question."
"Mr President, I have been a Member of this Parliament for a year and a half now and I find the experience …"
"I do not have the Rules of Procedure here, Mr President."
"It is a very brief question."
"It is very frustrating that every time we ask questions in the debates, we never get a reply."
"I asked a very precise question and I did not get an answer."
"Mr President, on the basis of Rule 143(1), I wish to state that Mr Frattini is making out that we are all stupid because it was he who prepared the communication on the broader framework directive."
"However, he did not bring forward a directive, as Parliament requested, because it seems there was no unanimity ..."
"– Mrs Buitenweg, I am sorry, but Rule 143(1) has nothing to do with your request to take the floor."
"It merely states that ‘the names of Members who ask leave to speak shall be entered in the list of speakers in the order in which their requests are received.’"
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"– The next item is the report by Mr Catania (A6-0411/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission's fourth report on citizenship of the Union (1 May 2001 – 30 April 2004) (2005/2060(INI))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the granting of citizenship and the rights associated with it is a prerogative of the Member States."
"European citizenship is an emerging concept, a right deriving from national citizenship."
"The fact that each country has different procedures for granting national citizenship means that there is no uniform procedure for acquiring European citizenship."
"This report, for which I am the rapporteur, does not call the Member States’ prerogative into question: the right to citizenship and the granting of citizenship are their prerogatives, as expressly laid down in the Treaties."
"The times are perhaps not yet ripe for harmonisation of the procedures for granting citizenship, as I realised even during the debate in committee."
"Nonetheless, I believe it would be extremely useful and, indeed, necessary to begin a period of reflection – in the medium to short term – on the real and effective value of the idea of European citizenship."
"In my opinion – and not just mine but that of most of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – the only way to endow the idea of European citizenship with real value is to link it closely to the idea of residence."
"European citizenship by residence is a very important issue, and thousands of associations and thinkers who have taken part in this debate have already submitted a petition to implement it."
"European citizenship by residence can be included alongside the other procedures for acquiring citizenship – that is, citizenship by bloodline () or by birthplace () – which are provided for in many European Union countries."
"I believe that granting citizenship by residence is a way to eliminate and avoid certain paradoxes."
"Just think, for instance, that someone may be considered a European citizen – rightly too, perhaps – if he or she was born to Italian parents, lives in Argentina or Venezuela and has never set foot on EU soil, whereas someone else may not be considered a European citizen – unfairly, in my view – even though he or she has lived and worked in a Member State for 10 or 20 years but was unfortunately born to Tunisian or Egyptian parents."
"I believe that bloodline, birthplace and residence may, together and at the same time, constitute valid grounds for granting citizenship rights."
"Affirming that a person may become a citizen of the European Union after five years’ legal residence in Europe seems to us a practical way to reopen the debate on the future of Europe, which, since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty, has plunged into a crisis that may prove fatal and irreversible."
"Certain rights associated with EU citizenship are already conferred on the basis of residence: I am referring to the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to submit a complaint to the Ombudsman."
"Thus the right of free movement and residence and also the right to vote in European and local elections might be extended, in the same way as these rights are granted to EU citizens residing in a country other than their own."
"That would be an important step towards integrating all those non-EU citizens who live in Europe legally."
"I also call on my fellow Members who belong to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support this position and to give up excessively extreme positions."
"The document I am putting forward not only received the support of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in committee, but it also had the support of the Commission, whose members told the Committee on Civil Liberties that they were in favour of implementing citizenship by residence."
"Commissioner Frattini has also said he is willing to give support of this kind."
"I believe it is a very important step, which has also obtained the approval of a great many social and trade union organisations within civil society, both religious and secular."
"I am referring in particular to two major Italian organisations: Caritas and a major Catholic trade union, the CISL, which have publicly come out in support of this report to introduce citizenship by residence."
"Finally, I should like to reassure all those who, in their comments on this report, have raised the spectre of introducing a European tax in order to extend citizenship rights."
"They even include the Italian Prime Minister, who wrongly claimed during a recent television broadcast that this Parliament wanted to introduce a tax in order to extend citizenship."
"To dispel any doubts – although I do not see any threat in this report – I propose that we remove the explicit reference to a European tax and concentrate exclusively on the citizenship-by-residence concept."
"I hope that doing so will also help to deprive those who are afraid to extend rights in Europe of their excuses."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Catania, whose contribution is, I think, particularly coherent and valuable."
"After the Treaty of Maastricht, which introduced the idea of European citizenship, and after the added value given by the draft Constitutional Treaty, I believe the time has come to place human beings at the focus of rights and duties and thus, if I may say so, at the heart of the European integration process."
"The basis of the report is the consideration that European citizens, as indeed is confirmed by the regular Eurobarometer surveys, attribute great importance to the idea of citizenship, so much so that a good 70% of European citizens know about the principle of European citizenship – something that is true in very few other areas, again according to Eurobarometer."
"The problem is that many of these people do not have a clear idea of what rights and duties derive from it."
"I therefore think that work done in this respect is a positive step forwards."
"I shall illustrate this with a very strange fact: more than two thirds of Europeans believe that European citizenship automatically confers the right to vote in national elections in the country of residence."
"These points therefore need to be clarified and, as proposed in the report, explicitly elucidated."
"The chapter on the citizens’ right to information is very important, and is an area on which the Commission is already working."
"Efforts are being made right now to inform citizens better. The topic that I myself will be dealing with is the transposition of the new directive on European citizens’ right of residence, to ensure that the aspect of transparency of information is emphasised when the directive is incorporated by the Member States into their national bodies of law."
"Another highly significant point is the one about non-European citizens, that is, third-country nationals who are legally resident in the European Union."
"I personally am very much in favour of integrating third-country nationals who are residing and working legally on EU territory, and that is also the Commission’s policy line."
"I have published a draft European strategy on integration – Parliament will of course debate it – which is based precisely on the principle that citizenship at European level requires a framework of rights and duties for those who are not European citizens but who want to live, work and reside in Europe legally."
"I believe that that is the starting point for Mr Catania’s report, and that is the route that should be encouraged."
"Alongside rights, of course, as everyone realises, there are duties."
"The fact is, therefore, that the gradual transformation of non-Europeans into European citizens on account of their residence must clearly be accompanied by respect for the laws of the country of residence and for those European guiding principles that are also enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That is all part of the integration programme on which we shall be working in 2006 and which I hope to finalise with the agreement of the Council and Parliament."
"An important first step is now in the pipeline, which is to grant long-term residents a permit to reside and move freely within the European Union."
"This comes in a directive that has to be transposed by 23 January this year – the deadline is thus in a few days’ time – and I am putting political pressure on all the Member States to transpose the directive in question and to issue residence permits to non-EU citizens who have been residing legally in Europe for more than five years."
"There must, of course, be a thorough debate on the concept of European citizenship by residence."
"I am convinced that it is possible – perhaps without changing the structure of the Treaties, which do not provide for a link between European citizenship and residence – to start with a concept of civic citizenship: in other words, citizenship linked to the region and the place where the person works and lives."
"I think that will be feasible without introducing rigid concepts that might – or perhaps should – entail a need to change the Treaties."
"The European citizenship concept does not have its origin in residence but, since it is enshrined in the Treaties, if we want to introduce a new concept, the Treaties will have to be changed as well."
"Given that the aim is a fair one, however, I believe we should reflect on a regional dimension to the area of rights and duties."
"It is no coincidence that the integration plan that I have proposed casts mayors, provincial chairmen and regional governors as the main players in integration policy, more so even than the Member States, because it is precisely when one is closest to the issues affecting the citizens – be they from within the Community or from outside it – that one can understand the importance of the individual and his or her rights to education, to language teaching and to participation in local political life."
"These matters are all linked to the area where a person lives."
"That is the strategy on which I am prepared to start work straight away, if Parliament will decide on its position."
". Mr President, Mr Frattini, Mr Catania, I should like to begin by congratulating you on the quality of the work done by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"On behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I congratulate you all the more because a number of the proposals we adopted have ended up in the final report: we are delighted by this outcome."
"Commissioner, you spoke about rights and duties, and I believe that, in terms of citizenship, we are concerned here with a balance to which a number of us share the same approach."
"Nevertheless, the issue of own resources, such as we had brought up in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and such as we had put to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which looked into it, must also be raised."
"I am surprised by the remarks made by the Italian President of the Council."
"It is by no means a question of creating a new tax."
"It is a question of acting in the spirit of what we, in this Chamber, had voted in favour of with the Böge report and proposing a mechanism aimed at ensuring a constant tax burden."
"This mechanism must not only enable recurring problems prejudicing the quality of the European debate to be resolved, but also, with regard to the ‘fair return’ debate, enable a balance to be struck between the rights and duties of those residing in the European Union."
"Beyond this issue, I believe that the rapporteur’s proposals with regard to the acquisition of citizenship of one or another Member State and to the discrimination against third-country nationals residing in a given Member State should be taken up by this plenary assembly, with all the political groups joining together."
"I hope that this will happen."
"Equally, when it comes to extending the rights attached to EU citizenship to long-term residents from third countries, I believe that, if we do in fact want to make progress with regard to integration and that if we want the notions of European citizenship to become a reality, then the opportunity for these long-term residents to, for example, vote in local or European elections, should be accepted and enhanced at European level."
"Lastly, I believe that, with regard to our Parliament, the idea of a transnational election continues to give impetus to our work."
"I am not sure whether we have brought this idea any closer to fruition in this report, but it seems important to me to mention it as a factor that can improve, and contribute to, European citizenship."
"– Mr President, with the fourth report on citizenship, the European Commission is honouring its commitment under Article 22 of the Treaty of the European Communities to submit a three-yearly report on the application by the European institutions of the provisions of the second part of the Treaty entitled 'European Citizenship'."
"Basically, the fourth report presents developments concerning the rights which derive from citizenship of the Union."
"It is worth noting that all past reports on citizenship related to the Europe of the 15."
"We trust that the forthcoming report will provide an overall picture of today's Europe of the 25."
"The Catania report, however, does not present for us all developments in the individual sectors which, together with the right to equal treatment, make up the particular character of citizenship, sectors such as freedom of movement, citizens' participation in elections to the European Parliament and in local elections, public information and, most of all, information for the young people who will make up the heart of the Union in the future."
"In approaching the report within the framework of the remit of the Committee on Petitions, we highlighted the right of referral to the European Parliament and of complaint to the European Ombudsman."
"We are delighted by the way in which the rapporteur included our proposals, except for the omission of the proposal on the application of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"However, the report emphasises, in paragraph 32, the importance of the right to good administration and the right of access to documents laid down in Title V of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The submission of a report must be characterised by simple, brief and transparent procedures, which the rapporteur failed to emphasise in his report, so that citizens will not hesitate to make proper use of their right."
"Similarly, use of the right of recourse to the European Ombudsman requires suitable information of citizens and use of the means which the European Commission has as its disposal for an effective understanding of European citizenship."
"– Mr President, the duty of every rapporteur is to comment on the specific report on the basis of current legal terms and rules."
"However, Mr Catania has formulated his own legal rules, most of which are vague."
"Article 17 of the Treaty is clear and determines who can acquire citizenship of the European Union."
"We cannot ignore this."
"If we want to build legal structures, if we want to build structures which are not based on this specific provision, that is another matter, as is if we want to amend the Treaty."
"I would further say that, given that citizenship of the Union has undoubtedly developed into a source of real, specific rights, it must depend on clear and specific rules for its acquisition."
"I am delighted because Mr Catania rejected his own offspring this evening."
"He told us in committee and projected the usefulness of a European tax."
"Today Mr Catania appears to have understood where this proposal of his was leading and aborted it himself."
"The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejects these positions."
"I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, is public opinion in our countries ready to accept either the way which Mr Catania advocates or the European tax?"
"Answer for yourselves."
". Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am very pleased with the text proposed to us today and I have not, I might add, tabled any amendments for the vote in plenary."
"I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mr Catania, who has contributed a remarkable piece of work in the context of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who has succeeded in uniting the majority of Members around his draft report."
"Thanks to compromise amendments drawn up jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and thanks also to individual amendments tabled by Members of these groups, it seems to me that we have taken a number of important steps forward."
"I will mention five of them."
"The European Parliament is calling on the Member States to consider establishing a closer link between permanent legal residence over a reasonable period of time and the acquisition of national – and hence European – citizenship."
"It is underlining its desire for greater coordination of the general criteria and procedures for the acquisition of nationality in the Member States."
"Secondly, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss the possibility of drawing up a European voter’s card common to all the EU countries."
"Thirdly, it is calling on the Commission to draw up a white paper on possible developments in EU citizenship."
"Fourthly, it is calling on the Member States to extend the right to vote in local and European elections to third-country nationals and to stateless persons permanently residing in the European Union for more than five years, as well as the right of free movement and the right to a residence permit in any of the EU Member States."
"Finally, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss forthwith the possibility of granting EU citizens the right to vote and to stand for election in the municipal, local and regional elections of the Member State in which they are resident, as well as granting them the choice of voting and standing for election in national elections either in the country in which they are resident or in their country of origin, though not in both."
"Through these requirements and these desires expressed by the European Parliament, it is indeed a question of developing the Union into a real political community."
"Political citizenship and democratic participation are the keys to the very future of the European project that we desire."
". Mr President, this report addresses the fundamental issue of the link between the citizens, between the people – in order not to use a term that is currently creating confusion – and the political project that we are trying to implement, and contains a series of statements of immense significance, all of which are inter-related and all of which are important."
"Firstly, nationality still falls within the competence of the Member States; there is still a political entity in Europe which is called the ‘State’."
"This is the case, even if some of us do not like it very much."
"If we ignore this fact, we will merely be creating utopias."
"Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that, to some extent, nationality also falls within the competence of the European Union."
"It involves all of us."
"When a State refuses, illegitimately, to grant citizenship to people who have lived in their territory for many years, it is denying them access to European citizenship. This, in itself, gives us and the European Commission the power, without modifying the Treaties, to assess this issue."
"The States grant European citizenship: it is therefore something to which we cannot be indifferent."
"Furthermore, we cannot allow millions of people in Europe to contribute to our welfare and our wealth through their work and their taxes without having any kind of political rights."
"Resolving this problem in a concrete fashion is a complicated matter."
"But we cannot allow so many millions of people to be in this situation: contributing, but denied any right to express any opinion about their future."
"I therefore welcome this report."
"I believe that it is optimistic and that, in some cases, it goes rather further than the Treaties allow or than some of us would support: for example, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments must have the same degree of legitimacy and I therefore do not believe that, at this point, we can ask that certain people be allowed to vote in the European Parliament elections when they cannot vote in elections to national Parliaments."
"Both parliaments should have the same legitimacy, and when they evolve, they must do so at the same time."
"The Commission must publicise the rights that the European citizens currently enjoy much more effectively, for example in the consular field and in many other areas in which they are not even aware of the rights available to them."
"The Commission can contribute a lot to this debate, providing transparency in relation to what the different Member States do in a field which falls, and for the time being will continue to fall, within their competence."
". Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group supports the principal ideas in Mr Catania’s report."
"We consider that EU citizenship based on residence should be the ultimate goal to make the European Union a genuine political community."
"Those residing legally and on a long-term basis in the EU have to be granted political rights irrespective of their original nationality."
"The crucial reality of the enlarged EU is that amongst those covered by the term ‘third country national’ are half a million people who are not nationals of any state, being former citizens of a state which no longer exists: the USSR."
"These people make up 20% of the population of Latvia and 9% of that of Estonia."
"They are holders of non-citizen’s passports issued by those states, but for 15 years they have been deprived of their rights to political participation."
"In my opinion, Latvian and Estonian non-citizens may be the first candidates to become EU ‘civic citizens’, the term Commissioner Frattini proposed just now – and I am very grateful to him for that proposal."
"I believe that by adopting the Catania report Parliament will signal to the authorities of Latvia and Estonia that respect for equal rights is crucial for the EU."
"Mr President, citizenship is conferred by states, and it is therefore logical that those who want to see the EU turned into a state should also fight to establish citizenship of the Union."
"My group wishes to see practical European cooperation without wanting to construct a common state."
"We therefore reject the plans to develop citizenship of the Union."
"The place for common fundamental rights is in our own constitutions and in the European Convention on Human Rights. The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg must not be a rival, seeking to build a new state."
"Our countries’ voters must decide for themselves to whom they will give citizenship and at what juncture, as well as the rights and duties they will assign to such citizens."
"The very plan to bring about citizenship of the EU state, with the freedom to settle anywhere and sell one’s labour at reduced prices, destroys the EU and makes enlargement to include poor countries unpopular."
"The June Movement is in favour of a common market and cooperation but opposed to common citizenship."
"May I also remind you that, in 1992, the Danes voted against citizenship as provided for by the Treaty of Maastricht and obtained an exemption from common citizenship."
"This exemption is not being respected."
"Denmark is a party to every aspect of common citizenship of the Union, and using a Danish term for citizenship that excludes the element ‘state’ and therefore appears less binding emphatically makes no difference."
"Mr President, the notion of EU citizenship is really a synthetic concoction; it is not a natural product."
"Citizenship belongs to nation states."
"It is not something to be purloined by the EU in its desperate scramble for internal and external credibility, made more desperate by the humiliating rejection of the unwanted Constitution."
"What is being promoted here is a phoney and empty contrivance, designed to bring statehood to Europe."
"The proposal reaches its most ludicrous and unacceptable point when it embraces the progressive financing of the EU by direct taxation."
"If the proponents of EU citizenship think they will make the EU more loved and more wanted by promoting direct Brussels taxation, then I have to say that, happily, they are more out of touch with the citizens than I ever thought they were."
"Foolish reports like this do more to assist euroscepticism than anything else I can think of."
"Therefore, on that score, I suppose I should say: let us have more of them!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President, what has to be said, quite simply and bluntly, about the opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's report on Citizenship of the Union that Mr Catania has presented is that it misses the point."
"It does so by doing no more than demanding that EU citizenship be extended to include those who are resident in the EU but not citizens of it, so that, for example, foreigners and stateless persons would be given the right to vote and the right to stand for election."
"Third-country nationals would acquire the rights of EU citizens while retaining their rights in their home countries."
"To take one example, one could envisage a situation where, if Mr Catania had his way, an American who had lived in the EU for five years would be able to vote in the elections for the European Parliament, and indeed himself be elected to it, while at the same time being able to take part in elections in the United States."
"The effect of that would be to accord people who are not EU citizens more rights than those who actually are."
"The question at issue was, however, whether EU citizens actually enjoy, to the degree originally envisaged, the rights that they are accorded by law."
"Specifically, how do things stand with the rights of EU citizens as guaranteed by the Treaty on the European Communities?"
"Can our citizens really, for example, settle in other EU Member States without getting too tangled up in red tape?"
"What are the obstacles that make it more difficult to take up a job in another EU country?"
"If someone does that, how do things stand as regard the transferability of social security and health insurance, or the changeover to another system?"
"Are the controls on citizens at the internal borders unnecessarily rigorous?"
"Mr Catania, unfortunately – and I say ‘unfortunately’ in view of the fact that these are issues with which every citizen of the EU has to deal in everyday life – does nothing to answer these questions, not to mention others besides."
"Rational answers to them enhance the credibility of the European Union in people’s eyes."
"Improving the realities of day-to-day life and the cultural exchange between the European peoples makes Europe more readily acceptable."
"It is because the opportunity to do that has been missed that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be voting to reject this report."
"Perhaps I might be permitted to explain to the chair why it is that all the speakers are leaving the Chamber as soon as they have finished their speeches."
"As of 7 o’clock, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has been sitting, and all of us are required to go straight there."
"I would just like to clarify that for fear that it might be seen as discourteous."
"– Mr President, European citizenship does indeed, as Mr Catania quite rightly says, depend on nationality."
"As long as some people continue to see immigrants as second class citizens, as long as they believe that people who do not have European blood cannot acquire European rights, as long as, instead of integrating immigrants, they wish to keep them indefinitely in a grey zone, then immigration runs the risk of turning from the big hope of Europe into its big time bomb."
"The debate on European citizenship, as Commissioner Frattini quite rightly says, is directly linked to the harmonious integration of immigrants and the major question of political citizenship."
"The party from which I come in Greece, PASOK, has institutionalised the participation of immigrants in all its institutions."
"No European law is needed for that."
"It supports the participation of long-standing immigrants in local elections."
"We must become more open-minded in Europe and I am very grateful to Mr Catania, because his report allows us to hold a material political debate and to touch on matters which many conservatives in Europe do not appear to wish to touch on."
"Mr President, this report promotes the stupidity and falsity that is EU citizenship and proceeds to come up with suggestions as to how this ridiculous and failing notion can be promoted."
"The EU institutions show, with unwavering consistency, how totally out of touch they are with the sentiments and views of the public."
"The Maastricht Treaty may have created citizenship in principle, but it is a classic example of theory being impossible to put into practice."
"For example, EU citizenship is impossible to renounce."
"I do not want it."
"I was not even asked before it was imposed upon me."
"We now have clear proof of the desperation entering the thought processes of the federalists in this Parliament."
"It is their belief that ‘a direct link between some aspect of the tax system and the financing of the European Union’ would make EU citizenship more balanced."
"As any student of politics knows, linking something to a tax is the sure-fire way of condemning it to the dustbin of history."
"I have said many times before that if the EU is the answer then the question must have been a stupid one."
"This report proves that beyond doubt."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the creation of European citizenship because we want a Europe of the citizens and not simply a Europe of goods, services and capital."
"This citizenship grew out of increased protection of the rights and interests of citizens of the Member States and the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on the work he has done in this regard."
"We broadly welcome the balance sheet on the last three years presented to us by the Commission."
"The biggest problems that have come to light have primarily been down to incorrect implementation and practice, and not to non-compliance with national laws."
"This serves to reinforce the importance of a policy of information regarding the correct interpretation of Union rules and the correct implementation of the citizens’ rights, and reminds us that steps need to be taken to make the Charter of Fundamental Right legally binding."
"We want to strengthen and consolidate European identity and to increase the citizens’ involvement in the process of European integration, which needs to be reflected in higher turnouts at the European elections."
"Less welcome is the Catania report before us today, in which around half of the 40 points undermine the very concept, promoting recognition of EU citizenship regardless of whether or not the person has citizenship of a Member State. This clearly runs counter to the Treaty."
"European citizenship must not be understood as the idea of artificially creating a supranational identity to replace the sense of belonging to one’s country."
"The act of promoting a shared heritage based on a series of fundamental traditions and values should go hand in hand with respect for national identity."
"Union citizenship is complementary citizenship in addition to national citizenship and does not replace it."
"To advocate the opposite is to destroy the concept of European citizenship and to undermine the European project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Catania on his excellent report, which I support fully."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that there is no longer a European , but it is also true that we Europeans have decided to share a common destiny and that strengthening and developing European citizenship will undoubtedly contribute to our feeling increasingly more involved in the European project that we are implementing."
"We should remember, though, that millions of our fellow citizens live outside of the Union’s territory − almost one million Spaniards alone − and we should also remember that, regardless of our places of birth or residence, we are all equally European."
"There cannot be first- and second-class Europeans."
"I myself am the son of emigrants and I have spent most of my life outside of the Union’s borders."
"I have first-hand knowledge of how important it is to maintain a link with the country of origin and how necessary it is to bring the Union closer to the Europeans living outside of its territory as well."
"We must ensure that the rights that come with this citizenship are guaranteed for Europeans living in Switzerland, Argentina or any other part of the world, just as they are guaranteed for Europeans resident in France, Germany or any other State of the Union."
"In its White Paper on the development of citizenship, therefore, the Commission should provide for all appropriate measures to improve the conditions for exercising these rights and to guarantee that they become fully effective outside of the Union too."
"Mr Catania, I would like to thank you for having accepted the amendments that move in that direction and I hope that the Commission will take account of this House’s requests."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon."
"– The next item is the report by Mrs Prets (A6-0400/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation (2004/2216(INI))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased with the debate that has taken place on this subject."
"Many of you are aware that I regard fighting the traffic in human beings as one of those personal priorities which, I believe, must achieve not only visibility but also tangible and significant results during my mandate."
"Last October, as you know, I put forward a Commission communication devoted to this subject, precisely along the lines suggested by the rapporteur, Mrs Prets. It takes an integrated approach geared towards finalising a European action plan for firmly and decisively combating the traffic in human beings."
"In December, following that communication, the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers agreed with the proposal put forward and adopted an action plan."
"This plan specifically refers to best practice and to common standards and procedures to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings."
"With today’s report, which I particularly endorse and value, Parliament is adopting a vital – and certainly necessary – political role of its own, paying particular attention to women and children. These are the groups which, in my view, are most vulnerable to this real kind of slavery, which Europe has a duty to fight."
"I shall even say it has a moral duty, and not just an institutional and legal one, to stamp out this kind of slavery."
"This moral duty, as the report suggests, requires us to take an integrated approach based on the principle of having absolute respect for the dignity of every child, every woman and every man: every human being in general."
"This is not a legal or bureaucratic basis, but one of our fundamental principles grounded in the rules of the Treaties and of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and also, if I may say so, in the rules of morality."
"Although the European Union is already implementing policies in this area, they need to be strengthened."
"What I mean is, for instance, a policy designed to strengthen the principle of gender equality in order to prevent the marginalisation of women’s roles in the job market and their relegation to lower-paid jobs."
"Such a policy will certainly foster an improvement in cultural standards, which will be needed to root out the demand."
"That is another important point: demand is unfortunately a key part of exploitation."
"If there were no demand, if there were fewer customers, or if the number of users prepared to collaborate with the exploiters were cut drastically, the scale of the problem would undoubtedly be less horrific."
"I understand why the rapporteur chose not to focus on the topic of prostitution in the report we are examining."
"Personally, however – and I stress that this is my personal view – I feel that we must also address the issue of introducing tough measures to deter the clients, who are well aware that the girls they use are exploited and victims of trafficking."
"No one can fail to notice their tragic circumstances."
"This is an extremely sensitive subject, which we cannot examine in any depth today but which will have to be debated."
"The current degree of harmonisation is limited."
"The Member States have different legislations and, although there is a framework decision precisely on trafficking in human beings, child exploitation, the vile subject of paedophilia and child pornography, harmonisation at a practical level still appears limited."
"I agree with the rapporteur that little has been done for the victims of human trafficking, who should not be helped only when they decide to collaborate with the police."
"They also need help to rejoin society!"
"A child who has suffered the horrors of pornography and paedophilia should not be helped only when she cooperates with the police and reveals the names of her exploiters, but requires constant, life-long assistance, because the consequences of the harm she has suffered will probably mark her forever."
"The Commission has also attempted to base the approach to European legislation on the major guidelines drawn up by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"I am pleased to see that the Council also shares this approach and is thus in favour of extending all forms of child protection to young people under 18 years of age."
"We must not define the concept of ‘child’ too restrictively: those who are not yet 18 must also be able to benefit from the protection rules recognised by the United Nations and Europe."
"I also agree with another aspect of the report, where it emphasises the links between the strictly criminal matter of human trafficking and illegal immigration. I also endorse the topic of social protection and the need for a European Union foreign policy that aims at introducing a clear reference – as we are doing in all our international relations – to human trafficking as one of the Union’s priority areas."
"In short, those who negotiate with the Union and intend to develop close international relations with us must be aware that the European Union cannot even remotely tolerate the enormous traffic in and exploitation of women and children, and of human beings in general."
"In order to do all that, we need a database."
"I agree with you on that, and we are in fact working to set one up, including on a technical level."
"I am cooperating closely with Europol on enhancing their database, so as to be able eventually to set up a proper European statistical system providing reliable data."
"All too often, in fact, we do not know the real scale of the problem, and that is not acceptable."
"Europe will get a database and a reliable statistical system."
"At the same time, I intend not only to accept Parliament’s invitation but also to propose a great many practical initiatives which, on the basis of the action plan approved in December, will transform our desire to thoroughly stamp out the traffic in human beings, particularly women and children, into concrete action."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, it is gratifying that Parliament is today debating the trafficking of women and children."
"When the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I was draftsman, decided on the opinion I was to draft, there was not only a very large majority in favour of strongly condemning the odious trafficking of persons but also a desire to see human trafficking as an aspect of prostitution in the EU."
"What was important to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was to set the target of halving the trade within ten years and to see considerable efforts made to ensure that we MEPs obtain a better basis for decision-making, better statistics and, of course, better cooperation between police, prosecutors and judges."
"We believe – and I emphasise ‘believe’ – that up to one half of the victims of human trafficking may be children and minors."
"It was therefore important for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to emphasise that a minimum, inviolable age limit of 18 years must be set."
"For me, it is also only natural that women and children who have been victims of human trafficking be given the right to stay or else help in returning to their own countries."
"I also hope that, in the future, there will be cooperation with the tourist industry."
"Administrative districts and municipalities that receive large groups of tourists must make it clear that they view the trafficking of women and children as unacceptable."
"A concomitant of the decision about the tourist industry that we are to take here in Strasbourg are the rumours that thousands upon thousands of women are to be imported as prostitutes in advance of this summer’s football World Cup – a matter for protest on the part of the EU’s women Social Democrats."
"I am pleased to be able to say that, in Sweden, both our EU minister and the minister responsible for gender equality have condemned any such development, as has the chairman of the Swedish Football Association."
"I hope that all the speakers in this Chamber today are able to give their support to this protest against the trafficking of women."
"Sport, prostitution and the trafficking of women do not go together."
"In its ambition to draw attention to prostitution in the EU, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs wished to go further than the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is doing."
"I intend to return to this issue on a later occasion, for example in connection with our debate on Mr Frattini’s communication."
"We cannot, as Mrs Prets believes, bring the trafficking of persons to an end by providing information about it."
"What is required is for courageous politicians, including EU politicians, to take responsibility for doing so."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Prets’ excellent report tackles an extremely pressing and highly topical issue."
"At the very moment, in fact, when our societies are legitimately yearning to preserve the memory of what constituted slavery in centuries gone by, so that such crimes might never again take place, can we tolerate the continuation and development, throughout the world, of a new and modern form of slavery – sexual slavery – which is viewed by the traffickers as a run-of-the-mill commercial activity?"
"The response – and a unanimous one at that - of Mrs Prets and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is ‘No’."
"It must be recognised today that in spite of media interest which, I might add, is only a recent development, people still have a poor grasp of the devastating physical and psychological effects of trafficking."
"It must be recognised that, up to now, the texts we have adopted with a view to combating, at European level, the criminals who increasingly turn to this activity have more often than not gone unheeded."
"I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Prets is proposing a series of measures relating, at one and the same time, to prevention, awareness-raising and repression, which is the integrated approach Mr Frattini was talking about."
"For the first time, the ground has been prepared for a genuine common policy for combating this terrible modern-day scourge."
"Mrs Prets’ report is timely in avoiding the debate on what constitutes, on the one hand, trafficking and, on the other, prostitution. Due to the profound differences between our various sets of legislation, this debate would be liable to come to an abrupt end and to leave us powerless."
"I appreciate this approach, which is at aimed at effectiveness, but I also appreciate the fact that the taboo problem of demand has not, for all that, been sidestepped because, in the triangle formed by the actors in this tragedy – the traffickers, prostitutes and clients – it would be impossible, without being hypocritical, not to mention the clients’ responsibility in this affair."
"I therefore hope that the points raised are upheld."
"They underline our Parliament’s awareness of the problem and its desire to resolve every aspect of it, that is to say to banish sexual slavery from our society."
"I hope that the solid consensus demonstrated in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is repeated in our plenary, and I am convinced that the commissioners concerned, particularly Mr Frattini – who said as much to us - will hear our message and be very keen to make this fight a priority."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I speak for the Socialist Group in this House when I say that we are grateful to Mrs Prets and all the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights for their collaboration on this report."
"We have tabled many proposals as to how the battle against trafficking in women may be waged."
"We are alongside you one hundred per cent, Commissioner Frattini, if you take decisive action against this modern scourge."
"We have to drain this swamp and take action, and, with the action plan and with the help and cooperation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the United Nations, we will be able to do just that."
"There are plenty of proposals in the report that we can take up, and they need to be implemented now."
"Funding needs to be made available; Europol must be equipped with powers to act; a police task force needs to be set up: all these things can help."
"During the December part-session, half of the Members in this House supported the establishment of helplines for children."
"We want the Daphne programme to carry on being an effective instrument, but as something separate from the prevention of drug use."
"That is another issue, and every bit as important, but it needs to be dealt with separately."
"Where this is concerned, Commissioner, you have our backing."
"None of these things can be delayed for any longer."
"This was an issue that concerned both your predecessor, Mr Vitorino, and Mrs Gradin; thank heavens there are rather more people interested in it now."
"We also, however, have the World Cup football to look forward to, and that will prove to be another test."
"Germany is expecting no fewer than 40 000 additional prostitutes, supposedly to meet the needs of the men who will be going to watch the games, and the fact that these women will not be working of their own free will means that something needs to be done."
"We will continue to consider this issue in the Women’s Committee and will not stand idly by."
"What should go forth from today’s debate is a clear message to the organisations that we support women in their campaign and will not shrink back from raising the issue of demand for prostitutes in specific terms."
"Let us address this problem together and, not least by collecting the relevant data, as also with concrete policy measures, at last make this grey area the subject of headlines and make the public aware of it."
". Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank Mrs Prets for the work she has done, and I will be voting in favour of her report."
"The report sharply underlines our shortcomings with regard to combating the trade in, and trafficking of, women, adolescents and children."
"The laws in Europe on paedophilia, sex tourism and organised prostitution are in fact so diverse that we really need to show courage and determination in order to reach a consensus."
"We need to act quickly if we are to stop the growth in these sordid – indeed Mafia-like – markets and to combat the traffickers and their accomplices, who rely both on the prostitutes’ distress and on the clients’ sexual deprivation."
"I am not offended by the fact that prostitution exists, and I do not deny that it satisfies a great deal of its consumers, but I do, however, take a firm stance against this attack on a person’s integrity."
"I do not want to support a form of pseudo-morality that punishes the sins of the flesh but, at the same time, I do not want to accept a lax form of tolerance that disregards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly in relation to a person’s integrity, freedom and dignity."
"We must not, of course, imagine that we are going to eradicate prostitution, but we must make a clear distinction between tolerance and legitimation."
"I am in favour of criminalising demand."
"It is our duty to reflect together on the implementation of in-depth laws to stop the growth in these markets and to thwart those who seek out, encourage and try to put in place these kinds of activities."
"It is, in any case, crucial to arrive at a zero tolerance approach where cases of paedophilia and sexual exploitation are concerned, but we must also succeed in using information campaigns to raise clients’ awareness and to give them a sense of responsibility."
"In actual fact, even if the client’s role in all of this is a pitiful one, I am convinced that it should not be swept under the carpet."
"I am aware that it will be a long and difficult fight, but I do not want to be a party to a ‘least worst’ policy by supporting a lax form of tolerance that mainly benefits the organised prostitution rings, which garner huge financial profits and which also facilitate money laundering operations."
"I will conclude by saying that I am opposed to people being encouraged in any way to cast blame and to inform on others anonymously."
". Madam President, the fact that the trafficking of people for sexual exploitation is today the most rapidly growing criminal activity and that the European Union is no stranger to this phenomenon, obliges us to react."
"I therefore fully support the Prets report, which urges the Commission and the Council to establish a clear legal framework for combating this form of violence."
"Within this framework, there must clearly be preventive measures to support the development and ‘empowerment’ of women in countries of origin, in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of people who take advantage of their vulnerability, and exemplary punishments for those who profit from people trafficking."
"In any event, what we have to bear in mind is that these people are the victims, who need political, social and legal protection, and that, in all cases, we must guarantee − as happens in certain countries, such as Belgium or Italy for example − that, in order to encourage them to denounce their procurers, their right to residence after making that complaint is recognised."
"When these measures are taken seriously, it may be possible for us to eradicate this people trafficking more effectively."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Prets for her report and would like to take it as an opportunity to highlight an issue that will be of particular concern to us this year."
"Major sporting events also offer an opportunity to engage in the people-trafficking business, in which women are forced into prostitution."
"In sport, there is a constant emphasis on fairness and consideration for others, but if, on the occasion of the football world cup, the football supporters are offered brothels like the ones in Berlin, that is when I shall waste no time in spoiling the game."
"The trafficking in women and children, along with forced prostitution, must be banned, prosecuted and impeded, both nationally and at the European level."
"Let all those who are unwilling to take action against it be shown the red card!"
". Madam President, the aim of a strategy for combating the trafficking of women and children should be to help eliminate the various causes of such trafficking."
"The report makes reference to a number of these latter, including poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, lack of education, corruption and violence."
"Our priority, however, should be to change people’s way of thinking, and to move away from liberal policies that legalise various forms of corruption, addiction and prostitution in the name of the much-vaunted principles of the free market."
"A hedonistic and utilitarian approach to individuals lies at the root of such problems."
"We must move instead towards a civilisation of life promoting ethical values that ensure individuals are treated with due dignity."
"Another cause of social malaise is the crisis faced by the family, which is failing in its role as a morally healthy environment."
"Children who are left to their own devices in problem families imitate the models they see promoted in the media."
"They learn to adopt a consumer lifestyle in which the only goal or motivation to act is economic gain."
"Such a lifestyle is driven by a desire for success and rivalry between women and men, who compete with each other for power and influence instead of working together."
"This gives rise to frustration and various social ills."
"Violence and the sexual exploitation of women and children are caused by the sexualisation that is becoming ever more prevalent, both in the media and elsewhere."
"Together with what is known as ‘sex education’, it arouses urges before the attainment of mental and physical maturity, which is a prerequisite for control of one’s own actions."
"This produces people who operate according to primitive instincts and reasoning alone, and who lack empathy and the capacity for spiritual growth."
"I wish to express my thanks to Mrs Christa Prets for her report."
"Trafficking in persons, in particular women and children, is one of the worst forms of crime organised by international criminal groups."
"These groups mainly target people in lower-income categories on the pretext of employment as waitresses, barmaids, charwomen or au pairs."
"Most of the women who are ensnared in this way come from regions with adverse economic and social conditions, and high unemployment."
"Since trafficking in women is perpetrated internationally by well-organised supranational groups, combating this problem also requires coordination at the supranational level."
"It is commendable that international institutions such as the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union, are addressing this modern form of slavery belonging to the 20th and 21st centuries."
"Their activities have led to the adoption of a number of conventions, the signatories to which have included Slovakia."
"In my view, however, it is also important to monitor the actual implementation of these conventions."
"– Madam President, Mrs Prets' report is a truly exceptional, complete and integrated report."
"It touches briefly on all aspects of the problem of the movement of and trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation."
"Congratulations my honourable friend, and congratulations also to Commissioner Frattini on the sensitivity which he has shown and for the views which he expressed today on this issue."
"The phenomenon of trafficking for sexual exploitation and trafficking in women and children is a serious disgrace to contemporary society."
"Unfortunately, instead of tending to disappear, it is increasing."
"Prostitution is the atrocious reason for trafficking in human beings, but prostitution and trafficking in human beings are two sides of the same coin."
"It is a fact that there is social tolerance of prostitution in all the Member States of the European Union."
"That is not what I am discussing."
"However, there appears to be no tolerance of trafficking for sexual exploitation in woman and, more importantly, children in any Member State."
"Nonetheless, society is proving to be unable to stamp out this scourge."
"There is zero tolerance in words, but no results in practice."
"Who is to blame?"
"It is the inadequacy of the measures being taken to stamp out this phenomenon that is to blame."
"As the foxes said to the hares, 'we would agree to be your allies, if we didn't know what sort of creatures you are and who you are fighting against'."
"So an end to hypocrisy on the part of society, the state and individuals."
"This phenomenon demeans man and infringes the human rights of the victims involved in this venture and must be wiped out."
"There is no room for compromise or indifference."
"Criminalising the knowing acceptance of sexual services from women acting under coercion, deception or conditions of social and economic constraint and, more importantly, from children, is the first practical step which needs to be taken and it will certainly have results."
"The European Parliament is being called on to approve the Prets report by an overwhelming majority because, apart from anything else, it adopts for the first time the position of making the acceptance of such sexual services incriminating."
"Madam President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and focus my speech on the use of the new information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, and the trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation, an aspect which has also been mentioned in the report and which has not yet been raised in this debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, everything that is illegal in society is also illegal in the information society."
"The laws in force in each country also apply to the users and creators of the new information and communication technologies but, in practice, the very extra-territorial nature of those technologies and the fact that those laws are different in each country, make them extremely difficult to apply."
"The fact that an illegal information point for the trafficking of women and children, or for any other criminal activity, can be created very cheaply, the fact that it is accessible from any part of the world and that there is no reason why the information necessarily has to be consumed in the country from which it originates, enormously hinders the application of the laws."
"Furthermore, the technology is available to use the very mechanisms offered by the new information and communication technologies to hinder access by those people investigating the crime to the information point likely to be engaged in illegal acts."
"This makes it even more difficult to investigate the crime and hence to apply the law."
"If we really want Europe to be an area in which freedom and security are compatible values which enhance each other mutually, we must also deal with this problem decisively, thoroughly and in a joint fashion."
"This is a difficult problem that requires cooperation at European level."
"Understanding risks, rights and where to go for protection is essential to people’s protection."
"To this end, education is fundamental and in this regard the information and communication technologies offer some extremely positive opportunities."
"For all of these reasons, we would call upon the Commission, in coordination with the Member States, to tackle this aspect of the issue we are debating energetically and urgently."
"The attitude of considering human beings as commodities is a violation of human rights."
"Trafficking in human beings and prostitution are closely related, since trafficking in human beings supplies prostitution with new women and children."
"Experiences with the legalisation of prostitution show that it only increases trafficking in human beings."
"It is therefore ridiculous to differentiate laws about trafficking in human beings from those pertaining to prostitution."
"Trafficking in human beings is the fastest-growing type of organised crime."
"Buyers’ demands change, but what they want is unlimited access to women and children, and the market is flourishing."
"The globalisation of the economy also means the globalisation of prostitution, which is becoming an industry without borders."
"I would like to stress that if we think that we can combat trafficking in human beings separately from prostitution, we are burying our heads in the sand."
"It is time for some action across all areas of politics, because the sad numbers of victims show how the action taken up till now has been unable to control this situation."
"I would like to thank Mrs Prets for her excellent work; and thank you for your attention."
"– The fact that we are having this debate is important, but more important still is taking urgent and effective measures to put a stop to the trafficking of human beings, and in particular women and children, for the purposes of sexual exploitation and enforced labour; this is tantamount to slavery and a grave violation of human rights."
"We cannot turn a blind eye to this worldwide scourge, which affects 600 000 to 800 000 people, of whom 80% are women and children, and the EU, where more than 100 000 people a year are victims, is also not immune."
"There are clear links between trafficking of this nature and war, political instability in the countries of origin, the deepening of social and regional inequality, the feminisation of poverty and unemployment and violence against women and children, which means that fresh approaches and integrated policies are required."
"It is well known that trafficking for sexual exploitation is directly linked to prostitution, and it is therefore a matter of urgent priority that a range of integrated measures be adopted with the aim of protecting the dignity of women and children, and of taking action to combat the trafficking of human beings."
"Steps must also be taken to combat money laundering, and to shut down tax havens. Moreover, socio-economic policies that are aimed at enhancing solidarity, and are committed to economic and social cohesion, must also be adopted."
"Madam President, this evening I have heard the words ‘trafficking’, ‘slavery’, ‘violence’, ‘abuse’, ‘organised crime’, ‘paedophilia’, ‘rape’ - all of them scourges of modern society, as we all agree."
"However, I do not know of any national governments that have not already made these illegal."
"I cannot for the life of me see the point in reinventing the wheel when all this is already illegal across the European Union."
"What we need to do is get on with our business and start enforcing the laws that we already have."
"I am also surprised that you are surprised that this is the sort of thing that happens when you tear down all the border controls."
"It is difficult to believe that it has actually taken anybody by surprise at all."
"It was surely inevitable."
"As to the criminalisation of the client, which somebody suggested earlier, in the United Kingdom homosexuality was made legal in order to do away with what was then known as a ‘blackmailer’s charter’."
"If you start to criminalise the client in these matters, you will find that the law of unintended consequence comes into play, something at which I am afraid this Parliament is all too adept."
"– Madam President, trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, is as old as human society."
"It is also true that, even if this practice is almost always judged to be condemnable and disparaging for the position of man compared with other living creatures, at no time and in no civilisation, including of course in our European civilisation, has it been addressed effectively."
"The Prets report, on the one hand, is yet another attempt to highlight the ineffectiveness of national and Community laws and actions."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her methodical and realistic presentation and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on finalising a substantial text full of proposals and for developing effective actions not only at European but also at global level."
"I congratulate you, Commissioner, on the integrated approach to your recent communication and on the Council's action plan."
"I am highlighting what is for me the high point of the report, even though I know the difficulties and the limitations imposed by the Treaties, the call for a clear legal basis to be adopted in order to combat all forms of violence against and trafficking in women and children and the full communitisation of a horizontal European policy for prevention and to protect the victims in the sectors of immigration, employment, commerce and banking transactions, transport, tourism and the new technologies which can be used to make trafficking and exploitation uncontrollable and prosecution unfeasible."
"Another point which gives cause for hope is the call in the report for closer cooperation between the national authorities and Εuropol and Eurojust by improving international operational cooperation."
"It is a pity that the states did not hasten without hesitation to ratify the international agreements and conventions."
"The Community institutions are being called on here to safeguard the coordination and cohesion of activities by international fora."
"To close, I would highlight the reference in the report to the need for action with less costly means but of fundamental importance for the future of the civilised world, by which I mean educational programmes which will be capable of teaching boys and girls self-respect and, consequently, respect for their fellow human beings, so that they do not become either perpetrators or victims."
"I am glad to congratulate rapporteur Christa Prets for a timely and informative report."
"Above all, I would like to emphasise that trafficking in human beings is international organised crime."
"It is the most rapidly developing type of crime at the present time, if we consider for instance the rapid spread of cybersex on the Internet."
"In order to combat this, we need well-organised international cooperation."
"We need a clear legal basis."
"We need to take the struggle up to the level of a joint European Union policy, so that we can reduce the number of slaves by half within 10 years, as underlined by the report."
"The report highlights the need for the complete implementation of the existing structures."
"I concur with that 100%."
"Europol must make up for its idleness up till now, and ascertain the criminal networks, methods and persons involved."
"At the same time, the opportunities afforded by the European Neighbourhood Policy must be more effectively implemented."
"Based on the present incomplete information, the victims of contemporary slavery in Europe are mostly from Moldova and Ukraine."
"In order to prevent trafficking in human beings, those countries need know-how and financial assistance like that provided to candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania."
"The victims of trafficking in human beings are made all the more vulnerable by the poor economic conditions of their families and home countries."
"As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I am well aware that every third woman in Moldova is unemployed."
"At the same time, sources argue that every other prostitute in Paris is from Moldova."
"It is clear that these facts are connected."
"Women’s unemployment and the shortage of sources of subsistence make it possible for criminals to trap their victims with simple lies of well-paying jobs abroad."
"Therefore I share the rapporteur’s opinion that in political discussions with third countries, the Council and Commission must also very seriously raise the topic of trafficking in women and children."
"For my part, I would like to draw attention to witness protection as a recognised method of combating organised crime."
"In combating trafficking in human beings, one should also permit victims who testify to start a new life in a new country if they so wish."
"Of the members of the European Union, only Belgium and Italy do this."
"Thank you for your attention, and once again I would like to express my deepest thanks to the rapporteur."
"Madam President, there are always three sides to the trafficking of human beings: the victims, the organised crime networks and the demand side."
"The customers, or ‘clients’, are predominantly males who feel that they have a right to buy women, or rather, girls."
"Should we grant them this right without limits?"
"A recent comprehensive study commissioned by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and conducted by the Italian-based Transcrime Institute, shows that this restrictive view on the demand side has a decisive impact on the number of victims of trafficking."
"I am pleased to say that Finland is about to adopt a law similar to the one in force in Sweden, criminalising the buyers of sex."
"The Prets report which we are now discussing is weak in that respect."
"I know it will take some time before a majority of Member States have criminalised the buying of sex, but is it not time that we criminalise the buying of slaves and criminalise the men who buy the victims of trafficking?"
"I will end this speech in the same way I have promised to every time I speak in this House: – ‘I therefore maintain that prostitution must be abolished’."
"Madam President,"
"I wholeheartedly welcome Mrs Prets’ report on combating the trafficking of slaves and those who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation."
"It is a flagrant denial of the fundamental rights of a human being and must be addressed effectively."
"I welcome the Commissioner’s comment that practical support must be provided for those who are victims of trafficking."
"Allowing those who come forward to remain in the country would be one way of helping them to get out of the situation they find themselves in."
"I would caution against approaching this problem, as we heard from one person here tonight, with a ‘fortress Europe’ mentality and using this as an excuse to reinforce borders."
"I welcome the report’s emphasis on setting defined targets to tackle trafficking in the coming years with a view to its total eradication."
"Madam President, human trafficking is a very serious violation of human rights."
"It is mainly women and children who are, by various false pretences, recruited into it, thereafter being exploited in slavish dependence."
"In many cases, those who end up in prostitution are victims of human trafficking, and they are treated like ."
"We must protect them from this, both in and outside of the Community, with all the means we have at our disposal both in the corrective and preventive spheres. This means that these modern slaves who are caught up in this vicious circle must be actively given the opportunity of breaking out of it and starting afresh."
"Prostitution is not a normal industry, in which work is carried out, and so it should not be treated as one."
"Clients of prostitutes do not buy services, but take advantage of other people’s bodies."
"That is a form of violence and should, in my view, be punishable in the same way as other forms of violence."
"Penalising prostitutes’ clients is the best way of preventing human trafficking."
"I should like to thank Mrs Prets for her report."
"The amendments I tabled are meant to add detail to it, and I hope that my fellow Members can accept them."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I want to start by congratulating my honourable friend, Mrs Prets, on her own initiative report which aims to highlight the major moral and political problem of trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation."
"Despite the difficulty in collecting statistics, the numbers are terrifyingly large, both in terms of the people being trafficked, especially women who fall victim to sexual exploitation, and in terms of the income from this activity."
"This is not a new issue, but it is worth asking how European societies and the civilised world in general tolerates and, more importantly, maintains these phenomena."
"There are a great many reasons and responsibilities at all levels."
"First of all, society is responsible, given that sexual exploitation is not necessary; it is the result of the law of supply and demand."
"Secondly, the state is responsible, given that the Member States have not managed to control and combat these phenomena and their impact on the human victims."
"However, nor has the European Union been equal to the challenges and created a common area of justice and security."
"However, the European Union has certainly played a positive role in raising awareness, in cooperation and in addressing the phenomenon."
"The 2002 framework decision and the 2004 directive contributed to a certain legislative harmonisation and to broader cooperation."
"We must continue in this direction."
"This crime is developing across borders."
"Judicial and police cooperation need to be stepped up, using the facilities of Europol and Eurojust."
"We need to continue towards the integration and communitisation of our policies which increasingly need to accompany the single market and freedom of movement."
"I too would reiterate the importance of a common definition of the crime, so that we can collect statistics, the European arrest warrant, a clear legal basis, so that our policies and their Community and national budgets acquire European added value and effectiveness."
"Madam President, everyone here this evening has stressed that combating the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes should be given far greater priority in Europe."
"That is also the reason why I should like to thank Mrs Prets for her report, which contains so many specific recommendations."
"We are talking about many hundreds of thousands of women and children who end up in this criminal industry every year, the fastest growing criminal activity which generates lots of cash very easily."
"More effort is therefore desperately needed."
"We should also search our own hearts, for there is no market without clients."
"Money must be made, and that is why clients are needed, so we must start close at home in order to raise awareness and public sensitivity, as well as the visibility of this distressing problem, and to discourage the exploitation of these women and children in our Member States."
"The Europe-wide anti-human trafficking day, for which this report argues, could serve as a useful instrument in this."
"I look forward to hearing what Commissioner Frattini has to say on this subject, and whether he intends to embrace the idea."
"At the same time though, we should not shy away from sacred cows in this report, namely the World Cup, for major events such as these have a habit of attracting criminals who want to make a fast buck at the expense of women and children."
"We should also take far more decisive measures in tracing and prosecuting these criminals."
"Europe is too slow in introducing legislation that intends to combat human trafficking, and the criminal investigation services do not yet accord its combating the priority status it deserves."
"That is why I suggested that this legislation be included in the annual reports that we have requested."
"Europol too should start tracing criminals as a matter of priority."
"It is part of their mandate and they should now also act on it."
"I could go on, but I think that this report has set the right tone for adopting a more proactive stance towards this problem."
"– Madam President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Christa Prets, both for her own initiative report and for her sensitivity towards a social issue of global proportions."
"It is a problem about which no-one – and in particular the European Parliament – can remain impassive, especially when the information is extremely worrying for the Member States of the European Union."
"The words 'trafficking in human beings', 'sexual exploitation' and 'forced prostitution', at both national and global level, encompass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hunger have created, mainly in the developing countries, in the lower echelons of these societies."
"Women and children are the victims."
"I agree that criminal gangs are operating all over the world."
"New electronic technologies give these gangs immunity, often with our tolerance."
"However, when vulgar tactics are applied, such as coercion, constraint, kidnapping and threats to unprotected communities, by which I mean women and underage children, then I consider it incomprehensible for us to remain impassive to and remote from the phenomenon of violence and infringement of our human dignity and fundamental rights."
"We are all jointly responsible, given that the punishment of traffickers and their accomplices is and remains a theoretical act, not the demonstration of strength in practice that we should all engage in."
"To close, I should like to point out that major international events, such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup in Germany next summer, are used as cover for such incidents."
"The rapporteur is right to point this out, but the roots of evil run deep and in such cases the best cure is prevention, vigilance on the part of the countries which host such sporting events and, most importantly, public information for the citizens which constitute the shield of society, women and children."
"I ask you, Mr Frattini, is the Commission doing anything in this direction?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have spoken in this debate."
"There seems to be total agreement, and I believe that the value added by the European Union, as we address the problem together through a global approach, is clear to everyone."
"I should like to focus on a few specific points that have been mentioned."
"The Commission will continue to encourage and promote specific projects aiming at the prevention of human trafficking and the protection of its victims, particularly women and children."
"I can confirm that I am willing to ensure that the projects that come under the Daphne initiative are kept separate from the anti-drugs strategy."
"I know that Parliament specifically wants that and, once you have drawn up a proposal to that effect, I shall be prepared to endorse it and to keep the instruments for preventing and combating the traffic in women and children (the Daphne programme) separate from the anti-drugs initiatives, as they are clearly distinct topics."
"I fully agree with the idea of a European helpline for victims, particularly children."
"I too am working on a project of this nature and I greatly value the proposal contained in the report."
"I am thinking of initiatives in the framework of the Union’s international policy to reduce or, rather, to root out sex tourism."
"This is not exactly traffic into Europe, but there are unfortunately thousands and thousands of citizens of European countries whose ideal holiday is to go to countries where they can have sex with little boys and girls."
"Such sex tourism must be stamped out, and I believe that one way to do so is to involve the vast international network of travel agents."
"Travel agents know perfectly well, when they organise trips, what the aims of sex tourism are, and so we shall work with the governments of the countries involved and with the network of travel agents to pass on this powerful message at least."
"As regards sporting events, this is undoubtedly an important matter. I intend to write a formal letter to the German Government to recommend that specific preventive measures be taken during the 2006 football World Cup to prevent the influx and concentration of persons who would, unfortunately, be destined to go into prostitution during that period."
"It will not be a difficult operation, since these are problems that are easy to spot, and the German Federal Government’s means and resources, including its investigative resources, will be in a position to help us."
"I shall act on your suggestion and send this request."
"I agree on taking a tougher attitude towards customers."
"I am personally convinced – I have said this before and I repeat it now – that the clientèle needs to be deterred."
"There will be a debate on this topic and, although it seems there is some divergence of opinion on it, I believe we can all agree that there would be no trafficking in human beings, or at least much less, if it were not for the people who call for it."
"That is why careful consideration is needed, above all by the national governments, such as those of Sweden and Finland, which have adopted that strategy, and also by the European Union as a whole."
"Let me repeat my view: we need to be tougher on the customers."
"The last subject on which I should like to focus is information exchange: more information must be given to the countries of origin, but also more information must be exchanged within European Union Member States."
"Like me, you probably know that a European criminal record does not yet exist for people convicted of paedophilia, for instance."
"It was possible for the Fourniret case to happen because nobody in another country knew where this person came from or what sort of person he was."
"Today it is necessary to focus on paedophilia, for instance – as we are doing – by setting up a European information register: not a new structure, but a flow of real-time information accessible to all the Member States for certain types of conviction, starting with paedophilia itself, which in my view is one of the most hateful of crimes."
"Precisely for that reason, when I spoke to the director of Europol, I could appreciate the organisation’s commitment to combating paedophilia, including through the use of information systems."
"I am saying this because Mrs Riera Madurell raised the subject."
"I can tell you that an initial investigation last year into a gang of paedophiles in 13 European countries, coordinated by Europol itself, led to the arrest of almost 100 people. That really is good news, even though few people know about it."
"I repeat: 13 countries, and coordinated by Europol."
"That shows that Europe can and must take action."
"Of course, you can always count on my staunch support."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote shall be held at 12 noon on Tuesday."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong by Enrique Barón Crespo on behalf of the Committee on International Trade (O-0108/2005 B6-0348/2005)."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, which it is my honour to chair, has participated in the preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and is currently continuing to work with a view to the next stages of the negotiation of the Development Agenda."
"As you know, a delegation from Parliament followed the Conference in situ."
"I have been able to tell Commissioner Mandelson that, in Hong Kong, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council were more united than in Brussels, and that was important in this difficult negotiation."
"We are now at the stage of evaluating what happened in Hong Kong and preparing the recommendations for the future negotiation."
"The Committee is going to produce an initiative report, the rapporteur for which will be Mr Papastamkos."
"We hope that it can be approved in April, so that the conclusions can be on the table in time for 30 April."
"With regard to the results, the most significant thing we can say about this stage is that we have reached the end of it."
"I share the Commissioner’s view that the result are insufficient to make the meeting a success, but sufficient to prevent it from being seen as a failure."
"The progress made in relation to agricultural export subsidies, to the production and trade in cotton and access to markets free of tariffs and export quotas for the least developed countries is not inconsiderable."
"It is important to confirm to our partners in the developing countries that we remain true to our commitment that this should be a development round."
"Nevertheless, we are still a very long way from achieving a global and balanced result and there is still a lot of work to be done if we want this round to be completed by the end of this year, in view of the limitation represented by the expiry of the United States Trade Promotion Authority, granted by Congress."
"In Hong Kong, a series of intermediate stages were defined, which include such important elements as defining the methods for eliminating the different types of agricultural export subsidies, the reduction in internal support for agriculture and improving the conditions for access to the agricultural markets."
"We shall have to assess jointly whether the necessary, though not sufficient, conditions are in place to achieve a global agreement."
"As I said before, an important meeting is going to take place in Geneva at the end of April, at which we believe the European Parliament should be represented according to the methods we agree."
"We shall be constantly and vigilantly following this issue."
"There are three issues that I would like to mention to the Commissioner."
"First of all, the negotiation on services, which is essential from the Union’s point of view, is currently subject to a different timetable to that of the negotiation on agriculture and access to the markets."
"Commissioner, how do you intend to ensure a balance amongst the concessions in these three sectors while also respecting the timetable set?"
"Secondly, the issue of geographical indications, which is very important to the European Union, particularly in order to safeguard the future of agriculture as compensation for the elimination of subsidies and also in order to defend our quality products, appears to be suffering a delay."
"How does the Commissioner believe that this delay can be alleviated?"
"Finally, with regard to the situation of the emerging countries, who are partners of ours, who may benefit from the ‘everything but arms’ initiative, which is an important European initiative, and who may see their preferences eroded, how do you intend to secure the support of the countries close to us for a possible agreement in which we must create a balance between advantages and disadvantages?"
"This is clearly a complex process, and one in which we must be able to achieve a balance between the Union’s offensive interests, its defensive interests and the legitimate ambitions of the developing countries, and also to convince our fellow citizens that our interests are better protected within a WTO which is stronger, more open and more democratic."
"Finally, Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and Commissioner Fischer Boel and their teams of negotiators for the efforts they have made and the attention they have paid to us."
"I can assure them that they can count on solid, but critical, support from the European Parliament, with a view to achieving these objectives."
". Madam President, just to take up on the last point, I attach very great importance to encouraging and facilitating parliamentary involvement in trade matters."
"This is a relationship which is very important to me, and I hope that our debate this evening is a further demonstration of that."
"I am determined to keep these close and regular contacts between us going in the future."
"Indeed, as I look round the Chamber this evening I see that many of us were in Hong Kong together."
"This is a sort of early reunion and a good time to take stock."
"You asked me to give my evaluation of the results of the Hong Kong meeting and say what conclusions can be drawn from it."
"I want to do that."
"You have also asked me to set out my views on the next steps that should be taken."
"I will give you my preliminary views, but I also want the Members of this House to give me their opinions and reflections in turn, in order to shape my own views."
"Therefore, my reflection, which is very topical and an active process, means that this debate comes at just the right time."
"I am going to meet other Members here in Strasbourg tomorrow."
"I cannot pretend that the Hong Kong conference was a staggering success: it was not."
"According to the WTO Director-General, Mr Lamy, we moved from 55% to 60% achievement of the round."
"That was pretty small incremental progress, and it certainly is a very expensive 5%."
"If you consider how many people were in Hong Kong and how much it cost them to get there and stay there – not to mention the sleep deprivation whilst there! – it was indeed a very costly 5%."
"However, it was enough to avoid failure and to prevent the DDA train from derailing."
"So it was a good investment; it was worth it."
"We have to bear in mind that expectations had been significantly lowered before we arrived in Hong Kong."
"We were not expecting breakthroughs and we were not disappointed."
"Modest incremental progress was the best that could be expected and that is what happened."
"As for the European Union, we ourselves made the best out of what was at times a very difficult situation."
"When I say ‘we’, I mean all of us – the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"It must be said – and I wish to place on record my gratitude for it – that the support for, and the high level of trust and confidence that was placed in, Europe’s negotiators was of immense importance, value and encouragement to us."
"It was important to our collective European credibility and I believe it will be equally important in the months to come."
"At Hong Kong we found ourselves at times under very carefully orchestrated political pressure either to concede further unilateral concessions or to accept blame for failure."
"In the event, we did neither: we did not give unilateral concessions, nor were we subsequently blamed."
"Nonetheless, we made an important contribution, which was recognised as such, by accepting 2013 as the date for the final elimination of all agricultural export subsidies."
"In doing so we did not cross our red lines; we remained united and we emerged with both credit and credibility."
"That is not a negligible achievement."
"Europe was firm and reasonable and that is how I should like to characterise what I intend to be our future role and performance: firm and reasonable."
"One important achievement in Hong Kong was agreement on the development package, which was made possible by the determined pressure we had placed on other developed countries in the months prior to Hong Kong."
"Still, I should have liked the United States, Canada and Japan to follow us all the way down our ‘Everything but Arms’ road, and go for an all-country, all-product, duty-free, quota-free approach, as we ourselves have granted to the least-developed countries."
"Ninety-seven per cent – not one hundred per cent, as we in Europe offer – is a major step forward."
"It seems generous, but it will actually allow developed countries to shield some key products that are of importance to a number of LDCs and I regret that."
"Similarly, we made progress on cotton subsidies, but the final outcome was, again, disappointing in respect of the domestic subsidies operated in the United States."
"More generally, the outcome of Hong Kong leaves us with everything still to play for, and nothing in the final text prevents us from continuing to seek the kind of ambition and balance that have been our watchwords throughout this negotiation."
"After Hong Kong we can still continue to seek a round that is economically meaningful and pro-development."
"That means both more market access and stronger international trade rules for all."
"Having said that, I will not hide from you that the road ahead will be tough for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, there is a risk of some front-loading of negotiations on agriculture and NAMA – industrial goods – and then back-loading negotiations on services, rules and GIs."
"This has to be minimised."
"Secondly, a direct relationship has been established between market access for industrial goods and agricultural goods, which some WTO members might be tempted to interpret as necessitating reduced new market access for industrial goods, as opposed to new market access for agricultural goods."
"We will be very vigilant on this."
"Thirdly, and perhaps more fundamentally, it was not evident in Hong Kong that other important partners are ready yet to take the hard decisions, to make the offers and the contributions that will be needed if this round is to end on a successful note in a year’s time or beyond."
"Until a sense of mutual responsibility and flexibility – without which we cannot make the trade-offs or the bargains needed to bring this round to a successful conclusion – is demonstrated by all the key negotiating partners, we will not be able to look forward to an early conclusion of this round."
"The dust is still settling and we are still evaluating our next moves with a cool head."
"As I have said, today’s debate will be a contribution to the analysis that we are undertaking."
"I want to share with you some further thoughts on this."
"We should be adamant in having the principle of the single undertaking respected."
"That is central to this round and to how the WTO works."
"We should not abandon that principle."
"We should not accept further feet-dragging either in services, geographical indications or in rule-making areas, and the same is true for industrial goods."
"Above all we need to engage with our partners to gauge the real level of ambition and see if our ambitious vision of the round is genuinely shared by them."
"I really hope this is the case."
"Europe could settle, reluctantly and grudgingly, at the end of the day, for a minimalist outcome."
"We could do so if that is what the rest of the world wants."
"But I have to say to you that it would be a great shame, a great pity and a great loss to do so."
"It would not help our economies or others’ growth and employment, and it would not help reduce global poverty."
"That remains the aim of this round."
"So I will be engaging vigorously with all my partners in the weeks ahead to see if the negotiating material and the energy are still there for an ambitious and balanced outcome."
"However, I am not inclined to sacrifice quality for speed."
"I know that the United States Trade Promotion Authority will expire in mid-2007, and I will do what I can to achieve ambitious outcomes within the timeframes that we agreed to work to in Hong Kong, but not if that means sacrificing European interests or those of weak and vulnerable developing countries, which also need to gain tangibly from this round."
"This round is not just about competitive, large-scale agricultural exporters but about the generality of developing countries, and their interests cannot be sacrificed for the sake of speed."
"Importantly, we should be unambiguous in stating our aims, in particular towards the generality of developing countries."
"We should be more active in our bilateral and regional contacts and indicate clearly what we are requesting from our counterparts in the WTO and what we are not requesting or expecting. For example, that for the vast majority of developing countries we can give a lot, but seek nothing or very little in return."
"This would avoid the misunderstandings – some genuine and some, I am afraid, wilfully encouraged – that can grow in the minds of some that this is a sort of extreme cantonist round in which we are trying to extract ounces of flesh from our negotiating partners who are not in a position to pay into this round."
"That is not the case; it has never been the case and it will not be the case in future."
"More generally, the development arguments need to be restated."
"Reducing barriers to trade drives economic growth."
"It is not an unfair price to be paid by imposition on developing countries."
"At times in Hong Kong I felt that some developing country partners were simply not convinced that the progressive, properly supported opening of markets is good for development at all and that, instead, the panacea for all the developing world’s illnesses was simply the tearing-apart of the common agricultural policy."
"Of course, agricultural liberalisation should take place and needs to catch up, but this round is not an agriculture-only round."
"Since agriculture is less than 5% of world trade in goods and services, it is obvious that the biggest gains of this round lay elsewhere, not only for the European Union but in particular for developing countries, which would benefit immensely from expanding their trade with each other where the bulk of that trade takes place, which is in industrial goods, not agriculture."
"So the case for a strong South-South dimension of the round remains convincing."
"I fully acknowledge the importance of granting developing countries the necessary flexibilities, and we need to explain and stress this all the time in Europe’s approach."
"All our proposals include special and differential treatment which, in the case of the least-developed countries and the most vulnerable countries, basically means that they will not be requested to make any liberalising effort in this round."
"However, the European Community is not going to sign up to an OECD round in which the G20 group of emerging economies simply sits back and enjoys the concessions made by the developed world without much, or indeed any, gain for the poorest and most needy developing countries."
"That is not sellable across Europe; it should not be sellable across the world."
"Finally, I should like to talk about your role and contribution in the months to come."
"Clearly, the outcome of a negotiation must be sold and, to that conclusion, our policies and positions need to be explained as well."
"This is especially true in open, democratic societies like our own."
"I greatly appreciated your opinions and your help in Hong Kong."
"I thought we really were in a real sense working together as Team Europe, even if on specific issues there were nuances and certain policy differences between us."
"I would like your continued help in explaining not only to your own electorates but also to our WTO partners that the European constituency remains ambitious for the DDA, that we are deeply committed to its development values, but we will not be able to settle for an outcome that has nothing in it to enhance European growth or competitiveness or that can help us in creating more jobs to offset those that are lost in Europe as agricultural production falls away."
"In trade negotiations you get what you pay for."
"Europe will not be ready to pay for a round that offers nothing new on industrial market access, services, GIs or other rules that lend strength to the multilateral way of managing our international affairs."
"If there are no advances or real improvements in those areas, then we are not going to pay and be the sole banker of this round."
"These are my preliminary thoughts."
"I have already started discussions with my main counterparts, and the forthcoming Davos meeting will be the first opportunity to further compare notes with trade ministers."
"We will continue reassessing and fine-tuning our negotiating position in the light of the reactions and comments we get from other WTO members, but mostly, of course, from the Council and from you."
"I will again outline my approach in a trade policy speech next Monday, 23 January, in Berlin, after I have heard your views tonight."
". – Mr President, I shall refrain from referring to the specific objectives of the European Union and the outcome of the negotiations in Hong Kong subject by subject."
"The chairman of our committee, Mr Barón Crespo, has already done so, as has Commissioner Mandelson, whom I feel a need to thank for his negotiating ability in Hong Kong and for constantly updating us Members of the European Parliament in the run-up to and during the conference in Hong Kong."
"We look forward, Commissioner, to continuing our creative cooperation."
"The overall review of the outcome of the Hong Kong conference is judged to be average but, at the same time, taking account of the objective circumstances, positive."
"Average because, on numerous crucial issues of global trade governance there was no substantial progress, just declarations of programmes or declarations of intent."
"Positive because, above all, there was a commitment – this was emphasised – to continue negotiations."
"The Hong Kong conference demonstrated that our path towards the successful integration and completion of the current round remains open."
"Nonetheless, it is useful for everyone on all sides to realise that there is no viable alternative to the multilateral trade system."
"There is no alternative which can safeguard economic integration and development, the effective management of increasing economic interdependence and the peaceful and fair resolution of differences."
"The successful conclusion of the Doha round negotiations will strengthen and broaden international exchanges and international development."
"It will make the international trade system fairer, thereby generating benefits for everyone and will improve institutions and procedures."
"It will even act as a dam to the spread of bilateralism and protectionism."
"I am certain that the European Union will continue its effort and will develop dynamic initiatives to bring the round to a successful close."
"This effort unites us."
"It is a common challenge."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the principal merit of the agreement reached in Hong Kong is that of maintaining the multilateral system and of not derailing the development round begun in Doha."
"This agreement, which the Commissioner himself noted is an interim one, is a long way from concluding the round. Much remains to be done."
"Following Seattle and Cancun, however, a new setback would have opened the door to a proliferation of even more unbalanced bilateral agreements between the North and the South."
"The aim of the round must continue to be one of ensuring that the trade rules serve development, and this must remain the EU’s goal, even though we know that it will mean us obtaining less than what we offer to our partners in the South, not least where market access is concerned."
"Commissioner, at times I have been hard on you and the Commission in relation to trade policy."
"My group and myself will remain vigilant and demanding, particularly with regard to key issues such as public services or the support measures for LDCs and the ACP States."
"That being said, I should like today, in this House, to pay tribute to the work you have done, not only on keeping the European Parliament delegation constantly up-to-date, but also – and above all – on ensuring that the Member States’ position was coherent in Hong Kong."
"In saying that, I am thinking, in particular, of the difficult decision that had to be taken in order to reach a unanimous agreement on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies by 2013."
"It was a long-awaited decision and an important sign – including in terms of supporting and doing more to defend the CAP in the future – even though we know that, as regards agriculture, we still need to break the back of the negotiations on domestic support and market access."
"You have also shown the flexibility required to prevent a freeze on industrial tariffs and services, a freeze that would have proved fatal for the negotiations."
"You will need to remain flexible because it is only right that developing countries should want to control open trade and to carry on being able to regulate their public services, and that they should not jeopardise their weakest industries."
"I have one final comment to make: Hong Kong has demonstrated once again the need for an in-depth reform of the WTO."
"We have seen once again the extent to which there is still a deep crisis of confidence between industrialised countries and developing countries and the extent to which the clash between national interests constantly threatens the steps taken towards achieving our common objectives: development, the eradication of poverty and fairer trade on an international scale."
"We will only salvage the multilateral trade system by ensuring that it ties in with the other organisations of the UN system that work towards human development. This will be achieved by counterbalancing free trade with social development objectives, which amounts to guaranteeing that trade rules take account of non-commercial aspects, the environment, public health and social rights."
". Mr President, the recalibration of the Hong Kong talks forced us all not to hope for historic breakthroughs."
"It certainly delivered on this."
"As Commissioner Mandelson pointed out, the round was not a failure, but it was hardly a success either."
"A lack of democracy pervaded the talks, as they took place behind the closed doors of ‘green rooms’, and the opportunity to lift millions out of poverty simply did not materialise."
"In saying that, I do not wish to take anything away from the very close working relationship that the European Parliament had with the Commission throughout."
"Despite the world’s poorest countries joining hands to make the Doha Round a development reality, they were put in the impossible position either of accepting a text which left much to be desired, or of being on the receiving end of the finger-pointing blame game which plagued progress."
"In the space of a few hours on the penultimate day of talks, there was a sudden shift on two problems on which there had seemed to be permanent stalemate."
"The EU had a budget plan until 2013 and the WTO concluded the Hong Kong declaration."
"They were linked, of course, and everyone here knows how difficult it was for some to give up 3.5% of the EU’s overall agricultural support."
"However, one giant leap for the EU does not make one small step for the WTO."
"Whilst exalting the successful moves on agriculture we must not overlook the fact that much will be cancelled out by an undermining of the right of developing countries to protect their basic services and emerging industries."
"The elimination of trade-distorting agricultural export subsidies in 2013 is three years later than hoped for, and amounts to a symbolic gesture to the world’s poorest farmers."
"Until the dumping of all subsidised crops and products onto their markets is ended, they will continue to face an uphill struggle to lift themselves out of crippling poverty."
"Last week Gordon Brown admitted that the UK had failed to maximise on its twin presidencies of the EU and G8 to complete its ambitious development agenda."
"He proposed a five point plan to reverse that failure and a push by world leaders to restart and complete the trade talks."
"And push we must."
"We can do good."
"On cotton, we agreed to eliminate all forms of export subsidies in 2006."
"We ensured food aid could no longer be used as a system to mask continuing export subsidies, and the EU’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative was supported by all."
"Commissioner Mandelson, you said that we were to create a stage."
"We should now use that stage as a springboard."
"Now is the time to be ambitious again."
"Let the EU lead and hope others follow."
". Mr President, Commissioner, we already knew that there were not really any good intentions behind the trade negotiations, but it must be acknowledged that being at the Hong Kong Conference meant sitting in on a summit characterised by hypocrisy!"
"I say this because, to be perfectly frank, the developing countries were totally cheated: practically no progress at all with regard to cotton, a sugar and banana reform that continues to be extremely problematic and catastrophic – particularly for the ACP States – and access to the market for LDCs, which, despite everything, is still not completely unrestricted and which has been delayed."
"The only compensation for all that comes in the form of very strong pressure aimed at liberalising services and manufactured products, something that jeopardises extremely weak economies."
"With regard to agriculture, therefore, one might say that, despite an apparent clash between the European Union and the United States, the policy carried out by both blocs has practically been the same, that is to say the ongoing protection of a type of agriculture. This clearly shows that the ‘lowest price’ policy does not work and that it is not viable in the long run."
"Little or no consideration has been given to social and environmental rules, to small-scale farming, to the peasant farmers of the South who are very threatened by the agreements, to the small farmers of the North or to the interests of small and medium-sized farms."
"We were therefore expecting the European Union to show a real, coherent interest in the poorest countries."
"We were expecting it to promote sustainable development and the harmonisation of trade rules with social and environmental rules."
"We did not see any of that happen and we are all the more disappointed as a result."
"What next, then, for the negotiations?"
"We are very anxious about the new approach that seems to owe more to ‘top-down’ than to so-called ‘bottom up’ thinking and that marks a retreat to small group negotiations, which are less transparent and less democratic."
"We are particularly anxious about this matter at a time when many of our fellow citizens are deeply concerned about, and doubt, the European Union’s ability to control economic globalisation, given the way in which it is being managed at the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this was supposed to be called the development round, but frankly I think we can sum it up like this: the winner is the self-interest of the Northern countries of the world."
"The interests of US and European multinationals – effectively sponsored and represented by the work of the European Commission – have won yet again."
"How can one talk about demolishing protectionism or defending the free market when every one of the 25 000 cotton growers in the United States receives an average of USD 114 000 a year in subsidies?"
"That results in a 15% cut in the price of cotton on the world market."
"The 20 million African growers are thus reduced to hunger: they include the peasants of Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger, all countries ranked at the bottom of the UN Human Development Index."
"How can one talk about development policy, when a policy based on the dumping of agricultural produce has been extended until 2013?"
"The result of that is further destruction of the economies of developing countries, and we must not forget that 70% of the world’s population lives off the land."
"The European Union and the United States blamed each other, but in practice neither one is prepared to cut agricultural export subsidies on cotton straight away."
"That means continuing to create a monopoly system dominated by the agribusiness multinationals."
"We did not hear a single word about the need to include social clauses and to respect them: there was absolute silence on that topic."
"Not only that, but the developing countries have been forced to open their markets to industrial goods from the North, as they must cut their customs duties substantially."
"The result of that is unequal competition, which will further destroy what little industry has so far developed in Africa and the poorer regions of Asia."
"To the unthinking public, 97% may sound a lot."
"We know, however, that the problem will be the 3% of products that will not be allowed to freely access Northern hemisphere markets."
"In addition, the development aid promised has not been confirmed in precise figures, and it has not even been specified whether it will consist of actual aid or loans: it is pure window dressing that is being exposed for the sham that it really is."
"The services market is being opened up: education and social and health services will increasingly become less of a right and more of a commodity available only to those who can afford it."
"There is also the risk that even water may be included on this market as a commodity, one that in the near future will rival oil on the market."
"That is not to mention the situation of access to medicines, which are in practice denied to the 30 million people with HIV in Africa."
"I should like to know how one can talk of a development round when faced with such a reality."
". Mr President, whilst the sixth ministerial WTO Conference may not have been a failure, the very modest progress made in Hong Kong does make 2006 a particularly difficult year for negotiations."
"I should like to ask the Commission how it thinks it can galvanise the other partners into action."
"The G20’s salami tactics, which Commissioner Mandelson criticises, have eventually resulted in the European Union ending up virtually empty-handed in terms of industrial products and services after all, while more than enough time was taken to thrash out an agreement to end the export subsidies in 2013."
"The Commission should therefore pull out all the stops in order to hold onto the momentum of Hong Kong in 2006, so that an acceptable agreement can be reached in the area of industry and the services sector too."
"I should also like to ask the Commission what efforts it intends to make in order to give what are termed non-trade issues a more prominent place on the agenda."
". Mr President, as one of the 26 MEPs who attended the world trade talks I would agree with the Commissioner that there was some success – it was not a complete failure."
"But I must say from my understanding of what happened in Hong Kong that enormous pressure was exerted on the European model of agriculture at those talks, all in the name of helping developing countries."
"As I said in Hong Kong and as I said in this House previously, my stance has been that this is a false impression."
"A false impression is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to the EU markets."
"Nothing could be further from the truth, indeed the least developed countries have very little to gain from such a gesture."
"The real winners would be the beef barons of South America, if we were to allow the European farmers to be sold out."
"In the streets of Hong Kong we saw Korean farmers fighting for their livelihoods, small Korean farmers threatened by transnational grain corporations which are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries."
"In Europe we cannot allow our food supply to be outsourced."
"Treating agriculture and food as ordinary products on a production line threatens our very food security."
"It is clear that the WTO talks cannot succeed as long as it insists on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihood of our small and medium farmers, because they are the ones at risk, not the agricultural exports, Commissioner."
"Perhaps it is time to exclude agriculture altogether from the WTO because, as you said yourself, it amounts to only 5% of world trade."
"Why should 5% prevent the 95% progress that could be made?"
"This should be rethought in the interests of the overall talks, because I believe agriculture will always be a problem."
"Mr President, Mr Mandelson, five lessons have been learnt from the Hong Kong Summit."
"Firstly, there is a flaw in our negotiating method."
"One year prior to the Summit, we make agricultural concessions by revising the CAP."
"The outcome: when you arrive at the negotiating table, whatever talent you may have – and it is immense – you no longer have room for manœuvre, unless you cross the red line on agriculture."
"Secondly, Hong Kong validates Seattle and Cancun."
"Despite the fact that agriculture only amounts to 5% of world trade in goods and services, it is undoubtedly the Ricardian comparative advantage of Europe, or why else would it be at the centre of the war that, for example, Brazil wages on us at every summit?"
"Thirdly, developing countries such as Mexico criticise the ostensibly generous reduction in customs duties aimed at promoting market access because these countries have understood all too well that the customs ‘gift’ is not intended for the poor, but for companies from the North manufacturing their products among the poor, for example in Bangladesh or Vietnam."
"Fourthly, this reduction in customs duties, while a nice gesture in political terms, is difficult to manage technically. Proof of this is the fact that, after 20 years of mathematical formulas – Swiss formula or otherwise - the Hong Kong declaration is unable to find a solution."
"This amounts to saying – and this is my fifth and final point – that the road to a reduction in customs duties is a dead end that should be consigned to the past."
"The modern solution consists of deductible customs duties in the form of customs credits or drawing rights provided by the importing State to the exporting State, credit equal to the total amounts of the customs duties levied on the exporter’s goods."
"Mr Mandelson, if you were to achieve that, you would be Harry Potter, you would have succeeded in marrying together the theories of both Ricardo and Frederick List, you would have resolved the problem of global economic imbalances and you would have protected the interests of the poor and those of the rich, free trade and our social model in one fell swoop."
"Mr President, before I thank Commissioner Mandelson and he falls off his chair at the thought of my thanking him, I should like to make a criticism of the way that Parliament was involved there."
"We had 26 MEPs, 10 support staff and a press officer."
"At no time did I meet the press officer; at no time did the press officer run anything for the PPE-DE Group – not that he was there to support our Group; he was there for the whole of Parliament."
"As the person who co-chaired the Interparliamentary Conference and got the agreement on that co-chairing, I was surprised that we had no press officer."
"Robert Portman asked why the European Parliament was there and what the Members were doing."
"Mrs Kinnock from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was there; there were Members from the Development Committee and the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, including me."
"I hope you will take that message back."
"Commissioner, I would first like to thank your staff: Mrs Nikolay was outstanding, as was Mr Trojan."
"You also were outstanding in the way you kept us informed and kept us up to date with the negotiations."
"You have asked specifically today for thoughts to take forward, so perhaps I can give you a couple of things to think about."
"I think you did a wonderful job, but could you explain why the EU is continually being blamed – particularly by the United States – for holding up the talks?"
"It seems to me that there are other arguments that should be put forward and yet we are not getting the message across."
"I have said that in the past and hope you can explain it."
"In the Interparliamentary Conference, we succeeded in getting geographical indications forward."
"You mentioned that and yet, as far as I know, it was never involved in the final discussions."
"It is very important to Europe and many other countries."
"I was disappointed by the polarised nature of the debate in Hong Kong."
"There were few attempts to bring those differing viewpoints together."
"As one of my colleagues said, there was a lot of finger-pointing and blaming of other people, which was counterproductive."
"Is the big ministerial ‘jamboree’ the best way to continue the negotiations?"
"Should we not look at a less circus-like approach?"
"Thank you for all the work you did, Commissioner, and may it continue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take as my starting point the point just made by Mr Sturdy."
"You, Commissioner, asked what you should do in terms of ongoing evaluation, and what we would like you to consider."
"Mr Sturdy is, I think, right; we certainly should give consideration in future to whether the single undertaking approach will always be the right one."
"Its continued use probably makes sense, but I strongly suspect that the future of the WTO will depend on other methods being found, on a more flexible outlook that will probably involve allowing issues to be negotiated in parallel and the use of a flexible and rolling work plan."
"How all that will fit into this round is something I leave to you and your wisdom."
"Following on from this is another consideration that you should bear in mind."
"This House has always maintained – indeed, I myself drafted a report on the subject some years ago – that we should take note of the bilateral rounds too."
"My own group consistently attaches a great deal of importance to the multilateral negotiating round and I am very much in favour of it, but it must nevertheless be clear to us that bilateral negotiations are of value too."
"Now for my question: while the old Commission always refused to enter into bilateral agreements with Asia, have you, Commissioner, come to see things differently?"
"Would you like to set other priorities for work in this area?"
"Thirdly, I have just returned from Mexico, where, I was surprised to learn, a high degree of importance is attached to the services sector and to investments in infrastructure, although I did get the impression that there was no very precise understanding of what the Commission would like to do and of what we would like to do in the multilateral rounds on services."
"Perhaps you could find something to say about that."
"My fourth point has to do with standards."
"I am firmly persuaded of the need for us to get back to discussing standards in the multilateral round more than anywhere else."
"The more participants, the more important that will become."
"The more problematic international competition becomes, the more pressing an issue this will be."
"What I would like to know is whether you are thinking in terms of a new initiative."
"Finally, framework programmes for research are under discussion, and many Members have raised one point that will become important where agriculture is concerned."
"Where do you stand on the question as to whether we should invest more in agricultural and structural research?"
"What line do you take on research into bioethanol?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process that started in Qatar was called a development round."
"The ministerial meeting in Hong Kong did not live up to the promise, and that is worrying because, if we do not succeed in lifting 2 billion human beings out of poverty and hunger, the world will march towards a series of uncontrollable political and social explosions with devastating effects."
"I realise that reaching a compromise was very difficult, but the goal of 2014 for eliminating subsidies is too far off."
"I am afraid that many things will happen between now and then."
"Perhaps Europe was not entirely to blame, but we were partly to blame – not Commissioner Mandelson, but Europe itself."
"It had been said that more needed to be done – and done better – to help and protect those who were unable to do so by themselves and who would be crushed by the market, as is actually happening."
"Credit is due to Commissioner Mandelson for having represented a Europe in Hong Kong that was less arrogant than the United States."
"It is the state of the West as a whole, however, that must force us to rethink the situation in a thoroughly new way if we do not want the round to collapse under the blows of growing worldwide disorder, which we are already witnessing."
"The meetings that we had in Hong Kong demonstrated three essential points: first, the need to reform the World Trade Organisation; secondly, the world order is changing and China is lying in wait for us; and, thirdly, a drastic change is needed in the concept of world trade that led to the creation of the WTO."
"Mr President, the Commissioner and the young team that he put together before the Hong Kong negotiations have failed to balance market access for agricultural products here in Europe against that for industrial products in the countries of the developing world."
"The countries of the developing world had good reason to reject your liberalising tendencies, and you were perhaps little more than ridiculous in the eyes of the global public when you then failed to put a long-overdue stop to export subsidies."
"We are offering the countries of the developing world a very great deal of market access; the only point at issue is what conditions we impose."
"What comes into play here is qualification, participation at our price level and to our standards, so that these countries’ economies can develop."
"Where the developing world’s access to the market in industrial products and services from our part of the world is concerned, it is vital that these countries’ development – in commerce, in infrastructure and services should not be wrecked or made impossible; instead that they should be enabled to qualify, in this area too, as service providers who will benefit these countries’ development."
"Then perhaps we can talk in terms of a development round."
"I hope that you will think these things through again and give priority to qualification when working through the next round."
"– Mr President, with a uniform strategy the European Union and the United States of America, despite their antagonisms, have used the sixth ministerial conference of the WTO to step up exploitation of the peoples and the plundering of the wealth-producing resources of developing countries."
"Both the results of and the complete lack of transparency in the WTO negotiations are dangerous for the peoples."
"The WTO is proving to be an imperial organisation which serves the interests of the multinational groups of big business."
"The agreement which came out of Hong Kong strikes a serious blow at basic axes of the economy and countries' independence and sovereign rights in general."
"The agreement on agricultural products will speed up procedures to wipe out small and medium-sized holdings and, at the same time, will strengthen the monopolies."
"The agreement on non-agricultural products constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to industrial development in developing countries."
"At the same time, by opening the markets to natural resources, the consequences will also be disastrous for the environment."
"The so-called liberalisation of services – the Bolkenstein directive – which is being promoted through the WTO, will open up Pandora's box and the way for the full commercialisation of commodities such as water, health, education, transport and information, in a bid to increase the profits of the monopolies."
"However, the situation is unacceptable and cynicism breaks every boundary in the production and supply of drugs."
"This is a crime against humanity, given that over 30 000 people die every day, as victims of the exorbitant products of the international pharmaceutical industry, because they do not have access to drugs to combat major epidemics."
"This proves that agreements through the World Trade Organisation are simply cowardly ..."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were expecting much more from the Hong Kong meeting, even though it had already been announced that it was going to be a talking shop."
"Beyond the good intentions on the need to ensure a multilateral trading system, too many issues remained unresolved."
"Among the many issues that deeply affect thousands of European companies and workers is the problem of the unfair competition waged by certain non-EU countries to Europe’s detriment."
"Such unfair competition, as in the case of China, consists of social and environmental dumping."
"In plain words, that means European markets are being flooded with very low-cost goods, which in fact cost a great deal in terms of human rights violations, worker exploitation and a lack of environmental protection."
"These are shoddily made goods, which literally plunder the intellectual property and technological skills of European companies with impunity."
"Bringing down trade barriers is a good thing – nobody denies that – but it must not become merely an opportunity to place counterfeit goods or goods made with slave labour or child labour onto our markets."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it is our duty to ensure that the WTO regulations include strict rules on safeguarding intellectual property and on protecting quality products by means of geographical indications of origin, and also clauses demanding protection for the environment and for workers’ rights."
"Mr President, Mr Mandelson, following the WTO Conference, you pronounced that the outcome needed to be a constructive compromise because most people are dissatisfied."
"That is a good point and, if it were a question of budget negotiations – a zero-sum game in which concessions in actual fact cost money – you would be right."
"In this case, the situation is precisely the other way around."
"In trade negotiations, just as much is gained from abolishing customs duties ourselves as from forcing others to do away with them. This is no zero-sum game."
"Even if the conference was not the disaster that many had feared, I think we must be honest and say that it was a failure."
"The problems were deferred to a future in which disaster will loom ever closer, and I even think that, for important parts of the industrial and services sectors, the conference made slight changes for the worse to the document."
"I detect two worrying reactions."
"Firstly, there is a noticeable sense of resignation where multilateral negotiations are concerned and a desire to pin one’s hopes on regional and bilateral agreements instead."
"That would be a big mistake."
"Such agreements would never produce results such as to enable world trade to be liberalised in significant areas, and opting for them would be an all too easy way of avoiding phasing out the protectionism that we ourselves practise."
"Secondly, I hear people adopting the attitude that ‘we did our bit in Hong Kong; it is other people’s fault if we are not making progress’."
"I think that that attitude is a recipe for failure."
"People should realise that progress in negotiations does not stem from the ability to point the finger at the protectionism practised by other people. That is like seeing the mote in one’s brother’s eye without noticing the beam in one’s own."
"Instead, progress is driven by an understanding of the costs of our own protectionism."
"For Europe, the conference in Hong Kong should be a call to wake up, and not only to the obvious fact that the protectionism we practise in agricultural matters is costing us the far more important matter of the liberalisation of trade in services and industrial goods."
"Above all, we must realise, together with the United States, Japan and others, that the costs imposed on our consumers and taxpayers by our protectionism in agricultural matters are reason enough for abolishing them."
"‘Free trade, one of the greatest blessings that a government can confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopular’, said Thomas Babington as long ago as 1824."
"The WTO conference in Hong Kong shows that that might equally well have been said today."
"We must all, as consumers and employees, pay the price for the lack of trade liberalisation around the world."
"Mr President, free access to the American and Japanese market for the least developed countries is a good thing, but this advantage has been considerably watered down by the possibility of many products being exempted."
"The same applies to a large number of sensitive products for which no progress has been made whatsoever, again, I believe, as a result of the EU’s own attitude."
"Countries that rely on cotton, bananas and sugar were also left behind, clearly disappointed."
"It is a very good thing, though, that a deadline for export subsidies has now been set for 2013."
"Although this deadline is, I believe, too late, it has been set all the same."
"I hope that the Commission will want to phase out those distorting export subsidies much sooner, and I am looking forward to a precise schedule."
"The EU has pledged EUR 1 billion of aid for trade measures by 2010."
"Can the Commission explain where I can find that amount reflected in the Council’s multi-annual budget?"
"The same applies, in fact, to the sum of 200 million intended for the countries depending on sugar production and the pledges made there."
"I think we are still writing cheques with nothing to back them up, and it is obvious that we are wholly opposed to the idea of the poor people of Latin America, Asia or Africa paying, as it were, for our solidarity."
"In order to turn this development round into a success, the European Union must show its teeth."
"Not by now insisting on the liberalisation of services with the G20 – all we need to do is to look in the European Union to see how difficult we are finding this – but by putting the labour standards at the top of the global agenda for the next round and by reforming our agriculture more quickly and more extensively during the current round."
"The Commissioner deserves much credit for having averted a failure."
"We will only be able to talk in terms of a success at the end of 2006, though, if this round has been actually completed and implemented in a fair manner."
"Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for what he has said, and also to start with a critical observation on our negotiating position as Europeans, for I do believe that we were too honest, in that our position fundamentally repudiated deviousness as part of the negotiating mandate."
"I think we need to reconsider this, since all the others used subterfuges."
"We did not, instead preferring to put our outcomes on the table very early on."
"On the credit side, I would like to point out that your negotiating style and the way in which you communicated information to this House helped reinforce our determination, and for that you have our warm thanks."
"That has of course enabled us to influence the budget deliberations in Brussels, and that I regarded as a very good thing."
"Where geographical designations of origin were concerned, we got nowhere."
"That is something you mentioned, and many speakers have also made it clear how important an issue this is for us."
"I have to tell the Commissioner that our geographical designations of origin and the intellectual property that is tied in with them are things for which we have to fight."
"In doing that, we will have to be cunning and maintain a united front."
"Mr President, the EU’s behaviour in Hong Kong was a disgrace."
"The world had hoped that the EU would show leadership, demonstrate its solidarity with the developing countries and make efforts to secure genuine free trade with full access to the industrialised countries’ markets, particularly for the poorest countries."
"The EU should have used its powerful position to develop the WTO into an efficient multilateral agreement system with clear social and environmental conditions for trade."
"From where I am standing, however, the EU behaved almost worse than the United States. It was self-centred, lacking in solidarity, full of tricks and guilty of patently abusing its power in seeking to force the developing countries to open their markets to our exports."
"There is no desire to do anything about our own exorbitant and destructive agricultural subsidies."
"The agreement on abolishing export subsidies involves too long a delay and is full of underhand provisos."
"The EU gets on its high horse over the United States’s cotton policy – and, indeed, has good reason for doing so – but it behaves in precisely the same way itself, for example when it comes to sugar."
"What should, moreover, have been a development package to set the Thames on fire, and one that would have really got things moving for the poor, has ended up as a piffling little matchbox."
"What a disappointment!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, both before the WTO conference in Hong Kong and during it, the Commission kept Parliament constantly informed as to the current state of the negotiations."
"That was very helpful, and for it I want to express my warm thanks."
"I would like to put the following questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, the Commission was equipped with good ideas, but its lack of any strategy for how to communicate and convince meant that the public perception of the EU was that it was almost always on the defensive."
"Other states were astute and adroit enough to depict the European Union as standing in the way of progress for its own selfish reasons."
"What improvements is the Commission planning to make to its communications strategy?"
"What, in practical terms, does it propose to do and when?"
"Secondly, the original objective of the Doha development round was to agree on an ambitious programme for the reform and liberalisation of trade policy, particularly for the benefit of developing countries."
"As we have seen, not least before, during and after Hong Kong, it is an unfortunate fact that more and more people associate the term ‘globalisation’ with danger rather than with opportunity."
"Here in Europe, we see a whole generation completing their school education without having learned the fundamentals of the social market economy and world trade, and that is why they are easy prey for campaigns of misinformation and untruths."
"We also see our media running reports on the relocation of jobs almost to the exclusion of anything else, and certainly not about the creation of new jobs or the additional prosperity that world trade brings."
"We can see people being made more and more insecure by this and by the campaigns run by radical groups with the intention of spreading fear and misinformation, and funded with European money."
"In the plenary sitting of 12 May, the Commission undertook to put forward a plan for a proactive campaign, to be run while the WTO negotiations were in progress, to persuade people of the benefits of world trade."
"No such plan has as yet seen the light of day."
"Is work being done on one, and when will it be produced?"
"Thirdly, is the Commission planning to classify China as a market economy, even though that is no more justified than it ever has been?"
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner."
"I should like to begin with a few positives."
"First of all – and I believe that no one has mentioned this – the fact that the final text tackles the US abuse of food aid and that the ‘safe box’ has been created is very important."
"Secondly, it is important that the text reins in the worst excesses of the ‘blue box’."
"The final text also contains quite hopeful language on the special products and on the special safeguard mechanisms."
"Those are positives."
"Aid for trade is also welcome, although I have reservations about the World Bank and the IMF being in charge of it, bearing in mind the emphasis on conditionalities for which they are so well known."
"Like my colleague Mr van den Berg, I am very keen to know where the EUR 1 billion promised by President Barroso at Gleneagles is going to come from."
"There are huge gaps in the budgetary promises that have been made."
"When I chaired a press conference of the ACP Group in Hong Kong I got a real sense of their feeling of frustration and betrayal."
"On sugar, bananas and cotton the WTO has done the ACP no favours."
"Mr Mandelson, these countries are our natural allies, but unless we really prove that we have in place a Doha development mandate, and that we are honouring that mandate, then I believe that in the months ahead we will not be able to rely on our ACP colleagues."
"Also, it is absolutely critical that we have new long-term substantial funding for the Sugar Protocol countries."
"Realistically, can we, in the short time available, make progress on ending dumping, on confirmation of the developing countries’ rights to protect their farms, their infant industries and services?"
"Will we put in place fair and equitable access for developing countries’ exports?"
"Those are essential."
"It is a formidable list."
"Can you do it by 30 April, Commissioner?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong addressed quite a number of important global trade-related issues; however, the results offer no reason for celebration."
"Only one report from the negotiation group on trade facilitation was approved by consensus, and there were virtually no results in the service sphere."
"Some difficult negotiations are awaiting the Commission this spring."
"In reality, the trade interests of the 149 developed and developing countries are very difficult to reconcile."
"The WTO, as an organisation with its own regulations and decision-making procedures has, in the last five years, failed to come to any decisions; we have to admit that the WTO is undergoing a crisis."
"Therefore, I invite the European Commission to initiate WTO reform: to modify regulations and decision-making, to add new dimensions to the regulations, for example social and environmental issues, and to promote fair trade competition among all WTO members, both developed and developing States."
"I would also like to add that trade must no longer be treated as independent and in isolation from production, labour safety and environmental concerns."
"Trade is only the outcome of economic activity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the debate practically everything has been said."
"Perhaps the most important and relevant thing, as the Commissioner has said, is that Parliament is fully involved in the negotiation being carried out by the Commission."
"With regard to the assessment of Hong Kong, we have heard everything; nobody is entirely satisfied."
"It is like the metaphor involving the glass: some see it as half full and others see it as half empty."
"Has it been a complete failure?"
"No."
"Has it been a complete success?"
"No."
"Perhaps the success is that it has not been a failure, which it appeared it might turn out to be initially."
"What role has the European Union played?"
"I believe that it is fair to acknowledge that the Commission and the Commissioner who has been in charge have played a very worthy role, and we should acknowledge this here. We should also acknowledge − I believe this is only right − that this Parliament has been kept fully informed by the Commission's services, which is a very important step in terms of the work to which the Commissioner has referred."
"Some people would have liked us to have given more ground on agriculture, but the European Union has clearly done it duty in this field with the reform of the CAP, as it has also done with the reform of fisheries by means of the CFP."
"There are other people who need to make progress in this field and, as other speakers have said, perhaps what has most grated in this House has been the United States’ hypocritical position with regard to the European Union in the field of agriculture and also on development issues."
"We have not made any progress on services, and others must be committed to opening up their markets to our large services companies: it is crucial for everybody."
"For them as well, since services affect all economic sectors and this is a crucial issue for the European Union."
"Talks and negotiations are continuing."
"They are complex. Skill, patience and plenty of will to hold dialogue and reach consensus are required."
"We want the Doha Round to be concluded to the benefit of everybody, everybody giving ground and reaching a satisfactory compromise with a view to freer and fairer trade, with multilateral and more transparent rules. In this regard, we would like to thank the Commissioner for remaining in contact with Parliament."
"As you have said, involving Parliament means involving the citizens."
"We represent the citizens and it is very useful that we are all in agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, despite the gloomy predictions, the Doha Round for Development and the WTO are still alive."
"Though we must now carry on working with a tight timetable."
"I am also grateful for the cooperation that we have maintained during this last Ministerial Conference and I believe that, as has been said, this House must remain closely involved in the whole negotiation process, including the General Council in Geneva on 30 April."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on the achievements on the elimination of export subsidies and similar measures."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, could you go into more depth on the commitments and the timetable agreed by our commercial partners with regard to export credits, food aid and State companies?"
"Since time is at a premium, has the Commission decided on any political initiative to encourage the main players, including the emerging economies, to respect their commitment successfully to conclude this development round this year?"
"Finally, how do you believe the agreements reached in Hong Kong will affect the negotiations of the desired agreement between the European Union and Mercosur?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to return to this complex matter. I am simply going to emphasise a few considerations in order to highlight our keen interest in having a European Union that is there to act as a political tool for debates on subjects such as international trade."
"I join others in thanking you, Commissioner, as well as Mrs Fischer-Boel and Mr Johnson from the European Council."
"With regard to the date scheduled for the end of export subsidies in 2013, I have proposed an independent audit of all the forms of aid supposedly aimed at making a distinction between, on the one hand, aspects that are related to humanitarian issues and that must come under the public spotlight and, on the other hand, aspects that distort the rules of competition in international trade and that must be eliminated if the prevailing hypocrisy on this matter is to be dispensed with."
"I should like to draw your attention to five points."
"Firstly, in a complex world, it is vital that nations have a space worldwide for multilateral dialogue so they can discuss international trade issues."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the parliaments, which are the elected representatives of their nations, were not as fully involved in the negotiations as the non-governmental organisations were."
"The Member States need to understand that it is no longer possible to call on parliaments to vote in favour of funding international trade agreements and so to ratify them, without involving MEPs in the negotiations."
"Next, it is imperative that we protect access to our agricultural markets in the period of uncertainty just beginning."
"We will need to be ready to fight with regard to the dossier on geographical origins, which is a battle far from being won."
"Fourthly, a significant, forward-looking project needs to be developed, Commissioner, with a view to carrying out a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the economic and social impacts on Europe of all these negotiations. One such example is the impact on employment."
"In this regard, we could usefully draw on the work done by the European Economic and Social Committee within the Single Market Observatory."
"Finally, it is vital for the economies - particularly the Western economies - which create their wealth through the use of market principles, to help implement real mechanisms aimed at eradicating poverty in the world."
"If we, as democrats, do not do so, then we will pay a very high price in political terms, not least through the rise in extremism."
"Mr President, Hong Kong achieved its reduced ambition of outlining a roadmap, and what that shows is that the road ahead is rocky and will require most of its leading drivers to make some sharp twists and turns."
"What we have is a development package which is not generous enough, a date for ending export subsidies which is not soon enough, proposals on GATS which are not flexible enough, and a NAMA formula which is not fair enough, as well as an acknowledgement of the need for special and differential treatment which is not yet clear enough."
"So we made progress in Hong Kong, but a lot remains to be done and the Commissioner will be well aware of the expression: ‘a lot done, a lot to be done’."
"I believe that most of the blame for what still needs to be done does not lie with the European Union; it lies with our leading partners."
"I would like to add my thanks to the Commissioner and his staff, and to the Council under the British Presidency, which made great efforts to push many of these items along."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I doubt very much whether we could we have expected more from the WTO Summit in Hong Kong."
"Why would countries commit themselves at this stage if the final result has not been scheduled until the end of this year?"
"It stands to reason that more time has been taken out to strike the best balance between aid to poor countries and attention to the economic strength of our own."
"I think that the participants are motivated to reach new trade agreements."
"Good agreements are needed to prevent trade becoming a Wild West story."
"Law and order in trade is in everybody’s interests."
"I am also confident that eventually, the idea of improving the position of the poor countries will enjoy wide support."
"As such, I see the outcome as a promising intermediate step."
"A great deal needs to be done, though, before we can call this a real development round."
"I am pleased with the commitment to abolish the export subsidies in agriculture, including the indirect ones."
"I also welcome the initiatives, such as Everything But Arms from other countries, which must also apply to more of their products, and also all LDCs."
"I would also include the effect of a special and differential treatment, as well as capacity building."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner shares my view that this round should be a development round, and I should like to congratulate him on his energy and commitment."
"I think that he is negotiating from a particularly difficult position, because his mandate is known to the public beforehand and is the result of a public decision-making process in the Union."
"It is a good thing that the Member States have consistently presented a united front, and perhaps unfortunate that the European strategy, more than that of other negotiators, has been under attack, sometimes even from European quarters."
"Might that be the reason why the European Union was often dealt the bad card, even if it is much stronger and does much more than other countries?"
"In order to prevent the negotiations in Geneva from going without public support, I would ask the Commissioner to apply the same level of commitment when entering further into the negotiations and continuing to inform the EP about the state of affairs and about the strategy, with a view to making the necessary progress, even in important areas such as counterfeiting and services."
"Indeed, much needs to be done in those areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Hong Kong round is over, and where does the WTO go now?"
"While it is indeed the case that nothing concrete has been achieved, it has to be said that the lines of communication are not down, and that, under these circumstances, I regard as psychologically very important."
"The points I would like to make today have more to do with the general situation."
"For a start, Commissioner, you have made very good use of the negotiating mandate that you were given."
"There was general praise for the way in which the EU, for once, achieved something by acting absolutely as one, even though we were to some extent forced into a corner."
"More is, however, expected of us than of the other industrial states."
"Secondly, you collaborated extremely well with this House, seeing it almost as a matter of obligation to inform us, whether in person or through others."
"There is always room for improvement in anything, but we really did get very extensive information and involving us in the work going on was done very well."
"The question is, though, whether that is enough, and how things can be done in the future."
"I believe that Parliament’s rights in foreign trade matters need to be reinforced as a matter of urgency, and that this is a quite separate matter from the constitutional treaty."
"As globalisation goes further and deeper, the policy areas associated with external trade become ever more important."
"When a policy area becomes important to the public, the public’s elected representatives need to be able to have their say about it, and that is why we need to be able to have more influence over the Commission and be able to monitor it more closely."
"In saying this, I am looking into the future rather than criticising the work they are doing now."
"Mr President, I note that in his opening remarks, replying to Mr Barón Crespo’s oral question, the Commissioner asked for Parliament’s suggestions about future activity and future developments."
"My understanding is – and this is an issue which has not so far been raised in this debate – that both Ukraine and Russia are candidate members of the WTO."
"Does the Commissioner have in mind a timetable whereby accession of these two very important economies might be envisaged, and what might be some of the steps necessary before membership were to be achieved?"
"I have in mind one area which I understand is not subject to WTO discussions: energy."
"Parliament will be debating that later this week."
"But equally, agricultural products from a Member State, Poland, were blocked by Russia for reasons which many would find it difficult to understand."
"Presumably, Commissioner, you would be very supportive of the notion that common rules should be observed and respected by all Members, whether or not their form and understanding of democracy and respect for international commercial law happened to coincide identically with our own."
"This is an important point."
"We have dwelt, so far, on development relations between what used to be described as the First and Third Worlds."
"The Second World, as I understand it, was the then-Communist dictatorship bloc."
"How do you see our relations improving in that direction?"
". Mr President, in response to the last question – which bears almost no relation whatsoever to the subject matter of this debate – let me say that the honourable Member makes a rather good case for Russia and Ukraine being brought into the WTO, because they would be subject to international rules and to the dispute settlement machinery of the WTO."
"However, for them to enjoy that privilege, they have to accept certain undertakings unambiguously beforehand, and that remains the subject of continuing discussion between us."
"I will try and be brief, but a very large number of points and issues have been raised in this debate."
"I cannot do them all justice."
"I welcome the ideas that have been put forward by Members. I hear the criticisms that have been expressed about what we have done and needless to say I am grateful for the praise and compliments, but I am only too well aware that praise comes to a negotiator when he does not do anything wrong."
"The test for the negotiator is for him to do something right."
"That is harder, and that is the challenge held out before me in the coming months."
"I am in complete agreement with the Member who said that we need to strengthen the rights of the European Parliament in relation to trade – I have always said that – and, in the spirit of the times, given that our relationship is going so swimmingly, I cannot think of anything I would rather have than a strengthened relationship between us."
"A word to those who have expressed concern about the international criticism that has been directed at the European Union."
"It is criticism up to a point, but a better word for it is propaganda."
"All is fair in love and war in international trade negotiations, and we have to understand that where our negotiating partners arrive at a convergence of interests, notably in respect of agriculture, you will find a cacophony of voices directed against us, all of which have one goal in mind, which is to place pressure on the unity of the 25 Member States: to seek to divide the 25 and as a result, find advantage for themselves in the negotiations."
"That is why the unity that we found in Hong Kong is so important."
"It is not just a question of giving ourselves the comfort of solidarity amongst ourselves; unity of argument and message is the best riposte to the propaganda that will be aimed against us."
"As it happens, my judgement is that whilst the propaganda will not fall away and its decibel count will not go down, whilst those critical voices will maintain their shrillness in years to come, they are becoming less convincing and finding a weaker reception amongst many of the international commentariat who follow these negotiations in detail."
"I have found, since Hong Kong, a rather more balanced and nuanced appreciation of the content of these negotiations than I found on previous occasions."
"But we do not just have to find responses to people’s criticisms and propaganda, as a number of Members have quite rightly argued; we also have to reach out and find allies."
"We are not going to complete this round unless we are able to find some accommodation between ourselves and the interests and negotiating objectives of the G20 group of emerging economies."
"They are not homogeneous, but they have an effective discipline which I welcome."
"We would not be able to negotiate as we are; we would not have the prospect of finding a satisfactory outcome if we did not have those G20 countries, the emerging economies organised as they are and brought together as coherently as they are, in these negotiations."
"I think therefore that post-Cancún, yes, it gives us a lot of grief sometimes in the European Union to find our negotiating partners so well organised, but on the other hand the opposite of organisation is chaos and chaos is the enemy of a successful trade round."
"However, just as I welcome our negotiating partners in the G20, I think those Members who have pointed out tonight that we need to cement our coalition of interests and our relationship with the ACP countries are also correct."
"One thing I have learned and that has been borne in on me since I took up this post – something that some Members might bear in mind, given some of the contributions that have been made this evening – is that when you appeal to, or respond to, or try to accommodate the interests of certain developing countries, more often than not you will find yourself taking away from, or denying opportunities to, or dissatisfying, other developing countries."
"And so it is the case that when we are criticised, as the Commission has been on one or two occasions this evening, for not taking agricultural reform fast enough or far enough for the interests and benefit of certain rather more competitive developing countries, we have to understand that during the course of that reform, the further it goes or the faster it goes, the more pain we will be causing other developing countries to experience."
"So when I travel around, whether it be in Africa or the Caribbean, the street demonstrations that I face are not amongst the poor and exploited of the world who want us to go further in agricultural reform; in my experience of street demonstrations it has been people from some very poor, needy and deprived developing countries who are asking us to go slower in our agricultural reform, not faster."
"To an extent this is a question of compensating developing countries for the adjustment that is necessitated by that agricultural reform."
"Mrs Kinnock has quite rightly highlighted the issue of sugar."
"The Commission’s approach – and I say this on behalf of Mrs Fischer Boel as well as myself – is clear."
"We proposed EUR 190 million per year for each year between 2007 and 2013 for our proposed sugar action plan agreed with ACP countries."
"But the compromise that was found on the budget means a 20% reduction of the money that we thought we would have available for that action plan under the relevant heading."
"That is an unattractive prospect, if we are going to have, through budgetary constraints, to retreat from the original ambition of the plan that we set forward."
"Tonight I invite the European Parliament to help the Commission ensure that there is enough money to make that action plan a reality and to make sure that it genuinely meets the needs of those sugar-dependent ACP countries with whom we have had such an important historical relationship – a relationship we want to carry over as meaningfully to the future – and to help us ensure that that budgetary allocation is sustained."
"I will certainly be pushing to maintain the original EUR 190 million, but we in the Commission are not the budgetary authority; you and the Council are."
"Therefore I appeal to you to exert your best efforts to bring this about."
"I should like to mention another issue that constantly arises – quite rightly – in these negotiations, concerning investment in services and a service-based infrastructure of developing countries."
"Liberalisation in services is as important a part of the inbuilt agenda of this round as agriculture."
"I want to stress that our purpose in these negotiations is to boost commerce, because trade drives inter-economic growth."
"But boosting commerce, to my mind, is not the same as commercialising what other countries and governments legitimately want to keep within the public realm."
"That is their choice."
"That is the policy space to which they are entitled."
"No part of this negotiation concerning the liberalisation of services seeks to erode, let alone remove, the right to regulate public services."
"Take the example of water, as one Member already mentioned: where are developing countries going to get the capital investment, the transfer of technology, the transfer of management skills to operate the most efficient water industry in their countries that they can possibly get, to bring about the distribution that they so desperately need, if it is without foreign investment, foreign know-how and foreign transfer of technology?"
"We must keep a sense of perspective about this whilst recognising and safeguarding developing countries’ rights to regulation."
"With regard to agriculture – and incidentally, there is no question of excluding agriculture from these negotiations; anyone who ever dreamed that might be either desirable or possible has long since seen that dream disappear, never to return – we have an obligation to liberalise trade in agriculture, but we have to do it in a way and at a pace that are manageable and absorbable by European farm communities and that strike the right balance between the interests of different sorts of developing country; and, as I say, they are not the same."
"However, as European agriculture changes and evolves, the importance of specialised production and products and of those products associated with geographical indications becomes ever greater."
"That is why the protection of GIs remains not only an important but also an indispensable condition for our completion of this round."
"I say this not only to Mrs Mann but also to others."
"This is a single undertaking and that means that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
"In my view that is very important."
"It is a necessary protection that each WTO member has to ensure that their vital interests are not shunned or overlooked."
"If there were no single undertaking, no principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then we would be much weakened and not only us but also other WTO members would be less able to protect their vital interests."
"In my view GIs are of vital interest."
"In conclusion – and I am very much aware that I have not responded to many of the points made or taken up a number of the points – NAMA is an important issue;"
"I shall address these other issues in remarks I shall be making in a week’s time – let me just say that these multilateral trade talks are very important."
"Why?"
"Because multilateralism is important."
"Multilateral processes and institutions are important."
"Yes, the European Union pay extra into this round and into this system in order to keep alive, to strengthen and to carry forward the multilateral values and principles that are at the heart of this round."
"We will not pay indefinitely and we are not a bottomless pit, but it is true that we are prepared to pay for our principles, not only for the sake of our principles, but also because in a multilateral trade round the potential benefits for the global economy and for us in Europe and for the poor and needy people around the world are multiplied to a far greater extent through a multilateralisation of the agreement that we reach than any set of bilateral agreements between ourselves and other countries or regions could possibly achieve."
"I am not ignoring the bilateral agenda."
"Indeed, we have negotiations, whether it be ongoing, in the case of the Gulf States; ASEAN, potentially, when we have our roadmap put in place; and Mercosur."
"Incidentally, we need to consider what we are going to keep back from this multilateral agreement for our bilateral Mercosur negotiation."
"First and foremost we must make the multilateral talks successful."
"It will be a huge challenge in the coming months to achieve that, the way in which we can strengthen international trade rules to drive up standards of trade and social and labour rights, and trade in environment as well."
"There is a very great deal to achieve in a relatively short space of time."
"If in the coming months I can get as much negotiation in as Mrs Kinnock did in her one-and-a-half minutes, I will be travelling at a reasonable rate."
"It is a wee bit challenging for me to do that."
"However, given the number of things you have mentioned and registered, which we will carry on in our discussion tomorrow morning, if I can match a part of the same rate of progress I will not be doing badly."
"I must close this very long debate."
"We are out of time."
"The normal working time for the interpreters is until 10 p.m."
"We still have another debate, so we must move on."
"The debate is closed."
"– It comes as no surprise that Mr Mandelson says he feels that the ‘developing countries’ are not convinced that opening up the markets is a good thing for everyone."
"Let us remind ourselves of the true face of the liberalisation of world trade by the major economic and financial powers: every three seconds a child dies of avoidable causes; hundreds and hundreds of millions of people live in poverty, whilst wealth is concentrated at the cost of the exploitation of workers and of the resources that belong to the whole human race; in the past two decades, levels of inequality rose in 53 out of a group of 73 countries."
"As far as Mr Mandelson is concerned, the rise from 55% to 60% in the WTO negotiations, which was described by the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Pascal Lamy, as a ‘resounding success’, rescued the summit from failure."
"The most important thing, they say, is that the negotiations are not ‘derailed’ and that more are scheduled."
"We therefore continue our fight for food sovereignty and safety, for the right of each individual country to develop its economic potential in order to satisfy the need and aspirations of its people, for public services, for labour rights, against water privatisation, and against the patenting of life."
"The next item is the Commission statement on climate change."
". Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to debate with you the results of the successful conference on climate change held in Montreal in December."
"In Montreal, apart from the 11th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we also had the first meeting of the parties which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol."
"I was particularly delighted by the presence and positive action of the ten Members of the European Parliament at the Montreal conference."
"It underlines the importance which both our institutions ascribe to meeting the challenge of climate change and to the role of the multilateral procedure in the course of doing so."
"Our constant contacts and cooperation in Montreal bore fruit."
"It is therefore important that we also continue this practice at future conferences."
"The outcome of the Montreal conference is an important milestone for multilateral negotiations on climate."
"The Kyoto Protocol has now been put into full operation, while the agreement on the Montreal action plan paves the way for discussion of future international cooperation on climate change issues."
"This will safeguard, among other things, greater security for the European carbon dioxide emissions market and for the private sector."
"The enumeration of the political achievements at Montreal is truly impressive."
"Firstly, we agreed to launch two official dialogues on the subject of the future regime for addressing climate change."
"All the parties which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including the United States and Australia and, of course, all the major developing countries, are included in the Convention dialogue."
"A thorough, forward-looking dialogue will be held on the basis of the Convention, in the form of four workshops to be held over the next two years."
"The results of the dialogue will be presented at the Conference of Parties in 2007."
"The Kyoto dialogue will be used to discuss further emission reductions by developing countries on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol for the period after 2012."
"A special ad hoc United Nations working group has been set up within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol."
"This party will complete its work as quickly as possible and in time to ensure that there is no gap between the first and second Kyoto commitment period."
"Secondly, all the necessary decisions were taken in Montreal for the full functioning of the Kyoto Protocol as follows: the operating rules of the Kyoto Protocol, known as the Marrakech Accords, were approved in their entirety."
"The compliance decision makes the Kyoto Protocol binding for all parties and makes provision for a Compliance Committee to be set up."
"The five-year adaptation work programme contains a full set of activities, including work designed to further enhance our knowledge of the impacts of and the problems caused by climate change."
"It also includes specific tasks to design adaptation and the application of adaptation measures."
"The Adaptation Fund will finance adaptation activities."
"Its funds will come from contributions to the Clean Development Mechanism which will probably start to be paid in 2008."
"Thirdly, the Montreal Conference went further, making the Kyoto Protocol a stronger and more effective system."
"The Clean Development Mechanism was strengthened."
"The executive and supervisory role of the CDM Executive Board was made more transparent and stronger."
"The secretariat will hire more staff, in order to improve the services which it provides to the Executive Board and its committees."
"The parties also pledged a sum of money to the operation of the Clean Development Mechanism."
"Most of this money will constitute the contribution by the European Union."
"The joint implementation bodies were also set up."
"The preparatory work carried out on the Clean Development Mechanism can also be used for the approval of the joint implementation tasks."
"This means that it is possible to speed up the approval of the joint implementation tasks for which plans have already been drawn up."
"The European Union also pledged a sum of money in order to strengthen the committee supervising the joint implementation mechanism."
"Finally, the European Union used the Montreal Conference to demonstrate its significant progress in the application of the Kyoto Protocol."
"The numerous positive reactions which I received reinforce my conviction that the response of the European Union to the climate challenge may not only also be the most effective from the economic point of view, but may also offer a competitive edge to European businesses."
"The acute interest in the emission rights trading system which we have introduced makes it clear that we are an example worth following."
"The European Union has acquired a leading position internationally in combating climate change."
"It continued to support the Kyoto Protocol when serious doubts overshadowed the beginning of its entry into force."
"Nonetheless, we must always be conscious of the fact that greater efforts are needed within the Union."
"Most of the Member States need to apply additional measures in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives."
"New joint measures will also be needed at European Union level."
"The current second stage of the European programme on climate change will help to determine the optimum measures."
"I should also like to touch on the question of dialogue within the European Union on climate change."
"I believe that the agreement to launch an international dialogue achieved in Montreal is an important stimulus for the European Union."
"The strategy of the European Union seeking to supplement the process at the United Nations with bilateral commitments and to focus on confidence building and on including the views of the other parties has proven to be successful."
"The Montreal conference ratified this approach."
"The European Union now needs to cooperate with all sides, especially those with a large share of emissions, such as the United States, and the countries with emerging economies, in a constructive dialogue on broadening participation in the future international regime in the climate change sector."
"I consider that Montreal marked a new phase in international cooperation to combat climate change."
"The period of inquiry is over."
"We now have an international system with all the necessary mechanisms."
"Consequently, our efforts are focusing on consolidating it and on safeguarding its functioning."
"However, we cannot rest on our laurels."
"Climate change requires urgent action and concerns us all."
"Drastic cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases will be needed if we are to stabilise and then reduce concentrations of these gases in our planet's atmosphere."
"That is why, this year, in the second phase of the European programme on climate change, we shall discuss new initiatives in a bid to strengthen our climate policy."
"This second European programme on climate change will include an extensive review of the policies of the first stage in the climate sector, which includes the European Union emission rights trading system, action on capturing and storing carbon dioxide, air and other forms of transport and other issues."
"On the basis of this review, I shall propose new initiatives to strengthen our climate policy, depending on the results of this process of consultation with the interested parties."
"I know that I can count on support in this task from the European Parliament."
". Mr President, despite the absence of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is to be hoped that we will, tomorrow, be united in confirming that Parliament will take climate change and a future climate policy seriously."
"The resolution that is before us tomorrow gives a good and complete overview of the results and expectations of the climate conference held in Montreal last December."
"Let me start, though, with heartfelt congratulations for the whole EU delegation that took part in that conference."
"Both the British Presidency and the Commission were instrumental in bringing about the positive outcome in Montreal."
"As parliamentary delegation, we too tried very hard to do our bit."
"I think that the unison we displayed was a decisive factor in Montreal."
"The conference was a success and the climate resolution reflects our appreciation for starting the dialogue about future climate policy."
"The resolution looks ahead to the second period of commitment after 2012 and also welcomes the United States on board, even though we remain critical about the lack of commitment on the part of the Bush administration."
"Innovation is needed to combat climate change. The directive on tradable emission rights is an important indicator of the EU’s commitment and still deserves our full support."
"Montreal is good news, but we have also witnessed some bad news in recent weeks, such as the impact of a hitch in the energy supply, or the gas crisis, between Ukraine and Russia."
"A conflict such as this very aptly illustrates the desperation and dependence in which the EU does not want to find itself, and proves once more that the European Union must build in a guarantee of secure energy supply."
"The European Union can only attain this energy certainty by means of ambitious policy, common sustainable energy policy based on energy certainty, diversification and energy savings."
"This policy has a chance of success, though, only if huge forward strides are made on all fronts."
"Commitment to environmental technology is now more than ever necessary, as are serious efforts with a view to the involvement of developing countries."
"Only ambitious policy can ensure that the EU can shake off this unfavourable position of dependence and that global warming remains restricted to two degrees."
"We have tabled three amendments on environmental technology, the energy crisis and the developing world, and we would ask you to support them."
". Mr President, I have served in national parliaments where debates were timetabled to a second and the inability of this Parliament to get its act together means I have to apologise to the Commissioner because I will have to leave before hearing his concluding remarks."
"today reported scientist James Lovelock saying that, frankly, it is too late already."
"The multiplier effect is going to mean that the pace of climate change is going to accelerate and there is little we can do."
"When you read the European Environment Agency reports that glaciers in Switzerland retreated by 10% in one year alone, in 2003, you think that maybe he has a point, that we are just not realising what is happening."
"Here we are in this fantastic palace of energy use, debating what might be the end of civilisation."
"Montreal was a success, but only in relative terms."
"I am very conscious of the heavy burden you bear, Commissioner."
"I cannot think of a single person on this planet who has more direct responsibility for coming up with solutions to try and take the world forward, to try and take the economic block and therefore the world with it."
"You are hemmed in by ridiculous policies – we are still subsidising coal production – and economic priorities come to the fore, as they must, but sometimes to the detriment of the attempts we are all making to try and deal with these problems."
"So, I urge you, be bold and be ambitious."
"Let us not pretend that the Emissions Trading Scheme is somehow going to curb aviation emissions to a great extent."
"We need more measures; we need aviation fuel tax."
"If we are to deal with car manufacturers, we have got to set mandatory limits on CO2 limits; we have to have smaller cars."
"It is ridiculous: we are losing the world for the sake of people wanting to drive around in giants."
"I urge you, Commissioner, take the lead."
"Governments will always complain and criticise you, but they need you."
"They will scale back your ambitions, but unless you aim high, you are bound to achieve low."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is little time for this debate and so also to prevent climate change."
"Researchers are extremely worried about the rate at which climate change is progressing; they are worried about what sort of world their children, our children, will be living in."
"They say that the human race has 10 years at most to bring emissions right down: or, as Chris Davies said, perhaps it is already too late."
"At Montreal it was merely agreed that talks on future reductions would be started."
"We all know that the United States of America is the troublemaker where protection of the climate is concerned."
"The EU now has a major responsibility; our role as leaders must therefore be made clearer."
"At the next conference on climate the presidency of the EU will be held by Finland, which took an extremely vague line at Montreal."
"Now we need to pull our socks up."
"Finland and Austria should work with the Commission to draft a clear EU proposal to other countries."
"We need a programme for the EU’s own emissions reductions for the period 2020-2050."
"Businesses also need one."
"For them to invest wisely, they need to be able to calculate the value of their investments and the price of their emissions in the years to come."
"Mr President, in my view, far more attention should be paid to promoting public transport; one alternative, as someone has already suggested, would be an ecotax on the airline industry."
"Why do airline tickets have to be so cheap?"
"Since flying is in any case generally not an option for people on average incomes, a hefty tax surplus would be a quite appropriate way of benefiting the climate."
"In addition, I think it is a real disgrace that the nuclear energy lobby is constantly misusing the problem of climate change in order to get itself back on the map."
"Where climate change is concerned, attention should first and foremost be paid to really sustainable alternatives."
"Whilst the conference in Montreal was a minor success, it was not enough – not by a long shot in my view."
"That is why the EU should send a strong message that it is serious about continuing the fight against climate change."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the report on the reform of the United Nations recognises climate change as one of the most significant threats to global security."
"The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the use of renewable sources of energy, but in order for positive development to continue the European Union must show more initiative in further developing these energy sources both in Europe and elsewhere in the world."
"The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol following its ratification by the Russian Federation is a positive development, but in order to reduce climate change the USA’s involvement is also needed, as that country is responsible for one quarter of total emissions."
"In my view, the USA ought at the same time to step up its focus on energy efficiency and conservation measures."
"Several highly-developed countries can achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets for reasons unconnected with climate policy."
"We should also bear in mind, however, the rapid development of China and India, for instance, which are home to a third of the world’s population and where it is essential to find a balance between the needs of development and environmental protection."
"I would like to call on the European Commission to pay particular attention to the disparity between the promises made in the Kyoto Protocol and steps taken to fulfil them."
"I also call on the Commission, working together with the European Parliament and the Council, to formulate and actively defend a European Union strategy in talks at the UN forums on the future of the Kyoto Protocol and post-2012 commitments."
"Mr President, we know that climate change is dangerous and that it has been triggered not only by worldwide industrialisation and explosive population growth, but also by changes in nature."
"We also know that there is no stopping it even in the event of an immediate halt to the increase in greenhouse gas concentration."
"The appalling disasters that occurred in 2005 showed us what nature is capable of and may well be no more than the first indications of what we can reckon with happening frequently in the future."
"Even though they have sustained enormous damage, the USA and Australia are not prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol once and for all."
"Six countries are responsible for almost 50% of worldwide greenhouse gas production, and we must step up the pressure on them to a substantial degree."
"We here in Europe, though, are doing little better than they are if we now go back to singing the praises of nuclear power as an alternative compatible with Kyoto."
"If we do not soon make a start on at last implementing the environmentally-friendly technologies for propulsion and energy that we have developed, on putting a stop to the squandering of water and on the abolition of subsidies for trans-European transport, then we will be condemning our children, and their children in turn, to life in a permanent state of ecological emergency."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was a member of Parliament’s delegation to the Montreal Conference, and saw at first hand the efforts made by Commissioner Dimas and the British Presidency to reach an agreement, which, while not ideal, was very reasonable."
"Despite the US Administration once again causing a great deal of trouble up until the last moment, common sense eventually prevailed."
"Unfortunately, the US Administration does not wish to understand that the Kyoto Protocol does not pose a problem for the economy."
"As Bill Clinton rightly said in Montreal, clean technologies and energies are a new economy that will create new business opportunities and new jobs."
"According to a report by the European Environment Agency, Europe has witnessed climate change in the past two years on a scale not seen for 5 000 years."
"The four hottest years on record were 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2004."
"If we continue at this rate, without effective action, global warming will cause ice-sheets to melt in the north and the spread of deserts in the south."
"We must, as a matter of urgent priority, go further, and do more to honour the Kyoto Protocol."
"According to Professor Jacqueline McGlade, we need a gradual shift away from taxes on labour, and investment towards taxes on pollution and the inefficient use of materials and land."
"We also need reforms in the way that subsidies are applied to transport, housing, energy and agriculture."
"We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies."
"Will we have sufficient courage to do what we have to do?"
"One thing is for sure: if we do not act right away, we will be mortgaging our children’s futures."
"Mr President, Mr Dimas, you have the most important task of all the Commissioners."
"If it is you that fail, the Commission too fails."
"You are Mr Barroso’s guide."
"It is time we realised that it is climate chaos we are facing."
"There is no negotiating with Mother Earth."
"We are guests in her house and we must follow her rules."
"That is why we must quickly limit emissions."
"We must introduce carbon dioxide charges on products from countries that do not observe the Kyoto Agreement."
"It would create pressure for better politics in the United States and Australia."
"Countries that do not accept responsibility for the climate should not be able to be parasitic upon our earth."
"Current economic policy and trade policy have failed, and they create climate chaos and devastation instead of well-being and prosperity."
"Sorting this out is a matter of urgency."
"We need trade rules that observe the rules of the earth rather than those of short-sighted lobbyists."
"Legal proceedings cannot be taken against climate chaos."
"We need aviation taxes, carbon dioxide charges on imports, better rules governing emissions from cars, better transport policy and better trade policy."
"Only then can we take care of our earth."
". I shall make brief comments."
"I absolutely agree that climate change is one of the most serious, if not the most serious problem, which the world is facing today."
"Of course for the European Commission, and for me in particular, climate change, as I have repeatedly emphasised, is one of the main priorities."
"Of course, we have been fighting all this time to achieve the objectives which we set at the beginning of the year in our communication, which the European Parliament also adopted and which made the relevant recommendations for winning the battle against climate change."
"This communication was the main document which set out the relevant arguments and on the basis of which the overall debate was held which terminated in the Montreal agreement – and not just in Montreal, but also during the intermediate discussions at the European Council, at Gleneagles at the G8 summit, in Bonn and during other discussions held before Montreal."
"It therefore shows how important the contribution of the European Union was, both with this communication and the various interim discussions at bilateral level which we held with countries such as India, China and other rapidly developing countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, which are countries that emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, and with the climate of confidence which we cultivated throughout this time so as to achieve this success."
"Of course, our ambitions were much bigger – and are much bigger – but on the basis of the Treaties, as I said earlier, this was a success."
"We still have a long way to go and I agree that already today we are experiencing climate change."
"There has already been a 0.7° Celsius rise in the temperature and many of the phenomena we see today are due to climate change."
"As I said earlier, we are seeing various weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, prolonged droughts or floods in other parts of the world which are in keeping with scientists' predictions relating to climate change."
"Not all these incidents may be connected or we may not be able to connect them directly to climate change, but they come within scientists' general predictions."
"Of course, the phenomenon we are seeing today, the melting of the glaciers, both in the Alps and the Arctic Circle, the possible change in direction of the Gulf Stream, the rise in sea levels and a series of other phenomena will have serious repercussions on life, health, the environment and the ecosystems of the whole of mankind, which will be all the greater in the very poor countries, which do not have the means to deal with these consequences."
"We therefore have a truly huge obligation, a huge duty, to address climate change."
"The European Union really is the global leader on this issue."
"We honestly are making an effort and we hope that we shall persuade countries which are not showing willing to cooperate, such as the United States, which we referred to earlier and which is presently emitting more carbon dioxide than any other country, to follow this path."
"I am convinced that, in the not too distant future, all these countries, especially developed countries, will follow."
"Of course we also want the developing countries to contribute in their way, in accordance with the principle of the United Nations on joint but differentiated participation, to combating the greenhouse effect."
"I honestly believe that with you, with your help, which we urgently need, we shall be able to help combat this major problem for the world as a whole."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"The next item is the report by Georg Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on market access to port services (COM(2004) 0654 – C6 0147/2004 – 2004/0240(COD)) (A6-0410/2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the work they have done to improve the Commission’s proposal."
"This new proposal by the Commission for a directive on market access to port services meets the requirements already identified by the Commission back in 2001 when it adopted its first proposal on the matter."
"The proposal we are debating was presented by my predecessor, Mrs de Palacio."
"It pursues the same objectives as the previous proposal, namely to ensure that port services are freely provided, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty – as confirmed by the European Council via the Lisbon Agenda – the completion of the internal market in the port sector and the implementation of the conclusions of the 2001 White Paper on transport, which put forward solutions designed to reduce congestion on the road network and to increase cohesion with the peripheral regions."
"Clearly, all of this should be done in complete accordance with the regulations in force relating not only to the environment – the regulation on maritime safety and security – but, above all, to social employment and to social protection."
"Furthermore, the text stipulates that the Commission shall adopt guidelines on state aid for ports and that the ports concerned must comply with the provisions of the Commission directive on financial transparency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to underline the importance of having efficient ports: ports are a vital link in the transport chain and in the development of the motorways of the sea."
"Ninety percent of our external traffic passes through our ports."
"We need a clear framework of rules that promote investment in our ports."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made the changes it felt were necessary in relation to the text that was rejected in 2003."
"I am nonetheless aware of your reservations about this new text and, for that very reason, I wish to listen closely to the debate due to take place, the main motivation for which I have pointed out: the modernisation of our ports with a view to further developing the port sector in Europe."
"Thank you for listening."
"Mr President, you emphasised the number of speakers."
"I believe that this debate will, in any case, be very enlightening for the Commission."
"I therefore thank in advance all those who are due to take the floor and once again express my thanks to the committee and its rapporteur."
". – Mr President, I am much obliged to the Vice-President for the clarity with which he has spoken and for his willingness to engage with this House’s factual arguments."
"Let me remind the House of the fact that all the arguments for or against a directive on sea ports have been the subject of intensive debate for months, and that there are two things that were determined as long ago as the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s hearing last June."
"One is that everyone involved in what goes on in ports – from the port companies to the shipping lines – is in favour of unambiguous rules on transparency to create fair competition between sea ports."
"The same can be said of all the groups in this House, and I might mention that none of them, in the course of the Transport Committee’s deliberations, have tabled any substantial amendments to the provisions on transparency in the Commission proposal, and so I find it quite incomprehensible that four groups should move that the Commission proposal be rejected outright, for in so doing they are preventing the introduction of the rules on transparency."
"It follows that, if you are in favour of transparency and fair competition, you cannot under any circumstances throw out that part of the directive."
"Turning now to the issue of market access, it was clear from the hearing that there are very divergent interests at stake here."
"The providers of port services, in other words the businesses currently operating in ports – container terminals, watermen, lightermen and so on – do not, of course want these things regulated at European level; they would like to see them remain in the national sphere."
"Those who use port services, for example shippers and the business sectors that produce and ship goods, believe – and I think they are right to do so – that market access requires a European regulation."
"That is why I believe that the right, laid down quite clearly in the EC Treaty, to establish oneself and offer services, must apply in sea ports as much as anywhere else and that we need to bring in fair and unambiguous regulations to make sure that it does."
"I shall now proceed to set out, in brief, just five arguments in favour of European regulation of market access."
"Firstly, it is to the benefit of new service providers that market access should be facilitated in the first place by means of regular invitations to tender for public leased areas, in the absence of which no new provider of port services will ever have a chance to get into the market."
"Secondly, it is to the benefit of existing businesses handling goods in ports that these transitional provisions are intended to secure public leases, in theory at least for a period of up to 46 years."
"What we are proposing does not, then, do anything to jeopardise any business or put even one single job at risk; on the contrary, the long transition periods make it possible for existing businesses to continue operating."
"Our proposals are the right ones in terms of the interests of the port workers, since we want to delete self-handling from the directive."
"We take the view that there is no need for European rules on self-handling, since it is not even possible in container traffic, which is the typical activity of a modern harbour."
"The fact is that there is not one single container vessel that possesses the loading gear that would enable its own crew to load or unload containers."
"I have already explained how the long transitional provisions secure the port workers’ jobs, and, at the end of the day, there will be no danger of social dumping or of any deterioration in working conditions, for it is stated quite explicitly in this directive that it does not interfere with Member States’ social security arrangements or with free collective bargaining."
"Fourthly, our proposals are the right ones when it comes to securing the interests of shippers and of the businesses that use them, since, if new businesses come into the market, they can make their choice among the most efficient and best-value service providers and will not – as they currently do in some ports – have to contend with a monopoly situation in which they have to take what is put in front of them."
"Fifthly, the directive, as amended, is right from the economic and consumer point of view, since it is vital to exports and imports, and of benefit to our consumers, that all ports be regulated even more efficiently and economically."
"I do therefore believe that fair market access combined with protection for jobs and of the existing businesses’ interests is the best solution."
"You have before you 140 amendments to that effect, and I urge you to vote on their substance rather than turning away from making a decision based on facts."
"If you throw out the Commission proposal lock, stock and barrel – that is to say, not just the part that deals with competition, but also the part covering transparency – then there will be no European regulation, and, in its absence, nobody will have the certainty needed to plan ahead or any certainty as to what the law is."
"Do not let yourselves be swayed by yesterday’s strikes."
"I thought it inconceivable that it could have been the trade unions that, by the use of false arguments, induced these people to come here."
"Let us not allow the flares fired off by some of the demonstrators to show port workers in general in a bad light."
"Let us come to a fair decision in this matter – that is my plea to the House."
". Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which, of course, was not appreciated by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I too regret the violence that we saw yesterday, but we must understand the frustration that the dockers are feeling at the moment."
"This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission."
"It is an absolute insult to Parliament that it was brought back in virtually the same form within 18 months of its initial rejection."
"It is a real insult to the only directly-elected democratic institution at European level."
"The Commission should have thought very carefully after that initial rejection."
"As was the case with the Services Directive, there is some really flawed thinking at the centre of this directive."
"The idea of self-handling is ludicrous."
"It is a recipe for disaster and a health and safety nightmare."
"What we need in the loading and unloading of cargo is a dedicated, trained, experienced set of people, not an onboard workforce which would be exposed to the dangers of hurriedly loading and unloading cargo."
"Pilotage was included in this proposal."
"I represent Teesport in the north-east of England, which is one of the busiest ports in Europe and serves a massive chemical industrial complex."
"Highly volatile cargoes enter and leave that port every day."
"The notion that you can tender for piloting services for ships of that description in order to secure the lowest price is, again, ludicrous."
"It would put in danger not only the workers involved but also the entire population of my region."
"The Commission should have done the sensible thing: it should have revised this proposal completely before it brought it forward."
"I hope that it will readily withdraw it when we reject it tomorrow, as I am sure we will."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this House had rejected the port package, the Commission, through the agency of the Commissioner’s predecessor, delivered a fresh consignment in the form of a container with an extra dab of paint to indicate that this was a second package, even though its content is more or less identical to the first one."
"The Commission has had the nerve to table a proposal which shows, as Mr Hughes rightly pointed out, that it ignores the voice of Parliament."
"We would have appreciated a little more respect, but the Commission seems to have considered our input somewhat superfluous."
"It could deal with this on its own."
"The Commission has road-tested self-handling and tomorrow, we will see that this can go wrong."
"Self-handling is, of course, not the only problem."
"Our group, too, believes that this proposal – of which we are highly critical – is probably heading for a rejection, and we realise that the rapporteur, who most definitely deserves our respect, has not, despite persistent efforts on his part but as a result of all these circumstances, managed to find a majority for an acceptable, useful and viable solution on the basis of this proposal."
"If this does not kill off the port package or the port package journey altogether, then we know that we have to change tack and opt for a totally different approach."
"We need an approach that focuses on solving the real problems, an approach that gives due consideration not only to investment goods, but also to people."
"We need one that offers legal certainty to everyone, and for that calm consideration is vital."
"Down with the confrontation model."
"Long live the consultation model."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission, you will be so kind as to tell us whether, when you table fresh proposals, you intend to take your time conferring with all parties involved beforehand."
"."
"Mr President, perhaps I might say, before I say anything else, that the behaviour indulged in by some of the dockers yesterday here in Strasbourg goes far beyond what is tolerable or permissible in political life."
"By all means protest and demonstrate, but violence and vandalism are out – they cannot be allowed and must be denounced."
"Let me now turn to the matter in hand."
"In the past, we talked about clean waters and clean ports and campaigned for them."
"We enacted legislation on the subject, one example being the November 2000 directive on port waste facilities."
"If the port package belongs anywhere, that is where it belongs, in amongst the port’s waste; that is the right place for it."
"That being so, Social Democrats and many others will, tomorrow, reject this ‘port package II’ directive. Why is this so?"
"The answer is quite simple."
"The Commission’s draft takes no account whatever of the realities of life in most of Europe’s ports; its intention of interfering in functioning, economically successful structures and using an enormous and expensive bureaucracy to impose on ports a competition that already exists in almost all of them, is intolerable."
"At the end of the day, the most important thing is that what is at stake is a lot of skilled jobs; families and livelihoods are at risk, and that is what this is all about."
"I have not, so far, heard a single reason to justify putting these jobs at risk and needlessly jeopardising social harmony in Europe’s ports."
"There is no reason to do so."
"We are told that the fundamental freedoms – which are constantly invoked – are not guaranteed in ports."
"There may be a few ports like that in Europe, but unremitting competition is a fact of life in most of them."
"It is only natural that there is limited space in most ports for those who want to provide port services, and by no means will every one of them get their chance at once, but that is far from saying that any one of them is discriminated against."
"Let me give, as an example, a pedestrian area in the smartest part of a city."
"Not everyone gets the chance to practise his profession there either, but does the Commission want to do something like stipulate a tendering process in future, simply because a German hairdresser is unable to rent a salon on the Ramblas in Barcelona just when he chooses to?"
"That is simply not on."
"This is not just about Europe as a location for maritime business but also about how we Europeans measure up against the other continents."
"If we want to maintain our European social model, we cannot go presenting Asian businesses with European ports on a silver platter – and, by the way, our European ports are in any case much more efficient than Asian ones these days."
"You, Commissioner, inherited this questionable package from your predecessor, Mrs de Palacio."
"Knowing that you are not the sort to go hunting for legacies, we suggest that you rid yourself of this one – we will help you do it."
"The sort of proposal we want from you is one that cannot, in essence, be seen as anything other than European."
"What is needed is a European policy on ports, and fair competition between them, along with a proper policy on the ports’ hinterlands."
"We have to get European ports to compete properly with the rest of the world."
"If that is the sort of policy you want, Commissioner, then we are right behind you and will gladly work together with you in producing one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, almost 50 years since the Community was founded, there is now still no specific legislative framework for port services."
"The ports sector is the only transport sector in which problems involving the free movement of services have to be solved one by one by the Commission and via the Court of Justice."
"Of course, port services come under the fundamental freedoms listed by the EC Treaty – that is to say, freedom of movement and the right of establishment, as mentioned by yourself, Commissioner – and the general principles of the Treaty do not take full account of the special conditions that apply in ports."
"That is why a legislative framework is needed for the ports sector."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are, then, in favour of a ports directive, albeit not in the form presented in the Commission’s proposal."
"Indeed, very few people support a directive in that form. We have supported the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, in his efforts to transform this directive into something more sensible."
"In the light of the developments reflected in Mr Jarzembowski’s efforts, I have been surprised at the violent demonstrations against the Commission’s proposal, which does not, of course, have an earthly chance of being adopted in its present form."
"Mr Jarzembowski is to remove self-handling from the proposal in order to make it less controversial."
"That said, we have to listen to bizarre and untrue assertions about Filipino dockworkers poised to take over the jobs of port workers. Meanwhile, the port workers have repaid the good will that exists by staging disturbances in front of our Parliament building and smashing a large number of windows in the facade."
"I think this shows a lack of understanding of, and indeed contempt for, the democratic process."
"We need a ports directive that can establish the framework for free competition between service providers in ports and also for such freer competition between ports as will provide a safeguard against state aid that distorts competition."
"The Commission’s very point of departure is that, by putting an end to the monopolies, we could obtain more efficient and better run ports. We should then see more goods transported by ship, something that would reduce the burden on both the roads and the environment."
"This objective has, however, been completely lost sight of in the debate."
"It has to be recognised that the Commission’s proposal contains a number of weaknesses."
"We think that better account needs to be taken of the ability of service providers to pay interest on, and write off, the often very large investments they have to make."
"There must be better transitional rules when new service providers take over from old ones."
"If the directive ends up being rejected – as many of us believe, but do not hope, it will be – the document should be used in future work involving a new impact analysis of legislation in this area."
"Given the chaotic nature of developments so far, it is understandable that many should want the Commission to withdraw the proposal."
"I have to say that my own group does not have a unanimous view on the approach we should adopt to this issue."
"Precisely in view of the chaotic way things have gone, there are many who will simply vote against the proposal, but we continue to be interested in a ports directive."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in itself quite a feat to be able to present a Commission proposal that has been subject to so much and such intense criticism by so many people, for that is the case here."
"We were all, of course, able to witness what happened yesterday, namely, as Mr Piecyk stated a moment ago, that the port workers, sadly only a minority, went way beyond what is acceptable and tried to shoot themselves in the foot."
"This was a rather absurd thing to do since it was directed towards the only European institution that has defended the interests of the port workers in the past and is apparently doing so again now."
"This absurd action should not, though, detract from the port workers’ main, and constantly-stated, objection, namely that if an unchanged Commission proposal is adopted, there is a considerable risk that well-trained, experienced people will be replaced by cheap, badly trained ships’ crews, and that is not something we should be encouraging."
"What is striking, of course, is that it was not only the trade unions that displayed their dismay."
"Port services and port employers in numerous European ports also appealed with us not to introduce any more red tape relating to new rules."
"If you read the impact studies that have been carried out, then the conclusion is that if this directive is adopted unchanged, it will result in uncertainty and fewer investments, and will have an adverse effect on the quality of port services."
"I should like to add a third argument for the Commission’s attention."
"Why is it that whilst your Commission, in the person of its President, has always claimed that Europe should only draft legislation if it is necessary, if it adds something and if it cannot be done at national level, it has now tabled a proposal that tries to solve a problem in a number of ports in southern Europe by saddling all European ports with uniform rules?"
"My group’s conclusion is that we should reject this proposal."
"I would urge the Commission to stop tabling proposals of this kind and instead to bring proposals which will meet with support in Parliament."
"We should really clamp down on proposals for state aid."
"I urge you to try to solve the problems in southern European ports in a different manner."
". Mr President, legislation at European Union level or the imposition of obligations to harmonise national legislation of Member States is only of any use if it solves problems."
"For the people working in the ports, this port directive only causes them."
"The Commission has opened up the possibility of self-handling, as a result of which trained specialists, who know how to move cargo safely and accurately, could well be replaced by cheap ships’ crews from outside of Europe."
"Even if this Member State obligation is taken out of the directive, it still remains detrimental to ports where governments own the port’s inner harbours, the quays and adjacent industrial sites."
"As a result of compulsory periodic tendering for operators, the people who work there could lose their jobs when the contract expires."
"Continuity will then remain possible only in private ports, provided, that is, that they do not go into receivership or are not bought by the competition."
"This proposal has met with huge opposition, starting in 2003, when it was eventually rejected at third reading, only for Commissioner De Palacio, just before her departure in 2004, to leave the repeat of this proposal behind like a ticking time bomb."
"An important underlying motive may well have been that there were interested parties outside of ports that wanted to make transport by sea even cheaper."
"That is astonishing, given that the rates in Europe are lower than those in Asia or America and also because they are only a negligible part of the production costs for industry."
"Commissioner De Palacio’s official main argument was to promote shipping between Spain and Italy as an alternative to the huge stream of lorries that drive along the southern coast of France."
"Even without a port directive, this short-distance sea transport appears to have skyrocketed already in recent years."
"Moreover, it is reported that the impact on the German, Dutch, Belgian and French ports along the North Sea and the Channel with their major common hinterland would create chaos."
"As long ago as 1998, this House took the view that a possible port directive should focus on putting investments paid with taxpayers’ money in the public domain and that it should also focus on the extent to which the rates included cover the costs."
"The Commission’s two subsequent proposals did nothing of the kind."
"Nevertheless, whilst up to a week ago, the Christian Democrats and Liberals, half of this House in other words, were backing this proposal, now, virtually nobody seems to believe in it anymore."
"We can defuse this time bomb in tomorrow’s vote once and for all."
"Mr President, the French delegation of the Independence and Democracy Group is in favour of promoting maritime transport."
"In the current legal context, maritime transport yields good results."
"In 2000, 41% of the bulk consignments transferred within Europe were transported via maritime transport, compared with 43% transported via road transport."
"Yet, do we need this port services directive in order to promote this effective mode of transport?"
"The aim of this new proposal is to overcome the failure of the first package on port services, which was rejected by this very Parliament."
"This new proposal takes up the main points contained in the first arrangement."
"The scope remains the same, the list of services is identical and the promotion of competition remains excessive."
"The few changes affecting this text do nothing to improve it."
"The authorisations issued to the providers of port services genuinely give rise to suspicion."
"The burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes, and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty."
"The authorisation periods do not take account of the long period of time required to justify significant investment decisions."
"This succession of patch-up jobs belies an impulsive move made without any serious impact study."
"The study published by the British Transport Ministry on 26 August 2005 even falls under the heading of aggravating circumstances: an increase in the ticket granting entry into the market and an allowance granted to large suppliers at the expense of small companies."
"Changes affecting self-handling are re-igniting criticism of social dumping."
"This crucial issue shows just how central the Bolkestein Directive continues to be to all of the Union’s arrangements."
"Therefore, despite Article 4 and the exclusion of transport services from the ‘Services’ Directive, we know that these are the kinds of ploys we are used to in this House."
"Yes, maritime transport needs specific and precise reforms."
"Yes, this directive is primarily designed to disguise a new and obvious failure on the part of the Union’s institutions."
"Yes, maritime transport needs sovereign States that make it clear how they stand."
"Consequently …"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft ports directive that we are discussing at the moment is a classic product of the former European Commission."
"When it submitted the draft in the spring of 2004, the European Commission carried out no research into its impact on the new European Union Member States, with the result that, for example, the Baltic states ports would under this directive be obliged to compete with Russia’s ports in a situation of unfair competition."
"Therefore, however much the rapporteur tries to find a compromise on this draft directive, it is clear that doing so will be very difficult."
"Unfortunately, it may be that the organisers of the violent demonstration and various supporters of that demonstration on the left wing of this Parliament will tomorrow celebrate a victory."
"However, stage what events they will, I would like to say to those who espouse the relaxed social standards of the old Europe that without major reforms it will not be possible to maintain those standards after all."
"Mr President, this rehashed directive will be decided during the Presidency of Austria, which has no ports at all."
"It follows a chaotic vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when there was real doubt about the correct result."
"Britain, may I remind you, is an island with over 100 commercial ports and the biggest, Southampton, is in my constituency."
"It adds over GBP 2 billion to the British economy every year and the local economy enjoys another GBP 200 million from the cruise industry alone."
"These are big numbers."
"As a global trading nation, the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces."
"There is no public ownership, no state subsidy, so expansion in the development of facilities and services in British ports depends on retaining the confidence of private investors and high standards of service and employment."
"This directive will undermine confidence in those standards because it interferes in freely negotiated commercial contracts."
"It imposes controls that are neither necessary nor desirable."
"It seeks to solve problems in state-run ports that simply do not exist in Britain."
"The port authorities know, suppliers of services and facilities know, customers know: the only people who do not appear to know are those in the Commission."
"Even ship pilots’ proper concerns over safety have met with indifference."
"Do we really want novices piloting the biggest container ships in the world up narrow tidal waterways and trying to berth them safely?"
"Whenever the EU starts talking about creating a level playing field it reveals a fundamental ignorance of enterprise."
"British ports use their initiative and investors’ money to create competitive advantage: the very opposite of a level playing field."
"If passed, this directive will cost without yielding benefit and will slow down growth and confidence."
"The House should throw it out."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, from the previous positions and events relating to the demonstrations in Strasbourg and other areas of Europe, we have all realised that we are debating an issue which is very serious in its dimensions and repercussions."
"We should therefore be attentive to its multilateral parameters and, at the same time, more efficient in the objectives we wish to serve, by which I mean economic development, competitiveness and convergence between the areas of Europe."
"That is why we welcome the Commission initiative to propose a regulatory framework which is missing from the European Union more than fifty years after the establishment of the European Community."
"We therefore have before us the option of acquiring a regulatory framework which will lend transparency to the operation of services and relations with government and other authorities and which will also give greater competitiveness to our ports, not only in the major ports of Europe, which are losing ground against Asian ports, but also in other secondary ports, which will have the possibility, on equal terms from the point of view of competition, to develop so that they can also address the explosion in international trade and the advantages which will emerge from the European Union policy on short-haul maritime transport or sea buses."
"We must be ready to reap the benefits of these policies."
"However, we would like to see an impact study, in advance, before we reach a final result; this is something we do not have today and relates to the lack of transparency and the lack of a regulatory framework in Europe."
"However, we must try, at both European Union level and Member State level, to have such a study and we would also like this proposal for a directive to be integrated into the framework of a broader port policy, because competition is not just a regulatory framework, it also relates to services that give access and efficacy in general to the functioning of ports and transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join many others in the sharp criticism levelled at the Commission for the way in which it has handled this issue."
"It remains astonishing how the Commission, less than a year after the previous port directive was rejected, launched a fresh proposal without consulting the sector, or Parliament for that matter, knowing full well how sensitive this issue is."
"I would like to make a point of saying this because I am convinced things could have gone differently had there been a willingness early on to enter into dialogue with the parties involved."
"I do know, however, that Mr Barrot is not particularly happy with this dossier either, and my comments are therefore not meant for him personally, but they need expressing nevertheless."
"He knows, as well as I do, that it is not only the methodology, but also the content, of the text that meets with major opposition in the sector."
"The trade unions are obviously concerned about the extent of self-handling, but the proposal has also come under heavy criticism from ports, port companies, pilots and even ship owners."
"Mr Jarzembowski deserves credit for making an attempt to save the day despite all this, but I beg to differ with him as far as content is concerned."
"Given the way in which this dossier was submitted and subsequently received by the sector, we have no choice but to reject it comprehensively and to ask the Commission to go back to the drawing board."
"Approval would be an act of bad governance, certainly because we have no idea whatsoever what the outcome of the vote could be."
"If you want to build a house, but know that the foundations are inadequate, you have no choice but to stop the building work and start again."
"Rejection means that the ports will simply be able to continue working, as they have done for the past 40 to 50 years with spectacular growth figures in many cases."
"This does not mean, of course, that we can afford to sit back."
"The Commission should take its time, mull things over, enter into a discussion with the sector and study what there is in ports that really requires a European approach."
"A fresh Green Paper or White Paper, as is suggested by some, strikes me as a good approach and the Commission can, meanwhile, focus on what is needed across the sector, namely clear rules on transparency with regard to government investments."
"We need to reject this proposal first, though."
"Mr President, Commissioner, having rejected it during the last legislature, today we are once again dealing with the Commission’s proposal for the liberalisation of port services, and we find ourselves once again in practically the same situation, because, in substance, the text we originally rejected has hardly been changed at all."
"The proposal is similar and the rapporteur is the same person;"
"I say this with respect and affection for my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, but I believe that this proposal will also be rejected by a majority."
"Being generally in favour of the liberalisation of the markets and also of port services, I cannot support the present proposal; firstly, because the intention is purely to deal with services provided within each port, with the healthy intention of promoting free competition, but not to deal with the very real practices that breach the rules on competition amongst different European ports."
"I believe that numerous aspects of the normal practices in many ports need to be changed."
"I believe that some of the abuses and forms of contracting imposed on service providers are unacceptable."
"Nevertheless, I believe that changes cannot be proposed in such an aggressive way."
"We must promote an ordered transition and, on the one hand, guarantee safety and efficiency in port operations and, on the other, safeguard the rights of workers."
"I believe that companies have the right to choose workers freely but they should firstly take on those workers who have already been doing certain jobs and whose employment contracts are still in force."
"As has happened in other economic sectors in crisis, if there is a surplus of workers, we will have to negotiate a suitable restructuring plan between the trade unions, companies and the administration."
"Europe and this Parliament must not be seen by the citizens as an instrument for unbridled capitalism."
"Proposals such as this, which we are discussing today and which I hope we will reject, have contributed to the Dutch and French ‘No’s to the Constitutional Treaty."
"We must modernise our economy, but with the necessary coverage and protection for the people affected, which is the main objective of any political action."
"In that way we will have greater moral authority when it comes to condemning the use of violence that we witnessed here yesterday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens in this House reject the port package, not least for reasons of good form, since it was presented in haste by Commissioner De Palacio at her last part-session, that is to say at a time when she ought really to have relinquished office long ago."
"It looks bad to reintroduce, almost unchanged, a directive that Parliament has already rejected and, so to speak, throw it down before your successor and the House."
"Opposition to the port package comes from almost all the Member States; it has been rejected by the conservative government in Holland, the Labour government in Great Britain, and both the former red-green and the present conservative and social democrat coalition governments in Germany."
"There is a justifiable fear of an economic backlash brought on by the need for investments to pay off over shorter periods of time, by the expensive growth in bureaucracy and by the fact that competition is already in place."
"Costs in EU ports are very low; half of what they are in the USA and one-third of what they are in Asia."
"The dockers are justified in going on strike, for they fear wage dumping."
"There is no place in a social market economy for a social freeze policy of this kind."
"Opposition to the port package comes from an immense coalition of conservatives, socialists and greens."
"Let me urge you to join with us in rejecting it and in giving Commissioner Barrot the opportunity to put before us a new regulation that will create the transparency that European ports need."
"– Mr President, our debate is being held in the aftermath of the mass unemployment demonstration by dockworkers held yesterday in all the ports of the Member States with a great deal of success, sending a perfectly clear message to withdraw this directive on access to port services."
"It is also being held two years after its rejection by the European Parliament."
"The new version of this directive on ports, despite misleading claims of transparency, guarantees and so forth, is even worse than the one voted down by the European Parliament on 23 November 2003."
"There is, in our view, a major political issue here."
"Although the European Parliament rejected the directive in question, although the new version of it was rejected in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and although the rapporteur's proposal was voted down in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Commission has insisted that it be brought before the European Parliament, demonstrating once again the correlation between the will of the Members of the European Parliament and the workers employed in this sensitive area."
"The new version of the directive includes selling off ports to the private sector, together with the entire range of port services: loading and unloading, stevedoring and storage."
"Allow me to close by briefly adding the following to what other speakers have said: one of the basic issues which is a priority for the European Parliament is the safety of life at sea and environmental safety."
"Adopting this directive will increase the risks and we ..."
"Mr President, the previous port services directive was rejected by the last Parliament in the 2003 plenary and, as nothing has changed, why should the Commission expect a different answer this time?"
"Neither management nor staff have shown any encouragement for this legislation."
"Yesterday, a Parliament spokesman said that the protests had caused considerable damage, but what will be the damage in British ports if this directive is applied?"
"New investment of over EUR 400 million by the management of my local ports of Felixstowe and Harwich may be jeopardised if they have to open the services to other companies."
"Our British system has worked extremely well for decades, so why should British ports be disrupted when, clearly, this form of legislation is aimed at certain ports on the continent?"
"It is said that there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation, but if this directive is applied, at what expense?"
"Dockers could lose their jobs, the security systems could break down and the safety issue would be jeopardised."
"I voted to reject the similar bill two years ago and, as a British Member, I am going to do the same again this week."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us overlook the fact that the Members of this Parliament have already, on numerous occasions, come out against the need to adopt such a directive, and their objections have gone unheeded."
"If, however, such a directive has to be adopted at any cost, for the sake of opening up the market to competition and creating a legal framework to harmonise port management procedures and to make them transparent, then it should at least be fair and rational."
"The current proposal creates a series of distortions and will have consequences that are certainly undesirable, such as a decline in qualifications, with obvious repercussions on overall safety levels."
"In particular, it grants the pilotage service alone certain prerogatives associated with safeguarding the safety of shipping, as well as specific public service obligations."
"These, however, are characteristics of all technical maritime services, including mooring services, which should therefore be expressly protected and not exposed to free-market rules."
"I therefore call for the safety of our ports and the professionalism of their workers to be prioritised."
"Otherwise, I shall be forced to vote against the proposal."
"Mr President, along with most colleagues in this House, I have very serious concerns about the proposals before us."
"However, not only do I dislike the content of the proposals, which I will come back to shortly, but I also find it unacceptable that the Commission seems unable to take no for an answer."
"Two years ago, along with many colleagues, I found myself sitting in this very Chamber, having this very same debate, where a very similar proposal was rejected."
"Commissioner Barrot, why do I find myself in the same position again today?"
"At a time when we hear that the Commission is about to repeal or will not proceed with over-regulatory legislation, we are faced with the proposals we are now debating."
"For the United Kingdom, the content of the proposal has been met with disbelief by the industry."
"There is not one port that welcomes the proposals."
"Should they be adopted, businesses which have worked hard to become the best performing and most competitive in Europe would be compromised and threatened."
"Within the proposals, authorisation periods and tendering are thought to be market-orientated measures that will increase services and competition."
"They do nothing of the sort."
"Services will be reduced as potential competitors cherry-pick only the profitable areas of business, meaning less development in the sector."
"Financial institutions will also be less forthcoming with capital investment as returns will be minimal and not guaranteed, leading to exactly the opposite of what is intended."
"I am all for the free market and can support any proposal that is market-orientated."
"However, that is not the case with this proposal."
"If the EU wants to see a market-orientated approach, I suggest that it follows what we already have in the UK: a tried and tested system."
"I call on this House to reject the proposal in its entirety and send a simple message to the Commission: ‘no’ means ‘no’ in whatever language one speaks, except ‘Euro-ese’ where it appears to mean exactly the opposite."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have a slightly original debate in store for us tomorrow since the Committee on Transport and Tourism has done a procedural ‘u-turn’."
"We will therefore have to give our verdict on the raw text, that is to say on Mrs de Palacio’s ‘legacy’ text – the poisoned chalice she bestowed on the European Commission."
"Personally, I will be voting against it, not because – as everyone can confirm – I am particularly radical, but for three reasons."
"Firstly, I will be voting against the text because we do not have to accept a denial of parliamentary democracy."
"We cannot encourage the Commission to reproduce the same texts every time Parliament has voted against them, nor can we encourage it not to listen or to hear anything and to proceed on the basis of a mystical form of ultraliberalism that flouts everyone’s opinions, including those of the professionals."
"Secondly, I will be voting against it because this text is socially unacceptable and dangerous."
"It comes down to legalising the same kind of serfdom in the ports that is rife on the seas."
"Through self-handling by onboard personnel, it comes down to encouraging our ports to employ Filipinos and Malays in order to be competitive. In reality, it comes down to admitting that was right in June."
"It is politically irresponsible because we withdrew a directive on crews, which was a social directive, and we are keeping the port services directive; because, in the context of the ‘better lawmaking’ initiative, we withdrew 60 European Parliament texts in the course of proceedings, yet we are keeping the port services directive; and because, in actual fact, this text gives food for thought and proves all the card-carrying Eurosceptics and those most fervently opposed to Europe, right."
"As someone who fought to see Europe exist, I, for my part, believe that this is an insult to us."
"Commissioner, I know what your feelings are and I think that the problems related to Europe’s ports are problems to do with the excessive concentration in the North Sea, with saturation, with the disorganisation of road traffic flows on the continent, with the security of the straits – one can see what took place again in the Pas-de-Calais – and with national and regional development."
"A port is primarily a site. It is a strategic site; it is not a free-for-all service; it is not a supermarket."
"You need to think along these lines in future when you design the new initiative."
"Mr President, according to the Commission, the purpose of this directive is to make it easier to open up the market in port services and thereby increase the competitiveness of European ports."
"In reality, the directive would not open up the market, but instead would increase bureaucracy, reduce the productivity of ports and reduce competition too."
"The Commission’s proposal makes little sense."
"The rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, has certainly done an excellent job and tabled some relevant amendments, but it has to be said that even he cannot accomplish miracles."
"If the proposal is unworkable, it will not be made to work here in Parliament."
"Europe does not need more poor administration: instead, Europe and we need to ensure the quality of the work done at ports, the safety of employees and their rights and see to it that ports operate flexibly."
"The EU must focus on the essential, and the intention behind the Commission’s simplification strategy is, or at least is said to be, to do away with needless regulation."
"In this case at least it has not succeeded."
"I hope that the Commission will also apply the principles which it articulates to the directive on port services and everything it does."
"This directive will have to be rejected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today and tomorrow, all eyes of the whole trade union world will be on this House, as will those of everyone who works hard for a more social Europe."
"This spring is, indeed, set to become an important time, with, this month, the port directive up for discussion, while next month, it is the turn of the Bolkestein directive."
"As responsible politicians, we are given the opportunity to put this House on the map once again and to make clear our refusal to go along with the of ever more competition, ever more privatisation and ever more liberalisation."
"By rejecting this directive, we bring home the fact that we want a different Europe, where it is not only the economy that counts, but also the social and ecological dimensions. Consideration should therefore be given to the people who work in the ports, the dockworkers, who are at risk of losing their jobs, whilst freight should be handled safely and efficiently."
"Due account should also be given to the pilots who guide the ships safely into the ports and ensure that minor or major environmental disasters are prevented."
"The Greens will therefore reject this directive because we believe that a different Europe is really possible."
"Mr President, I would like to know if the Commissioner has heard a single speech – other than the one by Mr Jarzembowski, who seemed unsure whether he should say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – in which someone has taken a favourable view of this port services directive?"
"There is a wide variety of reasons for repudiating it, ranging from the social aspect to the bureaucracy involved, not to mention our sense that there is something undemocratic about a Commissioner past her sell-by date reintroducing a proposal that has already been rejected."
"This House is very definitely united, and I do believe that you could do yourself and the Commission a favour by taking the opportunity of your closing speech to announce that you are withdrawing this proposal, thereby pre-empting Parliament’s call on you to do just that."
"You accept that the interested parties do not want this directive and that your idea of what is good democratic practice is not the only one, and so you stand a chance of bringing in a new directive, one dealing exclusively with transparency and with the aid that ports need."
"That would be a sensible way of going about things, and by conducting yourself in that way you would be doing democracy in the European Union a great service."
"Mr President, that there are problems in certain European ports is not a matter of doubt; what is less certain is that the present Commission proposal will do an adequate job of addressing them."
"Adopting a number of amendments will not change this fundamental issue either."
"Given, to some extent, the growing resistance to the implications of this proposal among those involved, I would ask you to reconsider whether this measure is needed at this moment in time."
"In my view, this proposal is not the right action at the right time despite the imminent arrival of the services directive."
"Sectoral legislation for ports is welcome, and rules on state aid in ports are necessary."
"This proposal, however, is not equal to the task of standing up to existing problems without imposing excessively administrative and organisational burdens."
"I would therefore urge my fellow Members to reject this proposal and would ask the Commission to table a fresh, more focused proposal, together with a proposal for the regularisation of state aid in ports."
"I warmly support the amendments that serve this purpose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard here today and what we saw in the streets of Strasbourg yesterday, naturally gives us a sense of ."
"It should not, of course, have come to this, had the Commission had the wisdom two years ago to quietly bury its catastrophic port directive."
"For years, it has been evident that in the general public opinion and in the European ports in particular, there is no democratic support for this anti-social and ideological package of measures that has not been inspired by political common sense."
"Even a young child would know that this – what has now become notorious – self-handling leads to unemployment, social unrest and unsafe situations in the ports."
"Nevertheless, the Commission went ahead."
"Based on purely doctrinarian considerations, a proposal is now being put before us virtually identical to that rejected by a majority in this Parliament two years ago, without much respect for this Parliament, against their better judgement, and against the will of the large majority of European dockworkers."
"The same applies, to some extent, to the Bolkestein directive."
"It should come as no surprise that the citizens in France and the Netherlands, as others will do elsewhere tomorrow, turn their backs on this kind of Europe."
"The Commission could not be more blind to the social reality in the Member States, or further removed from the citizens in their suffering."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of the fate of this legislation, since it would appear that the House is highly divided, as a Spanish classic said, sometimes we must say what we feel and feel what we say, when faced with unacceptable pressure, however legitimate it may be."
"The European Parliament is faced today with a dilemma: either we move forward with the creation of a genuine internal market or we remain in a state of stagnation."
"Personally, I have decided to support a proposal whose fundamental principles and objectives are laid down in the Lisbon programme and in the Transport White Paper."
"Improving competition amongst port service providers will increase competitiveness and efficiency in ports and contribute to developing goods transport by sea, which is ultimately the main objective of our support for maritime transport in the Union."
"One of the fundamental elements of the proposal, but one which has given rise to the most controversy, is the express inclusion of self-handling."
"It is fundamental for the Member States to guarantee the recognition of a method for the provision of port services that contributes to the genuine development of short-distance sea transport, which, by its very nature, requires efficiency and speed not just in customs operations, but also, in particular, in loading and unloading."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in response to the fears of those people who believe that the approval of this directive will lead to a deterioration in the working conditions of workers, we must make it clear that the directive does not just respect the Member States’ legislation on working conditions, training and professional qualifications, but also those that relate to health, safety in the workplace, maritime safety and protection of the environment."
"Furthermore, the transfer of loading to ports will increase the volume of operations in them, which in turn will lead to an increase in employment."
"Mr President, I must point out that my country is standing at a crucial maritime crossroads from commercial and logistical points of view, since we are the European gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic."
"That is why it is essential from an economic point of view that we have modern, efficient and well-managed ports, since they must be competitive."
"Spanish ports are self-supplying and self-funding compared to other ports; that is why it is necessary definitively to assess the issue of subsidies to ports, that is, state aid."
"From a social point of view too, we have well-trained workers, with quality jobs and full employment rights, which is not always the case in maritime law. Finally, from an environmental point of view, many of the services being talked about are fundamental to safety and to environmental protection."
"This new proposal has achieved an unusual degree of unanimity, since even those people in my country who identified aspects that were useful for resolving certain bottlenecks and obsolete practices that persist in our ports, have preferred, and prefer, to reject it today."
"Based on my conviction, therefore, that this Parliament will do what it has to do and reject this proposal, which has amply demonstrated its inadequacy in terms of the current needs of European ports, I would ask the Commissioner to be sensitive, as he has shown himself to be in other areas of transport, and, because the global situation requires it, as soon as possible to prepare an updated, necessary and courageous consultation process which deals openly and thoroughly with all of the necessary aspects of European ports. In that way, within a reasonable space of time, we will be able to find the solutions to making European ports the centres of economic, social, technological and environmental development that Europe requires and, in view of the global framework, they will thereby contribute to better producing a more cohesive Europe."
"Mr President, having sat through this debate, I have a message for the dockers gathered in Strasbourg."
"I say to them that I have heard Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament line up and put forward arguments which are in the interests of the people of Europe, and Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament expressing sympathies with the underlying arguments that they are presenting."
"Rather than standing and attacking this House, they should take a step back, listen to what is being said in this debate and give their support to this House."
"That is my appeal to them."
"Tomorrow, this House will be considering a proposal that it effectively rejected in November 2003."
"It is a project that the Commissioner has tried to distance himself from entirely and a process that is democratically deficient, owing to a failure to consider, consult or compromise with those at its heart."
"It is clear that this proposal was designed with continental ports in mind, with the desire to liberalise the port services market, which is, for the most part, still nationalised."
"That is a welcome and necessary step, but it needs to be done in the right way."
"However, the United Kingdom ports industry has set itself apart from its continental counterparts."
"Our ports are privately owned."
"They receive no financial assistance from the government and capital for new investment is raised within the market."
"Owing to the large number of thriving ports, the industry already enjoys the healthy competition that this proposal seeks to achieve."
"The move to impose such a landlord model on United Kingdom ports will be enormously damaging."
"The threat of a trend towards a non-permanent workforce will lead to a lack of job security, lower skills levels, lower wages, a deterioration in working conditions, and will have a detrimental impact on the surrounding communities."
"My constituency, in the north-west of England, has a long and proud history in the maritime industry, with ports such as Liverpool, Manchester and Heysham numbering among some of the largest on the United Kingdom coastline."
"At its heart is Liverpool, the home of the United Kingdom’s first commercial dry dock."
"Under this directive, Liverpool’s communities, which are already among the most deprived in Europe, will witness hard-grafting dockers being put out of work."
"All this with a compensation package on the table insufficient to comply with United Kingdom law, let alone the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is neither desirable nor practical for this House to try to amend this proposal, which is fundamentally flawed."
"It is for all these reasons that we must vote this proposal down."
"– We are yet again presented with an unacceptable proposal to liberalise port services; and this proposal has, yet again, been met by a fierce struggle on the part of the workers to have it rejected, a struggle that we have supported from the outset, just as we did in 2003."
"This proposal for a directive forms part of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’ aimed at speeding up liberalisations, leading to a ferocious onslaught against the public sector and on public services."
"Quite apart from the crucial questions of national sovereignty that this strategic sector raises, this proposal, if adopted, would lead to unemployment, precarious working situations and work insecurity, especially via what is known as self-handling."
"Collective contracts and union rights are under attack; productivity and vocational training are dwindling; the risk of serious accidents is on the rise; and all in the name of competition."
"This is a proposal that panders to the interests of the large shipowners."
"We have therefore tabled a proposal to reject this directive."
"Mr President, there are several good reasons for rejecting the ports directive."
"Firstly, this is an issue on which each Member State should decide in accordance with the EU’s principle of subsidiarity."
"It is for the Member States to adopt positions on this type of issue."
"Our basic view is that Swedish rules should apply on Swedish territory."
"Secondly, the process whereby the ports directive has again appeared on the agenda is undemocratic."
"The European Parliament rejected an identical proposal by the Commission barely a year ago."
"Thirdly, the players who would be affected by this directive do not think very much of it."
"There is currently efficient competition between European ports."
"The ports directive would lead to a distortion of competition because the ship owners’ own staff would take over the job of loading and unloading."
"Who really wants this directive?"
"Its main advocate is the Commission, which wants to drive through this legislation at any price."
"The Swedish June List will reject this legislative proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am convinced that you will get a majority in this House to back a ports directive for Europe if the directive you put before us is well thought-out and really does promote transparency and competitiveness in Europe in this area."
"This directive, though, is not suited to that task and so I suggest that you withdraw it."
"You must have realised, in the course of this debate, what agreement, across the party boundaries, you have prompted in this House on this subject."
"You must surely realise that this draft directive, lacking as it does sufficient underpinning, is ill-prepared for debate."
"Even though Mr Jarzembowski has done a splendid job, there is little chance of this House improving a bad directive when one is put before it."
"The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives."
"What makes this draft directive scarcely fit for consideration is the fact that important aspects of it are unclear; its definition of markets certainly is."
"Is it meant to mean competition within ports, among the ports themselves or something that involves both the ports and the traffic that they share in their hinterland?"
"No impact assessment has been carried out, nor is it at all clear what benefit the consumer is supposed to derive from all this."
"More competition ought, by rights, to reduce handling costs, yet, from what we know, handling costs in Europe are less than half what they are in Singapore or Dubai anyway, which adds up to a good deal lower."
"The intention is that they should stay that way, yet this proposal opens the door to the possibility of their being increased."
"Will this directive really get more service providers into ports?"
"I ask you to reconsider it, to withdraw it and put a better one before us."
"If it is thought through properly, you will get a majority for transparency and competition in Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a strong, continent-wide economy needs a port system rather than individual ports; it needs a system that will integrate the Europe of 25 and facilitate the transition from allowing competition to strengthening overall competitiveness."
"The directive does not achieve that aim and, at a time of profound European political crisis, that is a bad or, rather, a shocking sign of the gap between the institutions and the actual needs of the interests at stake in a globalised world. All these many interests can no longer be reconciled along old lines."
"Inappropriate signs like these have to be eliminated."
"What we need is a vision of a common port system, a common policy, and transparent guidelines for investments and state aid. Such guidelines must not confine themselves to prioritising competition among ports, but must be able to prevent the competitive disadvantages of some of these ports from weakening the whole system."
"We need protection for skilled labour that will eliminate social dumping and instead encourage joint training."
"We need to protect the efficiency of public services and to recognise their requirements in the areas of safety, quality and accessibility. Lastly, we need to assess the impact of liberalising the sector, because what we find most worrying at this point in time is the current trend towards concentrating production and logistics in certain ports around the world."
"These are the new challenges, and the directive does not meet them."
"What has happened between the first proposal in 2001 and this second one is not a good example of European politics."
"I repeat, however, that a directive and rules are needed, and achieving them will require a major political commitment that does not shrink from laying down common rules, notwithstanding the autonomy of the ports…"
"Mr President, the port services directive presented to us for the second time completely overlooks the general interest and the improvement of the living conditions of Europeans."
"What is worse, it only serves the financial interests of the large transnational freight companies, to the detriment of all the actors in the port sector, from the port worker to the small businessman."
"Its only aims are those of demolishing the statutes and social protection measures and dragging salaries down in order to make a minority rich, and this to the detriment of people’s safety and the environment."
"This directive’s social model is as good as the law of the jungle; self-handling is slavery reborn."
"All the technical-nautical professions and all the European trade unions unanimously reject this Bolkestein-style directive for the ports."
"Yesterday, I joined the 10 000 port workers from all over Europe in demonstrating before Parliament."
"I can bear witness to their determination to stand in the way of this monstrous directive."
"I can assure you that voting in favour of a directive such as this means taking responsibility for many of the Union’s ports being blocked by hard-line strikes, with all the economic consequences that such action entails."
"I, like others, would point out to the Commission that we, as the representatives of the nations of Europe, had already rejected this directive."
"To propose another, almost identical, version of it constitutes a political affront to Parliament and to the port authorities as a whole."
"For the sake of the construction of another Europe seeking a high level of social and democratic integration, we call for this directive to be rejected."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I wonder who wants this directive?"
"There is not a single port agency which is served by or which accepts this directive; all it serves is globalisation and the new order, which you are indeed monitoring and you are indeed following, by which I mean dumbing down."
"It flies in the face of logic and it flies in the face of Convention 137 of the International Dockworkers Council, which clearly states that priority must be given to skilled dockworkers."
"What are you trying to do?"
"Are you going to put cartels in the ports?"
"We in Greece have three-quarters of all the islands in Europe; in other words, we have most of the ports in Europe."
"We know how they operate."
"There is a positive modus operandi."
"We could have quicker results, but with people we know, people with experience."
"Are we going to put in unskilled workers to give us better results?"
"So why are you flying in the face of logic, democracy and the workers' interests?"
"We do not ultimately want an arbitrary Europe; we want a Europe of the peoples."
"Mr President, whenever there are demonstrations in front of our buildings, whether here in Strasbourg or in Brussels, we know that they have to do with the defence of existing interests, and if these demonstrations become violent, we know that the balance of these interests is very definitely the number one issue."
"It is, though, an unfortunate fact that the slogans and truncheons conceal the real alternatives."
"What this is all about, in essence, is not fundamental issues such as liberalisation, transparency and the like, but rather, as always, the details of the practical arrangements."
"That is why, in this debate on how to take this directive further, I am right alongside Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, in his desire to improve the Commission proposal, which, it has to be admitted, was not a good one."
"Nor am I greatly heartened by the slogan, ‘Back to the Start’; if we were to do that, we would simply be wasting a lot of time."
"The fact that people are calling for White Papers or even Green Papers is evidence of a desire in this House for five years’ rest from being Europe’s legislator."
"I see this debate as running parallel not only to the debate on the services directive that we are going to be having next month, but also to the debate on the constitution."
"There, too, the issue is not about whether Europe should or should not be ‘social’, but, in essence, about hundreds of details that go to make up a workable, better, shared Europe."
"The only thing is that there is no willingness to talk through these hundreds of details, no willingness to make the effort to seek and find consensus; instead, people would rather resort to slogans."
"They may attract the attention of the media, but they help nobody in this Europe in which we share to find their way to better and workable solutions."
"Mr President, it is a riddle to me why the European Commission should have put forward this proposal again."
"We hear of the significant resistance it is meeting, and Mr Barrot now has an opportunity to show that the EU is in step with our citizens by withdrawing this proposal."
"I think that there are three arguments for doing so."
"First and foremost, we do not need the directive."
"Many European ports are thriving, as I know is the case in, for example, my own country, Sweden."
"Ports are being developed, and there are many flexible solutions."
"What we need instead is a directive on competition between ports, as we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have also pointed out."
"This proposal by the Commission is for a piece of centralised European regulation."
"It is not about deregulation within the ports, as is being made out."
"It is a piece of centralised European regulation that we do not need because it would not lead to ports being developed. On the contrary, it might hinder their development."
"Unfortunately, it is not, then, out of concern for the ports and transportation that the European Commission has put forward this proposal."
"Such centralised regulations would make it more difficult for ports to carry on their activities."
"It would become more difficult to develop ports and transport systems because ports are transport hubs and combined terminals that have to be efficient if the whole transport system is also to be so."
"What would be best is to allow regional and local players to develop the ports."
"Finally, this ports directive would be bad for port workers."
"It is they who would have to pay the price for the centralised regulation proposed by the Commission."
"Many job opportunities would probably be lost, and a lot of activities transferred to the lease-in industry, the result being poorer conditions and less security for workers."
"It is for many good reasons, then, that I propose that Parliament reject this proposal."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we support the dock workers against this directive, which is wrong for employment, wrong for their right to safety and wrong for the economy itself, because it proposes competition based on dumping."
"It must therefore be rejected, as it was in 2003."
"We need to think about the kind of collapse to which free-market policies are leading."
"Dock work has a glorious, long-standing tradition, which has created rights and prosperity by linking trading activities with the towns that welcomed them."
"Without this noble work, which the directive would wipe out for the sake of free-market policies, there would be no future for Europe."
"The European social model is our chief resource, and this directive, just like the Bolkestein directive, is the negation of it."
"That is why I believe that the workers are right and that this Parliament should endorse their demands by rejecting the directive before us."
"Mr President, whilst we set out with a premature proposal by the committee, under Mr Jarzembowski’s leadership, a sound package of amendment proposals was thrashed out with built-in certainty, with more certainty for companies and port workers, and without self-handling."
"The news of this last aspect still does not seem to have got through to the trade union movement, or to some Members of this House for that matter."
"Sadly, battle and emotion appear to have prevailed over a sound discussion on content and, Commissioner, it is not what you say, it is the way you say it"
"It all stems from the Commission, your predecessor in fact, who started a flawed discussion."
"Why do you not withdraw this directive?"
"I would like you to explain this for me in a moment, for that would be the best solution all round."
"However, today’s political reality is that there is insufficient support for the hefty package of amendment proposals by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where it enjoyed a narrow majority."
"Since there is insufficient support for the package of amendment proposals, we cannot back this directive."
"I do remain convinced, though, that we need port policy specifically tailored to Europe."
"This has been amply clarified by Members of this House, first among them Mr Jarzembowski, with whom, and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have tabled a proposal."
"We would ask the Commissioner to present a document setting out its vision of port policy in the broadest sense, including competition between the ports, as a basis for what we hope will be a sound discussion this time."
"Are you prepared, Commissioner, to draft a substantive discussion document of that kind?"
"Would you also include the body of ideas from the package of amendment proposals, as prepared by Mr Jarzembowski?"
"Let us hope that that will prompt a sound discussion."
"Mr President, when the European Parliament threw out the proposed port services directive two years ago no one believed that the Commission would try to bring it back."
"Yet it did not consult, it would not listen and it decided to ignore this democratic parliament."
"Let us be very clear about the damage that this law, if adopted, would inflict on ports, including the east coast ports which I represent in this Parliament."
"Replacing highly skilled, trained staff with ships’ crew able to load and unload is a recipe for accidents, injury and, possibly, deaths."
"Compare that with the port of Tilbury, which achieved a 50% reduction in accidents in 2005, or Great Yarmouth, which has seen no reportable accidents for two years."
"I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this law would be devastating for jobs."
"Port owners tell me that over 600 new jobs at Felixstowe and over 750 new jobs at Harwich would all be threatened."
"Not one of 650 jobs at the port of Tilbury would be safe."
"That is what the port owners say themselves and these port owners would see their incentive for vital new investments destroyed."
"Already two new investment projects at Tilbury have been put on hold because of the uncertainty created by this directive."
"Port expansion at Bathside Bay, so recently approved at Harwich, and the positive decision we very much hope for this week for the Felixstowe South expansion, are both in jeopardy."
"I would say to the UK Independence Party, that represents GBP 1 billion of expenditure, if you check your figures; and we would not even have to be here now but for the fact that your members voted for this legislation in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"On investment again, in Great Yarmouth a campaign for more than a decade to build an outer harbour would see this put in competition with the existing inner harbour, substituting existing jobs rather than expanding jobs and services in an area recognised as a priority to tackle unemployment in the whole of the European Union."
"Make no mistake, it is skilled dock workers who would suffer most – people like Steven Drew from Yarmouth, sitting in the Public Gallery listening to this debate, who, together with his father Frank before him, have given 55 years’ combined service to the ports industry."
"Competition is needed between ports, not within them."
"The European Union should now do what it should have done before: consult ports, trade unions and shipping lines from scratch, starting with a blank sheet of paper, and on this proposal it should admit defeat."
"This European Parliament, having sought to reject this proposal once and for all, should now vote ‘no’ for a second time and never again."
"– As the previous speeches have shown, this proposal for a directive has caused huge controversy, which has extended way beyond this Chamber, covering many port operators and most workers in the sector."
"As regards the latter, I should like to state that we understand their protest but do not accept their violent methods."
"That said, the two committees called upon to give their opinions both declared their opposition to the proposal for a directive, thereby further securing its political fate."
"The importance of the port sector, Mr President, needs no added emphasis."
"We all know that almost all external trade in the EU is conducted through its ports and that the ports employ some 350 000 people directly, not to mention those employed indirectly in the sector."
"What is more, techniques for moving cargo and equipment are constantly evolving and this requires constant investment and renewal."
"The questions that arise are therefore the following:"
"Is the proposal for a directive conducive to investment, competition and access to the market?"
"Does it respect the rights acquired as regards current operators?"
"Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity?"
"Is it fair as regards compensation in the event of replacing providers?"
"Does it affect the labour market and the social rights of workers in the sector?"
"In a word, does it achieve the objectives of greater efficiency, better competition, more internal market and better services?"
"Mr Jarzembowski sought to find even-handed answers to these questions, and I therefore wish to congratulate him."
"It does strike me, however, that this proposal needs to be looked at again, in light of the conditions under which it has been presented by the Commission."
"What is needed is a political strategy which genuinely stimulates the development of Europe’s ports, as the rapporteur himself points out and amends, which takes account of the current state of affairs in the market and which involves all interested parties, naturally including Parliament."
"It is for you, Commissioner, to provide the answer."
"As far as we are concerned, it will obviously be much easier to make a decision in line with the stated objectives."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy also means that we should prune unnecessary and ineffectual legislation and not increase bureaucracy."
"European port services are already very competitive currently, both in terms of quality and charges."
"This does not represent a conflict between labour and capital because port owners, users and workers in different European countries regard the proposal as harmful, and not of any use."
"Competition for competition’s sake should be rejected and there needs to be greater focus on quality and safety."
"This directive will definitely not increase competition: on the contrary, it may even harm it."
"For example, the authorisation system will increase bureaucracy."
"An ILO Convention guarantees to give registered professional port workers priority for this kind of work, and in Finland this is reinforced in a collective bargaining agreement."
"The key factor is safety: would it be in the interests of health and safety at work if, after a hard day’s work, seafarers had to attend to the handling of yet another load in a foreign port?"
"Mr President, the basic issue in this debate is about whether, in this area as in all others, competition and new services are a good thing."
"It is about whether competition would cause matters to become worse for consumers, employees and businesses."
"To hear some of the debaters, one would think that the existence of competition and more companies is bad for the whole of society."
"We can, in fact, see how those European societies that have opened the doors to competition and new enterprise have seen services and businesses develop, with lower prices and better service for the consumer."
"We have seen this within area after area, including the telecommunications and aviation areas, and have heard the same cautionary arguments before deregulation has been implemented."
"I remember how, when telecommunications deregulation was, at one stage, debated, it was maintained in all seriousness that telephone calls would be a thing of the past and that those who worked within the industry would lose their jobs."
"In actual fact, there have been more jobs."
"When it comes to ports, which are so crucial to trade and development within the EU, it is obvious that the dynamic entailed in increased market access and in competition between and within ports will lead to a development of services."
"These things are crucial not only for enabling the ports industry as such to operate better but also because shipping, transport and trade will be more efficient."
"What is at issue here is not only the whole flow of goods in Europe, but also opportunities for new regions to develop – new ports and new structures in our economy."
"If we want to see competition, we shall also get to see new developments and change."
"Anyone who maintains that everything is already perfect and that our ports throughout Europe operate exactly as they should need not be afraid of competition."
"If we obtain new enterprise and new opportunities, things will happen."
"That is why the basic issue is that of whether we want, as I myself do, to see a more dynamic flow of goods in Europe."
"– Thank you Mr President."
"We are not talking here about containers; we are talking here about people, about my colleagues."
"This discussion is about a directive which, justifiably, the European Transport Workers Federation is calling unnecessary, provocative and unbalanced, and the port authorities and the industry also agree about this."
"It contains the worst elements of another proposal which this Parliament has already rejected."
"After that vote, instead of forgetting all about it or at least coming up with a decent proposal, the Commission took an even worse position."
"My vote will be against this directive because it undermines the rights which this category of workers, port workers, acquired with much difficulty in the course of a long period of time."
"I am going to vote against this directive because it opens the door for abuses in the way that certain workers are treated, as well as putting workers against each other."
"I am going to vote against this directive because it reduces the health and safety in such delicate areas as ports."
"When we boast so much here about health and safety, how can we do something which undermines it?"
"I am going to vote against this directive because I believe in balanced competition where everybody gives his share, and not where it is always the workers and the lower paid who have to pay."
"I believe that even those who are in favour of liberalisation of port services should vote to reject this directive. This is because a vote in favour would be opening the way for an original directive which even our colleagues seem to agree that it has a lot of shortcomings."
"Let us give a strong signal that we are building a social Europe and not a system without a conscience."
"The vote on the ports directive is a golden opportunity to give hope and direction to the many who are waiting for a move from an institution like ours."
"I am proud that the Maltese Labour Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are responding in a consistent way to this call."
"To the millions of European workers, among them hundreds of Maltese workers represented by the General Workers Union, and who are also here today and who are affected by this directive, we want to let them know that we are solidly behind them."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a few technical considerations."
"Above all, it seems that this proposal does not take account of the Green Paper being prepared by the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Barrot."
"We should take the opportunity offered by this initiative to examine the new supply of services from the countries that have recently joined, and we should compare the national legal requirements on costs to be borne by the goods, so that free-market conditions can effectively prevail."
"It seems to me that the directive before us runs absolutely counter to competition and market rules, in that it allows the large companies operating in northern European ports to set up oligopolies, in contrast to the different situation in Mediterranean ports, and above all it leaves us open to attack from the major East Asian companies, which are invading our port system."
"We must certainly compare the effects of state aid policies on competition and clarify the concept and practical applicability of such aid, particularly as regards concessionary leases and other means of allowing a provider of services to provide them as a public service subject to public rules."
"Above all, this directive includes no comparison of the environmental protection rules for carrying out new infrastructure works, or of waste disposal policies."
"We have to clarify the rules on competitiveness in view of the risk of unfair competition from the East and, even more importantly, we must reaffirm the environmental guarantees for the Mediterranean, which is under attack by operators who do not respect Community environmental legislation."
"Self-handling is a very serious threat to the small and medium-sized enterprises operating within our ports."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has retabled the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services, but without taking account of why it was rejected by Parliament in 2003."
"Today's proposal for a directive is basically no different from the previous one."
"It maintains the provision of self-service, which is out of keeping with the modern working conditions needed in European ports in the sectors of hygiene, safety and quality of port services."
"Where, in truth, are the proposals for the proper layout of ports?"
"Where are the proposals for modernising the overall functioning of ports?"
"We have not heard the old call for exemption from the scope of the directive for pilot services, which are not a commercial activity but constitute a public service, the objective of which is the safety of shipping and the protection of ports and the marine environment."
"Nor did we hear about the efforts made by the members of the committee in order to improve the proposal of the European Commission, despite Mr Jarzembowski's honourable efforts."
"The lack of policy will result in a long period of uncertainty and, of course, there will be no investment climate."
"The best proposal is to withdraw it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not question the need for a directive or the need to pave the way for liberalisation. This proposal for a directive, however, has been framed in a similar way to the one that was rejected in the House in November 2003, and does not take account of Parliament’s recommendations."
"Furthermore, there are legal inconsistencies in the proposed directive in relation to the international and Community regulatory framework."
"Firstly, it fails to guarantee compatibility with the ongoing proposed review of Regulation (EEC) No 1191 of the Council concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service. It also fails to take into account the specific characteristics of each individual port, not least ports in the outermost regions, where public services are vital to the survival of communities and where forced liberalisation can lead to socially and economically unacceptable monopolies."
"The proposal for a directive before us is already unacceptable, but the report makes matters worse by increasing deregulation and by creating problems relating to security, to guarantees of public services, to the efficient operation of port services, and to the safeguarding of social rights, arising from the proposal to extend self-handling without any regulation."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that this proposal for a directive should be withdrawn and subsequently replaced by another that takes account of Parliament’s recommendations …"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Estonia is a maritime country, and port services represent a large proportion of our gross national product."
"The implementation of the Port Services Directive would not lead to big changes for us."
"The port services market was liberalised soon after Estonia gained its freedom from the Soviet command economy."
"The directive proposed by the European Commission broadly interferes in details, such as the licensing process and the duration of contracts, while leaving responsibility in important areas to the Member States."
"Uniform and clear standards concerning quality, environment and safety would be more useful for improving competition in the internal market than detailed regulations."
"I also share the fears of the port workers of old Europe."
"It appears that the Commission wishes to achieve an increase in efficiency mainly at the expense of qualified workers."
"Let it be said that the ports of my homeland Estonia, in the so-called ‘new Europe’, compete on quality, not cheap labour."
"I am certain that the intellectual potential of the European Union could produce a much better directive."
"The Commission should make use of this opportunity."
"Commissioner, I regret to say that I will vote against this directive tomorrow."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, even though the debate was not a chorus of praise, I have listened very carefully to each and every one of you."
"Firstly, it is useful to point out the background to this proposal, which in fact came from the previous Commission and from my predecessor."
"Nevertheless, I can understand that Parliament might have been surprised, Mr President, that this proposal was presented to it again and I can understand that this move might have shocked some of you."
"I would simply like to raise some points that – without justifying it – also explain the reason why this proposal is back on the table."
"Firstly, it is because, despite everything, we feel the need which some of you have highlighted to have a clear legal framework in order to promote port investments."
"Ninety percent of our European exports pass through our ports."
"We need efficient and modern ports."
"Secondly, this proposal was re-presented with very strict limits on self-handling, which had undoubtedly been the subject of the most serious criticism at the time of first reading."
"Thirdly, as someone who has exercised social responsibilities, I cannot all the same let it be said that this proposal would violate all the social rights existing in the port sector."
"It was not the Commission’s intention to reduce the social rights of workers in this sector."
"The Commission has even included in its proposal an obligation for all the providers of port services to receive an authorisation forcing them to comply with the minimum rules of Community social law."
"Furthermore, Article 4 of the proposal constitutes a safeguard by stipulating that the directive will in no way affect the application of national legislation on the employment of personnel."
"I will put it very simply, ladies and gentlemen: I would never have re-presented this proposal if I, personally, had felt it presented such serious risks as some of you believed it did."
"Nevertheless, I must say that the debate has all the same been useful and it has shed some light on all the aspects of a port policy which cannot, in fact, be merely reduced to the subject of this text."
"Many of you pointed out that other problems were very important. These include greater transparency with regard to the costs of services, the introduction of fairer competition between our ports and the need to boost investments in order to further increase the capacities of our ports."
"I am therefore well aware that a port policy cannot be reduced to a text of this type and, in this regard, the debate has been very useful."
"Another thing the debate has done is to highlight the very diverse situations of Europe’s ports, even though I had already become aware of that state of affairs in this, my first year as Commissioner for Transport."
"In this regard, we are also coming up against a problem."
"Some of you rightly emphasised that it was impossible to deal with the fact that situations differ so greatly from one port to the next by focusing too much on centralisation, and I admit that you are right."
"We are also faced with the high-speed development of the technologies used in the ports, which also brings a factor into play not present in the situation that prevailed when this proposal for a directive was devised."
"I would say both that the debate was useful and that your committee has done a really good job."
"It is true that I will give my full agreement in advance if Parliament goes as far as to discuss the amendments tabled by its committee. I am in favour of extending the expiry dates for the authorisations."
"I am in favour of the transitional measures, Mr Jarzembowski. I am also in favour of the compromise amendments on the protection of investments made prior to the entry into force of the directive, provided, of course, that the stated aims, that is to say non-discriminatory and fair market access for all, are observed."
"It is quite clear – and here we are faced with a paradox – that the Commissioner addressing you had hoped that you would reach a verdict on the text amended by your committee."
"The paradox is that you are going to have to reach a verdict on the initial text."
"Well, you will not criticise me for having faith in Parliament when I say that, in this area and with regard to this text, I believed that the improvements made by Parliament were excellent and in fact made it possible to respond to a number of valid criticisms."
"That is the situation, however."
"I am aware that there are two schools of thought among you."
"There are those who say that the initial text is not amendable, and then there are those who say that it could be corrected."
"That is your rapporteur’s theory."
"Mr President, my task is a difficult one."
"I want to affirm my respect for Parliament: on the one hand, I have to respect the work done by your committee and, on the other hand, I also have to respect the opinion that will be expressed during a vote."
"Is it not in fact sensible to wait for the vote so that I can draw all the necessary conclusions?"
"It seems to me that, in a healthy democracy, there can be the opportunity to vote. That is what I believe, and I am not offending Parliament when I tell it to reach a verdict, while I perhaps regret the fact that this procedure does not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that has been improved – I have no hesitation in saying this – by the committee."
"Be that as it may, Mr President – and I say this somewhat solemnly – on having listened carefully to this entire debate, it is quite clear that I will draw all the necessary conclusions from tomorrow’s vote by Parliament."
"I believe that doing so is a way of respecting Parliament and I acknowledge the strength of a number of arguments, which will enable me, I might add, to better devise an overall port policy for Europe."
"I wish to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and, once again, I undertake to do only one thing: to draw the necessary conclusions from your votes, once they have been cast."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday – therefore tomorrow – at 12 noon. It is up to you to draw all the necessary conclusions from it."
"In quashing this second proposal for a directive, before our first reading and notwithstanding the fact that the Jarzembowski report brought about some real progress and constituted a solid base from which to work, the left and certain trade unions are going to plunge the port services back into a situation of legal uncertainty and political instability."
"The withdrawal of self-handling and the recognition of criteria relating to maritime safety and to professional qualifications in the selection procedure for service providers were advances on the first proposal for a directive."
"European ports have to invest if they are to develop and respond to the increase in maritime traffic."
"A port like Marseilles needs European competition that is fair and equitable if it is to defend its assets and its jobs."
"Our Community fleet needs efficient and competitive port services."
"This proposal, while admittedly imperfect, would have brought legal certainty and stability to a booming sector."
"I remain opposed to the rejection of the text, an action that amounts to our abandoning our responsibilities."
"If the text were to be rejected, then I should like the Commission to propose a Green Paper on port policy and to consult all of the parties concerned."
"I will conclude by thanking the French law enforcement agencies, which kept Parliament safe in the face of yesterday’s intolerable demonstrations."
". – The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report by Mr El Khadraoui (A6-0403/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on developing the agenda for the Community’s external aviation policy (2005/2084(INI)); and"
"- the report by Mr Zīle (A6-0375/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport (2005/2085(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their good cooperation."
"Although we did not see eye to eye in every respect, I do think we managed to agree on the essence, and we will in that way help bring about a European strategy on a subject that is only set to increase in importance in the next few years."
"As you know, this discussion was sparked by the famous 2002 open skies judgment by the Court of Justice, from which it was evident that the European Community has exclusive competence in international airline services, more specifically automated booking systems, intra-Community ticket prices and the distribution of slots or landing rights."
"All existing bilateral aviation agreements between the Member States and third countries must be brought into line with the judgment, with the consequence that no fewer than 2 000 aviation agreements across the entire Union are up for review."
"There are two ways of going about this."
"Either the Member States take it upon themselves to hold bilateral negotiations with third countries in order to bring their bilateral agreements into line with Community law (58 agreements were harmonised in this way), or negotiations are held at Community level under the so-called horizontal mandate. So far, 22 countries have already accepted horizontal agreements with the Community, as a result of which 327 bilateral agreements have been adapted."
"This brings the total to 385 agreements, which means that there is still a long way to go before all 2 000 agreements are amended."
"I therefore make a case in my report for bringing all bilateral agreements into line with the open skies judgments as soon as possible in order to avoid legal uncertainty."
"I personally prefer Community agreements, since one set of negotiations is enough to replace all existing bilateral agreements with a particular country in one fell swoop."
"After all, the European Community can throw far more weight into the balance during negotiations than can, for example, a Member State on its own, but this does require common, cohesive vision."
"I would stress that we should conclude agreements with our key partners and up-and-coming countries, such as China, the United States and Russia, as soon as possible, whilst not forgetting our immediate neighbours."
"That is important for economic reasons, as well as political reasons in terms of aviation, such as safety and security, and that is why I have tabled an amendment on this very topic in readiness for today’s vote."
"When Community agreements are concluded, it is crucial that the European Community should consider three major factors."
"Firstly, the agreements must be balanced, and equivalent access to each other’s markets is important."
"This means that aspects such as landing rights, rights to cabotage, equal establishment and ownership rights, as well as state aid must be taken into account."
"I tabled an amendment before today’s sitting to ensure that the issue of state aid will be added to the list."
"That is not unimportant in view of the tougher security measures that were imposed on all airline companies in the United States following 11 September, with the US Government providing funding for US airline companies but not for the others, which amounts to distortion of competition."
"Secondly, my report underlines the fact that the opening up of markets should always be preceded by convergence of regulations, and the need for the degree of liberalisation to be coupled to fair and competitive conditions."
"The European Union is either working on, or already has, rules on social matters surrounding safety, security, the environment, state aid and competition."
"It is unacceptable that these high standards should be eroded by the advent of market operators bound by less stringent rules."
"Certainly in open skies agreements, where it would be possible for airline companies of the European Union and third countries to have unrestricted access to each other’s markets, it is essential that there is a level playing field between the legislation of both parties."
"Otherwise, we could end up with distortion of competition and there is also the risk of relocation, as a result of which European airline companies would move to states with less clear-cut rules."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment to include the convergence of regulations surrounding security, state support and competition in my report, so that regulatory convergence will take place in those areas too."
"If it proves impossible to reach an open skies agreement, the Commission would then be asked to develop fair and transparent mechanisms for dividing up traffic rights among the Member States."
"Thirdly and lastly, the Commission should also consult and inform all parties involved in the aviation industry and the European Parliament during the negotiations about the many fresh aviation agreements which will be concluded between Europe and the rest of the world in the next few years."
"These three important factors are also reflected in Mr Zīle’s report with regard to Russia and China."
"Here too, the principle of reciprocity must apply."
"The high levies which Russia demands for flying over Siberia must be abolished."
"Asia, after all, is gaining in importance, and the shortest route to fly to it is still via the Russian Federation."
"Mr Zīle, therefore, also deserves all our support."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and those who put forward motions on the European Commission’s report; as a result of this, in my view, we in the Committee on Transport and Tourism managed to achieve a good result."
"I think that we all had a common goal to give those from the European Commission that are conducting talks both with Russia and with China something to work with and, of course, also to send a political signal to the Council for the giving of a mandate."
"In these terms too, in my view, we managed to formulate a very clear position on the most essential issues."
"With regard to relations with China, taking into account the rapidly growing Chinese aviation market in ten years’ time, for example, China will be the largest market in Asia for cargo flights we had several principles in our work."
"Firstly, there needs to be swift progress in creating a comprehensive aviation agreement between the European Union and China."
"Secondly, the agreement would have to be based, of course, on a horizontal agreement."
"As Mr El Khadraoui, my colleague, just mentioned, we would very much like to see very rapid development on this foundation in relations with China."
"Thirdly, at the same time as preparing a comprehensive agreement we would like to see an extension of the mandate, so that it would also cover requirements for the safety infrastructure of airports and for the quality of China’s air traffic control."
"Fourthly, the report placed particular emphasis on the need to achieve a result without delay in the field of air cargo transportation that would allow European companies to compete sooner in the potentially largest Asian air cargo market."
"With regard to Russia, the most important aspect is that the Transport Committee regarded as totally unacceptable the practice whereby each year Russia, in contravention of the Chicago Convention, of which Russia itself is a signatory, collects from European Union airlines more than EUR 250 million for overflights of Siberia."
"Most of this money is invested in the Russian airline Aeroflot, which thus makes over USD 100 million profit per annum and is enabled to retain approximately 38% of the air transportation market between the European Union and Russia."
"I am pleased that my colleagues on the Transport Committee considered that the European Commission ought to be far tougher in talks with Russia, both within the framework of the World Trade Organisation and on projects for aviation modernisation."
"In our view, it is unacceptable for these payments to continue as they are and in a very non-transparent form until 2013."
"In addition, for many European airlines these payments create discriminatory obstacles when it comes to acquiring parts of the previously mentioned Chinese market."
"The expression in the draft motion for a resolution is even stronger no other forms of payment to replace the Siberian overflight charges are acceptable to the European Parliament."
"We in the Transport Committee also considered that in talks between the European Union and Russia all European Union airlines must be given equal non-discriminatory legal status in order to enable them to acquire permanent take-off and landing rights at Russian airports."
"Finally, may I say that we in the committee would like to see more information both about negotiations and about their status, which would thus give the European Parliament the opportunity better to defend the interests of Europeans both airlines and passengers in the sphere of other countries’ aviation markets."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely wish to thank Mr El Khadraoui and Mr Zīle for their work and for the spirit of cooperation that has governed our work."
"I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for having put a great deal of effort into this important debate."
"I would point out, Mr President, that this debate is timely, given that I have to prepare new aviation agreements during 2006."
"It was very helpful to have Parliament enlighten me on the Community’s external policy in the field of air transport."
"These two reports genuinely constitute an important contribution to the interinstitutional dialogue on Community action in this field."
"Throughout the past 20 years, the Community has seen its responsibilities increase in the aviation sector."
"The Member States have brought down the barriers of their national markets in order to have only one market now – the Community market – which is henceforth based on a full set of common rules, including in fields such as security, safety or air traffic management."
"This Community governed by the rule of law is the foundation of a market that has become increasingly important as the years have gone by."
"There are now 600 million passengers and 60 million tonnes of goods transported each year."
"To go from a bilateral system between states to one of agreements negotiated at Community level provides new and significant prospects, thanks to the opportunities afforded by the large European market and to the opportunities for developing cooperation in the Community."
"This transition from a bilateral system to a Community system also constitutes a legal requirement in terms of ensuring that our regulatory acquis is recognised and respected in the aviation sector."
"Mr El Khadraoui’s report addresses a series of key problems for our policy."
"Firstly, the importance of taking steps to align the bilateral agreements, which, ever since the Court judgments, have been the subject of legal uncertainty."
"Mr El Khadraoui, we are engaged in this task alongside the Member States in a spirit of close cooperation and using all the levers provided by the EU’s external policy."
"Secondly, you highlighted the need – and I thank you for doing so – always to respect the following dual objective: the opening up of markets and regulatory convergence."
"This priority accorded to regulatory convergence enables us to develop our international activities and the international activities of our industry in an environment of healthy and fair competition."
"We must simultaneously pursue both of these objectives."
"The efficiency and credibility of the Community in the negotiations depends on our doing so."
"Finally, this regulatory cooperation has to rely as far as possible on technical cooperation in order to guarantee a high level of convergence in such vital areas as security and safety, not forgetting, of course, in the problematic environmental and social areas that form part of our European social model."
"With Parliament’s support, we are going to continue to call for new negotiating mandates."
"The integration of Ukraine into the European area, an agreement with Australia and Chile and the start of negotiations with China and India will be the priorities for 2006."
"China and Russia are the subjects of two communications by the Commission, on which Mr Zīle’s report is based."
"I will begin with Russia and with the issue of Siberian overflights."
"I should like to thank you for your support on this issue and for your very legitimate demands."
"We are determined to put a stop to these charges, which clearly contravene all international rules, and, before contemplating a comprehensive aviation agreement with Russia, we need to resolve this specific issue by also taking into account Russia’s willingness to join the WTO."
"I have been increasing the tempo of the negotiations with the Russian Government over the past few months."
"The issue was brought up during the EU-Russia Summit in October following a letter sent by Mr Barroso to Mr Putin."
"I have had two meetings with the Russian Transport Minister, Mr Igor Levitin, during which I laid a great deal of emphasis on the urgent need for a solution."
"We are resolute in our position: we are calling on the Russian Government to establish a transparent and non-discriminatory system and gradually to reduce the charges before they stop altogether in 2013, which was the date agreed in 2004 between the Russian Government and the Commission."
"Finally, we are calling for the restrictions on the number of Siberian overflights by European airlines to be abolished."
"Through lack of sufficient reactions on the part of the Russian Government at this stage, we need to bring up this issue at all levels."
"A solution needs to be found to this issue before Russia enters the WTO."
"As regards the booming Chinese market, there are obvious advantages to a Community approach, as Mr Zīle demonstrated."
"The prospect of an agreement with China is crucial for European operators in the long term."
"Yet, our approach with regard to China needs to be gradual and methodical in order to strengthen our cooperation, while developing a level of regulatory convergence that is acceptable to our industry."
"The first phase of negotiations must unquestionably be devoted to improving the regulatory framework and the conditions relating to commercial operation."
"Our airlines are suffering from unjustifiable restrictions that must be lifted immediately."
"These aspects related to ‘doing business’ will be our priority."
"In any event, Mr President, I should very much like to thank the European Parliament for its contribution to the success of these important negotiations, which will enable the European Union to increase the opportunities for its air transport industry, which I believe is an industry that deserves credit for creating jobs in Europe and for showing us a particularly dynamic side to Europe and a Europe in which the development of transport goes hand in hand with a high level of security and with high-quality transport."
"I should once again like to thank Mr El Khadraoui and Mr Zīle, and I should also like to thank your committee."
". Mr President, I express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, for his extremely thorough work."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism accepted his report as an appropriate compromise."
"Therefore, on behalf of myself and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express the opinion that the report basically corresponds with the position of Parliament."
"In laying down the general principles, we have correctly emphasised that when, in accordance with the ruling of the Court, an issue falls within the competence of the Community, any type of discrimination between partners within the Community must be pragmatically excluded, on the one hand, and ‘open sky’ agreements should be concluded, to the extent that it is possible, on the other hand."
"Existing bilateral agreements can now be harmonised using this dual approach."
"At the same time, it still remains to be decided how we are going to divide between Member States the number of flights that will now be negotiated with foreign partners, in cases when the number of flights is limited."
"The Commission will soon have to submit a concrete paper on this sensitive issue to Parliament."
"In addition to this, I believe that another important principle is found in the approach of the Commission and Parliament, which emphasises the necessity of increased technical harmonisation with external partners."
"This is how we can primarily help maintain flight safety, the cornerstone of our foreign policy, and this is how we can indirectly facilitate the implementation of environmental and competition priorities."
"However, I do not agree with ideas of extending European or mainly Member State social rights to agreements concluded with third countries, and to aircraft flying under the flags of other nations."
"Let them comply with the provisions of the internationally applicable labour law and safety and competition standards."
"Anything more than this even within the European Union would only increase the unnecessary publicity campaign against new Member States, under the pretext of the non-existent social dumping."
"I also reject the taxation of air transport for reasons of environmental protection, since on the one hand there is no compulsory international regulation in this respect, and on the other hand, this competitive sector must finance itself, including airports, from its own revenues."
"The best environmental protection is to ensure the development of technical safety, not to impose new tax burdens."
"We have only accepted the inclusion of air transport in the Emission Trading Scheme as part of the compromise, but direct taxation is out of the question."
"As a Member coming from a new Member State, it is particularly important to me that neighbouring regions, the Balkans and large market partners such as China, the USA and Russia enjoy priority."
"Finally, I would like to say that in order to ensure transparency of negotiations, Parliament should be continuously involved in the negotiation rounds."
". Mr President, I should like to start by saying that Mr Zīle and Mr El Khadraoui have both tabled excellent reports, for which I should like to thank them."
"The fact that we are considering these reports together is also good news, since it will give an idea of our policy on civil aviation in general, and in particular with regard to China and Russia."
"The latter are key countries in economic, political and population terms, and also countries where aviation is developing at a very fast pace."
"The report tabled by Mr El Khadraoui provides us with a basis for a common EU aviation policy towards the rest of the world."
"This will place the EU in a stronger position, and my group very much welcomes this approach."
"Mr Zīle stressed in his report that the Committee on Transport and Tourism did not have access to the negotiating mandate beforehand, and I can assure the Commissioner that the Commission will be asked to be more open towards Parliament as far as negotiating mandates are concerned."
"We believe that the position on Russia outlined in Parliament’s report is ‘friendly but firm’, and I am delighted that the Commissioner too has expressed his support for such an approach."
"We agree entirely with the demands made regarding service quality standards, environmental protection, technical equipment for airports and air traffic control, including safety issues."
"We are fundamentally opposed to charges for flights over Siberia, and we believe that this issue should be resolved along with the other matters that will be negotiated with Russia."
"We would stress that the principle of mutuality needs to be observed, in relations with both Russia and China."
"This holds particularly true when it comes to debates on the rules ensuring a common level playing field for competition in the field of aviation for the EU Member States, and also for Russian and Chinese operators."
"I am therefore very much in favour of these two reports being adopted, and the rapporteurs deserve our thanks for their work."
"I am also delighted that the positions of the Commission, the Commissioner and Parliament coincide in a great many respects."
". That air transport is one of the major sectors that has an impact on growth is not a matter of dispute, and it is something of which we have all been made aware during the debate on these two reports."
"Particularly intensive consideration has been given to two issues, namely flight safety and, of course, the protection of the environment."
"Where flight safety is concerned, there is an urgent need for reciprocal rights of inspection, not least within the SAFA (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme), along with something that is an important step into the future, and one that we in this House have already discussed, that being the training of inspection staff and the exchange of information with third countries."
"It has to be said, though, that air transport has played just as significant a part in frustrating the achievement of the Kyoto target."
"If no action is taken, air transport will claim for itself all the room for manoeuvre in emissions accorded by the Kyoto Protocol in which the other sectors have made reductions."
"What that means is that industry has reduced emissions; private households have reduced emissions, and air transport will use them up unless we take action."
"That is why the debate on possible courses of action – whether these be fiscal in nature or involve emissions trading – must remain open-ended."
"That is a question to which we will have to address ourselves if we want to take Kyoto seriously."
"At the same time, we have to raise – not least at the international level – the issues of noise pollution and regionally-adapted bans on night flights, and make social dumping impossible."
"Within the ‘open sky’, though – where important actions have already been taken – Europe needs to speak with confidence and a single voice if balance is to be maintained and no one nation or group of nations is to enjoy advantages in global competition that are denied to others."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, aviation in general has been a life-long interest of mine, if not to say passion, and it is 40 years since I started flying myself."
"I always have been and still am proud of the fact that this field of human endeavour – and I refer in particular to air travel – can serve as an example of effective and broad-based international cooperation, in which such things as ideological differences are overlooked."
"Amongst other things, this ensures that air travel is in fact the safest form of transportation."
"For these reasons in particular, I will on the whole be happy to vote in favour of today’s reports."
"Their aim is to step up international cooperation, which will help make aviation better, safer and more efficient."
"I cannot, however, lend my full backing to one of the reports on account of the recommendation made in it to block Russia’s accession to the WTO, because charges for flying over Siberia have not been abolished."
"Let there be no mistake;"
"I am not an advocate of the charges as such, since they do not represent a logical solution."
"As I see it, however, it is intolerable that what amounts to a threat should be used against a sovereign state and that one obstacle should effectively be removed in order to make way for another that in my opinion is much more serious."
"I am in favour of tough and transparent negotiations, but they should be negotiations nonetheless."
". Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to the two rapporteurs for their work and also to congratulate them."
"It is good news that the EU’s proposal for a Community aviation policy takes into account economic, technical, legal, social and environmental concerns, without neglecting safety requirements."
"The importance of these latter becomes particularly apparent in the event of accidents, poor weather conditions or strikes, or whenever there is an escalation of the terrorist threat."
"I would add that passengers must not be treated as a necessary evil whenever such situations arise, which unfortunately is what happens at present."
"I should like to touch briefly upon a number of key issues."
"In view of the ‘open skies’ policy, I believe it would be useful to increase the number of airports in those EU Member States that serve as hubs for international flights."
"This would make it a great deal easier to transport both passengers and goods."
"Wherever appropriate, EU funds should be used to modernise airports, and I am delighted that an announcement has been made to this effect."
"Secondly, a similar level of services should be offered to EU citizens when checking in at any airport and the same should apply to the service culture and to flights to locations outside the EU."
"Thirdly, there should be a guarantee that appropriate conditions will be in place for disabled air passengers both within and outside the EU, and indeed we held a debate on this matter only a few weeks ago."
"Fourthly, the Community as a whole should be involved in negotiating such issues as charges for flights over Russian territory, and in fact these charges should be abolished without delay."
"Fifthly, I would suggest that all planes used by EU airlines, regardless of where they have been manufactured, should employ similar technological solutions in terms of passenger safety."
"I should like to conclude by saying that carriers should be encouraged to step up their cooperation with each other."
"This cooperation should cover price and schedule flexibility, since the goal should be for passengers to feel as though they are the focus of the carrier’s activities, and not a troublesome piece of freight, as is sometimes the case."
"Mr President, Commissioner for Transport, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking as rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the report on the European Union’s relations with Russia and China in the field of air transport."
"I would like once again to tell you about the conclusions we originally reached in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteurs, both Mr El Khadraoui and Mr Zīle."
"I believe, Mr Zīle, that your work has been entirely positive, since it has allowed all of the parliamentary groups to appreciate the scope of this proposal and the need to create a genuine common air space in order to consolidate our position in the world."
"The European Union must create closer ties with its partners, which include Russia and China."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a priority for the European Union, not just as a neighbouring country, but also for a series of reasons relating specifically to it, both from economic and political points of view."
"With 75% of external passenger traffic destined for the European Community, the European Union must be able to present our Russian partners with a proposal aimed at a future global agreement in the aviation sector, which, we believe, must be implemented in phases and once the problem of the payment of rights to fly over Siberia has been resolved."
"This last issue, ladies and gentlemen, is a genuine obstacle to the beginning of negotiations and we believe that the European Union must maintain a very firm and demanding position towards our Russian partners."
"In this regard, we are pleased with the words expressed here this morning by Commissioner Barrot."
"With regard to China, we are also in favour of reaching a global agreement, since China offers immense market opportunities to the European Union."
"Over the coming years, the Chinese giant is expected to show a sustained growth in the commercial aviation sector of between approximately 9% and 15%."
"Furthermore, China is carrying out a process of reform and liberalisation in its aviation sector, facilitating foreign investments and implementing a significant airport construction programme."
"Nevertheless, in order to begin negotiations successfully with our Chinese partners, China must firstly reach a horizontal agreement with the European Union and resolve the problem of overflying Siberia, which European airlines are obliged to do in order to reach China."
"Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to seize the opportunity to sincerely congratulate the rapporteurs on the work they have done."
"Reform of international air transport must also, I think, make it possible to establish a common aviation area with uniform standards."
"Considerations such as the efficiency and safety of flights are not just a contribution to the EU’s neighbourhood policy, but are also very emphatically in our own interests."
"It is, therefore, of enormous importance in the interests of our own safety that uniform air safety standards be incorporated in any new air traffic agreements with third countries, for this is the only way in which future air disasters can be prevented and a uniformly high safety standard guaranteed."
"We have to consider, though, the possibility of support being made available to those states that are unable to meet these technical standards."
"What matters is not just compliance with common rules in the field of aviation safety, but also, and above all, with those relating to social and environmental policy."
"There are few, if any, references to such rules in the bilateral agreements currently in force."
"Under no circumstances must the opening up of the aviation area be accomplished to the detriment of workers who may, in third countries, be employed under less stringent social security regulations."
"Were that to be the case, it would mean not least a considerable risk to safety if these workers were to perform their duties under intolerable conditions."
"If all those who become active in the market do so subject to the same rules, then there is no likelihood, in future, of safety in the air losing out as a result of social dumping."
"Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, of course, do no other than agree with those members of my own group who have already spoken, whilst extending my thanks to both rapporteurs."
"There is one point I would particularly like to highlight."
"It is a very good thing that there should be such agreement on this issue within this House and with the Commission, and I am very happy about that."
"I would like to point out, though, that not all the Member States take the same positive view as we do of this idea of a single aviation policy to the benefit of our airlines, those who work for them and those who travel with them, and there are airlines that are often happier to be represented in their dealings with third countries by their national governments rather than by the Commission."
"That is why we must take care that the Commission’s negotiations with such third countries as, for example, the USA, provide the Member States with evidence that a single European aviation policy is preferable to 25 different policies on aviation with reference to third countries."
"This is a dimension of which we must never lose sight."
"We are convinced that it is right and in the interests of the industry, workers in it and of airline passengers, to pursue a single policy with regard to third countries."
"Several governments, though, remain to be persuaded that this is indeed the case."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Zīle and Mr El Khadraoui. I would like to congratulate the latter on his excellent work, which is particularly significant as a milestone on the road towards the creation of single skies between the European Union and third countries, and which will now enable us to reflect upon what has been achieved and the challenges that remain, and which require certain conditions of social and environmental equality."
"Furthermore, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner, who, with admirable diligence, is successfully fulfilling the Community mandate and who, by gradually overcoming obsolete and increasingly inefficient bilateralism, is enabling us to take forward the initiative that often increases our credibility in the negotiations aimed at creating European single skies. In this regard, his particular reference to the move from national airlines to European airlines is extremely hopeful."
"I would, however, like to stress certain aspects that are of concern to us; mainly the delay in the agreement with the United States."
"We know that this is a well-known delaying tactic in negotiations: while hoping to acquire greater benefits, in the end they must join in with everybody else."
"The Kyoto Protocol has demonstrated this."
"We would therefore urge you to be firmer in this regard."
"Furthermore, I would like to stress the need to overcome bilateralism in the negotiation with Russia and, of course, its unacceptable policy of surcharging, which is entirely contrary to international legislation."
"These are lessons that we will clearly have to apply to the negotiation underway with China."
"We would also like the strengthened European Air Safety Agency to have an agreed and unequivocal means of coordinating with Eurocontrol, in order to overcome the apparent conflict between the two bodies, which could turn out to be contradictory."
"Finally, I would like to say that, in the case of the application that is taking place within the agreements or the requirement for environmental rules and legislation on social rights, we would like this negotiation to move increasingly towards international rules that are closer to the stricter European rules, in other words, they should be harmonised upwards."
"In this regard, I would like the Commissioner to tell us about the current situation of the conversion of the JAR OPS to EU OPS, that is to say, all the rules on flying times and rest times following the agreement reached in the Council, which we also believe to be important within the framework of the negotiation of the Union’s foreign policy in the aviation field."
"– Mr President, the own-initiative report by Mr Zīle gives a complete picture of relations between the European Union and the People's Republic of China and Russia in the field of air transport."
"However, the important thing is the differences which exist as far as flights over the territory of the two countries are concerned."
"As the rapporteur rightly points out, on the one hand we have the process of developing, modernising and liberalising Chinese civil aviation, which is well under way; on the other hand, however, in the case of Russia, problems persist, mainly as regards the point that, contrary to competition law, all efforts to manage and control air traffic are being used in an effort to subsidise Russian airlines."
"In both cases, the interventions by Commissioner Barrot are considered to be catalytic, although so far, in the second case, the issues pending still remain."
"In the case of the People's Republic of China, I welcome its progress, especially its adaptation to the rules of good cooperation with the European Union, the main features of which are the opening up of air corridors by its government to European companies, in order to serve fully passengers and the movement of freight by increasing flights."
"As a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and the People's Republic of China, I welcome the Commissioner's general stand, especially the action by Commissioner Barrot towards the completion of agreements on flights, although I would point out that, for Parliament, it would be logical for it to have access to the terms of the negotiating mandate which the Commission is seeking from the Council in relation to China."
"Finally, I agree with the rapporteur that an overall agreement with Russia should not be concluded unless a resolution is found to the problem of flights over Siberia which makes provision for the abolition of overflight charges."
"I hope that we shall reach the most harmonious of agreements, because both sides, Russia and the European Union, need each other within the framework of the general interests of our peoples."
"Mr President, I have three comments to make."
"The first is that, while we welcome the Commission’s move towards the progressive extension of Community agreements with third countries, the far-reaching effects on the transport sector as a whole, on the environment and on competition and the internal market prompt me to urge you to again consider whether foreign policy as it relates to air transport ought not really to be dealt with via the codecision procedure."
"Secondly, what we expect of the Commission is not only that it should set out its strategic approach, but also that it should draw up a list of countries with which an agreement is a priority and seek to conclude one with them."
"The Commissioner briefly sketched out what this might be like earlier on."
"Thirdly, all agreements must be guided by the principle that the first priority is the mutual opening up of markets on an equal basis, it should be borne in mind in the current negotiations with Russia and China that, if the problem with Russia relating to the overflight charges is not sorted out first, an agreement with China would go against the requirement for reciprocity, for the overflight conditions Russia imposes on China are not the same as those imposed on the European airlines, and that is something we cannot accept."
"Mr President, I too should like to join with all those colleagues who have remarked on the excellent work of the rapporteurs, Mr El Khadraoui and Mr Zīle."
"I support the view of the rapporteur concerning the necessity of developing a common external aviation policy for the EU."
"However, in addition to the EU aviation policy, we must be able to develop bilateral aviation agreements with third countries, as many of our partners have difficulties in committing to those common Union agreements."
"Nevertheless, I underline that those bilateral agreements should be in addition to and complement – not replace – the common aviation policy."
"Most importantly, the normal functioning of air traffic should be assured without useless confrontation while we are negotiating."
"As the rapporteur has stated, we have noted the difficulties in negotiating a comprehensive agreement with Russia."
"The charges imposed for flights over its territory are clearly against international law and are not acceptable."
"Sad but true, it seems that Russia will always somehow utilise its airspace for strategic purposes."
"I do not believe that we will get rid of those charges even though Russia would no longer collect overflight charges."
"Every year we in the European Union pay around EUR 250 million in such charges."
"Unfortunately, a major part of that sum ends up in the accounts of Russian airline Aeroflot."
"That is also bad for the competition situation in Europe."
"For Finland these charges are significant, as the only realistic option to fly to Asia is over Siberia."
"We should ensure that a level playing field exists for all EU operators."
"Today that is not the case, as those charges are often arbitrary and differ from one airline to another."
"As Russia seems to prefer bilateral cooperation, it is with happiness that I note that a more open attitude prevails in China."
"I would hope that the Council would agree to start negotiations with China and give the Commission a proper mandate for achieving a common aviation agreement."
"Finally, by ensuring sustainable economic and regulatory conditions for air traffic to Asia, we also revitalise the European aviation industry and ensure the possibility of offering efficient flight connections and routes, including in the more sparsely populated and geographically distant areas of Europe, such as the northern part of Finland."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the Members who were keen to react to the excellent reports by Mr El Khadraoui and Mr Zīle."
"On this occasion, I am very willing to confirm my intention to inform Parliament on a very regular basis about the strategic guidelines of our policy of international negotiations."
"Once again, I wish to thank our two rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"There is a great deal of scope for developing the aviation sector, and this is an integral part of our transport policy."
"I am obviously delighted with your very broad support for regulatory convergence, which, as an objective, goes hand in hand with markets being opened up."
"With certain partners not doing enough to guarantee a fair and efficient commercial environment, regulatory convergence is a priority."
"Markets can only be opened up gradually when a more careful approach is required."
"At times, we even need to adopt a firm stance."
"This is already the case, and it will increasingly become so where Russia and the issue of Siberian overflights are concerned, as Mrs Kauppi highlighted a short while ago. There is also the fact that these overflights are the subject of arbitrary charges."
"I am therefore delighted with your clear and unequivocal support on this point."
"I intend to pay a great deal of attention to safety and security issues, which sometimes urgently crop up in this sector."
"Aside from competition, we must be vigilant in ensuring that the social and environmental standards are fully complied with."
"In this regard, I wish to say to Parliament that the fact that we have a European strategy and that we can sign horizontal agreements is advantageous, because that enables us to influence international civil aviation law."
"A united Europe is far more able to bring about the development of certain standards and to steer them towards a higher quality, as much for the environment as for the social dimension."
"With this in mind, allow me to take the liberty of telling you, Mrs Kauppi, that the ‘operating standards’ text is currently at the stage of being finalised with a view to a common position being adopted by the Council."
"The lawyer-linguists need to translate this text, and the intention is then to send it back to Parliament for a second reading towards March or April."
"Finally, I should like to say that the progress of the ‘open skies’ negotiations with the United States should give the necessary impetus to the Community approach, which follows on from the Court of Justice judgment."
"In this regard, it is premature to give a precise assessment of the situation: we are awaiting a clearer insight into the US Transport Ministry’s new interpretation of the control rules for US airlines."
"It is true, however, that we have made a great deal of progress, particularly with regard to regulatory convergence, on which we have practically reached an agreement, and I hope that these negotiations will give a determined and decisive boost to the Community approach. This approach is clearly far preferable to bilateral agreements, which will never be as effective for our European industry."
"This is a fine illustration of the fact that, in certain areas, the Union would do well to speak with one voice."
"You will understand, Mr President, that I wish to thank Parliament in particular for strongly supporting the Commission in this strategy to promote a specifically European style of negotiation, which I believe must also be beneficial to each of the Member States, as well as to our entire European industry."
"I thank our rapporteurs and Parliament for having taken an interest in this aspect of external relations and of our international negotiations."
"This aspect will become more important, given the increasingly significant role the aviation industry is required to play in the world."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I would be grateful if you could pass on to President Borrell our thanks for his very kind words yesterday in memory of our colleague, Phillip Whitehead."
"I know I speak not only for the whole of my delegation but also for the whole European Parliament, because Phillip’s fair-minded and judicious approach to politics won him friends throughout this Chamber."
"My delegation has placed at the entrance to the Chamber a book of condolence, in which we hope colleagues throughout Parliament will feel free to put their memories of Phillip."
"We will be presenting this book of condolence to his family at his memorial service, which will take place at Derby Cathedral on 29 January."
"My office will provide details to any Members who wish to attend."
"Thank you, Mr Titley. I think that our colleagues and friends will have made a note of all these unfortunately very sad arrangements."
"The next item is voting time."
"That concludes the first voting session of 2006."
"The delegation to the European Parliament abstained on the Brok report because it considers the following points to be indispensable prerequisites for Croatia’s accession to the European Union:"
"1. To call for the suspension of EU accession negotiations for so long as the Croatian authorities maintain their ban preventing Community citizens of Italian nationality from having access to the property market, in clear contradiction of the principles of the ;"
"2. To call for full compensation for the property confiscated from the thousands of citizens of Italian origin expelled from Croatian territory since 1946, as a condition for Croatia’s accession;"
"3. To call on the Croatian authorities to accept their responsibility, now historically proven and documented, for the deportations, atrocities, massacres and ethnic cleansing perpetrated against thousands of people of Italian origin by the Communist regime since 1946."
". As the rapporteur in the last Parliament on the issue of relations with the Republic of Korea in the field of science and technology, I recognise the importance for Europe of relations with this growing economic power in Asia."
"I therefore welcome this report and I support it extending as it does our framework trade and cooperation agreement to the new Member States of the Union."
"We now have the mechanism in place for a growing partnership between the EU and the Republic of Korea."
"The important thing now is to use it."
". I voted in favour of this report before us, in view of the issues it raises, namely the true financial extent of the difficulties facing the Maldives following the tragedy of just over a year ago, quite apart from all of the country’s previous problems, and Parliament’s responsibility in this area, in technical terms, which differs from that of the financial institutions."
". It is clear, and I hope uncontroversial, that the Maldives should be included in the list of countries eligible for aid in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster of 2004."
"I was glad to support this move and hope that we can move as quickly as possible to provide useful practical aid to the country."
"Mr President, the Catania report on citizenship of the Union, which we voted out a moment ago, can claim to be one of the most undoubtedly incoherent and ill-considered texts that this House has ever produced, which is saying something."
"The long and short of it was that it granted the general right to vote for all elections to everyone who happens to be on our territory more or less legally."
"Willingness to integrate did not come into it, any more than did language command or conditions of nationality. In short, the aliens were accorded all rights, but no duties."
"This was indeed madness."
"This was the work of a handful of blinded ideologists who refused to recognise the reality of the totally failed multi-cultural model."
"Moreover, the sovereignty of our Member States was fundamentally damaged in this report."
"State citizenship and all associated rights, including the right to vote, must remain an exclusive competence of the Member States."
"Europe should not interfere in this."
"We had every right, and reason, to reject this idiotic report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my extreme bitterness at the fact that the Catania report has not been adopted by Parliament. Sometimes progressive trends can be seen in Parliament, while at other times decidedly conservative trends prevail."
"My deepest regret is that my own group was divided on the vote on this report, which should have been accepted in the most genuine spirit of liberalism."
"It is true that European citizenship is ‘work in progress’ and is additional to citizenship of one of the Member States, but it is a goal that we should be striving to attain through political actions. In doing so, Europe must endow itself with the dignity it deserves, and it must attempt to interpret as well as it can the new needs and rights of citizenship, which emerge in any case even before the law can take account of them."
"While explaining my regret at the rejection of the report, I should also like to express, therefore, my total solidarity with Mr Catania, as I have collaborated with him and support him on the amendments as well."
"Mr President, I have a declaration of vote to make on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party."
"We believe that the Catania report on the Commission’s fourth report on citizenship of the Union completely missed the point."
"At a time when the vast mass of the population take a sceptical view of much of what goes on in the EU, the issue of citizenship of it needs to be addressed with some seriousness."
"It is lamentable that this report does no more than discuss the situation of immigrants and has nothing to say about the needs of Europe’s citizens."
"Let me make it quite plain that those who want to enter the European Union from third countries, namely as immigrants or asylum seekers, deserve to be taken far more seriously and treated with much more respect than they are by this report, and it is for that reason that we have voted against it."
". My party strongly supports measures which assist the upward harmonisation of human and civil rights for all citizens of Member States."
"I strongly endorse those elements of the Catania report which sought to raise the issue of migrant workers' rights, particularly their civil and political rights to citizenship and electoral participation."
"Sinn Féin strongly believes that migrant workers should have full access to civil and human rights and that Member States should have a fair and equality-focused process of naturalisation for those migrant workers who choose to avail themselves of such mechanisms."
"I abstained in the final vote on Giusto Catania's report on the Commission's Fourth report on Citizenship of the Union (A6-0411/2005) on the basis that Sinn Féin policy regards issues of citizenship, elections and political participation as matters whose primary location should be within the governing institutions of the Member State."
".Nothing in Mr Catania’s report on European citizenship was worthy of support."
"However, two proposals were particularly shocking."
"Firstly, the demand for a form of European citizenship that includes the right of all residents of a country, irrespective of their nationality, to vote and stand for election, in local, national and European elections."
"Secondly, the demand for citizenship rights in the Member States to be harmonised, on the pretext that the differences between these rights bring about discrimination against non-Europeans who wish to acquire European citizenship as currently defined in the Treaties."
"Where will this madness end?"
"The only possible way of acquiring citizenship of a country is by having the nationality of that country."
"It is exclusively for the sovereign Member States to determine the conditions to be fulfilled before nationality can be conferred."
"Granting foreigners the right to vote, irrespective of their nationality, comes down to granting them a dual right: the one that they can continue to exercise in their country of origin plus the one that they can exercise in their country of residence."
"In reality, therefore, this is an unfair measure."
"Being someone’s guest does not give you the right to interfere in their business."
"For all of these reasons, it is a good thing that this report has been rejected."
"The report is aimed at strengthening citizenship of the Union by making it independent of national citizenship and by requiring harmonised rules for the granting of national citizenship."
"We, for our part, believe, however, that citizenship is one of the cornerstones of the sovereignty of nation states and that each Member State must be free to make its own decisions about granting citizenship."
"Of course, there may be arguments in favour of reforming the rules concerning the acquisition of national citizenship following a fairly long period of continuous residence in a country and concerning the opportunity to vote and eligibility to be a candidate in local, regional and national elections."
"The issue of citizenship of the Member States is, however, exclusively an issue for the countries concerned, applying their own legislation."
"It is up to each Member State to establish the conditions under which citizenship is acquired or forfeited, as well as the effect citizenship is to have."
"The European Union has no powers in this respect."
"Citizenship of the Union is, then, subject to national citizenship and is thus to be defined by national laws on citizenship."
"Moreover, the report contains a number of wordings concerning the introduction of an EU tax, uniform European party lists for elections to the European Parliament, the significance of a European Constitution in strengthening European solidarity and common bases for incorporating the European dimension into the curriculum of every school."
".The concept of ‘citizenship of the Union’, which is not even qualified by the word ‘European’, is a device designed to destroy our national rights to identity and sovereignty."
"Mr Catania’s report is proof of that, insofar as its aim is to impose one huge group in which the French, the Poles, the Spanish, the Italians, the Germans and the British will have disappeared, only to be replaced by ‘citizens of the Union’ who benefit, in particular, from the same political rights."
"Thus, Article 17 of the report, which calls on the Member States to grant the right to vote, and stand for election, in national elections to any resident who is a ‘citizen of the Union’, ‘irrespective of nationality’, would enable a Czech living in France to take part in the election of the President of the Republic."
"This right to vote would even be extended to non-European immigrants insofar as Article 18 proposes extending the rights of citizens of the Union to third-country nationals residing in the European Union."
"The nations of Europe, under threat of being flooded by immigration on a global scale, do not need European citizenship. Rather, they need to have their national rights reaffirmed."
"An increasing number of French people, in particular, are demanding that the nationality code be reformed on the basis of the principle ‘you either inherit French nationality or you earn it’."
"Even though Europe is experiencing a crisis both of representation, seen particularly in the French and Dutch rejections of the European Constitution, and of democratic participation, with growing numbers of people staying away from European elections, year after year since the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht it has not ceased trying to force us to swallow the pill of European citizenship."
"Once again, what we have here is a machine for crushing nations and national identities so that they can ultimately be replaced by a European identity."
"This new ‘package’, which comes straight from the upper echelons of Euro-federalist bureaucracy, is an integral part of the submersion and immigration/invasion process desired by the Commission."
"The right of every citizen to move and to reside freely on the territory of the Member States is intended as the central right of European citizenship."
"It is therefore easy to understand why Brussels is trying to simplify and relax the rules for entering and residing in European territory because it is on them that the acquisition of this new citizenship depends."
"The mindless dictatorship is systematically destroying national values and identities."
"It takes real courage today to display and defend a national awareness."
". We have voted for the report, keeping in mind that some elements of the text were not appropriate to be considered in this report, including some elements of EU citizenship, the positive stance on the constitution of the EU, election of some MEPs on the basis of transnational lists, the proposal on the European tax, etc."
"We voted against these elements of the text, but finally voted for the report in pursuing the better course of the migrant people in Europe."
"We kept in mind that this was only an own-initiative report without legal consequences."
". I welcome the report regarding citizenship of the EU with relation to third country nationals."
"The report's key issue is that EU citizens should be able to vote in national elections in Member States other than their own, provided they are resident there."
"I regret that the report was rejected as it was a worthy report."
"However, I abstained on the amendments to paragraphs 11, parts one and 2, paragraph 12, parts 1 and 2 and paragraphs 13, 21 and 28 as I felt that, at this stage, they went too far."
". It is apparent from the falling turnout at elections, the negative messages received from referenda and increasing frustration with the EU that the European citizenry are not going to be won over by sharing in an anthem or a banner."
"Far from being interested in how the EU presents itself – by way, for example, of the draft constitution – they are much more concerned about what it does or does not accomplish."
"Making more of citizenship of the Union will do nothing to turn EU-sceptics into the enthusiasts some might like them to be; it will certainly do no such thing for as long as we lack EU-wide minimum standards for the grant of citizenship and fail to do away with abuses of the asylum system."
"The attacks in London, the murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh, and the street battles in France are evidence of the fact that we must, in future, carefully examine those who seek citizenship as to their capacity for integration into the majority culture."
"The failure of Europe’s Moslems to accept the European legal and cultural order is a fact, and it is one that the EU can no longer gloss over on the pretext of ‘multiculturalism’."
"The practice of mass legalisations, too, whereby millions of illegal immigrants have been turned into ‘Europeans’, must be stopped, and the Schengen information system must in future be able to give indications of when there are embassies with a mass-production approach to handing out entry visas."
"For as long as the Schengen Agreement is ineffective and we fail to get a grip on the problem of parallel societies, for as long as we are unable to guarantee the protection of our indigenous European peoples – for as long as these things are going on, the dream of EU citizenship is one that we can do without."
". The issues raised by this report are highly interesting and worthy of far-reaching discussion."
"I should like to point out, however, that it does not fall within Parliament’s scope – or that of any other European institution, for that matter – to hold this debate in the first place."
"Acquiring citizenship is an exclusively national issue, a keystone of each Member State’s sovereignty and, in my view, non-negotiable."
"I disagree with a great many of the premises and conclusions in this report, and accordingly voted against it. I therefore welcome the rejection of the report."
"It is a human right to be able to participate actively in the democratic process, and we are vigorously endeavouring to bring about a situation in which everyone has this right."
"It is not, however, defensible for the EU to use this as a lever for developing its ambitions to take control of the Member States' democratic structures and so increase its powers."
". This report deals with citizenship, a very controversial subject, and I would generally be of the view that such matters should be purely matters for Member States, and that any EU rights flow from Member State citizenship."
"However, this report, which is non-binding, attempts to explore ways in which each Member State can be encouraged to raise standards of equity and fairness, as there are instances of EU countries treating minorities poorly."
"The eventual rejection of this report does I think reflect a mature decision on the part of Parliament, much as I still believe that these issues need to be examined and will return to the house before long."
"– ‘European citizenship’ is an ideological construct of no practical value, given that citizenship is granted by the Member States."
"The role which the report attempts to ascribe to 'European' citizenship has purely ideological characteristics, creating the false impression of a non-existent 'European citizen' on a single 'political and cultural territory', so that it looks as if there is no going back from an imperialist and reactionary EU."
"Basically, the report attempts to introduce through the back door aspects of the reactionary European Constitution rejected by the peoples of the ΕU, such as the taxation of European citizens directly by the ΕU, the strengthening of European parties, supranational ballot papers and so forth. The Euro-lust dominating the report is such that it goes as far – and this is unprecedented anywhere in the world – as establishing the right to acquire non-existent 'European' citizenship of persons who have been residents 'over a long period of time' and who will, however, be deprived of citizenship and rights in the countries in which they reside."
"We unreservedly support and are fighting with immigrants for the safeguarding and broadening of full political and social rights, such as the right to vote and stand for election, full employment, wage, insurance and pension rights, the granting of citizenship to persons who have been resident over a long period of time and so forth."
"However, the acquisition of these rights has nothing to do with the misleading ideology of ‘European citizenship’; it is the fighting ground of the mass grass-roots movement in each Member State and at European level."
"We have, of course, wholeheartedly endorsed this report by Mrs Prets, and we are also very glad of the considerable improvements that the amendments have made to it."
"It was a matter of particular concern to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that it should be made clear that prostitutes’ clients should also have cause to fear punishment if they are aware of forced prostitution."
"Our intention in this is that it should be spelled out that forced prostitution must not only be fought against by means of the law, but must also be treated as repugnant by society at large, and we are particularly pleased that this House has taken note of our 8 March initiative against forced prostitution during the football World Cup, which is being played in Germany this year."
"Our intention is to make it clear that forced prostitution must be shown the red card, and fair play must mean our making every effort to get rid of it."
"I hope that this House will thereby send out a clear message about sporting events, for we can combat forced prostitution only by sending out such clear messages to every stratum of society, and not only by means of legal initiatives, and the boom in forced prostitution really must prompt us to get stuck into fighting it."
"Mr President, the trade in human goods, which is even more lucrative than that in weapons and drugs, has done well out of the disintegration of state structures in a multicultural society, the transition to a market economy in states of Eastern Europe, the consequent encouragement of corrupt and criminal organisations, and the mass immigration brought about by the opening of borders."
"As the victims are too ashamed or afraid to testify and half the trafficked women and children who return home end up back in circulation, the perpetrators generally get away scot-free and so the sort of preventive action that is needed involves educating potential victims at as early a stage as possible and the fostering of popular awareness of the problem."
"Not only that, but there must also, at long last, be tough punishments for paedophilia throughout the EU and even tougher ones for the organised trafficking in human beings."
". The UK Independence Party voted against the Prets Report on the trafficking of women and children due to the nature of articles contained within the report."
"We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution."
"All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences."
". The UK Independence Party voted against the Prets Report on the trafficking of women and children due to the nature of articles contained within the report."
"We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution."
"All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences."
". I voted against the ALDE Group on paragraph 46 concerning criminalizing the clients who deliberately exploit persons in a situation of coercion."
"Whereas the ALDE Group line was to vote ‘No’ to this I believe that people that deliberately buy women/girls who are forced into prostitution should be seen as committing a crime similar to the crime of buying stolen goods – that is, fencing."
"And I think even the Member States that today are against criminalizing the buying of sex could introduce this as a criminal offence."
"We have voted in favour of the report on the trafficking of women and children."
"We believe that people’s safety is best ensured through common efforts to combat cross-border crime, particularly crime that violates people’s basic freedoms and rights and their human dignity."
"With a view to giving legal effect to the demands being made and so raising the profile of the issue, the Swedish Conservative delegation also wishes to emphasise that the issue of trafficking should be dealt with in the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs rather than in its Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"We are, however, opposed to proposals in the report that interfere in the Member States’ areas of competence, for example that of how the police are organised."
"The own-initiative report concerns important issues, and the June List supports many of the basic ideas that permeate the report."
"Sexual exploitation and human trafficking must be combated."
"Nor can the serious crime that is often a consequence of cross-border human trafficking be overlooked."
"It is therefore extremely important to make it easier to cooperate and to exchange information within the EU."
"The June List believes, however, that, on these issues too, each Member State must itself be permitted to choose its method and way of working."
"The June List therefore chooses to vote against the own-initiative report."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues applaud the recognition in this resolution that tackling trafficking is a key component of the fight against organised crime."
"Consequently, any measures taken in this regard should be consistent with the overall strategy against organised crime."
"Therefore, this should not be used as a pretext for pursuing the objective of full communitarisation in this area."
"Rather, we support effective national policies and strong inter-governmental co-operation to stamp out this evil trade."
"Trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of children are increasingly forming a sizeable parallel economy in Europe."
"According to the United Nations, nearly 4 million women and children are being abused or sexually assaulted."
"Inevitably, we are also seeing the methods of trafficking in human beings becoming more diversified."
"The growth in sex tourism and in demand for children for economic exploitation (as beggars, pickpockets, dealers, moonlighters, and so forth.), are all forms of crime and exploitation which in most cases are in the hands of organised criminal gangs."
"The dangerous Schengen Agreements, which abolished all controls at the European Union’s borders, allow them to be used as drug smugglers or robbers."
"Moreover, because they are minors, they cannot be prosecuted if they are arrested by the authorities."
"If we want to prevent all forms of human trafficking, we must tackle these mafias, these illegal trades that are constantly growing in a Europe that is wide open."
"Additional Community programmes and pious hopes from the many NGOs will achieve nothing."
"Only if people and our elites wake up to the ultraliberal pro-immigration policy being pursued by Brussels can we hope to eventually feel safe in Europe."
". I welcome the report emphasising the importance of introducing and promoting gender mainstreaming and child-sensitive approaches in all EU policies."
"Trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation is a violation of human rights and between 600 000 and 800 000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year."
"Approximately 80% of those cases are women and girls and 50% are minors."
"I agree that data on trafficking is lacking and that there is a need for a more harmonised approach between Member States on how data should be collated and, equally, that data on children should be kept separate from the data on men and women."
"It is essential that prevention strategies address both victims and traffickers."
"The most vulnerable groups should be focused on, first by improving education and employment opportunities, fighting the problem of the feminisation of poverty, discrimination and inequality."
"Furthermore, more campaigns should be introduced, with a common EU logo and international help lines, and more information on legal rights to health services for victims in other countries must be provided."
"Finally, I agree that law enforcement must prosecute and strictly punish traffickers and fight corruption."
". The Prets Report on combating the trafficking of women and children is an important contribution to the tackling of one of the most distressing and accelerating problems facing vulnerable women and children who face modern slavery, particularly in the sex industry in Europe."
"The problem must be tackled with maximum consideration for the victims of trafficking so that they do not suffer a 'double punishment' in the justice systems of EU countries."
"The sexual exploitation of women and children is a scourge of humankind that is becoming an ever-greater problem as time goes on."
"I fully agree with the idea of providing for severe punishment for the clients of sex slaves."
"That is not enough, however."
"A common, effective strategy is also needed."
"Trafficking in human beings, which is controlled by a real Mafia-like multinational of organised crime, feeds on the desperation and poverty of men and women who flee their own countries of origin in search of jobs and a better life in the rich countries of the world."
"Although trafficking in women and children is mainly directed towards sexual exploitation, it is also, unfortunately, used for other purposes that are equally despicable and degrading for a human being: forced labour, slavery and – something I find even more ignominious – the export of organs."
"Sexual exploitation is known to be part of a larger complex of criminal activity that includes sex tourism, drug trafficking and the smuggling of arms and radioactive waste."
"In order to help fight the Mafia and similar criminal networks, I again propose – as I did in March 2004 – that a European observatory should be set up to monitor organised crime and to propose ways of harmonising the laws on punishing it across the European Union."
". I do not need to repeat the arguments, which are so clearly set out in the report before us."
"That being said, I feel it is worthwhile pointing out that we should condemn in the strongest terms the trafficking of human beings (not only of women and children, even though they are the most vulnerable groups), be it for the purposes of sexual or any other form of exploitation."
"It is not enough to be firm in protest, however; we must also be resolute and proactive in deed."
"As is abundantly clear from so many parliamentary reports and so many journalistic reportages, the fight against trafficking of human beings will have little chance of success without cooperation at Member State level."
"I therefore feel that greater cooperation, improved coordination and stronger determination are required."
"Estimates of the number of women and children who fall victim to trafficking across the world vary from 700 000 to 4 million a year."
"According to the United Nations, 1.2 million are children."
"My colleague’s report takes as its starting point the tragic fact that despite the measures so far taken by the Member States and by the European Union itself, trafficking in human beings is today considered the fastest-growing criminal activity in comparison to other forms of organised crime."
"Sadly, this global phenomenon will not be stopped by piling up Community texts, resolutions or countless NGO reports on the subject."
"Indeed, while the causes have been identified: poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, the lack of border controls allowing the development of underground networks of all kinds of organised crime, violence against women, education, the explosion of pornography or the disappearance of moral reference points, the solutions proposed in this report are very vague, general and incomplete."
"If we are to combat all this organised human trafficking effectively, the first thing we must do is restore controls at the Member States’ internal borders."
"Their abolition with the Schengen Agreements was one of the main reasons for the development of this entire sex industry in Europe."
"There is a link between combating, on the one hand, human trafficking and, on the other hand, the demand for related services from those who buy sex. Criminalising this type of crime at EU level might, however, lead to penalties not adapted to the national systems’ internal logic and might also lead to a ban on criminalising those who buy sex."
". Nobody can deny that organised trafficking of women and children is a pressing issue facing the countries of the EU, and coordinated action across the EU is necessary to fight it."
"This report demonstrates how cooperation will lead to better results than the individual Member States acting alone, and I am pleased to support it."
"While I have reservations about some of the sentiments contained in the report, I am of the view that the EU itself must take action to combat this problem, in conjunction with the Member States themselves."
". The UK Independence Party voted against the Prets report on the trafficking of women and children due to the nature of articles contained within the report."
"We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution."
"All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than creating yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences."
"– There is no denying the fact that the future of air transport is currently at a crossroads."
"Last year’s steep rise in oil prices led to major problems for a number of airlines."
"Several of them will be faced with significant losses, and some in the US are even receiving government assistance again."
"Low-cost airlines are a second problem that we face, and we must ask ourselves to what extent these carriers, which are based in developed countries, meet International Civil Aviation Organisation and International Labour Organisation standards and the OECD guidelines for multinational companies."
"The key question is whether we are capable of ensuring that they comply with the requirements of the EC directives referred to in paragraphs 24 and 25 of the report on developing the agenda for the Community’s external aviation policy, and whether we are capable of monitoring this compliance effectively"
"In the same vein, I am aware of the problems posed by negotiations, in particular those with our largest partners, or in other words Russia and China."
"This is a subject covered in the report on relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport."
"The situation is probably most complex when it comes to negotiations with the United States, where relations constantly border on unfair competition."
"Yet in spite of the major problems that the Community faces when negotiating with its external partners, I should like to stress that such negotiations are urgently needed and of key importance, and that air transport will not develop any further without them. This means that particular importance should be attached to the closing comment of the El Khadraoui report."
"The place where a person is deemed to work when carrying out cabotage operations in an EU Member State is the Member State in question, which means that working conditions should be of an appropriate standard."
"Furthermore, cabotage in the field of air transport should be regarded as employment within the European Union."
"I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that this approach of extending the scope to cover an entire service sector should be supplemented by best-practice methods."
"It would then be possible, both in this and other sectors, to start negotiations on the opening up of the market and on the liberalisation of cabotage."
"This approach could also open up fresh opportunities for negotiations on the directive on services, including services of public interest."
"Adopting these two reports therefore provides us with a fresh opportunity for negotiations on both air transport and other matters."
"What is more, the opportunities for applying new principles to which I have referred may represent a real breakthrough, and they are very much welcomed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
". I believe that the establishment of a coherent development strategy for the Union’s external aviation policy is of significant importance."
"This common external policy can be set up either by adapting the existing bilateral agreements to Community law, or by concluding new agreements between the Community and third countries."
"It has become clear in the various discussions in committee, however, that this strategy cannot develop without agreements with the USA, the Russian Federation and China."
"In view of the new realities facing the global market and in the context of the various initiatives implemented by the Commission and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, this report is worthy of my support."
". The Union is pursuing its general strategy for the creation of a common aviation area with its neighbours."
"The vote on the report by Mr Zīle on relations with China and Russia in the field of air transport forms part of this context."
"These countries share high levels of growth in the aviation sector and face challenges relating to consolidation, liberalisation and modernisation."
"We never lose sight of the specific nature of these two countries and raises issues such as the abolition of overflight charges, and the need to extend the scope of the mandate to cover questions concerning airport and air safety infrastructures."
"I therefore feel that this report is a highly significant step in ensuring legal clarity through a transitional process that does not undermine the economic stability of the sector."
"I voted in favour of this report, which forms part of the broader question of the development of the EU’s external relations concerning aviation policy."
"Yesterday’s minutes have been circulated."
"Are there any objections?"
"Mr President, I was present yesterday and I cannot find my name in the Minutes."
"Would you please make a note of that?"
"That will be corrected, Mr Poignant."
"Mr President, I would ask that the damage sustained by the Parliament building as a result of yesterday’s demonstration be paid for by those who caused it."
"Mr Rübig, that has already been discussed at yesterday’s meeting of the Bureau."
"Fifteen police officers were injured and 20 window panes smashed."
"We discussed the security aspects and also how the damage may be made good."
"We now come to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the security of energy supply – and in particular that of gas."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the events in the first week of January surrounding the dispute over gas between the Russian Federation and Ukraine have made it abundantly clear to us that we cannot take the security of our energy supply for granted."
"Gas imported from Russia accounts for over one quarter of that consumed in the European Union, and, since up to 80% of that is transported via Ukraine, the uninterrupted and continuous supply of gas from Russia via Ukraine to the European Union is absolutely vital to households and businesses."
"The fact is, though, that there was up to a 50% shortfall in supply in some EU Member States on the first and second days of January this year."
"A diplomatic initiative on the part of the Commission and the Austrian Presidency of the Council helped to put a speedy end to this situation."
"This leads me on to mention Moldova and Russia, and to ask both of them to return to the negotiating table in search of a longer-term solution to the problems existing between them."
"It appears from reports in the media that an agreement has been reached for a period of three months, but that is certainly a very short-term solution."
"What matters now is that we learn the right lessons from what has happened."
"As I see it, there are three things we need to do if Europe’s supply of natural gas is to be secure in the long term, and I shall now set out what they are."
"Firstly, there is a need for diversification in the sources from which natural gas is supplied and the routes by which it is transported."
"Plans are in hand for a series of new pipelines with the capacity to transport a total of 140 billion cubic metres per annum, and these must be built without delay."
"One project that looks likely to be successful is the ‘Nabucco’ pipeline, 3 300 km long and running from Austria to the area around the Caspian Sea via Turkey, which, when finally completed in around 2020, will be able to transport up to 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas along a new route into the European Union."
"Secondly, we need to push forward the use of liquefied natural gas."
"The current capacity of existing facilities amounts to some 60 billion cubic metres per annum."
"Projects are up and running in certain countries to establish new terminals or extend existing plant."
"It is to be expected that capacity will increase to 160 billion cubic metres per annum by 2010."
"The European Union should aim for a five-fold increase in the quantity of LNG that it imports by 2010, which will enable it to receive supplies from other regions not capable of being connected to the EU by means of a pipeline."
"There is, thirdly, a need for greater transparency on the hydrocarbon markets in order to make prices less volatile and to ensure stable prices that reflect the market, while also improving the quality of information on the quantities of natural gas imported, and in this a considerable level of investment is essential."
"It is crucial that there should be as inviting a prospect as possible for investment in energy if businesses are to be prepared to actually make these investments at all."
"In the short term, we will have to give consideration to how we avoid situations of this sort coming about, or how we can deal with them without fallout."
"One option, to be sure, is greater integration of the supply network in the European Union, which would have the effect of simplifying the exchange of gas within the Community, thus reducing the dependency of individual Member States on certain states by which gas is supplied or through which it has to pass."
"Having more gas traded within the Community does, of course, presuppose the availability of gas in the necessary quantities and that is why we also have to work at supporting the establishment of liquid wholesale markets."
"Another short-term instrument is without doubt the storage of gas reserves to bridge the gap when supplies are interrupted for up to two months, although account will need to be taken of specific national requirements, such as whether to use geological voids, power stations or industrial premises for storage purposes."
"The Austrian Presidency will give priority to energy policy and in particular to secure energy supplies."
"Security of supply, alongside competitiveness and of course sustainability, is one of the pillars on which European energy policy reposes, both at national and at Community level."
"Europe must redouble its efforts to be equal to the challenges presented by energy policy, for by 2030 the world will be using 50% more energy and Europe will become even more markedly dependent on the importation of fossil energy sources."
"All things considered, if we want to guarantee the European public and industry a secure supply of energy, we will have to opt for an approach that incorporates various strategies."
"Within the European Community, we will have to further diversify energy supply by making more use of renewable energy sources, which may entail a three-fold increase in the use of biomass by 2010."
"European energy supply is to be founded, , on the cost-effective use of renewable energies."
"Other options for Europe will include the use of coal with clean technologies and, in the long term, of hydrogen."
"The Austrian view, however, is that the use of nuclear energy is not an option."
"Where supply is concerned, it will be necessary to press on with our efforts to create a European single internal market and increase investments in energy supply."
"Turning to consumption, on the other hand, energy efficiency in the Community needs to be improved."
"There are at present great disparities between the Member States in terms of energy efficiency, defined as energy consumption per unit of the gross domestic product."
"As our basis for this, we can take the agreement between Parliament and the Council on the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services."
"What happened at New Year also showed how important are the European Union’s relations with its partners."
"These partnerships need to be sustained consistently both at multilateral level – whether through the dialogues in the International Energy Forum or under the energy treaty with South-Eastern Europe – and at bilateral level as part of the EU’s dialogues with Russia and the OPEC."
"Willingness to cooperate is an absolutely essential element in securing energy supply."
"There are, then, a multiplicity of options available to us."
"It is for us to make effective and speedy use of them."
"As securing the European Union’s future energy supply is in the interests of all Member States, I am convinced that we will succeed in doing that."
". Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for finding time today to debate the security of energy supplies and particularly gas."
"In a way, it is a continuation of the debate we had on high oil prices last year."
"The current price of oil is more than USD 60 per barrel."
"The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia triggered the debate on the security of supply to the European Union."
"The gas dispute hit the headlines at the beginning of this year when Russia stopped its supply to Ukraine for a day and a half."
"That also had an impact on the EU through a reduction in the amount of gas reaching the European Union."
"While it is reassuring in the short term that an agreement was reached between Ukraine and Russia, we must be under no illusions."
"The issue has not gone away."
"Commercial negotiations between the two sides will continue in order to find a price adjustment formula that is mutually acceptable."
"We have also seen the repercussions internally in Ukraine, with the vote of no confidence in the government last week."
"Nor must we forget that the gas price dispute between Russia and Moldova was resolved only yesterday, with more detailed negotiations in the near future."
"I firmly believe that everyone needs to learn the lessons from the events at the beginning of the year."
"So, what are the lessons the EU should draw from this dispute?"
"Firstly, in the context of this particular dispute, the EU was, and should be, proactive."
"We not only maintained close bilateral contacts with both parties throughout the dispute but also urged them to resolve this dispute."
"While it is evident that the EU could not and should not take sides, we made it clear to both sides that it was in their strong interest to come to an agreement rapidly."
"In such a situation it is very important to have close cooperation between the Council – in particular the Presidency – and the Commission."
"Secondly, the dispute has underlined the usefulness of the energy dialogues with Russia and Ukraine."
"Those dialogues have provided us with the contacts necessary to impress our concerns and views upon both parties in a framework of mutual trust and common interest."
"At the same time, it clearly underlines the need to give greater momentum to dialogue."
"Thirdly, this dispute has underlined the importance of and the need for a clearer, more cohesive and proactive EU-wide energy security policy."
"While it is true that the Commission and Parliament have argued for this for many years, the time is now right to make real progress on this."
"I should like to stress the importance of developing a common approach to energy, which was highlighted at the Hampton Court informal summit and in the meeting between the Presidency and the Commission at the start of the Austrian Presidency."
"In his speech today, the President-in-Office clearly indicated the importance the Presidency attaches to this particular issue and that many concrete and clear proposals have been made."
"During the crisis we witnessed a certain lack of transparency in the European gas market that has made it quite challenging to monitor and assess accurately how this shortfall was being handled."
"The 2004 directive concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supplies, once fully transposed, should assist."
"Addressing those kinds of issues is one of the objectives of the energy market observation system which is under development in my services."
"More generally, this incident has thrown into sharp focus our increasing dependency on external energy supply."
"The necessity of adopting and developing a common EU approach will be addressed in a green paper on energy policy that the Commission is currently preparing."
"Clearly, the development of a common approach to the external energy dimension will be a fundamental element in the green paper."
"This external energy dimension should be based on a diversification of different energies, as well as on different energy sources, routes, suppliers and transit networks."
"There is a clear need for more investment in LNG terminals, in gas pipelines for diversification of supplies and gas storage facilities."
"While the EU has been engaged, via its technical assistance programmes, in promoting the development of new supply routes, and upgrading and enhancing existing routes, it is clear that other major energy consumers also take a very proactive and political approach to this issue."
"Europe will have to learn some lessons here, although one should not underestimate the complexity of this task."
"There are also, of course, the internal aspects of an EU energy policy to consider: firstly, the need to ensure that an internal EU-wide energy market is a practical reality."
"There is still some way to go to achieve a real internal market in both electricity and gas."
"Then there is the need to facilitate the necessary infrastructure investments required to ensure that the various national energy markets in the EU can really become more integrated."
"Here it is important for us all to recognise that this calls for the necessary means also to be provided including, where necessary, financial support."
"We also need to ensure that sufficient policy and financial support is given to research in priority areas and to ensure that more efficient energy technologies, including cleaner coal and renewable energy technologies, can penetrate the market."
"We need more actively to pursue policies and measures that can achieve real energy savings and efficient use of energy and thus diminish our external dependency."
"We have adopted ambitious legislation."
"Now it is time to implement it."
"Finally, we need to improve energy security measures to enhance the solidarity mechanisms to face the challenges of possible disruptions to energy supplies."
"One should keep in mind that this particular dispute, as it affected the EU, was resolved in a very short time, but we must be prepared for longer-lasting disputes."
"In conclusion, this dispute has again been a real wake-up call for us all."
"While it is true that energy is just a commodity, it is a commodity that is fundamental for our continued economic development and wellbeing."
"We must learn the lessons from this episode, which I will sum up as a need for a common European energy policy."
"This policy needs to be clear, coherent and effective both internally and externally, corresponding to the goals of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability."
". Mr President, the recent gas supply crisis is a wake-up call for the European Union."
"The PPE-DE Group welcomes the fact that the security of energy supply and sustainability of energy production and consumption are one of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities."
"It is high time, since energy security is becoming increasingly important for the overall security of the European Union, and especially its economic security."
"Any difficulty, even temporary, that has the effect of reducing supplies of energy from third states also causes serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Union."
"We were recently made aware of how the problem of energy security does not solely concern the areas of industry or economics."
"Energy has been used as a weapon and foreign policy instrument, and hence should be discussed in the context of foreign and security policy."
"The recent energy crisis between Russia and Ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of many Member States of the European Union that are to a dangerous extent dependent on one supplier."
"It is absolutely essential, therefore, for the EU to extend joint action to the energy field and take steps to create a proactive energy policy."
"It is clear that all the efforts taken at national level are not sufficient as they do not guarantee the long-term interests of the Union as a whole."
"Action at EU level is therefore clearly justified, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Moreover, if we treat the idea of a common market seriously, we should endow economic operators, not to mention citizens, with equality in energy security and supply."
"In this light we assess very positively the Presidency’s plans to finalise the decision on the trans-European energy network early this year."
"We should, however, move beyond that."
"One of the main principles of European integration – that of solidarity – encompasses the obligation to assist all those States that are in danger or in difficulty, and that includes problems relating to energy supply shortages."
"The Union should take concrete steps towards the diversification of energy sources and supply and the sharing of reserves."
"All potential avenues for enhancing the Union’s energy self-sufficiency should be explored."
"Nor should we forget the principles of transparency and equal access."
"The EU should propose a code of conduct on relations with its main energy suppliers."
"We should make all the necessary efforts to establish new sources of financing for all the undertakings aimed at increasing the EU’s energy security, both from the EIB and from the EU budget itself."
"We should not just think about ourselves."
"Energy security should constitute one of the cornerstones of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Reality calls for courage."
"Close cooperation in the energy field and the possibility of sharing energy reserves constitute one of the most effective and indispensable confidence-building measures both within the Union and between the Union and its neighbourhood."
"Our citizens will appreciate the tangible results of our actions to secure energy supplies."
"The PPE-DE Group will be tabling a resolution on this for the next part-session in Brussels."
". Mr President, while endorsing what the Council and the Commission have had to say about European energy policy, I do believe that there are areas in which we have to be rather more definite and specific."
"For a start, the big consumers – the EU, the USA, China and India – must do more to have a joint effect on the market, rather than only competing against one another for energy supplies."
"Secondly, we should turn our attention to infrastructure, and give thought – not as a state, but with our firms and businesses – to having the infrastructure owned and managed on a common basis, so as to avoid monopolies."
"Thirdly, we have to do something about the situation in which the WTO has procedures for settling disputes on everything from textiles to shrimps, but not on products as important as gas and oil."
"Fourthly, we need to develop the infrastructure, one example being the Nabucco project, to which the Minister referred, which is very important and which the European Union should support."
"Fifthly, all the Member States must diversify and come up with proposals on the basis of which a single European project can come into being."
"My sixth point is that renewable resources must, of course, be given priority."
"I share the President-in-Office’s scepticism about nuclear power, but the debate will go ahead and we have to ensure that it takes into account all the positive aspects and points of criticism and does not leave out the issue of how to dispose of the waste."
"We certainly cannot – and this is my seventh point – insist on a single energy policy with every country; only by taking national differences into account can we – particularly in the eyes of the outside world – justify a single energy policy."
"You, Commissioner, will recall how, at the hearing, I asked you for a programme that combined energy policy and foreign policy."
"I made the same request of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, but nothing, unfortunately, has as yet been forthcoming."
"I really would press you to put forward such a programme as a matter of urgency, in the Green Paper at the latest, so that we will have a consistent policy that we can defend to the wider world."
"Let me conclude by making it quite clear that, while we want – and need – partnership with Russia, its latest actions are unacceptable."
"We need Russia to treat its neighbours fairly, for they are our neighbours too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy resources are among the fundamental economic and production factors ensuring the competitiveness of an economy and the wellbeing of people."
"EU Member States assure their energy resources by concluding bilateral agreements."
"Russia is taking advantage of such agreements, including the forthcoming German-Russian gas pipeline, and is dividing the European Union by providing individual Member States with different degrees of access to energy supplies."
"Individual countries are easier to influence than the European Union as a whole."
"By constantly emphasising the importance of Russia as a strategic partner and its exceptional position among other countries, the European Union is granting Russia concessions."
"The main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the EU on Russia in terms of energy."
"However, the recent issues with gas supply between Russia and Ukraine show that Russia may resort to the same tactics in supplying gas to European Union Member States."
"The alternative sources of energy which must be used in order to avoid absolute dependency on Russia, that is, Norwegian gas resources, are limited and will not be able to meet the growing demands of the EU economy in the future."
"Is this, then, not the right time to reconsider nuclear energy, the most ecological form of energy, as an alternative to dependency on the unpredictable supply of energy from Russia?"
"Another very important issue being widely discussed in the EU is common energy policy."
"With the European Commission as the energy supply partner representing the interests of all 25 Member States, Russia would have to show more respect."
"Russia will not be able to completely cut off the supply of gas to the EU; it would simply not have any other way to dispose of it."
"Therefore, I invite everyone not only to discuss the development of a common energy policy, but also to take actions to develop the common energy policy and, in particular, a single energy system without delay, thus ensuring energy as well as political security for the entire EU."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bartenstein, I would like to start with Ukraine, having been rather surprised that the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which is an annual event nearly caused us in Europe to treat it as a European gas crisis."
"Ukraine, and later Moldova, found themselves in a situation that had been brought to the point of crisis, but Europe did not."
"Europe was able, as it has been before, to rely on stable trading relations with Russia."
"As I see it, what this situation has shown us was that we in the European Union cannot regard Ukraine as nothing more than a safe transit country, but must rather, by means of energy policy, help it to free itself from dependence on Russia and thereby improve its prospects for the future."
"A great deal of change is needed here."
"Quite apart from that, I see this whole debate as an object lesson in the weaknesses of European energy policy, which are more or less marked from one Member State to another."
"A coordinated approach could, without a doubt, help to improve the situation in the Member States and across Europe."
"We have now learned the real value of natural resources."
"It has to be said that we right across Europe, are, to say the least, wasteful in our use of gas, and of oil too, and this was the subject of more vigorous debate at the time of the Iraq war."
"For some considerable time, our squandering of these raw materials has been something we have not been able to get away with."
"If we want to learn the right lessons from this, then we must, I believe, be much more consistent in doing as Commissioner Piebalgs suggested at the time he took office."
"We have to pursue natural resource productivity and energy efficiency if we are to be less dependent on others;"
"I would be dead against striving for a fully self-sufficient Europe, which would be a naive approach in terms of the overall debate, but we do have to work towards a Europe that makes adequate use of raw materials."
"This is something we have been talking about for decades, for as long as there has been a Club of Rome, so let us at last come up with something of some practical use."
"Let those who think that the use of nuclear power is the right response to the reduced – or indeed finite – supply of gas, just for once put forward a serious case for their chosen approach; how many reactors do they want to build over the next few years, and where?"
"What do they propose to do with the waste that has been produced in Europe for decades?"
"A few weeks ago, we debated the report on the decommissioning of power reactors."
"Right now, the whole business of nuclear waste disposal is a disaster area."
"If that is to be the shape of the future, then I urge them to make their case in clearer terms, but please can they spare us a debate on lifetime extension of the sort that is resuming even on the subject of the reactor at Ignalina?"
"If you really do want to do no more than extend the working life of superannuated technology, then you are increasing the risks inherent in energy production rather than delivering us from them."
". Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the world continues to see the burning of fossilised matter."
"It is estimated that in 2030 humankind will still be producing 80% of its energy using fossilised fuels."
"The earth has a confirmed 179 trillion cubic metres of gas deposits."
"A quarter of the gas is in Russia, and another quarter in regions less stable, in Iran and Qatar."
"It can be estimated that at present consumption rates the EU’s own supplies of gas will be enough for just six or seven years."
"The use of Norwegian and North African gas for the EU’s needs increases the time perspective for gas consumption by 20 years, but it is 50 years in the case of Russia."
"If the EU is planning to satisfy the entire growth in its energy requirements in the next few decades by means of gas, there are no alternatives to imports from Russia."
"The next few years will see the development of cheaper methods in the liquefaction of gas, which will allow for a wider range of possibilities in importing gas."
"At the same time it will also make them narrower in scope."
"Liquefied Russian gas can then be sold to the United States of America, which needs gas, without the need for a pipeline."
"America’s own gas reserves will not be enough for even 10 years."
"Western Europe has been dependent on the gas pipeline that comes from Russia via other countries."
"The planned pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea will reduce this dependence."
"The project is understandable, because some of the countries the pipeline now passes through are hostile towards Russia."
"We in Finland have not had the slightest problem with the gas supply in 40 years."
"There is something in the gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine that needs explaining."
"Who owns the supply company Ros-Ukr-Energo?"
"On the basis of published data, I have worked out that it unaccountably benefits from the agreement to the tune of USD 600–800 million a year."
"The oligarchs in both countries have been involved in this, and what is the role of these countries’ presidents in generating huge sums of hidden profit?"
"Our group supports good partnership relations and cooperation on energy with Russia."
". Mr President, the recent events referred to by the international press as a ‘Cold War’ between Ukraine and Russia over gas, and the less recent project involving the construction of a gas pipeline between Germany and Russia, bypassing the Baltic countries, including Poland, are ample proof that certain countries are using electricity and gas supply networks, especially the latter, as political weapons in their relations with others."
"The Member States expect the Community to provide them with assistance in finding a solution to this problem."
"The Community should pursue a cohesive and integrated policy on the above-mentioned supply networks, as well as on natural disasters, pandemics and the terrorist threat."
"Such a policy would make it possible to safeguard the security and diversification of supplies."
"It is unacceptable for one Member State, Germany for example, to form a coalition with Russia on such matters, since this harms the interests of other Member States, including those that only recently joined the EU."
"This is one of the rare instances when the European Union should respond, and when it should respond promptly and decisively."
"A passive attitude on the part of the EU means that it consents to the principle of solidarity being destroyed, and that effectively it has no influence when it comes to the economic and political problems that are of real importance for Europe."
"That being so, there is no reason why the Union should not go on issuing meaningless resolutions and statements or directives that work to the detriment of Europe’s citizens."
". Mr President, it is a simple fact that Russia’s energy strategy is based on the use of gas and gas suppliers to achieve its political goals in certain regions, including Europe."
"The recent gas crisis is a test of sorts for the European Union."
"Its effects were intended to be felt, and indeed were felt not only by Ukraine and Moldova, but also by eight EU Member States, including Germany, France and Italy."
"By provoking such a crisis, Russia has forfeited its status as a stable and reliable partner."
"The only question that remains is what conclusions will be drawn by the European Union and the individual Member States."
"Will they decide that the construction of the Baltic pipeline should continue, although it will make Europe even more dependent on Russia, or will they realise that what is needed is a genuine diversification of gas supplies for Europe as a whole and a system of energy solidarity for EU Member States and their immediate neighbours?"
"Russia hopes we will draw the first of these conclusions."
"All those who no longer harbour any illusions about the new Russia’s imperial policies hope for the second."
"I shall take the liberty of making one final comment namely that the House’s difficulty in adopting a common resolution on this matter is an embarrassment for Parliament."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Current international political events and also economic factors, including the constant increase in the price of oil, are forcing the European Union to sit up and take notice of a situation that is both obvious and familiar: we have a structural energy supply problem and an increasing level of dependence."
"World demand for energy is rising, global resources are not limitless and, in any case, our Union does not have enough to meet its own needs."
"Recent events have shown how the energy supplies on which our economy is currently based can be put in jeopardy, and that is a risk that we absolutely must not take."
"It is essential to promote a closer international synergy, including through signed agreements such as the European Energy Charter, which creates a cooperation framework between Europe, Russia and Mediterranean countries."
"Energy cooperation with third countries is, in fact, a core element in the European supply strategy and helps to consolidate stable international political relations."
"Within this framework, clear, well-defined, concrete, lasting agreements must now be made, particularly with Russia."
"It is now urgent, therefore, for Member States to put into practice the recent recommendations on implementing energy saving measures, which will require a serious commitment on the part of the EU institutions, the Member States and every individual citizen."
"Furthermore, we must at last hold that complex and comprehensive debate on choosing technologies for the future and on the production and use of alternative and renewable energies."
"Despite the various crises, some of them recent, that have marked Europe’s economy over the last 40 years, this debate has, unfortunately, not yet been held."
"This is a delay, a failing and a gap that we must try to make up for as quickly and as urgently as possible."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Piebalgs for his role in convening the Gas Coordination Group and thereby making a major contribution towards resolving the dispute between Naftagas and Gazprom earlier this month."
"This situation between Russia and Ukraine has served as a wake-up call to those who may not have been aware how dependent the EU Member States are on imported fuels in general and on natural gas from Russia in particular."
"However, it is important that we retain a sense of proportion about this matter."
"The trade in gas between Russia and EU Member States remains commercially viable just as long as each has something the other wants."
"The import dependence of the EU Member States and the related increasing dependence on natural gas is hardly a secret."
"We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have long been aware of this situation and have been debating the need for measures to address this dependence."
"Ten years ago, I submitted a report to Parliament on prospects for gas supply in Europe and was criticised by the industry for suggesting that we could become over-dependent on gas if it provided over 25% of our energy requirements."
"Let me remind the House of the wide range of measures that are already in hand which address our security of supply needs: both legislative measures, such as the TENs Directive, and actions by the industry in building pipelines, storage and LNG facilities."
"We must take note of Russia as it flexes its muscles internationally, but I suggest that a measured, practical approach to maintaining diversity of supply and encouraging appropriate investments to that end must be our response as a long-term solution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in twenty years or so we will actually be 90% dependent on imports of gas."
"That is quite an achievement."
"The amount of gas used by the Member States and stocks vary greatly; in other words, the degree to which one is susceptible to a crisis varies very much."
"The further east a Member State is, the more dependent it will be on gas from Russia."
"The European Union has put pressure on Russia to abandon the practice of the dual pricing of energy, including gas, which goes on inside the country."
"We regard it as a condition of WTO membership."
"I therefore do not believe that the dual pricing of energy can last very long in Russia’s foreign trade either."
"Of course, in business deals it is permitted to grant discounts to good, regular customers in general, and that happens in many other sectors, but it obviously depends on the relationship between the seller and the buyer."
"Turning off the gas tap was certainly the wrong solution and a very unwise one."
"Such things are not done in European trading; it does not go on very much in less significant areas, let alone in such major contexts."
"The situation with regard to energy in the European Union is continually on the verge of a crisis."
"It only takes a storm on the other side of the ocean or the Ukrainian event to start a crisis or even a panic."
"We must have viable and diverse energy sources quickly, with a wide range of supply arrangements and networks of conveyance, and time is of the essence: our bedrooms could get cold at any time."
"We urgently need the Commission to produce an energy crisis programme."
"The resources that we now have are not sufficient."
"How are we preparing for a longer cut in the power supply, Commissioner?"
"What kind of solidarity mechanisms could enter the framework, and does the forthcoming Green Paper deal with energy crisis issues?"
"Mr President, the recent crisis between Russia and Ukraine over gas supply has shown that it is more important than ever to have a European energy market that is less dependent on imports."
"This will provide not only enormous opportunities for the European energy industry, including renewables, but also a window of opportunity for tackling climate change, boosting growth and creating new jobs."
"In order to achieve this we want more transparency, better regulation, a renovated and functioning grid, a European energy strategy, debate on self-sufficiency and solidarity between Member States, and rules that enable consumers to decide on their own consumption in a workable way."
"We therefore welcome the green paper as well as the Presidency’s programme."
"There is much to be done, but I think we can do it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that the way the talks are going between Ukraine and Russia makes it unmistakeably plain that Europe – which is more than just the European Union – needs a new and modern all-embracing energy policy."
"While one can debate the point to one’s heart’s content, the dispute between Russia and Ukraine was, at the end of the day, one between a supplier who wanted more money, and a customer who was unwilling to pay up."
"Both sides in the dispute had known that for ages."
"If, so to speak, a political course is set that makes this sort of crisis inevitable, without the attempt being made to find a solution in good time, then both governments have been negligent."
"Although I do indeed welcome the Commissioner’s announcement that a Green Paper will be appearing, I do of course hope that it will not contain such old ideas as the negotiation of codes of conduct for the countries by which energy is produced and those through which it passes, new pipelines or even nuclear power."
"Rather, I believe that we have to rely, as is already being done in many countries, on other sources, such as biomass, the sun, wind, water, geothermal energy and cogeneration, while also, at the same time, saving energy, making more efficient use of it, and reducing subsidies for long-established fossil fuels."
"That is something we have to bring about."
"The supply of energy is a service of public general interest, and we ought perhaps to consider whether responsible policies ought not to be regarded as a higher priority than attempts at liberalisation or the use of liberalisation measures as a solution to this problem."
"Mr President, the lack of a common and long-term energy security strategy is proof not only of the EU’s short-sightedness, but even that a conflict of interests exists between its Member States."
"One of the reasons why oil prices have tripled is that the EU has failed to adopt an intelligent energy strategy."
"The rise in oil prices works to the advantage of the large fuel companies, but it works to the disadvantage of the EU Member States and of the citizens of these Member States."
"It is a mistake for individual Member States to attempt to reach an agreement with Russia, as Germany has done, sacrificing the interests of the Baltic States, Poland, Austria and other Member States in the process."
"Along with the EU’s passive attitude, this has encouraged Russia to blackmail Ukraine by threatening to cut off gas supplies."
"There is an urgent need for the EU to draft and implement an energy security strategy as soon as possible, and indeed this can be viewed as a test of the extent to which the European Union is still a community."
"The EU’s energy security strategy should be based on the criteria of the weakest link, which can be summarised as follows."
"The efficiency of a system can be measured by its resistance to crises in those countries and regions which are most dependent on one supplier, or which have the worst transmission and distribution systems, or the highest generation costs in relation to national income."
"Our concern should focus in particular on neighbouring and transit countries."
"To echo Hamlet, ‘to be or not to be’ is the dilemma we face with regard to energy security in the EU."
"In this context, I regret to say that no provision whatsoever has been made for a common European energy security strategy in the EU’s 2007-2013 budget."
"Thank you, Mr President. The Christmas greeting from the Russian President to gas consumers in Ukraine was in no way a surprise."
"With its interruption to the gas supply in the very middle of winter, Russia reminded not only Ukraine but also the world’s energy markets, that power currently lies with energy suppliers."
"Energy consumers will have to take this into account for an unforeseeably long time."
"I would like to express my gratitude to Commissioner Piebalgs, who during the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis made use of the European Union’s influence early enough to prevent an energy crisis in Europe."
"With regard to the conclusions to be drawn following the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, the European Union must itself display and must ask the other countries in Europe for total openness regarding information about developments in gas prices."
"I believe that recent events give the Commission special authorisation to implement the legislation that has been passed, to implement decisions for the acquisition of alternative, energy-efficient resources and the creation of a truly liberalised energy market, and to secure the integration of European energy networks."
"Naturally, today almost all the speakers have mentioned this point: the need for a genuinely common energy policy for the European Union’s common market, which would facilitate long-term political stability not only in Europe but also in the global energy market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is in a state of shock following the crisis that has taken place between Ukraine and Russia."
"This is largely because, to date, even at time of intense internal upheaval, Russia had always shown itself to be a reliable energy partner, and at no point in the past have the Member States of the Union seen their supply of gas interrupted or reduced."
"Those three days of crisis were sufficient to bring countries such as Italy to the point of releasing their strategic reserves and, above all, for the Union as a whole to realise once again that its supply system is extremely vulnerable."
"The time has therefore come to consider seriously the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes, improving dialogue with stable partners, such as the Republic of Kazakhstan, for example."
"We must begin to think about importing gas from that country via Turkey, for example, which is a candidate country and hence an extremely secure one."
"Furthermore, we must maintain and enhance, at European level, research and development in new energy sources and achieve more efficient use of those we already have."
"Naturally, Mrs Harms, we cannot ignore any primary energy source."
"Not one."
"We must look beyond ideological preconceptions and face reality."
"If you want to commit energy suicide, you are free to do so, but your sacrifice must be an individual one."
"Do not expect us all to commit suicide against our will."
"Finally, Mr President, I shall end by calling upon the Commission to carry on putting pressure on the Member States to create a common energy policy, and this crisis has shown us beyond any doubt that we need one."
"Let us not wait until there is another crisis and then take measures that are more drastic and that may well be too late."
"Mr President, I must keep it brief."
"My concern is that attention be called to the foreign policy aspects of what we have witnessed in recent weeks, when Russia threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine."
"This did not come as a total surprise to those who, like me, have worked with those countries for many years. After all, Russia has previously threatened to use energy as a weapon with a view to exerting political pressure on its immediate neighbours and has even, if you ask me, done so on one occasion."
"Obviously, the outcome of what happened also came as a shock to the European Union and forces us to have this discussion today."
"As I said, I will keep it brief. There are three conclusions that are important for us where those foreign aspects are concerned."
"Firstly, we should diversify our supplies, our sources."
"Given that most of the countries from which we get our energy are unstable, the more countries we can use as sources the better."
"Secondly, we must reconsider the pipeline situation in Europe."
"We are particularly vulnerable since most gas is supplied via Ukraine."
"Are there any possible alternatives?"
"Thirdly, we must make it absolutely clear that in the longer term, we can safeguard our energy supply only if we can join forces with partners who are reliable and democratic."
"Finally, it has in my view become evident that energy policy more than ever goes hand in hand with foreign and trade policy."
"Mr President, I would like to focus our attention on proposals concerning possible solutions for energy problems."
"First of all, the European Union must promote the more efficient use of energy in its external policy by making this one of the priorities of the EU’s Neighbourhood Programme."
"It may even be worthwhile to establish the criteria for the energy efficiency as a condition for the provision of European Union support."
"In so doing, we will also facilitate democratisation processes in the neighbouring countries; our experience with reforms in Lithuania shows that modernisation of the economy provides the stable background needed for the development of democratic processes."
"In European domestic policy, greater attention should be paid to the development and implementation of an innovation centre dedicated to the new generation of small-scale energy plants based on nuclear and other technologies."
"We already have a successful aviation project, the remarkable Galileo programme; therefore, we can no doubt also have an innovation centre for the implementation of energy programmes."
"Such a centre could operate in countries with the greatest dependency on a single source of energy."
"I would like to believe that, apart from the general talk about a common energy strategy, the Commission will finally do something specific and that such a centre might provide the best evidence of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy objectives."
"Mr President, contrary to opinion, including opinion within this Chamber, the Ukrainian gas crisis was not a one-off, first-time event justified by the need to move to market policies."
"On the contrary, it is a consistent policy and has everything to do with politics."
"First, Ukraine had a contract, signed in 2004 and lasting until 2009."
"It was terminated because Ukraine elected the wrong president and because of forthcoming parliamentary elections."
"Second, the Russian Government is the majority shareholder in Gazprom, a monopoly headed by the deputy prime minister."
"It is not a company."
"One cannot speak of market prices and a government-controlled monopoly in the same breath."
"Third, the one-off issue: Moscow stopped oil and gas deliveries to stymie Lithuania’s independence movement way back in 1990."
"After independence, the Russian Government used the same weapon to punish the Baltic States for not joining the CIS and for demanding the removal of Russian troops."
"When Lithuania tried to privatise the Mazeikiu oil refinery, again supplies were cut off so that Russian investors could move in."
"It successfully followed the same policy when it came to Georgia, which gave up its gas pipelines."
"To sum up, Russia has consistently used a government-owned monopolistic energy company to put political pressure on countries – market practices and existing contracts be damned."
"Empiricism is wiser than wishful thinking."
"The experiences of the new Member States, and of Ukraine and Moldova when they adopted a pro-EU stance, clearly show the dangers of lacking a robust EU policy on energy security."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I do believe that the Commission and the Presidency have done the right thing."
"In the absence of sufficient information, we refrained from apportioning blame in any way and did not want under any circumstances whatever to express agreement with any one party to this dispute or even to betray the least hint of it."
"What is clear is that the situation could very well become critical, for one new Member State had problems with the energy supply to its industry from day one, but we and the Commission are deliberately not talking in terms of a critical situation rather than of a crisis."
"We must not lose sight of the fact that dependence on fossil energy sources and on imports thereof cannot do other than markedly increase; the Commission estimates that the proportion of our energy that we derive from these sources will, by 2030, increase from just under 50% – which is what it is at present – to something like two-thirds."
"It will be possible to influence this to some degree by the use of renewable energy sources and by improving energy efficiency, but I do not myself take the view that we can bring about any fundamental about-turn in this trend."
"The presidency looks forward with great interest to the Green Paper, or rather to the appearance of the first parts of it in time for the Spring Summit."
"When, if not now, are we to discuss the development of a common European energy policy?"
"What prompts us to go further down this road is the gas issue, Russia, Ukraine, and the problem of supply, as well as oil prices, climate change and many other considerations too."
"Both I personally, and the presidency as a whole, endorse the Commission’s proposal for the creation of a two-month reserve similar to that which already exists at another level for oil."
"Your House will have an opportunity to discuss the details of this later on."
"As I said in my statement on Moldova, we have sought in many respects to give priority to that country in our neighbourhood policy."
"Despite Mr Swoboda’s assertion that having Russia as a member of the WTO would open up certain possibilities in this respect, even then, it would be possible to do but little within the space of 36 hours."
"What is interesting is that Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter, and so there can be no recourse to the dispute resolution procedure for which it provides."
"It is, then, energy efficiency that must quite clearly be given priority, along with renewable energies and the fostering of the awareness that we must, in various ways, and to an even greater extent than before, address the issue of gas imports."
"It remains for me to observe that, over the coming years and decades, Russia and Russian natural gas will become the backbone of the European Union’s gas supply."
"Speaking as an Austrian, I would like to point out that it was an Austrian company, OMV, that was, in 1968, the first to conclude a supply contract with Gasprom, which has been absolutely reliable for nearly forty years."
"We need to win trust, and perhaps, to some extent, to rebuild it."
"I have already, in my speech, discussed the alternative route in the shape of the ‘Nabucco’ pipeline through Turkey."
"Absolutely necessary though it is to diversify supply, this cannot be accomplished overnight; we must learn our lessons from the critical situation that lasted for 36 hours."
"With this in mind, I am grateful to your House for this very important debate and will close by highlighting the importance that we attach to this chapter as an item on the agenda for the Spring Summit in March."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for this debate, which clearly indicates there is general support for developments towards a common EU energy policy that respects subsidiarity."
"It is interesting that the first calls for such vital developments were made 30 years ago, during the first oil crisis."
"At that time, for obvious reasons, they came not from Parliament but from the Council."
"The situation today is definitely more complex than it was then, and will probably have longer-lasting consequences in the energy area than was the case 30 years ago."
"Given these circumstances, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must act."
"On the security dimension, I would like to mention two particular aspects."
"Firstly, enlargement definitely brought new challenges for the European Union."
"Security of supply was certainly a far bigger challenge for the new Member States than for the older Member States."
"Secondly, the paper we are preparing at this stage has two authors: Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and myself."
"Therefore, the issues that Mr Swoboda raised will be addressed."
"We also look into action at times of crisis."
"As I mentioned, this crisis was very short and some speakers referred to it as a mini- or even non-existent crisis."
"One should not underestimate the importance of the situation, because some countries did feel an impact."
"In most countries, the only impact felt by citizens was a media one."
"However, in some countries economic measures were taken in respect of the supply of gas."
"It was a real crisis and we should look at how we could react more effectively in the future."
"At the same time, we should act immediately."
"We already have a lot of instruments that could be applied vigorously."
"On energy efficiency, we have a building directive entering into force which should be applied vigorously."
"The same applies to combined heat and power, and renewable energies: we have legal instruments and we should apply them."
"The same is true for renewable energy."
"The Commission will do everything possible."
"It is already taking positive steps, such as trying to mobilise all possible resources."
"Let me turn to the New Neighbourhood countries, with which we have very good relations. Unfortunately, it is true that energy issues have been neglected."
"A memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on the implementation of energy policy was signed only this year during the summit."
"Therefore, we really need to help not only to deal with external supply issues but also with energy consumption, because the energy intensity in those countries, and energy losses, are tremendous, and no country could bear the energy costs arising from that situation."
"The same applies to Moldova."
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has done a good job in Ukraine, but it could intensify its activities."
"We could draw on other resources to strengthen these and harness New Neighbourhood instruments for strengthening policies."
"We will do this, and do the same as regards development policy, because otherwise there can be no solution."
"I should like to thank you once again for this debate."
"I am sure that this will not be the last time we debate these issues, and I draw a lot of inspiration from such debates."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report (A6-0391/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (COM(2005)0263 – C6 0243/2005 – 2005/0118(CNS));"
"- the report (A6-0392/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (COM(2005)0263 – C6-0244/2005 – 2005/0119(CNS)), and"
"- the report (A6-0393/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the European Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (COM(2005)0263 – C6-0245/2005 – 2005/0120(CNS))."
". Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Daul, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Fazakas and Mrs Morgantini for their proactive involvement in this dossier, and to praise the impressive work accomplished by the rapporteurs, Mr Fruteau, Mr Glattfelder, Mr Wynn and Mrs Kinnock."
"Let me also thank the members of the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development, International Trade, Budgetary Control and Development for their strong commitment, their helpful input and the very constructive debate."
"These impressive contributions certainly have produced results."
"The reform of the common market organisation that has remained practically unchanged for almost four decades is a major undertaking; in fact this reform is long overdue."
"Sugar policy has many facets."
"The list of legitimate interests that need to be met is very long: the hundreds of thousands of farmers who grow sugar beet in the community; the sugar producing and consuming industries and their workers; the consumers; and, last but not least, our trade partners, including those countries enjoying longstanding preferences."
"From the beginning, I have been aware of the need to strike a fine balance between the different needs and the different demands."
"As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, I am fully aware of the social, economic and environmental relevance of the sugar sector, both inside and outside the Community."
"That makes sugar policy particularly challenging, which is why I have committed myself so deeply to the reform of this sector."
"I believe that the present proposals in their entirety respond to the needs of the Community."
"They are the result of careful reflection and are in tune in the CAP reform package and our international commitments."
"We have been ambitious and far-reaching."
"I am convinced that the future of the sugar sector cannot be based on short-term approaches."
"The reform package seeks to give the European sugar sector a viable and competitive future."
"It offers long-term certainty and generous assistance to help both farmers and sugar producers with the process of adjustment."
"By acting now, we will have the funds available to ease the painful restructuring process that is absolutely vital and at the same time compensate our farmers."
"Delaying this necessary reform would result in nothing but a more drastic reduction of Community production and a much more severe restructuring process."
"We also need to ensure the compliance of the future regime with the WTO panel, and our proposal fulfils that requirement."
"Finally, we have to ensure that the European Union remains an attractive market for developing countries, and offer our ACP partners the necessary financial assistance to adapt to these unavoidable changes."
"Much useful work has been done since the first communication from the Commission was presented in the summer of 2004, both in the European Parliament and in the Council."
"As a result, today we have the contours of a reform that has to a very large extent been shaped by Parliament."
"Most obvious is that the entire reform is built on the basis of a restructuring fund, which was an idea originally introduced by the European Parliament in the report by Mr Fruteau and Mr Daul at the beginning of last year."
"There are many other examples of the European Parliament’s influence on this reform: the retention of the intervention system during a transitional period; the reduction of the price cuts and its extension over a four-year period with a generous compensation scheme; all the measures taken to more adequately ensure the management of supply; the possibilities of making a real difference in those areas that will be most affected by the restructuring; and the allocation of the restructuring aid, of which at least 10% would be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors – an amount that could be increased by Member States according to their specific situations."
"All these fingerprints show that we have had collaboration that has gone beyond the expression of intention and has delivered a real political result."
"I want to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for its cooperation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is today faced with the necessity of reforming its sugar sector."
"As we all know, this reform is unavoidable."
"It is necessary because we need to bring the common organisation of the market in sugar into line with the guiding principles of the new common agricultural policy."
"It is also necessary in order to adapt to the changing rules of world trade."
"All the same, we must not lose sight of the consequences of the coming changes for the men and women who make their living from producing sugar in the fields and factories of the Community and in the developing countries."
"With this in mind, it is important that the changes to the European sugar sector do not result in the dismantling of our common organisation of the market in sugar, in the gradual closure of our production capacity or in the sacrifice of our producers and those of the poorest countries in consequence of an uncontrolled opening of world trade."
"Reform is essential, that is true, but it will only meet its objectives if the quest for efficiency respects the requirements of social justice."
"This twin perspective, which makes for balance, is the common thread running through the three reports on which the European Parliament is to vote this week and which were adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 29 November last."
"These texts are the fruit of several months’ discussions and hearings in the Committee on Agriculture and of exchanges of views with yourself, Commissioner, with your services and with the various parties concerned in the industry."
"They represent a compromise negotiated and approved by a large majority of the political groups in this Parliament."
"There are four major aspects to this compromise."
"The first is the introduction of flexible regulation of the sugar market. Flexibility, then, through the gradual introduction of market logic into the sector;"
"I am referring to the reference price, which will make the sector more competitive. Regulation, too, however, to avoid the disastrous consequences of a totally deregulated sugar market."
"Internally, this means maintaining the intervention system for a time so as to guarantee market stability during the next four years, which we all know will be difficult economically."
"Turning to the external aspect of the reform, the need for regulation means keeping control of sugar imports from the least developed countries."
"It is in fact essential today that we take account of the damage caused by the uncontrolled opening of trade, as the recent example of the western Balkans has shown."
"With this in mind, in order to avoid any incentive for fraud once the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative has taken full effect, the Committee on Agriculture argues in particular for the establishment of a commercial safeguard in the form of a safeguard clause limiting exports according to the net exporter principle."
"This arrangement would enable us to prevent destructive triangular trade while ensuring for the least developed countries that their local populations working in the sugar-producing sector will actually benefit from the preferential trade regime with the European Union."
"It would not affect the growth prospects of the LDCs’ sugar industries and would be fully compatible with the objectives of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative."
"The second major theme of the compromise before Parliament is European solidarity with, in particular, the most fragile regions."
"While the establishment of trade regulation will allow us to stabilise markets and avoid excessive price fluctuations in the future, it must in fact be accompanied by measures to cushion the reform’s impact on the communities most affected by cessation of activity, above all those which are most fragile."
"These include, first of all, farmers; they must receive substantial compensation for their loss of income, and some of the aid provided by the restructuring scheme should allow those who will lose their delivery rights and will be forced to make new investments in order to switch to other crops to be indemnified."
"Then there are the people employed in sugar factories."
"They are totally dependant on the sector’s future restructuring, and it is essential, where there is cessation of industrial activity, that they be considered by strengthening the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to receive aid from the restructuring fund."
"Finally, to avoid the most fragile regions being the main casualties of the restructuring of Community production, it is essential that the Member States should still have the final say over whether production ceases or continues on their territory."
"It is also essential that due and proper account be taken of the specific situations and constraints of the outermost regions."
"The growing and processing of sugar cane are essential to those regions and irreplaceable, in economic, social and cultural terms."
"In this connection, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being such a good listener and for the efforts you have made to ensure that these regions receive special treatment, especially as regards compensation and sales aid."
"I am sure that such schemes, for which Parliament has called, will enable the people of those regions who make their living from sugar cane to look to the future with greater equanimity."
"The third aspect of the reform is concerned with the sector’s future through the development of alternative outlets."
"In a world context characterised, on the one hand, by rising oil prices and, on the other, by the need to fight greenhouse gases, alcohol production in the sugar sector in fact offers a major asset for the development of alternative energies."
"In view of the impact of the reform of the COM on production levels, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore proposes anticipating these trends by means of a proactive policy involving both the agricultural and the industrial aspects: the agricultural by means of measures to improve access to aid for energy crops in particular, the industrial by adapting the restructuring scheme to encourage the development of bioethanol distilleries."
"These tools form part of a coherent legislative proposal that would encourage the development of the bioethanol industry, a source of outlets for both farmers and manufacturers in the sector."
"Finally, the fourth and last major thrust of our work, but not the least: prices."
"By contrast to the Commission’s original proposals, which would have a drastic effect on the sector, the rural fabric and the developing countries, the Committee on Agriculture in the end came out in favour of a slower and more moderate 30% reduction in sugar prices over four years."
"Such a level of price reduction would guarantee the reform’s economic effectiveness while helping to soften its impact on the sector’s players."
"In so doing, it would better guarantee continued activity in the production regions, safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly related to the sector."
"This more moderate approach is also in line with the Community’s development commitments and will enable the ACP and LDC countries which export part of their production to the EU to continue to practice remunerative prices."
"At the end of November, in anticipation of the World Trade Organisation conference in Hong Kong and without waiting for Parliament’s final vote, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States reached an informal, provisional compromise on the main directions of the future reform."
"While the real purpose of that agreement was to arrive at a common political line, the way it was immediately exploited by the various signatories in the media as meaning that the reform had been settled ahead of schedule nevertheless sends a clear message: I believe it expresses the desire of the Commission and the Council to bypass the European Parliament, whose prior opinion is nevertheless mandatory before any decision is taken."
"In this respect, I find the procedure totally unacceptable and it must be condemned in the strongest terms."
"However that may be, that compromise is now on the table and while it does not follow the Committee on Agriculture’s proposed amendments to the letter, it has to be said that, as it stands, it is a remarkable confirmation of how far the Council has moved from the original proposals."
"The compromise marks an appreciable shift towards the more moderate and more balanced measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the four major topics I have just mentioned."
"In terms of regulation, it takes up the idea of maintaining the intervention system for four years, before moving to a reference price, which will mark the introduction of the logic of the market into the common organisation of the market in sugar."
"Secondly, and more importantly, it confirms the soundness of Parliament’s analysis regarding the need to retain some ability to manage the supply of sugar on the Community market."
"While the measures proposed are different, their philosophies converge along the lines of adapting the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative."
"Concerning the implementation of European solidarity, the Council backs the increase in aid to farmers, proposing a compensation of 64.2% of lost earnings instead of the 60% initially proposed."
"It also takes up the idea of transferring to farmers 10% of the money provided for restructuring aid."
"Parliament’s proposal for a partial coupling and a modulation of aid for the less-favoured regions was not adopted, however."
"Concerning the third line of approach, alternative outlets, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States confirmed the possibility of a partial dismantling of factories, enabling bioethanol distilleries to be developed."
"Nevertheless, the hoped-for financial incentives for the development of energy crops have not materialised."
"Finally, in the field of prices, the 36% reduction over four years envisaged by the Council is not so quick or drastic as the initial proposals and is entirely consistent with the work done by the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture."
"Despite this undeniable progress, which must be welcomed, a number of proposals have not been taken up, in particular as regards tightening up the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to qualify for restructuring aid."
"It is in this regard particularly regrettable that the Council has up until now disregarded all the social criteria that must be complied with and the fact that it is ultimately up to the Member States to approve or otherwise any cessations of production."
"Moreover, even if it means departing from what is, strictly speaking, the subject of this debate and of my reports, I really must at this point express my outrage at the way the ACP countries are treated."
"In the light of a reform, and in particular a price cut, the consequences of which will be disastrous for a great many of them, the sum of EUR 40 million allocated by the Council for 2006 can only be considered derisory and insulting."
"The European Union really will have to find the resources necessary to remedy this situation, which contrasts with what the Heads of State or Government have repeatedly said about helping the poorest countries to develop."
"It is clear, ladies and gentlemen, that the Ministers of Agriculture will have to continue their efforts during the February negotiations if they are to reach a final agreement that is acceptable to all."
"With this in mind, I would like Parliament to vote in favour of the three reports before it with the largest possible majority in order to send a strong signal to the members of the Council so that the remaining gaps in November’s provisional compromise are closed and the COM in sugar is reformed in a way that is both fair and efficient."
". Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and Mr Fruteau for dealing so well with what is an extremely contentious and difficult issue."
"Clearly the reform of the sugar sector is essential, but I cannot agree that the collateral damage of what is an internal European Union reform should be felt by some of the small, vulnerable economies with whom we have very special relationships and partnerships."
"Throughout the discussions the ACP countries have made the case for a gradual price cut, an end to dumping and for additional long-term funding to help them deal with what is a drastic reform."
"By and large, their pleas have been rejected."
"It is the view of the ACP countries, as Mr Fruteau has intimated, that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what is on the table now."
"They have no guarantee of where the money is to come from in the long term to help them restructure and to diversify both within and outside of sugar."
"In the Caribbean alone the losses as a result of the cuts are expected to be in the region of EUR 125 million."
"The ACP Sugar Protocol countries supplied tropical sugar when Europe needed it."
"Now they are asking that we understand the inevitable dependence they have on that commodity, one upon which they depend for foreign exchange earnings which have brought stability to them and have ensured that they maintain democracies."
"Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion is on the table for European farmers."
"So far the ACP has EUR 40 million, which is to be divided between 18 countries, and it is not even clear how it is going to be divided."
"In addition, Commissioner Mandelson warned last night in the WTO debate that the figure of EUR 190 million, which the Commission has proposed, is now threatened by a 20% cut agreed in the EU’s budget negotiations."
"Commissioner, where exactly is that money going to come from?"
"Is it yet again the intention of the Commission to raid the development budget to cover the cost of these accompanying measures for the ACP?"
"I hope that the Commissioner for Development, Mr Michel, will stand firm and that, in the spirit of what you said about your interest in developing countries, you will give your support for new and additional money to cover the accompanying measures."
"Another concern relates to the effects of the regulation on LDCs."
"I refer you to the amendments that I have submitted on that issue."
"Almost all of the world’s least developed countries are members of the ACP group."
"Therefore they have an enormous interest in the appalling suggestion that we should pull back on our commitments to Everything But Arms."
"From 2009 all least developed countries should benefit from the same guaranteed price as that provided for in the ACP Sugar Protocol."
"There should be no delay in the fulfilment of Europe’s commitments to provide duty-free, quota-free access on a stable and long-term basis to LDCs."
"The safeguard clause that was agreed by the Council calls for an upper limit of a 25% increase per year on LDC imports."
"That makes an absolute mockery of EBA."
"LDCs are set to lose EUR 783 million of potential earnings in the first year alone."
"I hope that this Parliament will not accept a situation which jeopardises a European initiative of which we have been justifiably proud."
"We must not vote for any delay on the implementation or indeed for a safeguard clause, which would limit the promise offered by EBA."
"In line with the objective of having coherence between agriculture and development priorities, I would recommend support for amendments on the elimination of export subsidies and the abolition of C sugar exports."
"If we fail to act we will be giving absolutely the wrong signal to millions of the world’s poorest people, at a time when Europe is meant to be focusing on making poverty history."
". Madam President, the Committee on International Trade prepared a recommendation for the draft report debated today."
"This had three main elements."
"The first element stated that the Committee proposes a moderate price cut."
"We proposed that the European Union restrict imports more efficiently and that sugar producing farmers in the European Union receive higher compensation."
"These proposals are significantly more beneficial for the European sugar sector than those tabled by the European Commission."
"It is unfortunate that the decision of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, adopted in November, is extremely disappointing, as it does not take into account sufficiently the interests of European agriculture, and in fact it is even questionable that a decision adopted in this manner would lead to the development of a stable sugar market in the European Union."
"Today, Parliament can only hope for minor changes, but we are still very determined in respect of a few details."
"For instance, we would like to make it possible for sugar beet growers to be able to receive up to a fifty percent share from the restructuring fund instead of the current ten percent."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the opinion of the committee, the effective restriction of imports is extremely important."
"For instance, even the United States of America restricts imports under preferential conditions."
"If the United States does not allow cheating, then the European Union should not allow it either because it undermines the international reputation of the European Union."
"Furthermore, a system that imposes strict quotas on producers in the European Union, but allows importers to supply the markets of the European Union without any restriction is extremely meaningless and unjust."
". Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that when she first presented her proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I applauded."
"I realise that I was the only person who applauded in that committee, which put me at odds with many of my colleagues."
"I applauded because I have wanted reform in this sector ever since I read the 1991 report by the Court of Auditors."
"I have sought changes in the regime from a budget control point of view, from a budget point of view, from a development point of view, from a WTO point of view and from a consumer point of view, which puts me at odds with Mr Fruteau, for whom I have the greatest respect and whom I genuinely admire."
"But quite frankly, we should not accept the call for ‘the introduction of modifications’."
"What we need is a radical overhaul, as the Commissioner proposed."
"We should not vote for lesser price cuts and increased compensation and less quota cuts than those proposed by the Commission."
"We should not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers."
"All ACP producers were being offered the same."
"Large amounts of CAP funds are already available to EU farmers."
"Let us not forget that sugar producers, processors and refiners are not the poorest people on this planet."
"I agree that we need to monitor imports from the less-developed countries in order to prevent fraud and guard against triangular trade, but quite honestly, we are talking about tiny amounts."
"EU sugar production of 17 million tonnes will not be distorted; there will not be a market imbalance because of LDC imports."
"Amendment 61, on the Everything But Arms Agreement, should be opposed."
"What we are trying to do to the least developed countries is unacceptable."
"We should follow the line that Mrs Kinnock has given, making sure that, whatever we do with these reforms, the developing world is not jeopardised."
". Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar is one of the most major reforms to the common agricultural policy to be undertaken in the life of this Parliament."
"It is a balancing act on a high wire extending between, on the one hand, the demands made by the WTO, the obligations arising from the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative and the panel’s decision, and, on the other, the producers of beet and cane sugar and the economic interests associated with them in Europe."
"The Commission, represented by Commissioner Fischer Boel, Parliament and, above all, the Council bear the brunt of responsibility for this high-wire performance."
"Some 350 000 farming families and well over 100 000 workers in the relevant economic sectors of the EU are affected by it."
"Many sugar beet farmers and worker in sugar factories still want to know why it is so necessary to reform, and on such a massive scale, a sugar market organisation that has stood the test of decades."
"The answer is a very simple one: it is because the international commitments made long ago mean that, in the absence of reform, the future of beet and cane sugar cultivation in the European Union will be very much in doubt after 2009."
"Reform of the common market organisation for sugar gives us the chance to keep a great deal of production in Europe, even though it will result in painful reductions in income for sugar producers."
"It is unfortunate – as Mr Fruteau indeed said – that, following the Council’s agreement of 24 November, the Commission and the Council of Ministers gave the impression that that had put the seal on the sugar market organisation."
"The fact is, though, that this agreement was no more and no less than a declaration of intent on the part of the Council."
"It is only when the ministers next meet, on 19 February, that the Council will be able to adopt the sugar market reform."
"I am glad to see that the Council of Ministers has, to a significant degree, taken on board the demands we made in our motion for a resolution on 10 March 2005."
"For example, the Commission envisaged price reductions of up to 50% in the price of beet sugar."
"A majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted a reduction of 30% in the price of white sugar; the Council agreed to 36%."
"In its proposal, the Commission envisaged 60% for compensation payments, while the Council wants to increase them to 64.2%."
"It is also heartening to see that the reform is to run until 2014/2015, and that there is to be no transfer of quotas from one Member State to another."
"It is at this point that I would like to thank the new German Agriculture Minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, who, shortly after being sworn in, promptly played a significant part during negotiations in the Council in getting the Commission’s proposals changed to the benefit of the European Union’s beet and cane sugar cultivators."
"It is above all in the restructuring fund that improvements are needed."
"The Council’s plan is that at least 10% of the funds provided for restructuring will be used for agriculture."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is calling for at least 50% to be used for the creation of alternative means of agricultural production, and, when it comes to the final decision on that in the Council, I ask you, Commissioner Fischer Boel, and the Council, to take account of the way this House votes."
"It is evident from Russia’s use of gas supplies to Ukraine as a means of political blackmail that we have to seize every opportunity to make the European Union just that bit more independent in energy matters."
"It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass."
"The Commission and the Council must support economically viable energy production by using the restructuring fund to provide start-up finance, and must do everything possible, to enable a stop to be put to the so-called triangular operations, to which reference has already been made."
"In my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like, in particular, to thank the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Daul, and the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, for their outstanding cooperation on the report on the reform of the common market organisation for sugar."
"I also wish to thank all those other Members who have made a constructive contribution to this report."
"When, on Thursday, we vote on the reform of the sugar market, this House will be sending out a signal and demanding that the Commission and the Council change their declarations of intent, even if only in a few respects."
"– Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for the maturity and efficiency with which he presented his proposals and for his cooperation with the political groups and all the parliamentary committees."
"Unfortunately, however, I must point out that the Commission and the Council have decided to review one of perhaps the most important markets without barely waiting for the decisions by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Do you imagine, Commissioner, that the way in which you have handled the issue promotes substantial interinstitutional cooperation?"
"Of course it does not."
"Do you today have at least to make a show of good cooperation with the European Parliament?"
"Which of the European Parliament's proposals do you intend to accept?"
"Have you been instructed and do you intend to exert dynamic pressure on the Council in this direction?"
"The review of the sugar industry is a premeditated crime for rural areas and for the European industry and of dubious results for developing countries, especially the less developed countries."
"Already in numerous regions, including my country, Greece, demonstrations have started by sugar beet producers and workers in the sugar industry – including the Greek sugar industry – due to the significant repercussions which a reduction in the order of 36% will have."
"You said, Commissioner, that you aimed to make the European sugar industry viable in the European Union."
"Are you exaggerating or have you got the wrong figures?"
"Both predictions and results show that the sugar industry will shrink or disappear and producers with it."
"We are therefore calling, within the framework of close cooperation and a mild adaptation of the new market, for certain proposals which are expressed as proposals in the Fruteau report."
"First, substantial compensation for loss of income, mainly for the small-scale producers who will be hardest hit by the reduction in aid."
"Secondly, material activation of the Reconstruction Fund, as the basis for substantial consultation with all producers and workers for the preparation of integrated operational programmes and restructuring programmes in a bid to stop areas being abandoned."
"Thirdly, aid of EUR 80 per hectare for areas sown under energy crops and an increase in the overall number of hectares allowed from 1.8 to 2.8 million. This is important, because efforts are being made to switch to more environmentally friendly forms of energy."
"Fourthly, the possibility of national aid for producers for a transitional period and the provision of a percentage of between approximately 30 and 50% of the sum given for the restructuring of industry to producers themselves, provided of course that they continue to cultivate other crops."
"Of course, what this means, Commissioner, is that you undertake to safeguard the sugar budget during negotiations on the financial perspectives."
"Otherwise, it will be cheque returned to drawer which, in the wake of the Commission's poor organisational skills, will reinforce the lack of credibility of the Community institutions in the mind of European citizens."
"Madam President, first and foremost, I should like to congratulate Mrs Fischer Boel on this reform."
"It was an ambitious proposal that the Commission put forward, and the compromise subsequently adopted by the Council is an excellent one."
"The result is clear: more free trade where sugar is concerned."
"Over the next few years, the world’s poorest countries will be given free access to the European market, and the price of sugar will be reduced to something closer to its price on the world market."
"I am annoyed that Parliament has made its contribution too late."
"In spite of many calls to get things under way last year, we are now in a situation in which we have had our day, as the decision has already been made in the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"That does not mean that the European Parliament has made no impression on the reform. On the contrary."
"Quite a few features of the reform reflect the wishes expressed by the European Parliament. For example, the section on restructuring reflects our desire to strengthen those regions in which sugar cane production is crucial."
"I am very pleased that we have, at long last, adopted a reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar, which has existed largely unchanged for 40 years."
"By means of this reform, we have taken a good long step in the right direction: towards something that is more in the way of a market economy."
"It is not enough to bring about free trade with countries outside the Community, as the fact is, of course, that we do not have a free market within the EU."
"Only once we have removed the national quotas so that production occurs in the places that are best for it and where it is most profitable shall we be able to talk in terms of having a free internal market."
"There are quite a few features of the reform worth emphasising."
"Unfortunately, time does not permit me to do so."
"I want particularly to mention the proposal for increasing the use of biofuel and the production of ethanol, in which I believe we must invest a very great deal as quickly as possible."
"That is something that, fortunately, a number of Member States are doing. Meanwhile, others are procrastinating and have not yet begun investing."
"It is not only sugar cane but also other crops that can be cultivated in areas previously given over to sugar cane and that can be used for biofuel which – environmentally, economically and in terms of supply – will be an important part of future energy production."
"The biggest battle in the campaign to create a basis for biofuel must be fought with the Member States’ finance ministers, who are a little too keen on the tax revenue from oil and on the contribution it makes to the state coffers."
"Irrespective of how justified it may be, the reform – including, in particular, the reduction in prices – will have harmful and far-reaching consequences for some of those poorest countries in the world that cannot cope with free competition in the world market."
"Given the very high price of sugar in the EU, we bear a very large share of the responsibility."
"It is therefore an urgent matter for us to appropriate adequate resources for the restructuring faced by these countries."
"Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, for his constructive cooperation."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, we are agreed that sugar reform was necessary."
"The market organisation for sugar had become perverse in terms of the quantities and budgetary resources concerned: after all, exports exceeded quotas by 5–6 million tonnes, which led to a disastrous dumping effect."
"The benefits gained by the ACP countries who were able to supply us with a proportion of their sugar on our terms were counteracted by the collapse in prices to which we contributed by means of this dumping on the world market."
"Although we were in agreement, two different approaches were proposed."
"On the one hand there was the idea of using quotas to return quantities to reasonable proportions and giving countries in the developing world, including the least developed countries, more involvement. On the other hand there was the Commission’s approach of starting to liberalise this organisation, cutting prices and promoting rationalisation in these fields – a solution that would culminate in full liberalisation."
"We argued long and hard in committee – although there is no point going into details about this now, nor would there be time."
"Having noticed that there was considerable opposition within Parliament, the Commissioner proceeded to bypass our institution and, together with the Council, to conclude the matter without any regard for Parliament."
"She knew that she could afford to do so because, firstly, she could assume that Parliament had no power of codecision and, secondly, because she had handed out presents to those whose interests were affected by this sugar market organisation."
"The most generous gift – the restructuring aid of EUR 6 billion to industry – then produced a change of heart in the interest groups."
"That is how she managed to carry her reform through."
"The only issue that still generates a great deal of opposition is the question as to how these restructuring funds will be managed."
"We have presented proposals for this."
"The scenario where farmers receive only 10% and where it is not compulsory to make business and regional development plans in which social and environmental criteria or the workers play a part, is unacceptable."
"My group will therefore, be proposing that this issue be referred back to committee, to enable us to negotiate it with the Commissioner and to achieve something for the farmers and the regions."
"If we let it go through as it is, no one will lift a finger."
"I hope that the other groups will follow our lead."
"Madam President, the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar is giving rise to grave concern both in the ACP countries and in the outermost regions."
"That concern is particularly keen on the island of Réunion, where sugar cane is still the main crop."
"The mobilisation of the players in the sugar-cane sector has not been in vain."
"It has brought appreciable changes to the initial reform plan."
"We note these positive changes and pay tribute to the work done by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur."
"We must not deceive ourselves, however."
"The measures proposed to mitigate the effects of this reform are temporary and as such merely palliatives designed solely to win acceptance for a reform the effects of which may ultimately be disastrous."
"The outermost regions share the same fate as the ACP countries in this respect."
"We cannot let them believe their future is assured."
"It is all the less secure because there are many uncertainties about what will happen after 2013."
"Apart from the inadequate Community compensation, what national compensation will there be and, more importantly, will it continue beyond 2013?"
"This concern is all the more legitimate because the Hong Kong summit suggested there will be a new debate starting in 2009 with implications for the European budget, including the common agricultural policy."
"When we know that a stock of sugar cane represents seven years’ harvest on average, after which it must be replanted, it is easy to see that these uncertainties may undermine the confidence required to meet the replanting targets hitherto supported by the European Union."
"Ultimately, the question is how the sugar cane sector can be saved."
"Madam President, I will conclude by saying that, faced with this situation where our planters’ future is not assured beyond the life of a cane stock, it will be impossible for us to approve the report that is before us."
". Madam President, the methods being employed to reform the sugar market run counter to the strategic goals of the EU and of the common agricultural policy."
"The EU subsidises the dumping of B sugar surpluses onto the markets of third countries."
"This is expensive, and it leads to a distortion of international trade."
"Sugar production limits should be imposed primarily on countries with large B quotas, and it should be these latter that bear the cost of the reform."
"After all, A quotas serve to meet Member States’ own needs."
"Combining A and B quotas would therefore mean that many Member States would risk no longer being self-sufficient in sugar."
"It would also mean that those countries that have played no part in bringing about this overproduction crisis would incur unjustifiably high restructuring costs."
"When viewed in the light of the reform’s goal, this proposal is unjust and illogical."
"The cost of solving the overproduction problems caused by a small number of Member States will be covered by others, in particular the new Member States, which after all have much lower B quotas."
"Why should they have to do so?"
"The old EU Member States have been allocated a B sugar quota of 2.7 million tonnes, whereas the new Member States have only been allocated 0.12 million tonnes."
"Environmental concerns have also been passed over in the reform that has been proposed."
"Farmers will be forced to intensify their production of sugar beet and to concentrate it in selected countries and regions, all for the sake of increased competitiveness."
"What does this have to do with environmental protection?"
"This reform will also work to the detriment of social, economic and regional cohesion."
"It will result in even more farms going out of business and in redundancies at sugar factories, which runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The proposed reform of the sugar market is based on a strange concept of solidarity, for which we unfortunately have the Commission and certain governments to thank."
"The sugar market reform under discussion stands in contradiction to the common agricultural policy."
"Once again, it is becoming apparent that this policy is common…"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have always maintained, both in committee and in Parliament, that the Commission’s haste in pushing through its proposal – to the extent of breaking institutional and Community rules – was suspicious to say the least."
"The reason for such haste seemed obvious: after the World Trade Organisation negotiations, the Commissioner would certainly find it more difficult to gain approval for a reform characterised above all by major price cuts and partial compensation for losses."
"Madam President, while agreeing that reform is needed, my group has always demanded that it should not only bring in the necessary changes, but above all not lose sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive in the medium and long term."
"We have therefore been opposed to the Commission’s proposal right from the start, because it aims at concentrating production in certain Member States by sacrificing the less suitable, weaker areas; thus only some areas will have to pay the price of the inevitable overall cut in European production."
"Fortunately, the Council has mitigated the Commission’s original proposal, partly by introducing the chance for Member States to grant production-linked aid, up to a maximum of 30%, although the compromise achieved is not fully satisfactory and will still penalise the sector too much."
"At this stage Parliament must, in any case, accept the responsibilities conferred on it by the Treaties and adopt its own position."
"Although it will be very difficult to reopen a debate that is now closed, when the Council comes to formally approve the reform, it must consider the possibility of including some of the vital amendments proposed by Parliament to improve the text."
"These include, for instance, maintaining the intervention system until 2010; varying compensatory aid according to production; making it mandatory to allocate at least 50% of the restructuring aid to sugar beet and chicory growers, to offset their loss of income; and reformulating the conditions for access to the restructuring system through the signing of a trade agreement with the sugar beet and chicory growers."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I recommend that you do not approve the three reports dealing with the reform of the sugar regime."
"This is a reform that works against the growth, rural employment and economy of the least developed regions of the European Union and, as such, against the Lisbon Strategy as well."
"The reform is not improved sufficiently even by the better amendment proposals contained in Mr Fruteau’s reports, and it will lead to the European Union losing its unique chance to play a leading role in the liberalisation of agrarian trade within the WTO framework."
"This is highly regrettable, because the assumption of a leading role in this issue would enable us to achieve our objectives in negotiations on the liberalisation of trade in non-agricultural commodities."
"The main problem is that, rather than relying on natural market forces to correct the current over-bureaucratised regime, the reform employs a new array of untried, non-market and complex administrative restrictions."
"Neither quantity nor price regulation, for instance, are used in the trade in more important commodities, such as flour or cereals."
"The need for a different type of reform is further prompted by the profound changes in the economics of bioenergy."
"For these reasons, I have already submitted proposals for a market-based regulatory system to the relevant authorities."
"On the question of the Fruteau reports, the House should give its support, in particular, to the recommendation of the AGRI committee, under which the Council would never be allowed to conclude a final political agreement without consulting the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your support."
"Madam President, I first wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Daul, as Chairman of the Committee, who, through their cooperation, have produced an excellent report on the issue of sugar, and one which we will have no trouble voting in favour of this week."
"Although this sugar reform is vital, however, the question here is also how this process is to be undertaken and how farmers will experience it in the different Member States, and especially whether farmers in the Member States will think that they are being treated fairly in this respect."
"For example, in my country, Finland, there was fear for a long time that the original Commission proposal on this subject would end sugar cultivation in our country entirely."
"That would certainly have happened if the Commission’s original decision had come into force."
"Now in Finland another sugar plant has to be closed by virtue of the impending decision and Finland itself has to pay a subsidy to its producers."
"There is no way anyone can say that Finland has gained from this, but now it is important that you, Commissioner, assure Finnish farmers as well as farmers in the other small Member States that in future, agreements will be kept to and that all countries will be able to engage in farming."
"This way needless fears can be dispelled."
"Another issue is that it has been said in public that the decision has now already been taken and that Parliament can no longer do anything about it here."
"This is the wrong impression to give, and I hope, Commissioner, that you will reassure us that in all matters relating to agriculture, Parliament will always be heard in good time and that there will always be cooperation."
"Then our citizens will have confidence that this system actually works."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"I think the text is appreciably better than the Council’s compromise text, because it points out a way to achieve much-needed reform without drastically penalising the agricultural sector and its production, particularly in the less favoured regions."
"The Council compromise gives cause for concern above all because of the repercussions it would have on less suitable areas, even though the cuts in aid have been substantially reduced, while the four-year extension certainly remains an unsustainable cut-off point."
"Commissioner and representatives of the Council, what I am asking – so as not to dwell on matters already dealt with by other Members – is for you to appreciate the considerable understanding shown by the committee and its Chairman, Mr Daul – the whole committee in fact – regarding the change in procedure that led to the informal compromise, in order to provide a more suitable negotiating position at the WTO."
"I also ask you to return the favour of Parliament’s understanding by accepting the proposed improvements to the text, which are sure to be adopted by this House, particularly so as to allow for transitional state aid in the least favoured regions and to readjust the compensation paid to farmers, especially from the restructuring fund."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Fruteau for having prepared these three particularly important presentations on reform in the sugar sector."
"As early as last November, the Council agreed on the common principles of the organisation of the sugar market and the directions for reform."
"That was a very important decision, welcomed by us all; first, because it demonstrated our ability to agree on issues that are important to the entire Community, which unifies the Union and, second, it has strengthened our negotiating position in Hong Kong."
"We have shown that the Community not only articulates ideas, but is also able to take specific actions."
"The Community comprehends and consistently prepares to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"It is a shame, of course, that the agreement was accepted by the Council without having consulted the European Parliament, which represents the interests of the European people."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the way the reform has been designed and planned is very important, but its implementation is of even greater significance."
"Therefore, restructuring is a cornerstone of all three reports."
"In Lithuania, the major sugar manufacturer is the Danish company Danisco Sugar."
"It operates factories not only in Lithuania, but also in Sweden, Germany and Finland."
"It is evident that the proposed reform will encourage to maintain the most efficient factories while decommissioning those operating at a loss."
"However, what we need to do is take into account the interests of the employees, as well as those of raw material growers, and ensure that they are not abandoned."
"Therefore, the reform must, first and foremost, facilitate the production of alternative products and create new businesses, and not only arrange an exit from the market."
"Austria and Finland promised to complete the reform by the end of the year."
"The reform will only be a success if it takes into account the interests of all market players."
"Madam President, whenever it is stated that the ACP countries will suffer if the EU’s chaotic sugar arrangements are abolished, the underlying agenda is always protection of the EU’s own production."
"If the ACP countries are to suffer as a result of these arrangements being abolished, it is of course because, with our absurd trading system, we have kept them in conditions resembling those of slavery, and if slaves are freed without being helped to cope successfully, they are obviously in a worse situation than before."
"We should help the ACP countries to develop sustainable production."
"It is grotesque that we only give them a pittance, when we richly reward our own sugar producers and sugar industry."
"The sum of EUR 200 million proposed by Glenys Kinnock is an absolute minimum."
"There is a lot of money to be saved by phasing out the common organisation of the market in sugar, so such compensation is amply affordable."
"We should also be very pleased about the fact that many developing countries would benefit from the liberalisation of the sugar market."
"The social and environmental problems that are demonstrably to be found in many places must be solved through the ILO and the environmental conventions."
"We must support those forces that are endeavouring to have the relevant requirements implemented, for example in Brazil, and, above all, we must have those requirements accepted by the WTO as obvious trading conditions."
"– I am sorry but today's debate, as far as Parliament's opinion on the sugar industry is concerned, is a mockery, given that the Council has decided and the national governments are planning to implement the harsh, anti-farming decision under which thousands of small and medium-sized holdings will be wiped out, sugar factories will close and the workers will join the ranks of the unemployed."
"Already in Greece farmers and workers are demonstrating."
"The decisions in the new regulation drastically cut quotas and institutional prices and abolish intervention."
"They come under the philosophy of the new CAP and constitute tools which aim to reduce resources for farming and channel them to the repressive policies of the European Union on the pretext of terrorism."
"At the same time, the decisions by the WTO demonstrate that farming – and, of course, sugar – have come under the guillotine in order to favour the interests and profitability of European industrial capital through its increased, unimpeded penetration into developing countries, so that it can exploit them better."
"The rapporteur is trying with his proposals to delay the repercussions somewhat."
"Unfortunately, a quick or a slower death for the sugar industry ..."
"Madam President, like the last speaker, I too wonder why we are considering these proposals."
"Surely the Council made a decision on 22 November and it is now a ."
"However, if Parliament is determined to have its say, we should remember that the sugar regime has existed virtually unchanged for almost 40 years, and yet here we are trying to introduce wholesale change almost overnight."
"It is a sick system which has badly needed reform for many years."
"However, the draconian solutions being proposed – that is, the medicine for the sickness – are likely to kill the patient in the process: it is estimated that the new regime will cause the loss of 100 000 jobs in Europe and put an end to sugar farming in countries such as Greece and Ireland."
"It is also likely to do incomparable damage to the economies of many European former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, which were major beneficiaries of the old regime."
"I am also painfully aware that my own constituency in the east of England contains a major part of the UK’s sugar farming."
"I recommend that a proper study of the effects of the new regime should be made without delay."
"Never let it be forgotten that our actions affect human beings out there in the real world, beyond our cloistered environment."
"It is a shameful indictment of this centralised bureaucratic form of government that it has taken so long to act, even then only under pressure from the WTO, and that so many people will suffer as a result."
"Madam President, the reform of the sugar market that we are considering today is a pseudo-reform that is dangerous, unjust, dishonest and antisocial."
"It is dangerous because it will result in the EU becoming dependent on sugar supplies from the rest of the world, which will be to the detriment of our continent’s food security."
"It is unjust because the subsidised exports of B sugar that cause so many problems were primarily the brainchild of France and Germany, yet it is the EU as a whole that pays the price, and the new Member States that suffer the most."
"Instead of eliminating export surpluses, the proposal strikes at the heart of sugar production throughout Europe."
"Only a few years ago, the large sugar companies in Poland paid a very low price for factories that had been privatised."
"These same companies will now receive several times more money for closing the factories down."
"This is merely one example of why the reform is dishonest."
"Finally, the reform is antisocial because it ignores the plight of thousands of farmers and sugar factory workers who will lose their livelihoods, and who will find it hard to find new jobs."
"This pseudo-reform is worthy of the title , like the gangster film."
"The large sugar companies will make hundreds of millions of euros by relocating their businesses outside the European Union."
"We should reject this pseudo-reform for Europe’s sake."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, the common market for sugar had largely been working well since 1968, as borne out by the figures: we were producing 20 million, consuming 16 million and only exporting four million, as against Brazil’s figure of 13 million."
"Free trade devotees tell us, however, that European sugar has created economic diabetes among the poor countries."
"Accordingly, in order to eradicate poverty in the sugar cane world, sugar must be eradicated from the Europe of sugar beet."
"This outlook has led to three Community regulations, along with a 36% price cut – and the accompanying drop in revenue – and the opening up of the market in 2009 to triangular trade in sugar via the Balkans or the least developed countries, to the benefit, of course, of the large operators."
"The upshot of all this is clear to all."
"Despite Mr Fruteau’s laudable efforts, we are set to become sugar importers, the European taxpayer will have to foot the bill for a series of indemnities to the ACP and, after 2015, Europe’s agri-food industry will be shoved aside."
"Furthermore, given that by 2015 China and India are set to be huge agri-food importers, Brazil will be feeding Asia while Europe is out of the picture."
"Just one question, Commissioner: why, 20 years on, do you dislike the small farmers of Europe ..."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur for his work."
"I can support this compromise, which was reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following intensive discussions and negotiations; but at the same time we have to be aware of the impact these three reports have on European agriculture in general and beet farmers in particular, and on the sugar industry."
"The sugar sector is an example of the extent of the WTO’s influence on the economies of individual States, and also on that of the EU as a whole."
"The Agriculture Committee has succeeded in moderating quite a few of the Commission’s proposals, and I think that the result is most acceptable."
"I hope that the final negotiations between the Council and the Commission will see a good deal more of the Agriculture Committee’s demands taken on board."
"The cultivation of energy crops offers farmers at least some opportunity to find alternatives to sugar-beet growing and to promote non-food production – which is vital and also forward looking."
"Following the reform of the CAP, European agriculture has to undergo its next major reform very soon."
"We must nevertheless accept that we live in an interconnected world, and that stubborn insistence on the status quo is certainly not a viable alternative."
"The Agriculture Committee is of the opinion that, in future, there must be the possibility of obliging the Council to wait for Parliament to take its decisions before taking its own decision."
"This was an exceptional situation, in view of which I support the procedure."
"I hope that, in the final reckoning, we shall continue to have beet farmers and an active, attractive sugar industry, in the future."
"Madam President, in November, the Council decided to reform the European sugar sector by reducing prices by 36% over four years, and paying compensation of more than EUR 7 billion to the European sugar sector."
"It is important that some of this compensation should go not only to the farmers and industry, but also to the workers who are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the reforms."
"They should not be overlooked, and I should like to hear the Commissioner commit to support for retraining them, thus allowing them to find appropriate employment."
"I am behind the Council’s decision not to delay any longer free access for sugar from the least developed countries under ‘Everything But Arms’."
"This is about people for whom, certainly when prices plummet, sugar exports are of vital importance."
"We must deliver on our promises and open up our market in 2009; we have procrastinated long enough."
"I regret the Council’s decision not to bite the bullet as far as abolishing C-sugar is concerned."
"Since C-sugar distorts the world market price, it would be better for us to look for alternative end uses for possible surpluses, such as energy production."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner if he can guarantee at this stage that C-sugar will be abolished."
"I can understand why you have decided to introduce a 25% regulation in order to counter triangular trade, but can you confirm that this investigation, if it reaches beyond 25%, is intended only to counter triangular trade and not to flag other issues?"
"Can you confirm that it will not have a delaying effect?"
"Commissioner Mandelson said yesterday that it is true that we need 200 million if we are to be serious about helping the ACP countries."
"Mr Fruteau was right to say that 40 million is unacceptable."
"It is unclear where that money is to be found."
"It should be new and fresh funds."
"Can you promise that the Commission will in any event make every effort to find those 200 million per year and that this will not be at the expense of Category 4 development budget?"
"The fact is that that really would be funding the poorest countries from their own pocket, and that is the wrong type of solidarity."
"Madam President, all we can say is that this debate is a bit too late in the day."
"The Commissioner, whom I would like to congratulate on the fact that the bulk of her ideas have been adopted by the Council, was tactful enough to say that Parliament had had a great deal of influence."
"Although I should like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on this, I realise that what we will decide in a resolution today or tomorrow will have little effect on the final outcome."
"I too felt that the sugar reforms were necessary."
"We have come in for some criticism from the WTO panel; we now have a weapons agreement which we must adhere to and allow for."
"The farmers in the Member States are getting a raw deal, as are the farmers in the ACP countries."
"I agree with the many who stated that sugar will not be the key product for the ACP countries; just as important will be the energy production."
"We have the technology – which is already being applied in Brazil and elsewhere – by means of which sugar cane is directly converted into alcohol."
"I would encourage the Commission to give the ACP countries maximum support in this process, for it would be preferable to use sugar cane for energy production in those countries, provided, that is, that they are in the tropics."
"Another problem has meanwhile cropped up."
"If I have been reliably informed, the European market will soon be flooded with a surplus of some 2 million tonnes of sugar."
"That is because exports have dropped and the harvest has been good."
"There is still a large supply of intervention sugar and it looks like in the first year, the level of participation in the restructuring process will be lower than expected."
"I would like to put a quick question to the Commission."
"What does it intend to do in the short term about this surplus of 2 millions tonnes of sugar?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, the sugar reform, as it is currently before us, will be pernicious to poor developing countries and ACP countries that are now losing their access to the market or are given lower prices for their products."
"As far as I am concerned, every agricultural reform that harms developing countries is a bad one."
"This reform also deals a lethal blow to the incomes of thousands of farmers and workers in the sugar industry, and the absence of a proper social plan to mitigate it turns this into a worthless exercise."
"Finally, this reform does not benefit the European taxpayer in any way because it is budget-neutral."
"Given these three considerations, we can sum this reform up as a disaster."
"There is no question that the European sugar policy should be reformed, but not in a way from which only major food producers benefit."
"Madam President, today’s debate has raised many questions, in particular with regard to the impact the reform will have on the new Member States."
"The question we should be asking is whether something extraordinary has happened to the world’s sugar trade or sugar production in the two years since the EU underwent its last enlargement to justify such a sudden change in sugar policy, and the answer to this question is ‘no’."
"I mention this because the effects of this reform will hit the new Member States hardest."
"It is not uncommon for farmers in these countries to have invested all their savings in their farms, even though they have been treated unfairly."
"I would remind the House that farmers in the old EU Member States receive three times more in land subsidies than those in the new Member States."
"This reform has no doubt been several years in the making, which means that the public in the new Member States was intentionally misled, or even deceived, at the time of accession."
"Implementation of this reform will be further proof that the idea of European solidarity and genuine assistance for the new Member States is an illusion."
"Genuine assistance means giving the new Member States a real chance to develop their economies, rather than granting them subsidies on a short-term basis."
"One or even several countries can be outvoted, but the Polish public is opposed to a reform of this kind, and objects to being constantly cheated."
"I too would be happy to do without an EU that is run along these lines."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Fruteau for his accomplished work of such considerable scope."
"Sugar has always been and, I believe, will remain a strategic product."
"So the ongoing struggles in relation to the rules and regulations of sugar production and trade are not accidental."
"We must not forget that a considerable part of the EU economy is related to this product, from agriculture to industry, with people working in all the sectors."
"These people create a large part of the GDP; they earn their livings, provide for their families and raise children."
"Thus, in pursuing the reforms, we have no right to disregard those people, our citizens."
"We cannot ignore their interests or allow any threat to their employment and income."
"And that is exactly the threat that I see."
"It is a pity that whilst submitting the proposal, the Commission paid little regard to the opinion submitted by the European Parliament."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur tried to improve the proposal, but I am not sure they fully succeeded."
"I tend to think that the reform is much more beneficial to developing countries and the transnational companies hiding behind them, or large businesses, rather than to the most vulnerable circle of the EU community, that is, farmers, factory workers, and in general, residents of the rural areas."
"Therefore, in my opinion, the submitted proposal, even though largely improved by the Agriculture Committee, is inappropriate, unfair and insensitive; and it will strike hard at millions of rural residents who already live poorly as it is."
"Mr Didžiokas, you are talking too quickly, and reading out your speeches too quickly, and you are not the only one."
"The interpreters cannot keep up with you, and so time is wasted."
"It will be of much greater benefit to what you want to convey if you speak either more slowly or without a prepared speech."
"– Madam President, as we know, from as early as 1968, Europe has sought to ensure that it is able to meet its own sugar needs; that is to say, that it is in a position to satisfy demand by means of its own production wherever possible."
"As with many good intentions, this went wrong along the way and undoubtedly began to constitute a problem."
"Our sugar-beet farmers simply do not stand a chance of competing with the hot climate and low wages of the tropics – although it has to be said, of course, that our sugar is not produced using either slash-and-burn or child labour, nor is it transported halfway round the world, which undoubtedly protects the environment, too."
"Allowing beet farmers to produce ever greater surpluses and sell them on the world market at subsidised prices, so to speak, and thus making them competitors to all of those who could actually produce sugar far more cheaply, created a system that was bound to collapse sooner or later."
"Yet instead of slow, sensitive regulatory intervention to avert the worst-case scenario, the response was to look the other way for decades."
"The last straw seems to have been the agreement with ACP countries on the re-export of their sugar, which was subsidised to the tune of EUR 800 million."
"This is a most peculiar kind of development aid."
"Previously, subsidised EU sugar exports were regarded as immoral; now they are illegal."
"We shall have to work hard, therefore, to ensure that our farmers, our sugar factories and the workers in these factories emerge unscathed, as far as possible, from this mess of our own making."
"The debate is suspended until 9 p.m."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0676/2005)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Interpol, which is an admirable and valuable organisation, and which is situated on European Union territory, has a number of databases – on stolen documents, on stolen works of art, on wanted criminals, on fingerprints, etc. These databases are available to the law enforcement forces of the world."
"Is the Commission satisfied that the operation of these databases is fully in accord with the data privacy laws of the Union?"
". The Commission supports cooperation between Interpol and European Member States as well as EU bodies such as Europol."
"At the same time, as pointed out in the 2004 Commission proposal for a Council common position on the transfer of certain data to Interpol, applicable data protection rules must be respected."
"This was confirmed by the Council common position of 24 January 2005 on exchanging certain data with Interpol."
"It notably concerns lost or stolen passports. It underlined that the conditions of the exchange shall be agreed with Interpol in order to ensure – and I would like to stress the following – that the data exchanged will respect the data protection principles that lie at the heart of data exchange within the Union, particularly with regard to the exchange and automatic processing of such data."
"I should add that the control of personal data by Interpol shall be ensured by the rules on the control of information and access to Interpol’s files."
"In particular these rules establish a commission for the control of Interpol’s files and govern the composition, role and functions of that commission."
"The current chairman of the commission is Mr Hustinx, who is currently also the EU data protection supervisor."
"I wish to ask a supplementary question."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for his very careful reply and, although I am taking Italian lessons, I appreciate the fact that he gave it in his very good English."
"It is a complicated reply, and therefore difficult to take on board."
"However, I noted that he referred to the Council position of January 2005 covering stolen passports."
"That is clearly in order."
"However, I wonder whether he could assure me that the other databases I mentioned – on works of art, wanted criminals and fingerprints – are also satisfactorily covered by the Council position?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the honourable Member for his supplementary question as well."
"The Council has laid down very clear guidelines and the Commission will monitor compliance with these rules, which will apply to all the databases on which Interpol works."
"I refer in particular to certain key principles regarding data protection: who is entitled to access the data; for what specific and predetermined purposes; how long can data be retained; and, above all, who will be entitled to use them and in what circumstances?"
"As you know, we have recently put forward a draft framework decision on data protection under the third pillar."
"This is the very first proposal of this kind, and it further expands the field of data protection in the context of police cooperation."
"The conclusions of the last meeting (November 2005) of the Mediterranean countries' Environment Ministers portray an extremely alarming situation as regards the availability and management of water resources in the region."
"In particular, 50% of the wetlands have disappeared, adversely affecting the flora and fauna throughout the region, while it is estimated that only 60% of the rural areas along the southern coast of the Mediterranean have access to safe drinking water."
"In the light of this data and scientists' estimates that, in the future, 38% of the population of the Mediterranean will live in areas where water is in short supply, will the Commission take practical initiatives in the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation to deal with this phenomenon jointly with the partnership countries, taking as a model Directive 2000/60/EC(1) establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy?"
"Given that under the SMAP (Short and Medium Priority Environmental Action Programme), water and waste management is a priority field, does the Commission have an assessment of the measures and programmes implemented in that field?"
"Does the Commission intend to implement new measures and initiatives under this programme?"
". Mr President, the management of water resources in the area of the Mediterranean is a challenge for us all from the point of view both of the quality and the availability of water."
"The problem of water shortages in the Mediterranean is intensifying due, on the one hand, to the increased demand for water in certain sectors and areas and, on the other hand, to the repercussions of climate change."
"As regards climate change, I would like to comment that, from a scientific point of view, it is difficult to maintain that isolated cases of droughts are directly connected to climate change; nonetheless, we know that climate change contributes to more severe phenomena which are manifesting more and more regularly and over larger geographical areas."
"We requested and have received a report from the EU Joint Research Centre on the links between climate change and water, water shortages and droughts."
"In general, protection of our water resources is one of the priorities of the environmental policy of the European Union."
"In fact, the European Union has radically restructured its policy in the water sector with the relevant framework directive."
"In this way it sent a political message well beyond its territory."
"One of the basic principles of the European Union's policy in the water sector is cooperation between the regions in various Member States which share common water resources."
"For this purpose, the so-called EU Water Initiative was adopted, within the framework of which the European Union and its Member States have undertaken to achieve the Millennium Goals as regards the water sector."
"Following this, the Commission launched a joint procedure between the framework directive and the EU Water Initiative, a procedure which Greece headed for the part of the initiative concerning the Mediterranean."
"The aim of this cooperation is to facilitate the application of policies of proper administration of water resources in the Mediterranean countries, by adhering to the principles of the Community Water Framework Directive."
"Consequently, with the Member States of the European Union and third Mediterranean countries working together, working groups have been set up, one of which will address the issue of water shortages, and guidelines will be drafted by the end of this year, which will be addressed both to the countries of the European Union and to the other Mediterranean countries."
"Measures will also be proposed to prevent and manage water shortages and droughts."
"Water is one of the priorities of the short-term environmental action plan, known as SΜΑΡ, which is being applied at regional level."
"Monitoring SMAP actions forms part of the programme and there are reports available for most of these actions."
"A detailed evaluation of the programme will be scheduled this year and the results will be at your disposal."
"So far, evidence from the application of SΜΑΡ is positive and is contributing to the promotion and exchange of experiences and best practices, especially in the water sector."
"Under the SΜΑΡ 2 programme between 2000 and 2005, two of the eight projects – with a Community contribution of EUR 6.2 million – directly concerned water management."
"The next generation of the SΜΑΡ programme, SΜΑΡ 3, will focus on the preparation of overall coastal zone management plans and will make provision for technical assistance to be provided to the Member States' governments."
"Already various relevant plans are at the signature stage and are expected to last three years from January 2006."
"– Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given me in your reply as regards EU policy within the framework of the 25 countries and its cooperation with third countries in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, especially within the framework of the Mediterranean basin."
"I wanted to ask if you currently have more detailed and more specific information available on the question of the guidelines which the European Commission will issue as regards public and private investment within the framework of Barcelona II, because the water sector is a very important sector for the quality of life and equal development which we want to achieve in the Mediterranean basin."
". To be specific, I should like to say first of all that we have various means of financing available both for the countries of the European Union and for neighbouring countries."
"Basically, they are: the Cohesion Fund, the Regional Development Fund, the Rural Development Fund and so forth."
"Of course, all this depends on progress with the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013."
"We also have a series of measures available both to European and to neighbouring Mediterranean countries from the EU Water Initiative, especially the initiative for water in the Mediterranean and, also, a series of directives for best practices which, of course, will have the relevant financial support."
"Commissioner, in its 2004 report, the European Environment Agency stated that the temperature in Europe had increased by one degree above the average for the rest of the world."
"Has the Commission looked into the establishment of a European Drought Monitoring Centre?"
"Another consequence of the drought is the devastating fires."
"Has the Commission looked into any financial aid for preventing fires and alleviating their effects in the rural areas in question?"
". Indeed, the European Environment Agency, in a report which it filed two months ago, noted and emphasised that environmental priorities for the Mediterranean area include drought and the prevention and management of drought situations and water shortages, which hit countries such as Portugal and Spain in particular this year."
"As regards the drought in Portugal and Spain, the European Union Cohesion Fund provided funds to adapt and support measures already financed some time ago in order to deal with similar weather phenomena."
"As regards long-term measures, the European Union will fund Spain with more than EUR 1 300 million to support the new Spanish plan on the management and use of water."
"In future, special attention will be paid to measures to prevent and manage droughts and water shortages."
"I must also stress that the Environment Agency emphasised in its report the importance of other emergent threats in the area of the Mediterranean, especially for ecosystems, from changes in temperatures and rainfall in the area, which have various consequences."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon, we discussed the security of energy supply with Commissioner Piebalgs."
"What role does the Commissioner see in this Water Framework Directive for renewable energy, which, of course, represents a quite fundamental future strategy for the security of our energy supply?"
". Renewable energy is one of our priorities at the moment."
"We have a green paper on renewable energy, which we are trying to promote by various means."
"We also have targets for the European Union for 2002 and 2020."
"We have not succeeded yet, but we hope to achieve those targets through the various means and measures we are proposing."
"To this effect, we have the second phase of the European climate change programme, which promotes renewable energy sources, and we are proposing a series of measures in support of such energy sources."
"At the same time, the Commission is currently discussing a strategy for biofuels, which provide a means not only of securing energy resources within the European Union, but also of answering the problems that will be created for farmers by the new agricultural policy, as well as limiting greenhouse gases and dealing with other environmental problems."
"Could the Commission outline what action it has taken in response to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 15 January 2004 on the implementation of Directive 96/71/EC(2) concerning the Posting of Workers in connection with the provision of services (P5_TA(2004)0030) which noted that the implementation, as intended by the Directive, of core labour standards in the free movement of services and the prevention of social dumping often fails to be achieved in practice, and, in particular, to point 10, which called on it to submit proposals to simplify and improve the existing Directive with a view to obtaining better implementation and application of the Directive in practice as well as better achieving the goals of the Directive, and point 14, which called on it to submit a second report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the Directive no later than by the end of 2004?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to Parliament’s resolution on the Member States’ implementation of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services."
"Social partners from all sectors were involved in discussions on the resolution, and asked to provide further information in the form of an extensive questionnaire."
"The latter was also forwarded to the administrative bodies of the Member States, which is the follow-up procedure for all Parliament resolutions."
"The Commission lent its support to a research project carried out by the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers on the practical impact of the Posting of Workers Directive, which was followed up by a conference."
"The end result was a draft second report on the implementation of Directive 96/71/EC, which covers the same issues as Parliament’s resolution."
"The Commission services are currently in the process of finalising this draft report, and it will be adopted in the near future."
"The Commission has played an active role in both implementing the Directive in practice and improving cooperation in the field of information provision by working together with a group of specialists from the Member States."
"One of the outcomes of this group’s work has been a code of conduct, along with guidelines for cooperation and multilingual documents for informal exchanges of information."
"The aim of these latter is to facilitate communication between contact points and monitoring bodies."
"In addition, a dedicated website has been launched on the posting of workers, which contains key information in three languages on the legal framework governing the posting of workers and links to related documents and websites set up by the Member States that cover problems relating to the posting of workers."
"The website also provides the public with access to a list of contact points and monitoring bodies, which means that official bodies and individuals can find out about the appropriate contact points in the various Member States."
"I have been informed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to draft an own-initiative report on the impact of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services."
"A hearing on this report will be held on 26 January 2006."
"I will be very interested to learn the outcome of this hearing, and I would welcome the opportunity to cooperate with Parliament on this key issue."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner Špidla."
"I should like some clarification on whether the report, which you indicate as being finalised, is the report dated 15 November 2005 that has already been circulated in draft form to the social partners."
"If so, would you undertake to circulate this report to the Members of the European Parliament, in particular to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs?"
"Would you not agree that the experience to date of the Posting of Workers Directive indicates that amendments are required in order to clarify the application of that directive to the delivery of services from third countries, such as Turkey, and also from some other Member States?"
"I am thinking in particular of the Vaxholm-Laval case, which is clearly a challenge in my view to the operation of the directive."
"Finally, could you indicate what statistics you have with regard to the number of posted workers and labour inspectorates in the various Member States and the effectiveness of those inspectors?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document to which Mr De Rossa referred is indeed the report I mentioned."
"The document that has been distributed to the social partners is the original text, which we are still working on, and our assumption is that it will be discussed with Parliament."
"I shall now move on to the subject of statistics."
"Statistical information will be included in the report, although some of the details still need to be finalised, since interpreting statistical data is always an extremely complex task."
"For the time being, the Commission does not believe that any legislative amendments to the Directive are needed."
"What is needed, however, is better enforcement of the Directive’s implementation in practice, and I have outlined some of the measures that the Commission has already taken to this end."
"– Mr President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements."
"Am I right in assuming that he does not consider the setting of quotas for third-country workers to be the right course of action for the European internal market; and that, when he works on the proposals for the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive, he will actively take into account the French study that concludes that the existing system provided for in the directive is not working in the Member States?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to admit that I was not able to identify the report to which Mr Schwab was referring from the quote he used."
"I will be able to provide a more accurate answer after I have checked the quote for myself."
"Access for workers from third countries is a policy which is embodied in EU legislation, and which applies to all the Member States."
"If the honourable Member wishes to discuss amendments to the rules on third-country workers in more detail, I would of course be more than happy to do so."
"I would thank the Commissioner for his answer and am pleased to see that the Commission will cooperate with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs now that we are dealing with the issue in an own-initiative report introduced in connection with the Posting of Workers Directive."
"The fact is that it has become apparent – especially from the messages that have come from the Commission concerning various signals pertaining to the Vaxholm case – that the Posting of Workers Directive is not nearly so crystal clear as might be wished."
"The intention, of course, is that posted workers should be allowed to work under roughly the same conditions as people in the country to which they have been posted."
"My question is as follows: is this directive adapted to all labour market models within the EU or only to those governed by legislation and collective agreements declared to be universally applicable?"
"Do you think it is adapted to the Scandinavian model, which involves collective agreements that are not declared to be universally applicable and under which each company is negotiated with separately?"
"Or is a change needed whereby that particular labour market model would also be included?"
". No opt-outs were provided for any of the Member States’ systems when the directive was debated and adopted, and it therefore applies universally."
"I can well imagine that interpretation of the directive is far from simple at times, since it incorporates a global concept of the European Union and covers all the different forms of labour relations."
"As far as the Commission’s basic approach to this matter is concerned, you will be aware that the Laval case is pending before the European Court of Justice, and so I have no choice but to say that it would be wrong for me to adopt a specific position."
"Generally speaking, I can say that in principle the Commission’s comments should not call any Member State’s social model per se into question."
"They should, however, unfailingly uphold the principle that the economic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty can be combined with the various social models."
"In other words, the directive was intended from the outset to provide protection to posted workers at a level that is appropriate for the given Member State."
"Interpretation may be problematic in certain cases, as I said before, but this is the principle which underpins the Directive, and which applies to all the Member States."
"Commissioner, could you just clarify for me, in your comments regarding the Vaxholm case, that you are not in a position to comment?"
"Is the Commission not, in fact, permitted and indeed obliged to make a submission to the European Court of Justice with regard to its view on the issues at stake in that case?"
"Has it not in fact been asked by the Court to make such a submission?"
"Mr De Rossa, although this is not strictly speaking a point of order, if Mr Špidla is able to answer this question in 15 seconds, I shall give him the floor."
". As you will be aware, and as I said a few minutes ago, the Laval case is currently pending before the European Court of Justice, and the Commission services are at present preparing the Commission’s comments."
"In principle, these latter should not call any Member State’s social model per se into question They should, however, unfailingly uphold the principle that the economic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty can be combined with the various social models."
"As previous speakers have already noted, there need be no contradiction between the two goals of supporting fair economic competition and guaranteeing protection for workers."
"It is self-evident that any social model that is implemented must comply fully with the goals and fundamental principles of Community legislation and that it must observe these latter, in particular when it comes to such principles as legitimacy of aim, objective justification and proportionality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is in the process of preparing an opinion that will form part of proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"As I have already said, it is impossible for me to go into details at this point in time, and indeed it would be wrong for me to do so."
"In the Commission’s view, what will be the impact of the proposed harmonisation of direct company tax in terms of the stability of economic growth and employment, especially in vulnerable areas of sparsely-populated Member States?"
"."
"Thank you for the question, in response to which I can state that the Commission has absolutely no plans to harmonise direct company taxation."
"As is outlined in the Commission communication of 25 October 2005 on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission intends to carry out the necessary preparatory work towards a common consolidated tax base over the next three years, with a view to presenting a Community legislative measure by 2008."
"The Commission does not intend to propose a harmonised corporate tax rate, which is just part of the overall area we would like to harmonise."
"As regards vulnerable areas of less populous Member States, it should be borne in mind that, under Community state aid rules, Member States have to respect strict conditions when providing for preferential tax regimes in favour of companies undertaking investments in assisted areas, under national regional state aid guidelines for promoting the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas of the European Union."
"State aid rules remain applicable to any state measures which may be enacted in the context of a common consolidated tax base initiative."
"The preparatory work by the Commission has not yet reached the stage of examining the impact of a common consolidated tax base on different regions within Member States."
"Any legislative proposal submitted by the Commission after this work has been carried out will, in any case, be accompanied by an appropriate impact assessment."
"On the other hand, I should point out that the common consolidated tax base has been identified as an important tool for helping the Community achieve the Lisbon goals."
"It will help to reduce compliance costs and to encourage cross-border activities, which will lead to a higher rate of economic growth and employment and a higher level of competitiveness across the whole of the European Union."
"– Commissioner, your reply satisfies me completely."
"I should like to ask you to comment on the question of small and medium-sized enterprises, by which I mean whether they will be taken into account by the Commission as a special group within European enterprises as a whole."
". My answer is a definite ‘yes’."
"The Commission considers the SMEs to be a special group which is to be supported as it provides a large number of jobs."
"According to my judgement, the common consolidated corporate tax base will give a special advantage to the SMEs, which are in a less favourable position than the multinationals."
"So, if there is one group which will profit from the common consolidated tax base, it will be the SMEs."
"The recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in favour of the Marks [amp] Spencer company, which had asked the UK authorities for tax relief to offset losses suffered by subsidiaries of the group in other European countries, creates a new set of conditions and will have a significant impact on government revenue from corporation tax."
"Although the judgment recognises that Member States may prohibit the parent company from deducting tax so that national governments do not suffer losses through the actions of multinational companies endeavouring to exploit the loopholes in tax legislation in order to maximise their profits, I believe that a new area of competition has been opened up between Member States to attract investment."
"What view does the Commission take of the Court's judgment?"
"Does it propose to take any legislative initiative?"
". On 13 December 2005 the Commission welcomed the ruling of the Court of Justice in the Marks [amp] Spencer case on cross-border loss relief."
"The Court has interpreted the principle of freedom of establishment for cross-border loss relief in a way that is in compliance with the logic and philosophy of the single market and in a way that is supported by the Commission."
"The Commission has to continue its efforts to eliminate all obstacles preventing companies from reaping the full benefits of the internal market."
"The Commission therefore intends to come forward with a communication in the near future in which it will outline its views on cross-border loss relief."
"This communication will go beyond the specific case of Marks [amp] Spencer and focus on the economic aspects."
"The Commission knows that this is a difficult subject as Member States are rightly concerned about the need to protect their tax revenues, but at the same time it is clear that it cannot accept that obstacles to the internal market continue to hamper companies from making investments and creating growth and employment in line with the objectives which it has set itself as part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"– Commissioner, you have not answered my question."
"The Marks [amp] Spencer case highlights double tax dumping."
"We have different rates and different approaches between the Member States to the taxation of multinational companies with parent companies and subsidiaries within the framework of the European Union."
"The ruling by the Court of Justice perhaps highlights rather than deals with the problem."
"I ask you again: what does the Commission intend to do in order to limit tax evasion by large multinational groups and stem the loss of public revenue to the Member States?"
"Does it intend to take any legislative initiative?"
"Otherwise, why do you talk of Economic and Monetary Union?"
". The Commission’s interpretation of the ruling of the ECJ on the Marks [amp] Spencer case is fully in compliance with the ECJ’s ruling."
"The problem in that case was that while United Kingdom law permits loss relief inside the United Kingdom market, the same is not permitted in the case of other companies or branches of Marks [amp] Spencer in different Member States – one in Germany and one in Belgium."
"The ECJ ruling, in compliance with the philosophy of the internal market, was in favour of Marks [amp] Spencer and the Commission fully supported that."
"The Commission wants to study carefully the budgetary consequences of such rulings and try to take the initiative to have better coordination within the tax policy of the Member States: if not harmonisation, at least coordination is needed in order to avoid such problems."
"To conclude, I want to refer to the first question concerning the common consolidated corporate tax base, which would solve the problem."
"The difficulty is that, as I have already said, in the best case, if everything goes smoothly and well, we will come up with the legislative proposal no earlier than 2008, so we still have two years in which to provide some temporary solution."
"The independent consultancy firm Wik has been tasked by the Commission with evaluating the deregulation of postal services in the EU."
"It has been reported in articles in the Swedish media that the consultancy firm has among other things proposed the following:"
"No EU country is to be allowed to impose a requirement on any postal operator to charge a standard rate for postage."
"Pricing must be free and market-based and not publicly regulated."
"This means that it may become cheaper to send a letter within a city than between two towns in the same country that are far away from one another."
"In addition, the rules stating how often mail must be delivered are to be curtailed to a minimum of one day per week instead of five days per week, which is the case at present."
"How does the Commission view the above proposals?"
"Does it believe that the abolition of a standard postage rate can have adverse consequences for inhabitants of remote localities in sparsely populated countries like Sweden and Finland?"
". The sector study referred to by the honourable Member was commissioned by the Commission in 2004 from Wik Consult in order to assist ongoing work on the gradual opening-up to competition of the European postal market."
"The views expressed in the study are those of the consultant."
"The study is merely one of several elements that the Commission is considering in looking at various options and their possible consequences."
"In addition to the regular consultation with stakeholders and notably an online public consultation currently under way, the study actually serves as a platform to engage in a transparent and open debate on the conditions for enabling the further phasing-in of competition in the postal market."
"It is the understanding of the Commission that the approach taken by the consultancy on the issue of the uniform tariff and the frequency of delivery was an attempt to give more flexibility to the public postal operator in order to sustain a viable and efficient universal service in the long term."
"The current Postal Directive 97/67/EC, as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC, does not impose a uniform tariff but requires a minimum frequency of delivery of five days a week."
"The Commission can assure the honourable Member that on all aspects of the postal reform in the European Union, including both the issues mentioned, it will try its best to strike the right balance between the necessary degree of harmonisation at EU level and those conditions to be fixed at Member State level, which would reflect the very different characteristics of each national postal market."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I should like to be given an answer to my final question: that about whether thought had been given to what the consequences might be for inhabitants of sparsely populated regions."
"This perhaps mainly affects ourselves up in the Nordic countries where there are many miles between different households and villages."
". As I said in my reply, this consultancy study will form only part of the Commission’s thinking."
"The purpose of this particular consultant’s report is to inform the Commission on its thinking and it does not prejudge the Commission’s final decision on these matters."
"The honourable Member may rest assured that this forms only part of our overall deliberative process and does not in any way commit the Commission to making a proposal one way or the other."
"I am happy to say that it is not the only consideration, because lots of us use the post and would like it to be delivered each day rather than just once a week."
"But there is also uncertainty in terms of the actual post offices that will be distributed throughout rural Ireland as well as rural Europe."
"Can the Commissioner comment on what the Commission is thinking in relation to those services – other than the post – that are offered, and when a decision might be made by the Commission so that there will be more clarity?"
". As the honourable Member may know, the Commission must come forward with a report, before the end of 2006, on the direction which it considers the liberalisation of the postal market should take."
"All the reports and consultations effected form part of our deliberative process in arriving at such a decision."
"As Mrs McGuinness will be aware, the liberalisation of the postal market has been in progress for some time, and it is as part of that process that the Commission must bring forward its report on the direction to be taken."
"The question of universal services is a key part of its deliberative process."
"It is, of course, a matter for Member States to organise their arrangements regarding rural post offices as they see fit and in line with their own requirements."
"Our specific role as the Commission is to consider that of the opening-up of the postal market."
"Will the Commissioner pledge that he will not seek to allow a system to be put in place that will bestow a second-class service on rural communities?"
"What specific steps does he have in mind to safeguard against private entrepreneurs creaming off the easy and the profitable aspects of the postal services, whilst leaving rural residents as the poor relations?"
"With regard to the recently introduced deregulation in the United Kingdom, does the Commissioner have any plans to monitor that, or any comments to make upon it?"
". The point raised by the honourable Member will form part of our thinking in whatever proposals are put forward by the end of 2006."
"And, yes, I am very conscious of the importance of a universal service and particularly the importance of such a service to rural parts of Europe."
"There is a risk that health care services will be excluded from the scope of the directive."
"Patients would not be able to enjoy the same rights as users of other services (right of information on providers, requirement to conclude indemnity insurance)."
"Patients have already obtained the right to have health care costs in another Member State reimbursed thanks to the European Court of Justice, meaning that Article 23 would simply incorporate case law into national legislation, as well as providing patients with a higher level of certainty on account of the definition of hospital care."
"What have the Member States done to incorporate the right of patients to have health care from another Member State reimbursed by their own social insurance systems?"
"What does the Commission intend to do to safeguard these rights if Article 23 is not adopted?"
". Article 23 of the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market does, as the honourable Member says in her question, codify existing rights to patient mobility."
"The case law of the Court of Justice has established that, subject to certain conditions, patients have the right to have the cost of healthcare received in other Member States assumed by the social security system in their own Member State."
"Patients are, without prior authorisation, entitled to get reimbursement for non-hospital care received in other Member States."
"For hospital care, prior authorisation may be required before a patient can go abroad to receive health care."
"Authorisations must be granted when the necessary care cannot be given in the patient’s Member State within a medically justifiable time limit."
"Before the proposal for a services directive was tabled, the Commission carried out a study on the implementation of the rights of patients in the Member States."
"The conclusion was that ‘European citizens are encountering unjustified or disproportionate obstacles when they apply for reimbursement, from their Member State of residence, of costs for non-hospital treatment incurred in another Member State, or for authorisation for assumption of the costs in the case of hospital treatment’."
"For an individual citizen, the right to receive treatment in other Member States and to have the cost covered by his or her own social security system is probably one of the most important benefits of the internal market."
"These are the reasons for the Commission to propose the inclusion of health services in the scope of the services directive and for proposing a specific provision on the assumption of health care costs incurred in other Member States."
"The Commission has also been actively involved in the work of the high-level group on cross-border healthcare and patient mobility with a view to establishing how best the framework for guaranteeing and promoting patient rights in the single market can be developed."
"This work has shown the clear benefits of cooperation between Member States on health and healthcare related issues, of which the reimbursement of costs is just one aspect."
"A number of Member States are concerned about the effects cross-border care and patient mobility may have on their national health budgets."
"In the absence of a clear legal framework, we will continue to be confronted with developing ECJ case law."
"Pending the vote in this House on the first reading of the proposed services directive, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the position on certain articles, but I can confirm that where Member States impose disproportionate or unjustified restrictions, the Commission will act, including by launching infringement procedures."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well thought out answer."
"He rightly said that legal certainty that health care costs incurred in any Member State will be covered is a key benefit, and one that is of fundamental importance for the free movement of citizens and services within the European market."
"There is one question I should like to ask, if I may, as a former minister for health and head of a large teaching hospital."
"Is the Commission aware of the fact that the Services Directive represents a key opportunity to lay down clear conditions and legal provisions concerning the reimbursement of non-urgent health care costs to citizens of the 25 Member States, without the principle of subsidiarity being violated?"
"Furthermore, is it aware that it has already become untenable for the European Court of Justice to continue acting as the guarantor and interpreter of legislation on this issue, or for it to be possible for such a role to be performed by a high-level group that engages in ongoing discussions, yet has no legislative power and cannot provide any legal certainty?"
". As I said in my reply, one of the reasons for the inclusion of health services in the scope of the Services Directive was to deal with some of the issues raised by the honourable Member."
"However, as the honourable Member will be aware, the debate on the Services Directive in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in other committees has thrown up a number of other issues, and the Internal Market Committee voted in a particular direction."
"At next month’s part-session, the first reading of the Services Directive will come before the House and amendments will be debated."
"Therefore, there are many conflicting viewpoints among parliamentarians on this issue and there are conflicting viewpoints among Member State governments on the scope of the Services Directive to include healthcare costs."
"As I have said on this issue and on any others relating to the Services Directive, I remain open to hearing the concerns and opinions of all stakeholders."
"I wish particularly to thank the Commissioner for his excellent answer to Mrs Roithová’s question, and I wonder if the Commission might help bring about some understanding of these issues by producing basic data showing that this is an area in which genuine added value can be obtained. By this I mean that cross-border care could constitute added value for people, that we could obtain better specialist health care and that patients could obtain better care of higher quality, sometimes at lower cost but, above all, in a more efficient way."
"I am completely convinced that the Commission could come up with data which would help us."
"I wonder what the Commission thinks about helping bring about a better debate on these issues."
". As usual, Mrs Cederschiöld makes a very compelling argument for her case."
"However, as I said in reply to Mrs Roithová, there are differing views on this issue."
"I await the outcome, in the first instance, of the vote in the European Parliament next month and the various amendments that have been proposed in this and other areas."
"Certainly Mrs Cederschiöld makes some very compelling points, but there are other views also."
"The Commission's efforts gradually to create a more transparent and open European defence procurement market are moving in the right direction despite the particular features of this sector."
"The procedure followed so far is based partly on Directive 2004/18/EC(3) and partly on Article 296 of the Treaty, which provides for derogations."
"To what extent does the Commission intend, provisionally, to define more clearly the criteria for implementing Article 296 concerning derogations, together with the criteria for the scrutiny and monitoring of the related national procedures?"
"To what extent can it be considered that derogations whereby government authorities negotiate with suppliers of their choice in respect of the manufacture of goods for the purposes of research, study and experiment and the supply of defence material by legal persons, in which the government holds more than 50% of the capital, are consistent with the conditions governing the application of Article 296?"
". The honourable Member’s question can be split into two parts."
"The first issue is whether the Commission intends to clarify further the criteria governing the use of Article 296 of the Treaty."
"The second, more specific issue is the Commission assessment on the rules to be applied to research, study and experiment contracts in the field of defence."
"On the first issue, we recently outlined our proposals for future initiatives to improve cross-border competition in defence procurement."
"Our communication of 6 December announced the adoption in 2006 of an interpretative communication on Article 296 in the field of defence procurement and the start of preparatory work on a possible defence procurement directive."
"Those initiatives are based on the results of the consultation launched with the green paper of 2004."
"The contribution of Parliament to this debate, voted on 17 November, explicitly supports the Commission in its initiative."
"The interpretative communication will give guidance on how to use Article 296 of the Treaty, which allows Member States a derogation from internal market rules and from Directive 2004/18 when their essential security interests are at stake."
"This provision has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and cannot be interpreted widely."
"It is for the Member State that seeks to rely on this provision to provide evidence that the derogation is justified and proportionate to the objective pursued."
"A possible directive would coordinate procedures for defence procurement in cases where the derogation under Article 296 is not applicable or where a Member State chooses not to take advantage of it."
"It would provide new, more flexible procurement rules, better suited to the specific nature of the defence sector."
"The adoption by the Commission of a possible proposal for such a directive is subject to the results of the impact assessment which will be carried out in 2006."
"The Commission is not in a position to give an assessment of the facts described by the honourable Member in the second part of the question."
"Article 296 of the Treaty has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and according to the specific circumstances of each case."
"However, the principles that should be taken into account when establishing the rules to apply can be briefly outlined."
"On the one hand, it is worth noting that public procurement in the field of research, study and experiment benefits, under certain conditions, from specific derogations within the existing directive and within the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organization."
"Defence contracts of this kind can also benefit from derogations within the Code of Conduct set up by the European Defence Agency for the Article 296 area."
"On the other hand, the question of government ownership of the share capital of potential contractors, and the consequences in terms of the rules to be applied, is not an issue to be addressed on the basis of Article 296: this is linked to the ‘in-house’ derogation, as established by the Court of Justice."
"However, according to this case law, the derogation only applies in cases of 100% ownership."
"– I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his transparency and comprehensive reply to my question."
"I think that concern about the question of transparency of public procurement and public defence is an issue which preoccupies the European economy in general, but I shall bear in mind the Commissioner's explanation that he will clarify the derogations from Article 296 of the Treaty on the basis of the relevant decision by the Court of Justice, especially the stage of the procedure during which public arms procurement contracts are awarded."
"What we need to know – and urgently – is how the Member States are to intervene with a consultation mechanism in relation to procurement as a result of research and technology."
". The honourable Member, Mrs Batzeli, reminds us of the advantages of having transparency in this particular area of public procurement."
"However, as she will be aware, Article 296 allows considerable discretion on the part of Member States as to how they organise such activity."
"Hopefully our recent communication of December 2005 and what we intend to do in cooperation with all stakeholders will open up that area even further."
"I believe it is important to have a single European market in the defence production and procurement sector, which is vital for the future of the European Union."
"I believe that the Commission – in the past at least – has given an unreasonably generous and wide interpretation of Article 296."
"Could you say whether you would narrow that interpretation in future?"
"Most importantly, if you do not have it, will you do an estimate at Commission level of the costs of not having a single market in the defence sector, in terms of the costs of purchases from overseas that might have been purchased in-house and the costs of having a fragmented and divided defence market in Europe with batch production rather than mass production?"
". I understand that the sum total of defence budgets in the EU is in the order of EUR 169 billion, of which about EUR 82 billion is for procurement."
"Therefore, as the honourable Member implies in his question, any opening-up of the market in this area could lead to very substantial savings on the defence budget of many Member States, which would be much to the betterment of the public finances in all those Member States."
"So there is indeed considerable potential in this area."
"On the other hand, if we are to open up this particular market even further, there must be cooperation among the Member States as to how to proceed."
"I wish to put these facts on this House’s record just to show the amount of money involved in this area."
"Questions Nos 28 to 30 will be answered in writing."
"How does the Commission assess developments in the Ukraine during the past 12 months, and what strategies has it drawn up for 2006 with a view to bringing this important and entirely European country closer to the EU?"
". Thank you for the question."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy has brought and will continue to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union."
"Our cooperation with Ukraine can be seen as most successful."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan adopted in February 2005 has proved to be an essential and efficient tool for encouraging reform through deeper political cooperation and closer economic integration between the EU and Ukraine."
"Following the Orange Revolution, a renewed willingness on the Ukrainian side to boost EU-Ukraine cooperation could be observed."
"The implementation of the Action Plan by Ukraine in the course of 2005 can be assessed positively."
"At the summit with Ukraine in December 2005, President Barroso confirmed progress by Ukraine in political and economic reform."
"Progress in the EU-Ukraine relationship could be registered on economic integration; granting of market economy status by the EU to Ukraine; cooperation in the key sectors of energy and transport; a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation; justice and home affairs; the opening of visa facilitation negotiations in parallel to negotiations on a readmission agreement; as well as in the area of foreign and security policy, namely, the launching of the EU border assistance mission on the Transnistrian segment of the Ukraine-Moldova border."
"However, important steps remain to be taken by Ukraine in the implementation of the Action Plan, in areas such as the rule of law and in particular on the economic side: the fight against corruption; adopting relevant legislation for WTO accession; and improving the business climate."
"The Commission hopes to build on the additional impetus given by the summit – the first with a Ukrainian Government fully committed to reform – to the development of our relationship with Ukraine."
"In February 2005 the EU committed to initiating early consultations on an enhanced agreement between the EU and Ukraine as soon as the main political priorities of the Action Plan have been addressed."
"That commitment remains valid; when we are able to do so depends on Ukraine and perseverance in the reform process to tackle outstanding issues."
"The March 2006 parliamentary elections will be an important test of Ukraine's continued commitment to democracy and will be essential in opening further perspectives in the relationship with Ukraine."
"The future relationship will be based on several essential conditions: the success of the political reform, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and WTO membership, so as to fully integrate Ukraine into the world market."
"This will also open up prospects for the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Ukraine."
"The way ahead lies in a close partnership with Ukraine, based on common values and the objective of economic integration, as well as strengthened cooperation in a number of areas."
"The policy of constant progress and small, continued and common steps in the EU-Ukraine relationship has proved to be successful over the past year since the Orange Revolution and will allow us to tackle the challenges ahead."
"– Mr President, on the one hand, I regret the absence of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner – I do not think that that is right, as her name appears on the agenda – but, on the other, I am glad that the Austro-Hungarian cooperation in the Commission is working so well."
"I have two brief questions for the Commissioner."
"Firstly, what aid, in the form of staff and funding, does he regard as conceivable for the coming year to prevent the reform process in Ukraine failing or toppling once more – as, indeed, certain neighbouring states obviously believe it will?"
"Secondly, what specific action is the Commission taking to improve the transport links between the European Union and Ukraine, and to develop common infrastructure concepts to strengthen Ukraine’s energy and transport links to the west?"
". I am afraid it is too early to answer these questions."
"Perhaps Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has something in mind, but as far as the Commission is concerned, we have not reached the point of being able to answer this question because, first, political and economic reforms are needed to get Ukraine closer to the European Union."
"Then comes further and deeper cooperation."
"I should like to put a question to the Commission."
"The fact is that, today, the European Parliament has almost unanimously adopted a very powerful report on human trafficking."
"We have given a very great deal of attention to this issue, and we have also addressed it in the contacts we have had with Ukraine."
"With today’s decision, Parliament is giving its position a higher profile."
"I should like the Commission to give particular attention to this issue, which has received an incredible amount of support today here in the European Parliament."
". I think that it will take a long time to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union and it will be a long road."
"Using my personal experience as a former foreign minister of neighbouring Hungary, I can say that Ukraine has come a long way, and since the Orange Revolution there is now no major question that Ukraine wants to get closer, that Ukraine wants to be a democratic country, wants to be a market economy."
"Nevertheless, it is still has a long way to go before it completely complies with EU norms and principles."
"We have two options."
"Either we can be too demanding and push Ukraine away from the European Union, or we can be more tolerant, more cooperative, and bring Ukraine closer, bearing in mind that the domestic political situation in the country is not that simple."
"Ukraine is now facing general elections that will be a test of democracy in the country, whatever the outcome."
"What we have to take into consideration is not the outcome of the election, but the democratic nature of that event, which will be a test for Ukrainian democracy."
"On 27 November 2005 Velupillai Pirapaharan, leader of the LTTE, made 'an urgent and final appeal' to the newly elected President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaske, to reinvigorate the peace process and 'satisfy the political aspirations of the Tamil people.'"
"Pirapaharan indicated that, if 'a reasonable political solution' was not offered soon, the LTTE would intensify its struggle for self-determination, possibly by violent means."
"What is the Commission's response to the tone and content of Pirapaharan's Hero's Day speech?"
"Given the stalemate in the peace process since the LTTE withdrew in 2003, and the seemingly irreconcilable zero-sum perspectives of Rajapaske, (who campaigned with promises not to share power with the LTTE) and Pirapaharan, does the EU not feel it has an overwhelming responsibility, as a Tokyo co-chair and a key donor, to open an urgent dialogue with both parties before they return to violence, to find a solution which realises the Tamil right to self-determination within a united Sri Lanka?"
". Thank you for the question."
"There are strong reasons for concern about the situation in Sri Lanka."
"The year 2005 was a bad one for the peace process."
"The assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, the electoral boycott enforced by the LTTE in the north and east, and the numerous killings in the east and in Jaffna have put the ceasefire in jeopardy."
"The failure of the post-tsunami operations management structure, the mechanism within which the government, the LTTE and Muslim representatives were to decide jointly about tsunami reconstruction in the north and east, has also been a heavy drawback, creating huge resentment among the Tamils."
"What we are seeing now is a dangerous spiral."
"The Sri Lankan military has now lost more than 60 soldiers in indirect attacks by the LTTE in Jaffna and other parts of the north and east."
"So far, the government has acted with a remarkable sense of restraint, but this cannot last forever."
"The European Union, and the Commission in particular, plays a strong part in the peace process."
"Sri Lanka is a personal priority of the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"She went there last March and fought hard to obtain an agreement on P-TOMS."
"She still feels this would have made a major difference."
"The EU passed strong messages to both sides throughout the year."
"In particular, the EU declaration of September 2005 announcing that high-level delegations of the LTTE would no longer be received in EU capitals was a major signal that, while seeking a balanced approach to the conflict, the EU would not tolerate further violence from the LTTE."
"The Commission has also been instrumental in raising the profile of the co-chairs."
"The Commissioner responsible for external relations personally attended three of the four co-chair meetings held in 2005."
"Indeed, two of them were held in Brussels."
"The Commission continued to support Norway’s facilitation through public, as well as private, messages throughout the year."
"The Commission also supported the idea that the next co-chair meeting should take place in Sri Lanka close to the fourth anniversary of the ceasefire agreement."
"The Commission will intensify its efforts into the next year."
"Two priorities have been set for the Commission’s action."
"Firstly, the Commission will work towards an even stronger role for the co-chairs, including direct visits at ministerial level."
"The Commissioner responsible for external relations herself intends to return there in February, hopefully with all the co-chairs."
"She wants to be able to speak to Mr Pirapaharan in person and pass him the direct message that Europe will react very soon if the LTTE shows no sign of change."
"Secondly, now that P-TOMS have failed, the Commission is working on an alternative base to deliver reconstruction to the north and east."
"It may seek to work more locally, say in one or two districts, to compensate for the absence of a larger consensus between the key players."
"I thank the Commissioner for his detailed response."
"I have one issue that I wish to raise, following on from today's mine attack which resulted in the deaths of two civilians and the injury of 12 soldiers."
"That is the latest in a month of bloodshed."
"Given that both sides have agreed, in principle, to review the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, is the EU, as co-chair of the peace process, planning on taking this opportunity to push for a human rights declaration signed by both the government and the LTTE in order to put the protection of fundamental human rights at the heart of the peace process?"
". Thank you for the supplementary question."
"As I am not the Commissioner responsible I can only give my personal view, and not that of the Commission, on this new development which the Commission has not had time to discuss."
"However, it would seem to me that an initiative such as the one you suggest as a possible option is fully in line with the Commission’s policy on the situation in Sri Lanka."
"As the subject is covered later in this part-session Question No 33 will not be called."
"As the author is not present, Question No 34 lapses."
"We note with concern that the democratisation process in Colombia is constantly being disrupted by disturbances in the country."
"We are also concerned about the continuing human rights violations there."
"The armed conflict is escalating and drug-trafficking is continuing on a large scale."
"This constitutes a serious obstacle to development and peace in Colombia."
"A number of Swedish voluntary organisations send personnel to Colombia to work on peace projects and projects to defend the rights of local and indigenous people, including land rights."
"This should be seen against the background of the fact that, as in many other Latin American countries, large corporations are expanding rapidly, as, particularly, is palm oil production by them."
"Will the Commission propose any special measures to support the democratisation process in Colombia?"
". The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member regarding the continuing human rights violations and the persisting threats to democracy in the regions of Colombia affected by the longstanding internal armed conflict."
"Therefore the EU strategy for Colombia mainly aims at supporting comprehensive peace initiatives, with the strong involvement of local communities."
"It is thus the intention to directly contribute to the strengthening of democracy with an integrated set of instruments."
"Among these, over the period from 2001 to 2005, more than EUR 16 million was committed for Colombia from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, for 53 projects supporting human rights and democratisation, and which have been implemented or are still under way."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I asked this question precisely because Colombia is in the process of becoming the scene for our second largest refugee disaster."
"Where Colombia differs from other countries is in the fact that land there is still in the hands of local and regional landowners."
"That is why there is still an opportunity to help the local population and to ensure that people are allowed to retain their land. This factor will of course be what is important when we try to solve this conflict."
"Thank you very much for your answer, and I naturally hope that we shall jointly make progress in these peace initiatives being taken by the EU."
". I do not wish to take the floor on that, as I am not aware of the problem that the Member raised."
"What view does the Commission take of the outcome of the ASEAN summit held in December, particularly as regards the protection of human rights in ASEAN countries such as Myanmar (Burma)?"
". The Commission follows with interest the attempts by institutions and individuals in ASEAN countries to establish a human rights mechanism."
"The Commission supports those efforts and other human rights issues through various cooperation programmes in several ASEAN countries."
"An EC-sponsored ASEAN-wide human rights conference will be held in Manila in 2006."
"We are encouraged to note that for the first time an ASEAN summit called for the release of political prisoners in Myanmar."
"ASEAN leaders also agreed to dispatch the foreign minister of Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, to assess the democratic process during a visit."
"While those initiatives by ASEAN are positive, we should remain cautious about the prospects of immediate changes in Myanmar and especially about the release of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Commissioner, progress has indeed been made, at least in terms of the call that has been made for human rights to be respected in the country formerly known as Burma."
"I do, however, have a question, or rather a request and a proposal, for the European Commission."
"It is my belief that the Commission should monitor the situation on an ongoing basis, naturally with Parliament’s help."
"Truly international pressure, brought to bear by Europe as well as Asia, is our only hope of achieving any concrete results."
"I would urge the European Commission to take an ongoing interest in this issue."
". Thank you for your proposal, which I will certainly forward to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"I think that the possibilities available to the European Union, which is not in the region, are more limited than those available to ASEAN, for instance."
"I think ASEAN could do more, but your proposal is certainly worthy of consideration."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the debate on the following reports by Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the effort he has made to improve the Commission’s proposal, which represents a u-turn in what has been the European Union's policy on the sugar sector since 1968 and which, furthermore, is going to put an end to sugar beet cultivation in many regions of the European Union."
"Although this has been mentioned many times, I would like to comment on the lack of respect that the Council has shown towards this Parliament by reaching an agreement and communicating it to the media before hearing the opinion of this Parliament."
"The gentlemen’s agreement that has always existed within the institutions has been violated."
"Given anti-democratic gestures such as this, we should not be surprised that the citizens do not believe in the institutions and vote as they do and as they will continue to do."
"With regard to the political agreement that the Council has reached, it is closer to the Commission’s proposal than to what the European Parliament is going to vote on tomorrow."
"I shall just refer to prices."
"You have agreed a reduction of 36%, while the Commission proposes 39% and we in Parliament are going to vote for a reduction of 30%."
"I would also like to express my disagreement with the discrimination against the countries with a production share lower than their consumption and do not therefore produce the surpluses that in theory make this reform necessary."
"These countries are being penalised, while an extra quota is being provided for the large producers of C sugar."
"Finally, everybody talks about producing biofuels as an alternative to the sugar beet that is going to be taken off the market, but how and when are the means going to be provided?"
"I do not imagine that you believe, Commissioner, that with a million and a half hectares for energy crops and a subsidy of EUR 40 per hectare we can respond to the needs of the huge number of farmers who are going to lose their livelihood."
"Mr President, the decision of the Council is brutal for the European, and therefore the Hungarian sugar industry, and hence it cannot be accepted."
"The European Parliament cannot allow the decapitation of the European sugar industry."
"If this brutal Council regulation remains in place, in 15 years’ time sugar production will be limited to two European Union Member States: France and Germany."
"This could be avoided if the excellent, thorough and balanced report of rapporteur Jean-Claude Fruteau is taken on board, but even the version proposed by Mrs Fischer Boel would be more beneficial for European sugar producers."
"The position of the European Parliament is that the price cut should be 30 percent, lower than the percentage specified in the decision of the Council, and compensation should be higher, of 100 percent if possible."
"It is also important to make sure that the transitional period does not exceed four years."
"Area-based aid should be linked to partial production, and this should be included as one of the conditions."
"This will be my request to the Commissioner."
"A more moderate price cut, together with the conditions mentioned, would grant more chances of survival to sugar beet production and sugar industry in midfield Member States, such as Hungary."
"Unfortunately all five Hungarian sugar factories are owned by foreign, French, German and Austrian sugar beet growers, who may decide to restrict production to their own countries."
"This would present a risk for a country with an economic production at average European levels, such as Hungary."
"This is why I am asking my fellow Members: let us correct the wrong decision of the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the cost of sugar, currently Europe’s most subsidised agricultural product, is three times higher than the world price – an unfair and unacceptable situation indeed, and the reason why I think that sweeping reform was, and is, inevitable."
"One question that arises is whether the Commission proposals go far enough."
"In my view, what is being overlooked is the sugar sector’s structural problem, namely a general overproduction."
"Far more sugar is already being produced than consumed."
"This situation will get worse as the price drops, which will only benefit major producers and distributors."
"In the final analysis, it is the agricultural industry that pockets the savings, while the small farmers receive less for their yields from sugar beet."
"Ultimately, the consumer ends up paying the same price for a kilo of sugar."
"It is, in particular, the poorest countries that are at risk of being the victims of this reform."
"Preferential treatment has created local sugar crops, often small-scale with a minimum outlay, in various ACP countries."
"Those countries cannot possibly compete without further European support."
"Hence the importance of the Kinnock amendment to free up an annual amount of EUR 200 million for the ACP countries."
"In fact, Mrs Kinnock’s other amendments also deserve our support."
"Failure to deliver on the commitments in the framework of the ‘Everything but Arms’ programme will seriously damage our credibility in respect of the LDCs."
"Moreover, this reform invites a discussion about a general abolition of all export subsidies, as recently promised in Hong Kong."
"I will conclude by summing up that sugar reform is necessary, but not if it is sweet for major producers while leaving poor farmers with indigestion."
"– Mr President, as we stated in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we are very concerned about this sugar reform and about the positions that the Council unfortunately adopted ahead of this debate."
"Our proposals in committee stressed the promotion of the principle of food sovereignty and safety, and the protection of farmers and the industry in regions and Member States experiencing difficulties. We also advocated an increase in production quotas, in countries in which there is a production shortfall in relation to consumption, as in the case of Portugal."
"Accordingly, we proposed, and continue to advocate, an increase in production quotas at the Coruche factory in Portugal to 120 000 tonnes of sugar beet, in order to guarantee economic viability, jobs and sugar beet production, given the good conditions in Portugal and the major shortfall in sugar production in relation to consumption."
"Mr President, they say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish."
"If we are going to shut down sugar production in Ireland and in the EU, we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers, even if just to salve our own conscience."
"But are we crazy?"
"Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels?"
"Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment when we need sugar production more than ever?"
"Sugar has other uses besides sweets."
"On the one hand, we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives; on the other hand, sugar – one of the viable alternatives – has been made to disappear."
"One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing."
"How can we accomplish anything?"
"While we are planning our own compensation package, let us remember third countries like Mauritius, which are being devastated by our sugar reforms."
"Mr President, liberalisation of the sugar market is a complex problem, and one that requires our particular attention."
"The European Parliament demonstrated its awareness of this fact by adopting a resolution on the future reform of the common market organisation for sugar on 10 March 2005."
"Unfortunately, the European Commission ignored this resolution."
"In July 2005, it presented three proposals for regulations that undermined the meaning of the resolution that the House had adopted."
"Parliament was ignored for a second time on 24 November 2005, when the Council adopted a final version of the reform without asking the House for its opinion, and in the face of opposition from the Polish and Greek Agriculture Ministers."
"This has led to us being presented with proposals that violate the principle of European solidarity, and whose aim is to ensure that the sugar market is reformed at the expense of smaller countries, in particular the new EU Member States."
"A further aim is to ensure that European sugar production is concentrated in Germany and France."
"The proposed solutions will work to the disadvantage of farmers and sugar factory workers, and to the advantage of the large sugar companies."
"The individual and the principle of partnership have fallen by the wayside in this reform."
"The new Member States have privatised their sugar factories, yet the vast majority of such factories in Poland were taken over by foreign owners at a mere one third of the price that they will now be paid for stopping production."
"The situation is similar in many other countries."
"For these and many other reasons, I would suggest that all three proposals be rejected, and that a new reform be drafted that would in keeping with Parliament’s resolution of 10 March 2005."
"Mr President, I am fully aware that ever more far-reaching reforms of the common agricultural policy must be and will be carried out."
"It is an unfortunate fact that these new reforms will work to the disadvantage of farmers, and that as usual the new Member States will suffer most."
"This is yet another example of the unjust terms upon which we joined the EU."
"It will be no secret to the Commissioner that the reform of the sugar regime currently under way will not win her any friends in Poland."
"She should understand our point of view, however, and pay due attention to it."
"As the rapporteur said, our attention should be focused in particular on the men and women who earn their living from sugar production."
"The planned compensation should be targeted mainly at workers in sugar factories and at farmers, rather than at the owners of such factories."
"This is all the more true since the majority of sugar factories in Poland are under foreign control."
"The transfer of production quotas from one country to another should be prohibited in order to avoid speculation."
"This reform of the sugar market is yet another wasted opportunity."
"Instead of acting as an expression of solidarity between EU Member States and with developing countries, it will result in insufficient aid for poor countries and fresh points of contention between Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is an urgent need for a reform of the sugar market, since the present regulation governing quotas, prices and export subsides expires on 30 June 2006."
"Yet changes of the kind that have been proposed to us are unacceptable."
"The view held not only by myself, but also by the majority of sugar beet farmers in Poland, is that the only word that can be used to describe these changes is scandalous."
"The political compromise that has now been reached by the Council is intolerable."
"It has even been claimed by Polish sugar beet farmers that the reform of the EU sugar market was delayed on purpose until after the new Member States had joined, so that sugar production in the EU could be scaled down at their expense."
"The European Commission has said time and time again that C sugar quotas destabilise the market."
"The WTO panel ruled against us, and we were unsuccessful in our appeal."
"Yet the compromise reached by the Council of Ministers provides for an additional 1.1 million tonnes of C sugar for the Member States that produce most of it."
"There is an astonishing lack of consistency in the measures taken by the European Commission and the Council."
"Even though the goal of these institutions is to limit production, they have proposed an increase for countries producing large quantities of what is known as C sugar."
"We received several Christmas presents along these lines, but it is a shame that Father Christmas was not as generous to all the other countries."
"How do the Commissioner and the Council explain the fact that only selected countries will receive additional aid?"
"How have these countries been selected?"
"The cost of all these Christmas gifts, which will take the shape of more generous restructuring payments, will be met by other, much poorer countries, including Poland."
"I would ask the Commissioner whether the reform of the sugar market amounts to nothing but haggling, or whether it is based on consistent measures that will ensure that the European sugar market is competitive."
"I would ask Parliament to adopt the amendments that I have tabled with a view to improving this reform of the sugar market, at least in part."
"Let us hope that the Commission and the Council take note of them."
"There is still a chance that they will do so, and I would be very grateful if they did."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and subsequent vote will finally bring to a close more than a year of work in this Chamber, and I should like to highlight Mr Fruteau’s constructive approach, and express my backing for his reports."
"Rather than being the end of the road, however, this moment marks the start of a process of development in the sector."
"Turning to you, Commissioner, I should like to say that the trend towards viewing the market as the be-all –and end-all has had devastating consequences, although we have helped somewhat to mitigate those consequences."
"If such a reform is, rightly, deemed inevitable, that is already cause to be wary of its effects. This is because, since the positions of the Council and Parliament came closer together, it has revolved around a drastic price cut of 36% in four years."
"Deregulation via price works in the interests of the large producers, which can continue to grow to the detriment of the environment and exploit even further an under-paid workforce outside Europe."
"It is also in the interests of the major users, who will buy sugar a great deal cheaper on the world market without this being reflected in the price of the end product, thereby maximising their profits."
"That is their definition of development, not to be confused with our concept of development."
"On the other side of the coin, deregulation via price is damaging to the small producers here in Europe and, even more so, in the ACP countries and the least developed countries, who will sell their sugar for less and may even have to stop producing, without any viable alternative source of income."
"Nor will this be of benefit to small consumers: there are strong indications that they will not be paying any less."
"In Europe, moreover, some countries will stop producing and others will carry on with some difficulty, both for producers and for firms and their employees."
"I should like, if I may, to introduce a particularly Belgian flavour at this point. I would welcome the possibility of restructuring in the chicory sector with a view to producing inulin, for which prospects are good."
"I tabled some amendments in this regard and I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for accepting them."
"With regard to the Council, which is set to meet in February, I hope that greater prominence will be given to the amount of aid earmarked for farmers and to the conditions that firms seeking restructuring aid need to meet."
"I shall be keeping a close eye on this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on the sugar COM has been called a historic agreement and a brave and bold decision on a situation that has remained crystallised for too many years."
"It has been said that action was needed today because it implies being able to find the necessary funds to carry out this painful but absolutely essential restructuring and to guarantee not only compensation for the farmers concerned, but also the long-term sustainability of the sector."
"This new policy will encourage trade and will strengthen the European Union’s negotiating position at the WTO meeting to be held in Hong Kong next month."
"With this reform, the European Union will certainly be an attractive market for developing countries, to which they can export their sugar, although I personally believe that we shall lose a great deal in terms of quality and consumer health guarantees."
"In this respect, Commissioner, perhaps we need to take a tougher, more prudent and more cautious line."
"Lastly, this agreement will enable the European Union to offer its ACP partners financial assistance to adapt to the changes, but it will certainly end up simply protecting France and Germany, as always."
"While expressing my great appreciation for the work done by the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I do not wish to linger over the terms of the agreement, which are now familiar to everybody."
"Once again, however, I must point out the extent to which the role of the European Parliament has been undervalued, in that all too often it has been bypassed by the Council and by the Commission itself."
"While hoping, therefore, that the amendments to improve the text are accepted, I want to say how baffled I feel, since there has been no attempt at all to take a bolder stand on the CAP in order to ensure that the European Union has the energy independence that it needs, by focusing on alternative energies or energies integrated with oil, such as energy from biomass, as Professor Prodi maintained as well."
"By transforming biomass, we can achieve earnings that far outweigh the losses on sugar."
"Is the Commissioner aware of that?"
"Is the Commission?"
"I believe it would be worthwhile for the European Union to invest in the biomass transformation sector which, incidentally, is a technology that produces hydrogen directly."
"Two tonnes of dry biomass, in fact, produces the same heat as one tonne of oil, but while the potential cost of biomass is EUR 200 per tonne, oil costs about EUR 400 per tonne."
"Let me give you an example: Italy would save about EUR 12 billion and Europe EUR 120 billion."
"With that we could implement a policy that combines the goals of reform with those of social justice in the best way possible and without unexpected and excessive trauma."
"We could adopt proactive, positive measures for the environment, for farmers and for the producers themselves, without promoting a benefit culture and, what is more, without losing jobs."
"Mr President, today we are debating three reports tabled before Parliament on the reform of the sugar market."
"As a representative of a new Member State, Poland, I should like to raise two grave concerns about this reform."
"Firstly, the reform has been made necessary by the excessive amounts of sugar exported by two countries in particular, namely Germany and France."
"These exports amount to nearly 2 million tonnes, and it is France and Germany that should bear the cost of this reform by significantly reducing the amount of sugar they export."
"Since Poland exports a mere 90 000 tonnes, it can only limit its production within these constraints."
"Secondly, sugar production limits have been imposed on sugar factories rather than on farmers in Poland, unlike in other EU Member States."
"The majority of sugar factories in Poland were bought out by German and French investors, who paid around EUR 200 per tonne of production limit."
"Given that they will be compensated to the tune of EUR 730 per tonne of abandoned production, the owners of such factories will receive nearly four times more than they paid."
"What is more, they will still own the industrial assets, or in other words the buildings, land and machinery."
"I should like to address these two grave concerns to the Commission and to the Council, as well as to the Commissioner, who is present in the Chamber today."
"All of these latter believe that they have come up with a first-rate idea for a reform of the sugar market."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we all agree that the sector needs to be reformed in order to make it sustainable, in line with the latest reform of the CAP and with the EU’s international obligations."
"Despite these new objectives, however, the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europe’s farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar."
"I therefore endorse Mr Fruteau’s report, along with the work carried out by the various political groups in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I feel sends out a very clear message to the Commission and the Council."
"In addition to the capping of price reductions to 30% in the common organisation of the market in sugar, I wish to highlight Amendment 3, on support schemes for farmers, which refers to the possibility of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent. This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform."
"I would say, however, that the Commission’s proposal was drawn up more from the point of view of the processing industry than that of agricultural producers, and more from the perspective of the interests of the major surplus producing countries than that of the smaller countries which do not even produce enough sugar beet to satisfy consumption, as in the case of Portugal."
"The mainstay of sugar beet production in Portugal is a factory that produces some 70 000 tonnes of the 300 000 tonnes consumed across the country."
"In other words, it is not countries like Portugal that are unbalancing the international market with surplus production."
"Nevertheless, by safeguarding the possibility of the restructuring fund supporting those giving up on part of the quota, we will be helping the sugar industry in some countries, such as Portugal, and shifting it away from the agricultural sector towards sustaining the processing side of the industry."
"Lastly, I should like to express my objection to the way in which the Council has approached this subject, from an institutional point of view."
"It does not matter how many times we hear that what we have is a political agreement and not a formal decision, the truth is that at a time when Europe’s citizens have expressed their concerns about the amount of transparency in the European institutions, this is not the best way to move forward."
"It is not simply a matter of following the interinstitutional agreement to the letter."
"We also have a duty, as politicians directly elected by the citizens of Europe, to demand respect, both ethically and politically, for the institutions."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Fruteau's reports and I would also pay tribute to the way he has gone about his work."
"It would be fair to say that we do not have identical views on the reform of the sugar regime, but I would like to think that we are now much closer at the end of the process than we were at the beginning."
"Like the rapporteur and previous speakers, I think it is a pity that the Council chose to reach a political agreement in advance of the debate in this Parliament."
"I think it shows a lack of respect for this House."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Council has recognised and supported the need to end the artificial support for the sugar sector and to make the European sugar regime more competitive in the world market, and I believe that the 36% reduction will make us WTO-compatible."
"It is not as radical as the 39% that the Commission proposes, but I think it brings us into line with WTO rules."
"The four-year implementation that the Council also recommends gives our producers a chance to adjust to the new realities."
"Where I would like to see more action is in two specific areas."
"Firstly, in relation to C sugar."
"We should have a clear commitment to abolish C sugar, which clearly distorts world trade and could still be a subject of dispute at the WTO level."
"So I shall support Amendment 80 on Thursday, as I hope will the House."
"I warmly welcome the EUR 7 billion compensation that has been given to European producers and I recognise that they need that support."
"However, like other speakers in this debate, I regret that we are not being as generous to ACP producers."
"The 18 ACP producers currently have stable earnings of around EUR 250 million a year from the sugar regime."
"The Commission proposal was for EUR 190 million a year between 2007 and 2013, which was good but not generous enough."
"The problem is that the Council agreement of 16 and 17 December does not meet the EUR 190 million that the Commission proposed, and as the budgetary authority in this, along with the Council, Parliament must press for EUR 190 million a year, if we are to be seen as genuine about our Millennium Development Goals objectives."
"Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who say that using sugar as a biofuel is a potential way forward and a potential new market for sugar."
"The technology exists; it needs to be improved and adapted; that needs research and technical support, and I hope the Commission will look again more generously at that aspect of reform and do more to assist the wider use of sugar, both as an environmental measure and as a way of compensating European sugar producers for the loss of revenue they face from these proposals."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Fruteau, not only for his work to date, but also for sticking with this marathon session; and I also thank the Commission."
"I think we should all get a clap on the back."
"Rather than repeat some of the comments made about these reforms, I just want to say that I have some concern about the severity of the price cut."
"I have urged this before, as an alternative to using a quota cut as a mechanism to control supply."
"I have particular questions for the Commission."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could give me an answer."
"In relation to the levy to be deducted from processors, could the Commission say whether, if a country – and I am speaking of Ireland – grows beet in 2006, the company has to contribute to the restructuring levy this year, should it intend to stop production in 2007?"
"It is a crucial issue and it will decide whether or not we grow beet this year – perhaps the last season for beet growing in Ireland."
"My second question relates to a comment the Commissioner made earlier in the debate when she said that the 10% which is being set aside under the restructuring scheme for growers could be increased by Member States in particular circumstances."
"Perhaps the Commissioner might outline what those circumstances might be."
"Without using all of my time, because we may all be tired and perhaps emotional, I shall just say, with regard to the developing world – and I share the concerns of others here in the House – that in reforming sugar we have upset the developing world, because we are offering it access to our markets at much reduced prices."
"What it wants is access at high prices, because that is the only way that it can grow and prosper."
"Those who have called for this to happen should think about what they have now succeeded in achieving."
"Lastly, I hope the reforms do what the Commissioner says they will do: give us a competitive sugar industry."
"Alas, I think that for Ireland it will mean that we will have no industry at all."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, deserves thanks for his committed work, which enabled the achievement of what was, after all, an acceptable compromise."
"He was not helped, of course, by the fact that the Agricultural and Fisheries Council had taken a preliminary decision."
"Although we do not have power of codecision in this field, this decision can only be tolerated in the light of the 2005 WTO negotiations."
"The compromise that has now been reached remains a tremendous challenge for those affected: within the EU as well as the ACP and least developed countries."
"Even though the affected parties will receive compensatory payments, there will be losses of income one way or another."
"In future, many sugar-beet-growing regions in the EU will not be able to grow as much sugar beet for food purposes or, in some cases, any at all."
"The Commission should follow the lead taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this regard and examine the possible scope for increasing the funds per hectare available for non-food crops."
"In my view, the key proposals of the Agriculture Committee are similar to those of the Agricultural and Fisheries Council."
"I hope that the compromise is adopted in the end, as it will give beet growers planning security and enable sugar-beet production in the EU to continue in future in spite of severe cuts."
"Sugar-factory operators also share responsibility, however."
"Their task is to implement the regime of the future market organisation in such a way that viable socio-economic solutions can be devised in cooperation with the trade unions and staff representatives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you are no doubt all aware, sugar cubes are a Czech invention, and so as a Czech MEP I should like to make a number of comments on the proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market for sugar, if I may."
"The first comment I should like to make is that I welcome the attempts of the European Council and of the European Commission to reform the EU’s sugar policy."
"The policy as it stands is utterly ludicrous and costs taxpayers and consumers too much."
"This state of affairs must change as soon as possible and the market as a whole must be deregulated and liberalised."
"Secondly, the fact that the sugar regime is being reformed only after the EU’s policy was ruled unfair by the World Trade Organisation is deplorable, and everyone in the EU should spend some time reflecting on it."
"Why are we incapable of liberalising our own markets, and why do we have to be forced into doing so by other countries?"
"After all, free trade and free markets have brought nothing but prosperity to the European nations throughout their history, whereas economic protectionism brings nothing but poverty."
"Yet it would appear that advocates of protectionism are well represented in this House."
"I am fundamentally opposed to their views and I will not vote in favour of their amendments."
"The sugar regime must be reformed as soon as possible."
"The third point I should like to make relates to the fact that a sugar refinery operated in my home town from 1890 until 1994."
"The reason it went bankrupt was the opening up of the sugar market after the fall of Communism in my country."
"The sugar refinery in my home town of Lysá nad Labem went bankrupt because it was unable to compete with the subsidised sugar refineries in the European Union."
"In the course of the 1990s, more than 50 sugar refineries in the Czech Republic went bankrupt or were closed down for this reason."
"The people who worked in them lost their jobs and received no compensation, and the refinery owners and sugar beet farmers received no compensation either."
"It is now the turn of the sugar sector in the old EU Member States to undergo the same process of market adjustment."
"The compensation that has been proposed is extremely generous, which should make such adjustment a simple task."
"I am therefore in favour of the reform of the sugar regime, and indeed I believe that it could go further."
"Our experiences in the Czech Republic show that such a reform is both feasible and manageable."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to highlight the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to be able to reach an agreement amongst all of the political groups, which is not at all easy given that the Commission’s initial proposal was aimed more towards the disappearance of sugar cultivation than its reform, without taking account of the resulting social cost."
"I therefore believe that this intense year of work has been worthwhile."
"Secondly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, whose three regulations have incorporated moderation, balance, solidarity and, above all, a realistic approach to the future of the sector, not just the 21 European Union producer countries, but also the ACP and least-developed countries."
"I would also like to add my voice to the many criticisms heard in this House at the fact that the Council should adopt a political agreement without awaiting Parliament’s report."
"We hope that this will not have set a precedent for future reforms."
"Finally, after so much work, I would like to refer to the double speak that some Members have been indulging in from the outset – I feel that I should point this out now that we have come to the end – voting in favour of the Fruteau report in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and then, when they get back to their country, criticising everything about it."
"Some of us have been working to reach agreements, to bring positions closer together, in order to achieve what in the end has become a reality."
"Despite everything, we believe that the current situation is much better than the situation at the outset; we do not like the reforms, we have never liked them, but we must recognise that we have improved on the difficult initial situation."
"I believe that this is the moment to send a clear message from this European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is always better as a rule to build rather than destroy."
"It is preferable to do things with an eye to future generations rather than to the next elections, because we will always be proven right in the end and the strategy of confrontation without arguments which has taken hold in my country will not bring about any positive solution."
"I shall end by calling on Parliament to support the Fruteau report, which is a good report and which may improve the Council's agreement, and, if it is strengthened by this Parliament, we will be able to move forward towards a better future for the sector."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the new sugar regime being outlined will be particularly unfortunate for growers."
"In many areas this means an end to the cultivation of sugar beet."
"The closure of sugar factories will send farmers and industrial workers into unemployment."
"Unfortunately, the first demonstrations have already started in my country."
"We must set as our objective the survival of our farmers on their farms."
"We do not need any more urban drift."
"If we want to replace sugar beet with energy crops, we must be more generous with our aid."
"Besides, we owe it to the environment, because energy crops mean that we are protecting the environment, although the ACP countries will not fare better in the future under the new regime."
"Commissioner, you are a sober, honest and able person."
"You work with Mr Fruteau, who has made very good proposals, you work with the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Daul, you make improvements, you make brave proposals, you demonstrate to those who criticise you that you are not here as a formality and that everything has been decided, but that you want – truly and constructively – to listen to Parliament."
"In this way you protect the European Union, the European Parliament and European agriculture."
"Otherwise, in many disadvantaged areas of Europe we shall see farming disappear, villages abandoned and the ecological deterioration of Europe."
"For heaven's sake, I do not think that is what you want."
"Mr President, sugar reform is first and foremost a social problem for farmers and workers in Europe and in the developing world."
"For social justice to be successful on a world scale, the European market has to be opened up."
"This reform is inevitable and painful, but if you have to jump through fire, you may as well make a good job of it."
"The Commissioner succeeded in making an enormous leap, the Council managed a smaller jump and this House would like to take a somewhat smaller jump still."
"Workers and farmers are worried, though, and are right to demand strong social guarantees."
"In that sense, the restructuring fund is vital."
"Thanks to the pressure we have exerted, we now have a bigger restructuring fund, which is important."
"We would like the fund to grow even more, for workers want more than retraining."
"They want alternative employment when their factories close down."
"Bio-ethanol is a solution, provided it can be produced using low levels of energy."
"More funding is needed for research into this."
"Only in that way is a social and sustainable future for the sector possible. Only in that way can the sector accept this reform."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a change, I should like to speak in favour of the current process of reforming the common organisation of the market in sugar, albeit with a very specific eye on sugar in the outermost regions."
"While the EU is committed to cutting back sugar production to bring it into line with world trade rules, the French overseas departments are on a diametrically opposite course, which consists of further increasing production in order to ensure that sustainable jobs are maintained and created, and that the fragile balance of both farming and industrial operations is preserved."
"As regards the Commission’s proposals, it can be said that Réunion, Guadeloupe and Martinique are pioneers in adapting their sugar cane sector."
"This is firstly because their level of production have remained well below authorised quotas, and they are thus not part of Community overproduction, and secondly because, in the past thirty years, factories have gradually merged. Accordingly, it is no longer possible to envisage either stopping or cutting back activities without upsetting the whole balance of the sector."
"Sugar cane has become a valuable commodity, capable of producing not only sugar but also energy, using bagasse or indeed natural manure."
"In the overseas departments, multifunctionality in agriculture is not merely some theoretical project, it is a reality."
"Moreover, it is precisely because they were pioneers that the overseas departments cannot go any further."
"Whereas the Commission and the Council have refused any further financial concessions to the departments, France has been authorised to implement provisions paving the way for state aid to be granted, in addition to the Community funds, via the political agreement in the Council ahead of the WTO summit in Hong Kong."
"There could be compensation for price cuts, with some leeway for increased production, which would return some sense of stability and visibility to a sector that has endured two years of uncertainty."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, on his efforts and would formally ask you, Commissioner, to retain the provisions in the Council’s compromise on sugar in the overseas departments in order to ensure the sector’s future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sugar reform was one of the most complex Community policy dossiers."
"Before finding political agreement, the Council should have taken Parliament’s opinion into consideration, in order to strengthen cooperation among the European institutions and to provide solutions commensurate with our expectations and the impending challenges."
"The outcome that has been achieved is, however, positive and moderately satisfying."
"I believe that Parliament’s contribution to the establishment of the compromise was vital."
"The own-initiative report adopted by this House last March provided a number of decisive pointers for drawing up the new proposal."
"The emphasis that this House placed on the social impact of the reform, with the establishment of a restructuring fund for the industry, is an essential part of our position which has been taken up in the agreement."
"It is certainly a painful reform, but it is inevitable if Europe is to meet its international commitments and at the same time ensure that the sector has a sustainable, competitive, long-term future."
"The compromise that has been reached is much more balanced than the Commission’s proposal in June and it provides for a series of positive measures: the chance to retain a proportion of coupled aid for those who continue producing; the support measures for sugar beet growers; the attention given to the regions penalised by the dismantling of the industry; and the creation of a diversification fund."
"The reform thus avoids totally abandoning production and its social and employment repercussions will be much less disastrous than we feared."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that Parliament has made known its opinion on the reform of the sugar regime."
"I was one of the Members who voted in favour of the resolution we adopted last year."
"Among other things, this resolution called for the quota reduction measures to be reconsidered, in particular in the case of the new Member States."
"I am delighted that the Commission has revised its original strategy and proposed a reform based on a reduction in the guaranteed price of sugar that will meet competitive sugar producers and sugar beet farmers halfway."
"I have certain reservations about the report we are discussing today, however, since it calls for a smaller reduction in the price of sugar than that to which the Member States agreed in December."
"This agreement itself was the result of a compromise that was achieved by toning down the harder-hitting proposal by the Commission."
"Firstly, it should not be forgotten that we suffered defeat at the hands of the WTO."
"We must therefore meet the requirement to open up our sugar market by 2009."
"In this connection, I can only wonder at the exaggerated amount of attention being paid to the interests of the least-developed countries."
"On the one hand, these countries would like the price of sugar to be reduced in markets outside Europe, but on the other, they want prices to remain high on the European market, to which they have privileged access."
"Secondly, I should like to stress that reducing the price of sugar over a longer period would work to the advantage of less competitive businesses, and help perpetuate distortions in the sugar market."
"It would not only be competitive sugar producers who would lose out, but above all European consumers, since they would be the ones paying most of the cost – quite literally – of a more moderate fall in prices."
"At present, they have to pay three times more for sugar than consumers in other parts of the world."
"Is it acceptable for them to continue subsidising an extensive protectionist system every time they buy a product containing sugar?"
"We should remember that the main purpose of the European Union is to remove barriers to mutual trade, not to perpetuate and strengthen them."
"We should therefore prove that we are a truly European Parliament, and that we are not afraid of implementing market mechanisms, in the fields of sugar production and sales."
"Mr President, the political agreement reached by the Agriculture Ministers − including the Spanish Socialist Minister, for which she should have been dismissed − will undoubtedly be adopted at the end of the month among points A of the agenda, that is to say without any debate whatsoever."
"There is no need, everything has been debated."
"Unfortunately, the discussion we are holding today in the European Parliament will have no impact on the final decision."
"In the future, we must prevent Parliament's voice from being ignored again in such a blatant manner, particularly on decisions with such significant economic and social importance."
"To this end, however, the European Commission must not use any excuse it likes to ignore the opinion of Parliament, as it has done on this occasion."
"I would like to make it clear, in case there is still any doubt, that this report, which will be put to the vote on Thursday, is a very long way from the political agreement reached by the Member States, with regard both to sugar prices and to compensation for farmers or the Member States' freedom to maintain part of the coupled aid, which in the agreement amongst the 25 in the Council is not taken up."
"Parliament’s report distributes the efforts for reducing production in a fairer manner, by removing the additional allocation of a million tonnes previously known as ‘C’."
"These are just a few of the examples that we may find if we compare the different texts, but the list would get very much longer if we were to carry out a detailed analysis of the agreement."
"In short, we do not like the reform, we did not like the European Commission’s reform because it was horrible."
"Nevertheless, the agreement that is going to be voted on in this Parliament on Thursday seems to us to be the least bad option."
". Mr President, I have listened carefully to the debate."
"Its intensity is a sign that quite a lot is at stake."
"However, it is also a sign of the commitment with which you have engaged yourselves in the process of making this new reform."
"Let me first deal with the amendments."
"I believe that I have found in them a lot of common ground with my own views."
"I shall start with the proposed new common market organisation."
"You have argued that the safety net is necessary during the restructuring period ending in 2009-2010 in order to limit undesirable market disturbances."
"I can accept that."
"I can therefore endorse the substance of Amendments 2, 29 and 54."
"In order not to encourage overproduction and subsequent building-up of stocks, it will be necessary to set the intervention price at a level considerably lower than the reference price of the following campaign."
"Intervention will also have to be limited to a certain maximum quantity."
"Finally, I think that during the restructuring period we need to dispose of all management tools, including private storage."
"You also argue that as long as our international commitments are respected some quantities of quota sugar should or could be exported."
"For the sake of the market balance, this is an idea that I can live with and thus I accept in principle Amendments 20, 39, 49, 51 and 68."
"Many of you have mentioned bioethanol."
"I share your analysis that future energy production could become a outlet for Community beet."
"Along these lines, I can support Amendments 11 and 42, raising the political profile of bioethanol in the reform package."
"As you are aware, the Commission is working on a whole set of political initiatives."
"On 1 February we shall adopt a proposal on the promotion of biofuels based on agricultural raw materials."
"I am also aware that Mr Parish is currently working on a Parliament resolution on exactly the same subject."
"I think we need to take this debate when these contributions have been adopted, rather than to take it now within the context of the sugar reform."
"I must underline that I am very interested in coming back to this debate as it is very important."
"I share the view that we need to address the specific problem arising for those growers who practise autumn growing."
"This is specifically a problem in the Mediterranean countries."
"That would require a provisional extension of the quota without restructuring levy for the marketing year 2006/2007."
"The Commission can thus agree with the principle of Amendments 23 and 69."
"I can share your concerns as regards the income of beet growers, and consent to the relevant part of Amendment 31 concerning the removal of the additional 10% flexibility for the sugar price."
"On industrial sugar, I can accept the substance of Amendment 43."
"Strict and complex rules that are difficult to monitor should be avoided."
"There is also a series of technical amendments that were already accepted in the technical discussions on the Commission proposal."
"Other amendments cover minor issues that could better be settled in the framework of the implementing rules."
"I am not in a position to accept the other amendments on the reform of the COM."
"Let me now move to the draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes."
"I can support the principle of increased flexibility for Member States in the context of the compensatory payments and therefore accept the substance of Amendments 5, 6, 8 and 11, adjusted as necessary."
"Building on my vision to underpin the development of bioethanol production in the Community, I can also live with the notion of Amendment 7, whereby sugar beet for purposes other than sugar production could be grown on set-aside land."
"Amendment 4 and Amendment 13 present a compensation system based on the amount of sugar produced from beet from each individual farmer."
"I am in favour of the proportionality principle of this reform, for instance, by advancing higher levels of compensation to Member States facing severe reductions on their quotas."
"However, the draft report proposes a system that would differentiate payments based on the volume of the sugar beet produced."
"Such a system would create enormous practical difficulties for a very limited added value, which would go against the shared objective of simplification, and I therefore cannot accept it."
"Nor can I accept the other amendments."
"Finally, let me refer to the draft regulation establishing the restructuring funds."
"I can endorse the idea underlying Amendments 4 and 14, whereby beet growers can benefit from a part of the restructuring aid."
"However, given the very different conditions faced by Member States, a minimum of 50% would be too high."
"Let us not forget the many obligations that need to be dealt with through this restructuring fund."
"There are some environmental, and some social obligations that are very important. If we were to impose a minimum of 50%, there would be cases where we would have difficulty in meeting these different obligations."
"Therefore I cannot accept it."
"As mentioned already in my opening statement, a of 10%, with the possibility for the Member States to increase this percentage, seems much more appropriate."
"Mrs McGuinness, this is addressed specifically to you: I would never dare interfere in the decisions taken by the Member States to decide at what level they would agree on this compensation percentage."
"Likewise, I can support the principle set down in Amendment 5, and the relevant part of Amendment 10, relating to the extended flexibility for industries ceasing sugar production and moving to alternative sectors, such as the production of bioethanol."
"The same applies to the notion of the partial quota surrender which is in Amendment 7."
"The social element is already well covered in the proposal and additional administrative requirements would only slow down the restructuring process."
"Therefore, I am of the view that Amendments 6, 9 and the relevant part of Amendment 7 should not be accepted."
"Some last-minute amendments have also been tabled."
"I am positive about the idea of Amendment 17."
"Sugar beet growers who continue sugar beet production in Member States which significantly reduce their sugar quota should be eligible for some kind of state aid for a transitional period."
"The proposed amendments to which I have not referred are of minor importance and for technical reasons I do not consider it necessary to take them on board."
"This also includes the last-minute amendments tabled last week."
"I took note of the particularly harsh comments that were made concerning the treatment of the ACP countries."
"Indeed, this has been the subject of very intense discussion, but we have not forgotten the ACP countries."
"The foreseen price cut only kicks in for the ACP countries in 2008, two years after it is imposed on the European farmers."
"Let us not forget that after the full implementation of the reform, the ACP countries will still benefit from a price that is twice as high as the world market price."
"The Commission has always proposed an action plan for the ACP countries, with EUR 40 million for 2006."
"These funds are expected to be at their disposal in 2006, even if the prices are not lowered until 2008."
"Funding of EUR 40 million is certainly not a lot, but it is enough to get started and it has always been the intention to provide significant funds for the remaining period from 2007 to 2013."
"It is quite clear that the size of these funds will depend on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspectives."
"The reform also introduces a number of obligations for undertakings that want to take up the restructuring fund."
"I must say that I am sorry and disappointed that quite a lot of Members – among others the Polish Members – are obviously unable to be here, because it must be completely clear that sugar companies cannot, I repeat,just take or cash in the restructuring fund and leave the country."
"They simply have to provide measures for employees in the sugar industry."
"These rules apply to training or early retirement, or what you will."
"This money is going to be spent in cooperation with the government."
"There seems to have been a complete misunderstanding about these restructuring funds."
"I can answer Mrs McGuinness' question on the levy, which is: yes, the only way to avoid this payment to the restructuring fund would be to do away with the production in 2006/2007."
"Lastly, some Members criticised the fact that the Council agreed on a political line for the sugar reform on 24 November 2005."
"The definition of a political line at the November Council was driven by exceptional circumstances."
"The current regime remains applicable only during the ongoing campaign and our growers and operators face some very difficult choices."
"We owe it to them to provide, in a timely fashion, acceptable conditions in which they could make those choices."
"We have lost in the WTO panel on sugar, and compliance with the panel's conclusion is a matter of urgency."
"Finally, we had to prepare for Hong Kong in order to be able to defend our sugar sector, and we therefore needed to know what we had to defend."
"However, I must emphasise that these circumstances should not have come as a surprise to anyone."
"Since I presented my reform proposal before this Parliament on 22 June, I made it absolutely clear that the Council would have to define its political line on the sugar reform at the November Council."
"I repeated this when I appeared before the Committee on Agriculture on 13 September 2005 and when I wrote a follow-up letter to all the members of that committee on 26 September 2005."
"I have operated in full transparency throughout the process to allow Parliament to play its role to the fullest."
"But, finally, let me say to those of you who are critical here today that we owe much credit to the many committees and members of this House who have provided very valuable input over the last 12 months."
"The reality is that you have managed successfully to influence the shape of the reform – a reform that will secure sustainability of this sector in Europe and a reform that allows us to offer a real alternative to those farmers and to those regions that will be most affected by the restructuring."
"That is the result and it is a good one."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0381/2005) by Mrs Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the provisions of the Århus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters to Community institutions and bodies (06273/2/2005 – C6-0297/2005 – 2003/0242(COD))."
". Mr President, the regulation to be voted on tomorrow on the application of the provisions of the Århus Convention to Community institutions will force us to confront decisions which are very political in nature."
"It concerns important environmental legislation which relates to access to environmental information and the right of citizens to participate in decision-making."
"The Århus Convention, ratified in the European Community by the Member States and the EU, will be implemented by means of three directives, for which the first two pillars have already passed through the codecision procedure and conciliation."
"During the entire process I have been rapporteur for the reports on the Århus Convention."
"These pillars concern the transparency of environmental information and the Community’s right to be involved."
"The third directive, access to justice, will probably not go ahead, because the Member States have not achieved consensus in the matter and there has been a general feeling that the project should be shelved."
"The right to access to justice has also proven to be the biggest problem area in this regulation."
"I have always stressed the importance of the rights of citizens regarding matters of the environment."
"Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental component of our own safety."
"The regulation now before us, which extends the scope of the provisions of the Århus Convention to Community level, is nevertheless in danger of acquiring some worrying features."
"The European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, when it voted, clearly altered the focus of the provisions, taking the Convention to what in my opinion was an undesirable level."
"It is one thing to monitor and regulate how, for example, an authority applies and interprets the provisions of environmental legislation but quite another to monitor and regulate how a democratically elected legislator goes about his or her task."
"The committee’s design as it stands would in practice give all non-governmental organisations that fit the description very loosely the right to take the Community institutions to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, thus according them a kind of watchdog status with regard to said institutions."
"As a politician, I am not, however, prepared to delegate in this way the power democratically bestowed on me and controlled by the people, and I hope that tomorrow this matter will be put right in the plenary vote."
"The most crucial areas in tomorrow’s vote relate to Amendments 22, 24 and 25."
"Article 230 of the Treaty allows citizens to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities if a decision affects the citizen directly and individually, which is only right and proper from the point of view of democracy."
"The position of Parliament’s Committee on the Environment now means, however, that any NGO within the EU can evade this provision by requesting an internal review, which the Community institution must reply to with a formal decision."
"This decision, in conjunction with Amendment 25, will clear the way for examining the legality of the original decision, and not only its procedural but also its substantive legality, and will thus give NGOs the power ultimately to evaluate the work of the Community’s institutions."
"This would automatically allow them to take the Community’s institutions to court, and, with such supreme authority, oversee our work."
"In a democracy it is the people who are the highest authority, and the decision-makers whom they elect implement their will."
"Now, however, we would be placing NGOs above the people and that is difficult for me to accept."
"This is a political matter and one of principle."
"Please do not misunderstand me: we need environmental organisations, and the world would be a much poorer place if NGOs had not justifiably raised many important questions."
"Nevertheless, what they are now trying to drive through for themselves, with some heavy lobbying, is disquieting."
"Furthermore, the definition of NGOs in the regulation is a very loose one, and for that reason I have tabled two amendments for the House which set out the criteria in greater detail."
"The first states that an NGO must have operated in more than one EU country for at least two years."
"The other amendment adds the words ‘compliant with the law’ to the definition."
"These amendments are essential for requests for reviews to remain within controllable limits and in order to obtain additional criteria for the nature of the work of NGOs."
"The members of our committee in this report have tabled amendments which I am happy to agree with."
"I myself have emphasised the importance, for example, of the quality and comparability of environmental information."
"Similarly, I support the democratic nature and transparency of our decision-making whenever I can."
"In fact, however, that is all I want from the environmental organisations."
"If they themselves complied with what they demand of us, if they were more transparent in their activities and funding procedures, and if they gave less misleading and mistaken information, we would not need to impose these restrictions and criteria."
"From the global point of view, it has been disappointing to observe that NGOs do not by any means always disseminate the correct information or correct what has been shown to be mistaken information."
"A good example of this is the letter that came this week from the biggest environmental organisations, which gives the wrong picture of the opportunity that is possibly now opening up to them of access to justice in court."
"They mention that industrial companies are able to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice, and now this legislation would only bring them to the same level."
"The letter fails to mention that the environmental organisations do by no means aspire to the same level as companies, regarding which there is a call for this decision to affect them ‘directly and individually’, in other words, as an interested party."
"Instead, the environmental organisations should now be able to choose, within the entire Union and ignoring criteria relating to interested parties, which area they are interested in."
"It was misleading that this essential detail was left unsaid."
"The Århus agreement is an important part of viable democracy."
"For that reason, citizens’ rights should not abuse the right to access to justice in order to put the brakes on projects or provide a forum for organisations’ fund collecting campaigns."
"Neither can I accept that the work of political decision-makers should flounder amid endless complaints from organisations."
"It is not appropriate to resort to the right to appeal incessantly."
"Abuses would undermine those citizens’ rights which we originally set out to defend."
"Accordingly, at the plenary reading we now have to be careful regarding how the Community actually applies the right to access to justice."
"I hope that Parliament will move closer to the Council’s view, which I hold to be a balanced one."
". I should like to thank the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their perseverance in drafting this report at second reading."
"I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, for her contribution to efforts to apply the Århus Convention to Community institutions."
"It is worth noting that, following the directives on access to environmental information and public participation, this proposal for a regulation is the third legislative proposal in succession on the application of the Århus Convention, this time to the Community institutions, and Mrs Korhola has made a valuable contribution."
"This regulation has been proposed in parallel to the decision to ratify the Århus Convention, which contains obligations not only for the public authorities in the Member States, but also for the Community institutions."
"Consequently, the provisions on this matter already in existence needed to be supplemented."
"That is why the proposal covers all three parts of the Convention, namely access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice."
"The Community became a contracting party to the Convention in May 2005, just before the second conference of the parties in Almaty."
"At that time, the first reading of the regulation had already taken place and political agreement had been achieved at Council level in view of the common position."
"The common position improves and completes the initial Commission proposal from numerous points of view."
"It also incorporates, either literally or materially, many of the amendments which the European Parliament formulated at first reading."
"To be specific, as far as access to environmental information is concerned, a new Article 6 is proposed which refers to the application of the exemptions relating to access to environmental information, as proposed in the European Parliament's amendment."
"The common position also incorporates elements of the European Parliament's amendments relating to more detailed requirements for public participation in the preliminary preparation of plans and programmes relating to the environment."
"As regards access to justice, the Council simplified the criteria and the procedures on the basis of which non-governmental organisations can file a request for an internal review of deeds of Community institutions."
"It is worth noting that the organisations in question no longer need to act at Community level in order to exercise this right."
"The Commission is in a position to accept the changes in question, given that the current wording retains the obligation of the organisations in question to have environmental protection at Community level as their basic objective."
"The Commission was also able to accept changes to the provisions which refer to the outcome of the internal review and the facility for non-governmental organisations to take recourse to the Court of Justice."
"The Council effected the changes in question in a bid to avoid a text which might clash with the rules of the Convention concerning the right of access of individuals and groups of individuals."
"The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, endorses the Council's intention in this case, especially given that the common position is in keeping with the Århus Convention, which allows the contracting parties to adopt criteria for public access to justice."
"I hope that agreement will soon be reached on this specific proposal."
"We have already come a long way from the overall application of the Århus Convention and the adoption of this regulation will prove just how much we wish to apply it to the Community institutions."
". Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with Mrs Korhola;"
"I really cannot agree with Amendments 22, 23 and 25."
"I believe that the Århus Convention, which is already being transposed in some countries, such as Spain, is clearly a victory for the possibility of transparency, training and so forth."
"Nevertheless, I am extremely worried that positions that move away from the common sense demonstrated by the Council and from the Commission's position intend to give non-governmental organisations excessive legal capacity, in my view, as Mrs Korhola has said."
"I believe that democracy must be symmetrical."
"It is not logical that non-governmental organisations should have more rights than local councils in this field."
"Neither do I believe that regions can have a particular capacity which we here would give them."
"Furthermore, there is a principle in law, that of direct interest, which has been the subject of much debate in legal history and which is normally applied to the family or to certain problems that occur in the territory in question."
"Nevertheless, I believe that applying direct interest to any NGO in Europe would take us into the realm of infinite law, and we would have no idea where that would end."
"I believe that this may create a huge number of problems, above all because, as we know, sustainable development requires knowledge of the direct resource, because not every case is the same."
"The main principle, which we have raised here many times, is that the concept of sustainable development is integral, it must relate to a specific place, and in one place certain things can be done for economic and social reasons which cannot be done in another place."
"The idea, therefore, that certain NGOs, often not located in the relevant place, can demand this right by virtue of their interest in the environment, seems to me to be excessive."
"I therefore agree with the Council’s position."
". Mr President, I would like firstly to point out that this report by Parliament, which must facilitate the work of adapting to the Århus Convention, is a necessary and appropriate instrument."
"I therefore acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur and the other Members to apply this Convention to the mechanisms currently in place in the Member States and the Community institutions with a view to guaranteeing the legitimate right to environmental information and justice."
"In this regard, we believe that better access to information and greater participation by the public in decision-making will make it possible to apply those decisions more effectively and will contribute to increasing awareness of environmental problems amongst the public."
"The Convention will have to enhance transparency, responsibility and good governance in such diverse areas of public action as energy, agriculture, transport and tourism, by recognising a series of rights aimed at guaranteeing the effective participation of the citizens in public decision-making processes."
"That information must provide sufficient knowledge to allow them to participate actively and consistently in the different administrative procedures."
"Furthermore, the right to promote the administrative or legal resources they consider appropriate must be recognised when it is judged that those rights have been violated by public administrations."
"With regard to the specific aspects of the report, I believe that in relation to access to justice for NGOs, the latter should not have excessively restrictive requirements, such as the requirement to work at international level and, above all, that of not having been registered for more than two years for the presentation of requests."
"I believe that in many cases that would be a serious injustice."
"Furthermore, with a view to ensuring that justice is universal, I believe that we should reject the idea of the European Investment Bank being able to deny access to environmental information, since the Århus Convention states that exceptions must be interpreted narrowly and the inclusion of the term ‘banking’ enlarges the notion of confidentiality."
"In fact, the directive on public access to environmental information does not lay down specific rules for banks."
"I would like the Commission to agree on these two specific issues because I believe them to be the most important ones."
"I hope that this Regulation will be applied as soon as possible, in order to guarantee access to justice on all environmental issues."
"Mr President, the application of the Arhus Convention to the European institutions constitutes a major step forward, because it helps – as is necessary – to make the process of drawing up European legislation transparent, so that the public has more of a say in the preparation of environmental plans and environmental programmes."
"This regulation enhances democracy in the environmental area."
"The provisions of Arhus with regard to access to information, participation in decision-making and judicial access for environmental issues will apply across the whole of the EU."
"From now on, not only the Member States, but also the Community institutions, will need to comply with these provisions."
"Accessing justice, as provided for in the Arhus Convention, entails that the public must have the option of bringing environmental decisions taken by the EU institutions before the European Court."
"At the moment, citizens with an environmental interest or environmental NGOs have no opportunity of raising any issues with the Court because they are rarely affected personally – the conditions included in the EC Treaty apply to access to justice, something that is often easier to demonstrate in the case of economic operators."
"It is, of course, important for NGOs to enjoy the same level of access to justice, although the way in which this has been fleshed out by the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – particularly in Amendments 22 and 25 – is liable to attract some criticism."
"To prevent many hundreds of NGOs from bringing minor objections before the court, amendments are used to prescribe strict conditions for NGOs who can make a request for internal review."
"Even with those conditions – that are now before us and that the rapporteur has presented to us separately – in place, there will be many NGOs who can submit requests of this kind."
"It is not the intention to bring every single environmental decision taken by the European institutions before the Court, for that generates legal uncertainty and will only increase the European Court’s heavy workload."
"On the other hand, at times when there is serious doubt as to a certain environmental decision, it must be possible to raise this with the relevant authorities."
"My group is divided over this issue."
"Whilst some are great fans of Amendments 22 and 25, because they feel that these remove an imbalance, that the Arhus Convention is thus better implemented and that this is in line with the EC Treaty, others think the reverse, namely that these create inequality because environmental NGOs would be given a privileged position and that moreover, the Convention would be at least at loggerheads with the Treaty."
"I can only regret that there is no room for a middle way, as a result of which NGOs would have the opportunity of having their say at times when it is really necessary, without there being the risk of numerous insignificant objections being lodged."
"In fact, I now believe that it would be preferable if the Convention were to simply give greater opportunities for access to justice, which is, in fact, what the late Constitutional Treaty would have done had it not now been abandoned."
"Mr President, if the Århus Convention is to work as intended in the EU, it is crucial that the rules also guarantee certain environmental organisations’ access to testing by the courts."
"The Council’s common position does not, however, give the NGOs such access."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has therefore, quite correctly, supported the Commission’s original proposal and re-introduced this element."
"I regret that many members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are attempting to prevent the Århus Convention from being fairly implemented."
"Have they learned nothing from the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes?"
"If we are to increase understanding of, and support for, the EU project, grass-roots participation and control are hugely important."
"Take a current example."
"The European Parliament has decided to take proceedings against the Commission in the case of the brominated flame retardant BDE, on which the Commission has lifted the ban without having been given the right to do so by the legislator."
"Moreover, the Danish Government has followed suit by taking similar legal proceedings."
"The environmental organisations too need, however, to be able to take action when EU laws are broken."
"Now, the chemicals industry has been at its tricks again, keeping the citizens at bay."
"Individual citizens cannot have decisions in the environmental sphere tested because there is no individual interest."
"However, NGOs take care of public interests within the environmental and health spheres, so they should have access, in the EU too, to testing by the courts."
"What we have here, of course, is a case of David and Goliath."
"The environmental organisations take care of public interests, while the chemicals industry, with huge sums of money behind it, can force decisions through the EU system."
"We saw this with REACH."
"Without transparency and grass-roots access to the Court of Justice, the EU is developing into an apology for a democracy."
"Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports all the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to this regulation on the EU’s application of the Århus Convention."
"Two points are of special importance to us."
"Firstly, it is crucial that the decision be comprehensive in scope so that projects funded by the European Union are also covered by the regulations."
"The European Investment Bank too needs to be covered by the rules."
"Much criticism has been directed over the years at the EIB’s handling of environmental issues, its failure to take due account of the environment and its considerable lack of transparency."
"Secondly, we want environmental organisations to be given a genuine right to take legal proceedings when the environmental rules are not observed."
"We are therefore opposed to any restriction on this right, for example that proposed by the rapporteur in Amendments 28 to 30."
"Such a restriction would in practice mean that many of the most important national environmental movements would not have the opportunity to take legal proceedings, and that is unacceptable to us."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the present proposal for a regulation is to create greater transparency by means of increased public participation in the drafting of legislative texts, something which I very much welcome."
"We MEPs are dependent on receiving information from associations, organisations, non-governmental organisations and interested citizens, and reflect these in our legislative procedures."
"Only by incorporating the individual interests of the relevant groups in compromise legislative texts can we produce good legislation."
"That being the case, the public naturally needs access to information, something which – I should like to emphasise – is also extremely important, and there needs to be more of it."
"It surprises me, of course, that the Commission occasionally sends information to NGOs and associations rather than to the Members of the European Parliament;"
"I have discovered – for example, in connection with REACH – that many organisations and associations have been getting such information before it reaches our pigeonholes."
"That does not worry me, but what does worry me is the shape and form of the amendments to the present regulation."
"Stipulating that NGOs – which, incidentally, safeguard sectoral interests – may take legal action to see their views incorporated into legislative texts actually presupposes considerable mistrust in Parliament."
"As a rule, all European institutions seem to be regarded with general suspicion."
"Permit me to allude to my previous occupation as a veterinary surgeon when I say that we are castrating ourselves and depriving ourselves of power here."
"We are calling ourselves into question and, in my opinion, we cannot allow this to happen."
"It would be a grave error to endorse this proposal; we should firmly oppose it."
"I am not implying that any NGO intends to exert a harmful influence on social developments, but I do request that it not be implied that Parliament is not up to its job."
"I wholeheartedly support the Council’s views on the second reading; everything else goes distinctly too far."
"That includes the proceedings for infringement of Community law, where intervention in ongoing proceedings is permitted: this does not benefit the public, either."
"– Mr President, there is a particular need for the full and integrated application of the Convention in all the Member States."
"Its importance is decisive for further progress with environmental policy."
"We need to place particular emphasis on the need for the integrated provision of electronically digitised information, as this will provide the basis for the proper implementation of public participation in all environmental control and awareness-raising procedures."
"This will quickly smooth out the problems of bureaucracy which have to date been the basic brake on all similar endeavours."
"Finally, it is most important that there should be a direct and intense response from the public sector to all aspects of the report and the proposed actions, because in numerous states the public sector is also the provider of most of the environmental information."
"The Korhola report, which carefully and cautiously addresses the complicated points of such a venture must, as far as non-governmental organisations are concerned, be open to these questions and not only strict or unfair towards them."
"To close, I believe that an important job has been done and I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her efforts."
"From its inception the Århus Convention was praised as one of the most ambitious achievements of democracy in the area of the protection of the human environment, not merely because it lays down a human right of the new generation, namely the right of people to a healthy and high-quality environment, but also because of the logical assumption that involving citizens would raise the level of environmental protection, firstly through the adoption of measures and then through the implementation of those measures."
"This assumption needs to be taken further, however."
"Rules need to be established whereby the authorities are required to share environmental information with citizens, and they in turn must be able in extreme cases to demand that standards are enforced in the courts."
"We are talking about the implemented regulations of an environmentally-protective participatory democracy."
"In view of the fact that the European Union is drafting a White Paper with which it will endeavour to bridge the information gap separating it from its citizens, the content of the regulation under discussion is highly topical in the broader sense of relations with citizens."
"On the basis of the Århus Convention, in pursuit of an improved implementation of environmental protection legislation, the Commission envisaged certain non-governmental organisations having the right of access to the highest judicial instance, the European Court."
"The logical conclusion to be drawn with regard to this regulation is that non-governmental organisations play an important role in the protection of the environment."
"Yet the common position of the Council with regards to this area reveals a different interpretation of the Convention."
"It is based on fear of an improper use of the European Court, although this is not a logical interpretation."
"Half-measures in the efforts to implement environmental protection legislation and the removal of certain areas of work of the European institutions from democratic control would send the wrong political signal to Member States."
"It is possible that this would lead to a reduction rather than an increase in their responsibility in the implementation of environmental legislation."
"– Mr President, I would ask the Commissioner to conclude this debate with a few explanations."
"I believe that there is a fundamental flaw in this evening’s debate."
"The common position that is the subject of Mrs Korhola’s report contains no rules whatsoever on access to justice."
"The Commissioner has presented rules for access to the first part of the Århus Convention: access to information, but, as things stand, there is no treatment whatsoever of the third pillar of this Convention."
"I believe that there is some confusion in this regard."
"In my view, the opportunity to request an internal review, for which provision is made in the common position, should not be confused with access to justice."
"I would ask the Commissioner to clarify this point."
"I should like to add, however, that I consider it absolutely indispensable that non-governmental organisations be given access to justice in the environmental field at European level, so that, if necessary, the practical transposition of European legislation can be examined on site."
"Experience with the right of collective action in Germany has been very positive: there has not been an abundance of actions, and actions have been purposeful, with most of those brought by associations there ending in success."
"Mr President, the Århus Convention, signed by all 25 Member States, gives the public rights in the three areas of accessing environmental information, participating in environmental decision-making and accessing justice in environmental matters."
"This regulation before us has the objective of applying these rights against the EU institutions: Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the ECJ, the European Investment Bank, ."
"It is essential that individuals who are directly affected by breaches of environmental law have a means of redress, whether through an appeal body, the Ombudsman or, if necessary, through the courts."
"This does not mean, however, drafting a lawyers’ charter, which is what we are in danger of doing."
"While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups, which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watchdogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf, I would urge caution in allowing any self-legitimising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clog up an already overburdened justice system."
"While I am opposed to Amendments 2, 7 and 12, my biggest problem is with Amendment 26, which proposes that all NGOs, regardless of the legitimacy of their interests or the transparency of their constitutions, should be granted the right of unfettered instigation of court proceedings against Community institutions for their administrative acts or omissions, such as in enforcing the implementation of EU environmental law."
"In some countries, an NGO can be formed with a membership of less than five people."
"Such a body is not democratically accountable by any definition, but these amendments would allow them to challenge the Commission without providing evidence of how or by whom they are funded or for what purpose."
"It is a long-established principle of EU law – built up over many years of case law and underpinned by Article 230(4) of the EC Treaty – that citizens need to have a direct and individual concern in order to have a standing in the ECJ."
"Bypassing the Treaty with secondary legislation such as the amendments to this regulation makes a mockery of the idea that it is the victim of infringements of the law rather than interested observers – whose motivation and support base may not always be clear – who should be able to seek a remedy."
"If the European Parliament wishes to extend the internal or judicial review process, it should do so through an amendment to the Treaty in the first instance."
"As a politician, democratically accountable to my electorate, I am also not prepared to delegate my responsibility to unelected, unaccountable bodies."
"Mr President, the role of the Århus Convention is to promote public control on environmental issues."
"In this way it helps to make our societies more environmentally conscious and encourages NGOs to be active in environmental policy."
"The most important part of the Convention is public participation in the decision-making process."
"Member States were not brave enough to accept the entire concept of the Convention."
"However, that is the way forward."
"We politicians will be judged by our voters on the state of the environment and on a sustainable future, and not on empty promises."
"I have tabled an amendment along with other colleagues, which is the 23rd one on this matter."
"Some Members of this House oppose it."
"Nevertheless, the amendment is only a retabling of the Commission’s original words."
"It says that if an internal review concludes that there is a contradiction with environmental law, then the body concerned should take a decision to eliminate the problem."
"I think that is quite obvious."
"If we realise there is an environmental problem and we do not do anything about it, then the whole process is senseless."
"By the way, all Member States – and I mean all – signed the original Convention, which contains this idea."
"The PSE Group is working in general, and in this particular case, for a clean environment and for public participation in the decision-making process."
"That is why we support this report in the form that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation must indeed ensure that all Community institutions apply the provisions of the Århus Convention, an agreement that intends to increase public involvement in environmental concerns."
"Whatever some Members may claim, it is certainly not the intention to go beyond what is needed to enable the Community to be a party to the Århus Convention. I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has firmed up the Council’s common position."
"I am therefore completely behind the report and hope that it will be adopted in its entirety without the need for any amendments."
"Given the increasing importance of Community environmental policy, the challenge for the regulation to comply with all provisions of the Århus Convention is significant, not least in terms of retaining some credibility in the eyes of the Member States and at international level."
"In other words, the same obligations and rights should exist at EU level as they do at Member State level."
"That certainly applies to the establishment of possible grounds for refusal of environmental information."
"The main point of discussion has already been mentioned here, namely the transposal of the third pillar of the Convention, the one on access to justice."
"Clearly, the general interest of the environment cannot only be upheld by people who have a direct or personal interest, as the Convention provides."
"For that reason, the Commission wanted to restrict access to justice to environmental organisations that meet certain conditions."
"The wish to remove anything or add additional conditions is not only unacceptable but also contravenes the Århus Convention."
"I therefore sincerely hope that those Members who endorse open and transparent environmental policy in the EU will also approve the present report as it currently stands."
". I would like to thank the speakers this evening for their very important speeches."
"I shall make an appraisal of the basic amendments and, at the same time, reply to the main issues raised today."
"As far as access to environmental information is concerned, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 14 or 15, which aim to apply the regime of exceptions to the provisions of the 2003-2004 directive to access to environmental information and requests for information addressed to Community institutions."
"The proposed regulation is being extended so that existing Community legislation on access to documents, as provided for in Regulation No 1049/2001, covers all Community institutions."
"The specific amendments by the European Parliament could bring about, as a corollary, the creation of two, partially overlapping regimes of access to documents, which would not help transparency and legal clarity."
"The new Article 6 of the common position already covers the exceptions in question and access to environmental information; these exceptions must be expressly clarified anyway in accordance with the requirements of the Århus Convention."
"Amendments 7 and 12, which aim to include in the definition of environmental information the degree of progress of access procedures cannot be accepted."
"There is no such provision in the Århus Convention."
"Similarly, access procedures are not environmental information per se."
"Nonetheless, it should be noted that it is the Commission's practice to publish on its website information relating to access procedures for all policy sectors."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 16 making provision for a deadline of 15 working days for persons applying for access to be informed, if the Community institution does not have the information requested, and to be referred to the public authority which appears to have the information in question."
"As far as public participation is concerned, the Commission cannot accept its extension to policies, as called for in Amendment 5 and, partially, in Amendments 19 and 20."
"The Århus Convention encourages public participation in the preliminary preparation of policies within the framework of a best effort clause."
"This is a broad meaning and no such requirement is contained in the legislation addressed to Member States."
"Nonetheless, it should be noted that the practice applied today, at Community level, makes provision for public consultation with the interested parties during the drafting of Community policies."
"In addition, the definition of environmental plans and programmes is broad and covers programmes of a strategic nature."
"The Commission cannot accept there is a need to call for public participation for plans and programmes funded by Community institutions, as provided for in Amendment 8."
"The Århus Convention refers to public participation for plans and programmes prepared by public authorities."
"In addition, permission for infrastructure works with a significant environmental impact is granted at the level of the Member State, where public participation is provided for."
"The Commission is able to accept in part Amendment 19, as regards the extension to the deadline for submitting comments within the framework of written consultations from 4 to 8 weeks."
"It can also accept Amendment 20 adding the obligation of the Community institution to take account of the results of public participation."
"This specific obligation derives from the Århus Convention and corresponds to the Commission's current administrative practice."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 23 extending the circle of organisations with the right to request an internal review from non-governmental organisations with the basic objective of protecting the environment to those which also or alternatively promote sustainable development."
"This specific criterion would be very difficult to define and might cover a broad range of organisations for which there would be no justification in recognising, for environmental purposes, the right of access to such a review procedure."
"The recognition of a special regime for environmental non-governmental organisations, the basic object of which is to defend environmental interests, is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Århus Convention."
"Similarly, as regards the criteria for legalising non-governmental organisations, the Commission cannot accept the final amendment proposed by the rapporteur, namely that non-governmental organisations should develop activities in more than one Member State."
"Even though it is true that the initial Commission proposal talked of activities at Community level, it became clear during discussions prior to the common position that such a decision would cause unjustified barriers to the right of access to justice."
"The Commission is satisfied with the present provision in the common position, which talks of the Community dimension of the environmental objective which the non-governmental organisation should promote within the Community."
"Finally, Amendments 22, 24 and 25 refer to the outcome of the internal review of administrative acts adopted by the Community institutions in accordance with Article 10 and how they relate to the provisions on access to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 12."
"For the reasons I have already mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the Commission cannot accept them because they would exceed provisions governing the legalisation of litigants under the Convention."
"The Commission can accept in principle Amendments 26 and 27 concerning adaptation to the rules of procedure and the date of entry into force of the regulation."
"I shall send the European Parliament Secretariat a full list of the Commission's views on the amendments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0001/2006) by Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from the extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC (PE-CONS 3665/2005 – C6-0405/2005 – 2003/0107(COD))."
"Mr President, there is a very tangible and practical background to this directive on which we are now to take a decision."
"It is the major disasters that occurred a few years ago, involving collapsing mine embankments, above all in Romania and Spain."
"They were environmental disasters that had huge consequences for the surrounding environment and that also poisoned the water systems."
"In addition, there are our constant environmental problems in which waste from existing and old plant spreads heavy metals and other poisons in our immediate environment."
"This means that a special directive is needed to regulate waste from the mining industry and other extractive industries."
"When we look at the proposal put forward by the Commission a few years ago and at the proposal on which we are to take a decision tomorrow, there are significant differences."
"Parliament has definitely helped make this directive better and more forceful."
"A host of Parliament’s amendments were adopted as early as at first reading, and quite a few have been added at this reading."
"I should like to highlight a number of specific parts of this report as being particularly important."
"Firstly, rules on embankment safety have been devised to prevent this type of disaster from occurring in the future."
"The method involving high concentrations of cyanide, used in Romania, is also banned by this directive."
"There will be clear rules on authorisation and on how this is to take place, and it will be possible to see which environmental problems can be remedied."
"An absolute obligation is also laid down to respect the Water Directive, whereby no water status deterioration may be caused."
"There are also rules to the effect that the site at which the mining takes place must be rehabilitated."
"This directive is to put an end to the era in which waste and damaged sites were left behind."
"So that it might do this, a financial guarantee is introduced for which companies must earmark resources for the purpose of rehabilitating the sites at which they have engaged in mining."
"When it comes to the new Member States, above all Romania but also Bulgaria, we reached a stage during the conciliation when these countries produced declarations in which they undertook not to seek exemptions but instead to respect all the rules of the directive."
"This is important, especially because Romania has significant problems in this area."
"When it comes to historical waste, the Member States are required to compile an inventory whereby they have to investigate where there may be historic waste causing environmental problems."
"Overall, there will be a significant improvement in the environmental situation in the EU."
"The arguments against these measures have mainly been financial in the sense that the measures would cost companies money."
"It is important to realise, however, that the environmental costs of rehabilitating the land would be part of companies’ production costs and that this is only right."
"Not including them in production costs would benefit the less than serious players."
"A directive such as this favours serious mining companies that accept responsibility for their environmental policy."
"This directive will also make it easier to produce new environmental technology, enabling the historical waste to be dealt with, and it will provide European industry with an opportunity in this sphere."
"Last but not least – and most important of all – is the fact that it will benefit the environment and the health of those who live in the areas concerned."
"The directive is not, of course, perfect. Directives are very rarely perfect."
"There are a few aspects of it I should like to have seen given more weight."
"The rules governing waste not classified as dangerous are weaker than they should be."
"This is due to the Council, which made changes for the worse to the directive at first reading."
"I did not obtain the decision I should have liked from Parliament that would have enabled these changes to be negotiated away."
"When it comes to waste plants, the definition is too weak and too generous towards the industry, and this is in danger of creating certain loopholes."
"Where historic waste is concerned, there are no clear requirements to take measures for dealing with this."
"It is important to realise, however, that under the EU’s other environmental legislation, above all the Framework Water Directive, there is an absolute obligation to deal with those cases in which historic waste is seen to lead to water status deterioration."
"This means that the directive as a whole is still sound."
"We can be satisfied with the work we have done during the last few years."
"Finally, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank those with whom I have worked, including the shadow rapporteurs for the various groups whose constructive cooperation I have enjoyed. I should like to thank the officials of the European Commission who, this time, have been excellent to collaborate with, together with the Presidency, which conducted a very constructive conciliation."
"It has been a simple matter to cooperate with them and to find practical solutions to the various problems we faced."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament teams which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 6 December 2005."
"I extend my particular thanks to Vice-President Roth-Behrendt and to rapporteur Jonas Sjöstedt, whom I also congratulate on the result."
"The discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and I believe that Parliament achieved concessions on the vitally important issues of financial guarantees, excavation sites, transitional provisions and acceding countries and on a number of other important points."
"The Commission supports the conciliation text with particular satisfaction and I hope that Parliament will ratify the positive result achieved by its negotiating team."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have travelled a long road, with many ground-breaking discussions along the way, and today we are meeting for the finale, so to speak."
"There are only a few of us left now, this being the third reading."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt – our ‘pacesetter’ – who, with expert knowledge and a great deal of energy, managed to maintain the momentum of the negotiations all the way to the Conciliation Committee."
"Mr Sjöstedt succeeded in never losing sight of the goal, whilst clearly recognising when the time had come for closure and ultimately also for final compromises."
"I am much obliged to him for this."
"The directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is, therefore, a success for the environment, for enterprises in the mining industry, and thus also for human beings."
"Environmentally sustainable activity does not just consist in doing nothing and making unspoilt nature the measure of all things, so to speak."
"Instead, we human beings have been set the – even biblical – task of subduing the earth."
"Europe is not characterised by primeval forest and unspoilt landscapes, but rather is known worldwide for its cultivated landscapes, developed over centuries."
"These should be used by people for people according to the principle of sustainability."
"Yet all intervention in nature also has concomitant effects; it would not be correct to say that mining has no impact on nature and the environment."
"Therefore, when assessing all intervention, return must be weighed up against expenditure, benefit against burden."
"As a result of the positive developments, technical possibilities and heightened environmental sensitivity of today, the yardsticks we use now are different from those we used just 50 years ago."
"We must put these achievements to good use in the interests of human safety and of preserving the health of our environment."
"We must also continue to stay on the ball at all times so that we can make use of the new possibilities that will undoubtedly present themselves in 5, 10 or even 20 years’ time."
"It was the serious accidents in the metal ore mining sector in Spain and Romania in the last 10 years that induced Parliament to call for this directive."
"Now that we have it, I think that we are on the right track towards achieving something positive for the environment and for human beings."
". Mr President, some five years ago the cyanide pollution of the River Tisza caused by a gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania, showed us Hungarians how dangerous mining waste can be."
"At that time my country was not a member of the European Union."
"Still the Commission and the European Parliament understood the problem and initiated a directive on the management of such waste."
"Mr Sjöstedt went to the site of the pollution, studied the facts, heard all the witnesses and experts, and then drew up an excellent report."
"That is what I call a good and responsible job of a politician."
"His report is based on real facts, on real dangers, and provides us with real solutions."
"Thank you, Mr Sjöstedt."
"The PSE Group supported the report from the beginning."
"At second reading, together with other colleagues, I tabled many amendments for stricter regulation."
"Most of them were accepted by the rapporteur and later by the Conciliation Committee."
"On water pollution issues, we tried to ensure compliance with other Community obligations, most of which were imposed under the Water Framework Directive."
"The compromise reached by conciliation is not ideal, but it is acceptable."
"The financial guarantees must be sufficient to cover the cost of the rehabilitation of the land affected by the waste facility."
"This is a success for us."
"We are also satisfied with clarification of the closure operation."
"However, we lost an important battle."
"We Socialist MEPs wanted the discharge of waste to any receiving body of water to be authorised before the operation."
"For me, prevention is the most environmentally friendly solution."
"Perhaps later everybody will understand this principle, not only in this House, but in the whole of Europe."
"In general we obtained a good directive."
"Member States, would-be Member States and third countries should respect the new regulatory framework."
"We have to monitor the strict implementation of this directive."
"Mr President, the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from various extractive industry sites is a key document in terms of environmental and health protection."
"It is also of major significance for the extractive industries, which will have to bear the cost of implementing it, and it will have a major impact in that it will allow an agreement to be reached and the interests of all parties to be reconciled."
"This directive is worthy of our approval."
"Nevertheless, like every document it will be subject to changing economic conditions, and we will only discover how effective it is once it has been implemented in practice."
"Future revisions will provide us with an opportunity to make certain amendments to it."
"For example, mining waste frequently contains mineral components that should be reclaimed in order to limit the need for further excavations."
"Mr President, the European Union and its Parliament are frequently criticised by many, for introducing laws that are unnecessary or at least not absolutely necessary."
"No one will say this about the Directive tabled before us."
"On the contrary, we succeeded in creating an internationally groundbreaking, milestone regulation."
"This regulation was created in the aftermath of the mining disaster that took place in 2000 in Baia Mare, Romania, to make sure that the environment and nature do not suffer such pollution ever again."
"When disaster strikes, all we can do is to limit and mitigate damages and pay compensation, but, as we have seen in this case, with little success."
"Natural environment was destroyed, and so far there have been no judgments passed in any of the damage compensation trials, which have almost stalled."
"Therefore the directive tabled before us emphasises prevention, which is always a key issue in making our future safe and avoiding environmental disasters caused by human negligence."
"However, the Directive does not only regulate future mines and their waste material, but also the old, abandoned mines and those that are still operating, often in a deplorable technical condition."
"As a member of Parliament’s Conciliation Committee, I would like to say a particular thank you for the work of Mr Sjöstedt, Mr Roth-Behrendt and Mr Florenz who took part in the trialogue."
"On behalf of Hungary, I would also like to thank them for identifying with my concern and proposal, as a result of which we achieved that the acceding Romania and Bulgaria are not applying for transitional exemption from the implementation of the Directive, as demonstrated in their attached statement."
"The Eastern Carpathians hold many treasures, and their extraction constitutes an important economic foundation of regional development."
"However, extraction should only be performed in a sustainable manner, taking into account the interests of the environment and nature to the highest extent."
"This is the subject matter of this directive, and this is what it facilitates."
"I am delighted that I had the privilege to participate in the creation of this regulation, which is so important for our common future."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I am obliged to Mr Sjöstedt, who negotiated very prudently on behalf of Parliament, and also to the Commission, which lent us its support in our endeavours to reach a compromise in the Council."
"Let me echo my colleague Mr Olajos, who rightly emphasised that, with this legislative proposal, we have really hit upon an issue that directly affects the safety of the public and of the environment, and thus we are by no means creating superfluous European regulations that, as it were, only serve to burden the economy."
"In this case, too, of course, a compromise does mean that the regulation gives rise to certain costs, but I believe that these costs are justified and can certainly be borne by industry, since assets as important as human health are at stake."
"A particularly important achievement of the compromise is that financial guarantees are now required to cover the potential cost arising from land affected by a waste facility."
"Arrangements such as these have to be made in advance, of course, as accidents very often result in mine operators declaring bankruptcy."
"This means that the funds necessary to at least institute countervailing measures are lacking, and the general public is left to bear the consequences again."
"Various aspects of waste management have also been specified much more precisely, particularly for the eventuality that the operator puts extractive waste into excavation voids during rehabilitation of the site."
"This kind of rehabilitation requires strict compliance with the legal provisions so as to preclude any soil or water pollution."
"In addition, operators have to take monitoring, maintenance and remedial measures: for example, they are obliged to collect or treat contaminated water or leachate."
"It is important that the acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, too, make statements pledging to respect the new provisions – let us not forget Baia Mare."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0415/2005) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality and repealing Directive 76/160/EEC (03659/2005 – C6-0373/2005 – 2002/0254(COD))."
". Mr President, in the past few days and in fact, in general, during the discussion of this directive, the question of whether it is really necessary to prescribe standards for bathing water at European level has been put to me on a regular basis."
"Is this not a classic example of a matter that could be dealt with at Member State level? I am aware of the fact that Members belonging to the Dutch Social Democrats, who are sadly not here at the moment, even referred to it in a report as a disgraceful directive for swimming pool water."
"Well, it is not a directive for swimming pools, let alone a directive for bath water. It deals, of course, with coastal waters and lakes."
"The question has been raised as to whether European action in this field adds any value."
"Parliament did not have any doubts about this when the House debated this very point at first reading."
"What is more important though, is that the Member States, and especially the Member States, felt that a directive was needed."
"If that is what they want, that is what they should get, but I do believe that it should be a serious directive rather than one that allows for more exceptions than anything else."
"In any event, after more than 12 years of discussion, a compromise has been struck – albeit with difficulty – between the Council and Parliament, which I assume will be translated into legislation tomorrow."
"The new directive provides for cleaner bathing water along beaches and lakes in Europe, better information for bathers and less red tape for local authorities."
"Across the whole of the European Union, more than 80% of bathing water locations already meet the stricter standards and in a number of Member States, even more than 90% of the swimming locations comply with them."
"At present, some 12% of bathers annually suffer from nausea, from stomach infections, rashes, tightness of the chest or eye or ear infections."
"The effect of the new directive is to tighten up health standards, as a result of which only 8% of bathers are expected to contract an illness."
"From 2015, bathers will also be informed of the current bathing water quality at their bathing locations by means of symbols that will be identical across Europe."
"At the moment, bathers can only access the quality that pertains to the previous year with some difficulty and only on the Internet."
"What appeals to me is that before long, I will be able to see for myself what the quality of the water is on the spot, because I do not know about you, but I only take my laptop to the beach on very rare occasions."
"Instead of 19 parameters, Member States will only need to measure 2 parameters, and that is an example of how the red tape will be cut when water is measured."
"For a long time, the European Parliament and the governments were at loggerheads over the question of how strict the standards should be and how high the associated costs for the Member States."
"We have reached a compromise that is satisfactory for all parties, and I think that in this respect, whilst the British Presidency deserves a compliment, it is the Commission – and you, Commissioner, in particular – who have been instrumental in bringing this compromise about."
"I should also like to thank many of the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in this respect."
"Bathing water will not only be cleaner, it will be cleaner, the costs will be manageable and deregulation is underway."
"In conclusion, I am interested to hear what comments the Commission will have to make on the article that is soon to appear in the scientific magazine ‘Environmental Health Perspectives’, written by Mr Albrecht Wiedenmann and which carries the rather complex English title ‘Concentration responsive effects with no observed adverse effect levels’, abbreviated to NOAELS."
"I cannot quite describe the term myself, but I am sure that you can."
"I am at any rate interested to see if the Commission will also use this study in its 2008 assessment report, because it contains quite a few terse comments about the directive as we are about to adopt it."
"I would add, though, time for incorporating it is rapidly running out."
"I will be delighted when the directive will actually be adopted tomorrow."
"I think it is a success for all of us, including myself, even though I am not exactly a keen swimmer."
"I only go in if I have no other choice."
"After 2015, I will be at least happier to take a dip."
"I hope, Commissioner, that I will be able to do so without any concerns in your Member State too."
"Mr President, I love the sea and swimming and I am therefore interested for personal reasons in the seas and waters of Europe being as clean as possible."
"I should like to thank the delegation of the European Parliament which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 12 October 2005, and vice-president Mr Trakatellis and the rapporteur Mr Maaten in particular, and to congratulate them on their outstanding work and on the result achieved."
"Discussions in the Conciliation Committee were complicated."
"However, at least, as far as the vital question of introducing ambitious standards for the classification category of adequate quality is concerned, I consider that Parliament achieved noteworthy results and a significant improvement in comparison with the Council's original position."
"The quality standards may not ultimately be as strict as certain would have wished – and indeed the minimum quality standards are not as strict as those which the Commission had originally proposed."
"Nonetheless, they were strengthened considerably during discussions in the Conciliation Committee, with the result that the final text is a considerable improvement over the provisions which apply today and which date from the time when the directive was issued in 1975 and, as such, have been overtaken by modern scientific data."
"The Commission supports the conciliation text with particular satisfaction and, as such, I would like to hope that Parliament will ratify the positive result achieved by its negotiating team."
"Thus, this evening, we are closing the debate on two very important directives, which no doubt will improve the environment and protect the health of European citizens."
". – Mr President, I am obliged to the rapporteur for the very good work he has done, and to the Commission for this proposal for a directive, in particular."
"To be frank, I was a little disappointed in the Commission when it gave its opinion on the Council common position."
"I should really have liked to see more support for a tougher, more sharply defined line on bathing water quality as, after all, we have considerably watered down the standards to which the Commissioner referred."
"With the support of the Commission, we could have put together a tougher directive, one that obliged Member States to introduce higher standards without the States being faced with the heavy spending that is so often talked about."
"Let us not forget that the main problem today as regards the pollution of bathing water is not localised pollution, but diffuse sources of pollution – agricultural sources in particular, of course."
"We could have achieved a substantial improvement on this issue with a relatively small amount of money."
"Yet we have reached a compromise, and one should stand by compromises; which is why I would appeal for the adoption of the proposal for a directive in Parliament tomorrow."
"We have, however, taken a step in the right direction."
"I am now pinning my hopes on 2008, when the Commission is due to review the directive and assess the situation prevailing by then."
"May I, then, anticipate this by asking the Commissioner, who is of course a keen swimmer, to make sure that his services carry out this assessment accordingly and perhaps after all raise the health standards to OECD levels, on which all States have in fact agreed, so that we do not find ourselves attempting to level down the health standards in this field."
"Bathing water undoubtedly has a strong ally in the Commissioner."
". Mr President, as a Hungarian Member of the Socialist Group I am satisfied with the outcome of conciliation on the Bathing Water Directive."
"We have had extensive debates both in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and later in the Conciliation Committee."
"It was not easy to make clear that we cannot apply the same criteria to inland and coastal waters and lakes – such as Lake Balaton in Hungary – as we apply to the Atlantic Ocean."
"That does not mean that we do not want to have strict rules as regards our inland waterways. However, lakes and oceans are obviously different."
"Landlocked countries such as Hungary and Austria should have a right to their own bathing water as well."
"The area around Hungary’s bathing lakes is subject to a ban on certain industrial and agricultural activities, and the sewage system covers almost 100% of households."
"We can improve many things, but we cannot turn a lake into an ocean."
"The present compromise is acceptable to us but means a lot of work for my country: some beaches will be closed and many others should be improved, but that is the cost of a clean and healthy environment."
"The compromise on a stricter version of the category ‘sufficient’ is to be welcomed."
"Public information on water quality at bathing sites is also very important."
"Indeed, on all beaches around Lake Balaton there are huge information signs written in Hungarian, English, German and Russian."
"Of course, we could add French, hoping that more tourists will come from France and other French-speaking countries."
"In my last speech, at second reading, I had a rather tough tone, due to the one-minute limit and the speed of a heavy debate."
"Now I should like to thank Mr Maaten for his report and readiness for constructive compromise."
"He did a good job."
"I hope, when I welcome him to Hungary, that he will be able to see how clean and sweet our Lake Balaton is."
". Mr President, hundreds of thousands of European citizens fall ill every year as a result of entering contaminated bathing waters."
"The diseases acquired in this way range widely in severity."
"Most are clinically benign to moderate, but some are serious and a few are fatal."
"As expected, children, the elderly and the immunosuppressed are the most vulnerable."
"It is thus imperative for the legislative bodies of the EU to be greatly concerned with the quality of bathing waters."
"They have indeed been working on this issue for many years, and one would expect the parameters used to monitor the quality of bathing water to be as strict as possible."
"Unfortunately this is not quite the case, and the reason for that is simple."
"It is that vast amounts of money are involved in the recreational and tourist industries associated with bathing waters, and if an area is pronounced to be of low bathing water quality then this has a serious economic impact on that region and that country."
"So the doctor’s opinion is no longer paramount, and ‘political compromises’ are the order of the day."
"Thus it is that after many years of talking, discussion and arguing – mainly about things that, if seen purely from a common sense point of view, are crystal clear – we end up in a conciliatory position in which we reduce the possible economic damage to countries with unhygienic bathing waters and increase the collateral risk of causing ill health among our citizens."
"Many colleagues will disagree strongly with what I say, but how else can it be explained when, for example, we have invented a distinction, as far as health risks are concerned, between inland and coastal bathing waters, and we are prepared to accept that inland waters can be almost twice as unhealthy as coastal waters yet still be of sufficient quality for bathing in."
"And how else can it be explained when we are prepared to label bathing waters as being of good quality when the risk of falling ill after swimming in them is of the order of 5% – i.e. 1 in 20 swimmers."
"Although I will support this directive, it does not go far enough to make our bathing waters really safe."
"It just makes them less hazardous."
"In conclusion, many thanks are due to everyone who has worked so hard to produce this directive, and especially to my colleague Mr Maaten – although he is not a swimmer he has still worked extremely hard – to the Commission and, of course, to the members of the Conciliation Committee."
". Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to say that, in spite of the good offices of the rapporteur, we believe the compromise in front of us is unacceptably weak."
"That is why my group will be abstaining in tomorrow’s vote."
"With that abstention, we intend to indicate the following."
"First, that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely unclear: the parameters have been so tampered with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely dubious."
"According to the peer-reviewed article about to appear in the scientific journal , which was mentioned by Mr Maaten, these values will bring no improvement for the quality of fresh water at all."
"Second, the real opportunity we had to extend this directive to cover recreational uses has been completely lost in the compromise."
"Third, after a strong fight for higher standards, Parliament’s delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category."
"Finally, the process by which this final agreement was reached was highly unsatisfactory, with last-minute technical proposals being introduced – verbally, not in writing – and with no time to properly study their implications."
"This is a disappointing result, but, in spite of that, I should like to thank everyone involved."
"I appreciate that it is not an easy business, but we will be abstaining tomorrow."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Maaten on the achieved result."
"It is partly thanks to his efforts that we will be able to adopt the review of the bathing water directive."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for its cooperation, because without the ambitious proposal it tabled, it would not have been possible to tighten up the criteria."
"I can inform you that I will agree to the result of the conciliation, even though I am not entirely satisfied with it."
"The category ‘acceptable’ that has been created is nothing but an excuse for covering up the fact that the standards have not been seriously firmed up."
"Moreover, the division that has been created between salt and fresh water is based on very limited information, and all of this means that the protection of bathers has improved far less than it might have done."
"I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the article that Mr Maaten mentioned, which will be published next month."
"In that article, the standards are set out as to what we need in order to really protect bathers."
"I hope, Commissioner Dimas, that you will be prepared to use this data in your next review, which I hope will not be as long in coming."
"Mr President, clean and safe bathing water is an obvious necessity, and an essential aid to a prosperous tourist industry."
"In my region of Northern Ireland there are many beautiful beaches, several of which proudly boast blue flag status."
"We have others yet to attain that accolade."
"I trust that this directive will assist in their achievement of that status."
"Equally relevant is compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive."
"This has been easier for countries eligible for cohesion funding, which makes available grants precisely for such projects."
"However, regions like mine, which have not and still do not qualify for cohesion funding, have greater difficulty in bringing their water treatment infrastructure up to acceptable standards."
"Extra national funding is, therefore, the only resort and has to be found."
"It is important to realise that the Bathing Water Directive should be considered in that wider context."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that the ten years of effort it has taken to draw up this document have been ten years of constant agreement and cooperation."
"This demonstrates how effective European Union policy can be, because, from the outset, local councils, local authorities and the States began to work to improve the condition of beaches and bathing waters, both inland and on the coast."
"I believe that it is important to stress – whenever I am teaching in the future, I shall explain this to my students – that this is a genuine example of the extent to which environmental policy is an added value for the economic system, for the wellbeing of the citizens and also in terms of increased land values."
"A beach with clean water is a welcoming and high-quality tourist area."
"If it is not clean, we know that the public will not go and will become increasingly conditioned."
"This is the result of a policy of cooperation and of a mutual effort."
"I therefore believe it to be satisfactory and furthermore the introduction of the category of ‘sufficient’ for water seems to me to be very realistic, because we must remain within the bounds of reality."
"Ensuring that waters are clean costs an enormous amount of money and takes an enormous amount of management effort, many sanctions for dumping along river banks and an integrated policy."
"We politicians must be aware that that effort comes from the citizens’ pockets and from a very significant scientific policy for controlling dumping, and that it is not easy to achieve all of this."
"I am therefore pleased and I would point out that this demonstrates the extent to which the quality of the environment adds value to the economic system, to industries and also to social welfare."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am much obliged to Mr Maaten for the good work he has done and for the negotiations conducted by the delegation from this House in the run-up to the third reading."
"I should like to confine myself to a few of the medical aspects of the directive."
"Bathing water is not free from germs, but low in germs."
"In principle, bathing water should be of drinking-water quality, as many bathers and swimmers do end up drinking it."
"In southern Germany, for example, we have one of the largest drinking-water reservoirs in the whole of Europe in the shape of Lake Constance."
"It must be mentioned, however, that even drinking water is not completely free from germs, but only low in germs, and that many germs – albeit of varying pathogenicity – are present throughout our daily lives."
"The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect, of course, but is an initial step in the right direction."
"After all, the limit values of 330 intestinal enterococchi for inland waters and 185 for coastal waters that have now been agreed – for the ‘sufficient’ category – represent a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 8%, and ‘health risk’ does not necessarily mean illness."
"The same goes for bacteria, with counts of 900 and 500 for the ‘sufficient’ and ‘excellent quality’ categories, respectively."
"In my view, standardised laboratory methods should be as much a matter of course as uniform sampling quality."
"The main concern as far as I am concerned should be that the public be informed sufficiently and in good time and that the ‘excellent quality’ designation be achieved in all our waters."
"A further aim – subject to strict scientific provisos at first – must be to control the viral load of the waters."
"This is progressively gaining in importance: there has been a rapid increase in the number of people falling ill in Europe as a result of enteroviruses and noroviruses."
"If only for this reason, we can expect a further revision of the directive in the not-too-distant future."
"I support the directive."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to follow on seamlessly from where Mr Ulmer left off. For my electoral district, which directly adjoins Lake Constance, the Bathing Water Directive represents a difficult balancing act between protection of consumers – bathers – on the one hand, and nature conservation and tourism on the other."
"The compromise we have reached on pollution requirements and quality standards in the ‘sufficient’ category, as Mr Ulmer put it, is a fair compromise between all the three interests that meet there."
"For this reason, I have found that this compromise has met with a great deal of acceptance back home, for which I am much obliged to all the MEPs concerned, the rapporteur included."
"It is also important to point out, however, that, by reducing the number of categories of polluter from 19 to just 2, we have found a solution that also serves the objectives of better lawmaking and less-bureaucratic regulation."
"This is a good example to demonstrate that we are all at pains to cut down the excessively numerous regulations that were commonplace in the past to the really important aspects, and for this, too, I am very much obliged to everyone involved."
"In the view of my group, the scope of the directive as a whole is very satisfactory."
"It is also to be welcomed that Parliament did not keep to its original intention of extending the scope of the Bathing Water Directive to other water-related leisure activities, too, and for this I am obliged to all the MEPs concerned."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0383/2005) by Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the environmental aspects of sustainable development (2005/2051(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank all those who helped improve my report, and I should like to say straightaway that I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"It is worth remembering that if all the inhabitants of Earth were to adopt the West’s lifestyle we would need several planets to meet their needs, and that the West, and primarily the EU, is duty-bound to carry out a root-and-branch rethink of its modes of production and consumption."
"This assessment is undisputed in the Chamber, cutting across traditional political boundaries, and has led the Commission to incorporate sustainable development into the Union’s priorities."
"The time has come for us to take stock of our actions in this area, and the results so far have been mixed."
"Progress has been made, but there have been setbacks or, at least, some shortcomings."
"Under pressure from public concern about the continued degradation of our environment, the EU has worked hard to warn the international community about ecology issues."
"Assessment of the situation has led to a large amount of rhetoric, but this has not always been followed up by action – far from it."
"The time has come for action to be taken, because there is an urgent need for a proactive policy aimed at reversing climate change, especially in light of the magnitude of recent natural disasters."
"I welcome the conclusions of the Montreal conference and the positive role played by EU representatives should not go unmentioned."
"Whilst the Union has adopted important legislation intended to reduce industrial waste and to make the cars we use more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, the significant increase in road traffic has meant that its efforts have come to nothing."
"This is a clear illustration of one of the paradoxes facing the EU: on the one hand, the free movement of goods and, on the other, the detrimental impact of the free movement of goods on the EU’s environmental objectives."
"There are two approaches to addressing this problem: firstly, to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly means of transport, with the Union providing financial support for large structural projects, and secondly, to incorporate the environmental cost of transport into the price of goods or to tax transport in relation to its environmental impact."
"There is an urgent need for proactive policy on water. In spite of the laws that have been adopted and the measures that have been taken, the state of water remains unsatisfactory."
"Do we need to point out once again that chemical pollution levels are still too high?"
"Do we not have a duty to hold certain farming methods responsible, as they are such a major consumer of water and various fertilisers?"
"The forthcoming reform of the CAP should take this into account and press ahead with the reform of grants and environmental cross-compliance."
"There is an urgent need for a proactive policy to maintain biodiversity."
"The list does not stop there."
"There is an urgent need for measures to be taken – such as the reports already adopted, the one by Mrs Ries and the one expected to be adopted on REACH – to offset the negative impact of the environment on health."
"There is an urgent need to take action on development aid, because inequality on Earth generates more and more conflict and the poorest countries are the first victims of natural disasters."
"Sustainable development provides part of the answer, because it represents a model of production and consumption that could and should be extended to all countries."
"The Union needs to be proactive and propose effective measures if it is to be up to the task of reversing the most worrying trends and of preventing irreversible situations from arising."
"To this end, it is essential that each sector be set quantified objectives and be subject to regular, strictly timetabled, evaluation."
"On a broader level, the political foundations of the EU must be further strengthened."
"This entails greater solidarity and more effective coordination; to encourage widespread dumping is incompatible with the requirements of sustainable development."
"It also entails a breakdown of the implementation of sustainable development at all international, national and local levels."
"Every legislative proposal would benefit from being viewed from the perspective of sustainable development."
"We have much to do in this area."
"Similarly, if we want to move sustainable development forward, we should no longer accept that the legal basis for draft laws on the environment or health should be the sacred cow of the free movement of goods."
"The Commission has a responsibility, but protecting the environment is not sufficiently high on its agenda."
"While it may have published five of the seven thematic strategies, these do not mask the weakness of the proposed review of the sustainable development strategy of the end of 2005."
"I must say I am concerned about the plans presented to us by the Commission."
"For example, when one reads in the thematic strategy on waste that there could be a return to national approaches whereby the Member States themselves would set their modes of managing waste, that, to my mind, would be a retrograde step."
"When the Commission announces that it wants to make fewer laws by refusing to propose laws that would indeed be burdensome for the Member States or for business in the short term, but that are necessary for the future, it is condemning the Union to political losses. It is all the more incomprehensible for the citizens that the Commission persists with certain legislative proposals that have either already been rejected by Parliament, such as the directives on port services, or been subject to fierce objections from the citizens, such as the directive on services in the internal market."
"I should like to conclude on a positive note. As much bad news for the Union as for our idea of development …"
". I should like to start by assuring you in connection with the thematic strategy on waste that, whenever we need to legislate in order to protect the environment and the health of European citizens, we shall legislate."
"Consequently, you need have no concerns on that account and the thematic strategy on waste truly is a step forward."
"We shall debate this when the time comes."
"I should like now, on behalf of the Commission, to welcome the contribution by the European Parliament to the review of the European Union sustainable development strategy."
"The exceptional Ferreira report contains many valuable proposals for the review, putting particular emphasis on the environmental aspects of sustainable development."
"Many of the proposals are reflected in the Commission communication."
"Following the approval of the Commission communication on the sustainable development strategy, the Commission wishes to cooperate more closely with Parliament and the Council and, on the basis of this communication, to get a European sustainable development strategy approved in June."
"The Ferreira report will be very useful in the consultations leading up to the European Council in June."
"Allow me to analyse further the Commission communication which we approved on 13 December and to add certain comments on the Ferreira report."
"The Commission communication is the third and final stage in a detailed review procedure which has lasted over 18 months and in which many interested agencies have participated from the whole of Europe."
"It is true that a fair amount of time was needed for the review but careful discussions were needed on such an important, broad-ranging strategy."
"The Commission presented three communications on the strategy in 2005: the guidelines in February, the draft statement of principles on sustainable development which the Council approved in June and the revised strategy with objectives and a more effective monitoring procedure on 13 December 2005."
"The Ferreira report focuses mainly on the environmental aspects of sustainable development."
"These aspects are indeed very important, given that non-sustainable environmental trends constitute some of the main threats in relation to our present and future prosperity."
"Nonetheless, it should be emphasised that the sustainable development strategy refers to all three aspects of sustainable development, namely the social, economic and environmental problems."
"In an effort to suppress all non-sustainable trends, it also aims to maximum possible synergisms between these three dimensions."
"The broad range of challenges covered includes climate change and clean energy, natural resources, transport, public health, social exclusion, demographics and immigration and global poverty."
"Sustainable development addresses issues which truly relate to citizens."
"They want prosperity but they also want a clean environment, good health, social protection and justice."
"The new strategy proposes a long-term vision for a sustainable Europe which goes well beyond 2010."
"Sustainable development is the primary objective of the Union."
"Both the Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy are predicated on implementing this objective in a fast-changing world."
"The Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy reinforce each other."
"The new strategy addresses some of the weaknesses in the previous strategy, such as unclear priorities and the lack of a clear monitoring mechanism and it confirms the main challenges, clarifies the objectives, responds to the existing, often fairly questionable objectives within the framework of the corresponding policies and defines a new and stricter monitoring mechanism."
"It pays particular attention to action and effective application in all policy sectors and the participation of all the interested agencies in the relevant procedure."
"We wish to go beyond words and to identify priorities for the next five years."
"The Commission wishes to cooperate with Parliament and the Council over the coming months, under the aegis of the Austrian Presidency, so that a common strategy can be agreed which will be broadly supported by all the institutions of the European Union and the Member States."
"A strategy agreed at European level is needed if we want to galvanise European society into making important changes and to put the European Union on a more sustainable course."
". – Mr President, this report by Mrs Ferreira is a very extensive, healthy, sound and also critical policy paper on the key fields of environmental and social policy, and I am obliged to her for it."
"Yet the more we in this House discuss this issue, all the stronger is my impression that, while we espouse quite wonderful principles at heart, the unfortunate fact is that the reality of practical implementation does not look so rosy."
"Most of us here probably agree, at heart, with the Commission’s proposal – that new market instruments are necessary, for example ecotaxes and the internalisation of all costs."
"Yet if we think back to the last sitting before Christmas, we recall that the majority in this House decided the opposite, under pressure from the Council and the transport lobby – here I am referring to the Eurovignette Directive – thus precluding any chance of recovering external costs, specifically costs to the environment and health."
"I am glad that the tone is reversed here."
"The many fine principles of environmental and social policy must also find expression in tangible measures."
"The Commission must set medium- and short-term objectives."
"Monitoring and evaluation activities are also necessary, as indicated in the conclusions in paragraph 64 of this motion for a resolution."
"A real change in our modes of production and consumption is needed: inaction on this will come at a high price and have serious consequences, especially for the growing number of poor people in our society."
"The EU has an ethical obligation to remain the leading actor on global sustainability."
"We politicians must not let ourselves be governed by the momentum of capital."
". Mr President, the European Union is making every effort to ensure that environmental concerns are incorporated into all of its policies."
"The rate of natural resource consumption in Europe currently exceeds our biological capacity by more than a factor of two."
"What this means is that our continent is appropriating a disproportionate share of the world’s natural resources, whether terrestrial or marine."
"Let me refer Members to the communication adopted by the European Commission on 15 October 1998, which committed the EU to improving the integration of its environmental and energy policies, and which contained concrete measures to this end."
"Eight years have passed, and yet none of the goals set out in this document have been achieved."
"Before our very eyes, a decision has been taken by politicians to construct the largest energy network of its kind, incorporating a double gas pipeline and a system of electric cables, along the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"Its construction poses a threat to environmental safety, and will have a disastrous impact on the marine environment in the land-locked basin of the Baltic Sea."
"There are a number of key questions that we must ask ourselves."
"How much longer will we go on drafting legislation that is divorced from reality?"
"How much longer will our legislative acts and opinions continue to be nothing but empty slogans and platitudes that are not followed up by practical measures?"
"Instead of focusing our attention on solving the most pressing problems at hand, proposals have been put forward for an alternative project, namely the introduction of an environmental tax."
"I am opposed to this approach."
"Environmental problems will not be solved by creating tax systems."
"They will instead be aggravated, since an increased tax burden will have a direct and negative impact on investment in costly new technologies."
"There will also be additional costs for employers that may lead to redundancies."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, as it shows clearly how many different issues we are actually talking about when we use the expression ‘sustainable development strategy’."
"Sustainable development concerns all Union policies, including, in particular, cooperation with the rest of the world."
"The Commission communication makes good reading, with many well-meant, kind words, but I am disappointed that the chapter entitled ‘Setting objectives, targets and milestones’ has turned out very short and also very superficial."
"One has the impression that the authors are well acquainted with the problems and have analysed them well but that, as soon as it comes to combating them, they fail to penetrate beneath the surface."
"I hope that the strategy announced under the Austrian Presidency is more ambitious and gives more specific answers on the subject."
"We must not confine ourselves to this single strategy, however."
"How seriously we take the concerns of sustainable development will also become clear from the development of Union finances in future."
"If environmental and species protection are important Community objectives, that must also be reflected in the budget."
"We must do our utmost to ensure that instruments, such as LIFE, that work well and are so important for the environment in Europe are allocated sufficient funds."
"The Commission communication lists a number of unsustainable trends, predominantly climate change."
"The Commission is therefore called upon to take those measures that represent important instruments for combating climate change."
"The Eco-design Directive adopted last year provides it with ample opportunities for this."
"I hope that the Commission’s first implementing measures to this directive will soon be in place, namely for those products with high potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases at low cost."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to thank Mrs Ferreira for a splendid report, which unfortunately received a couple of nasty dents in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The report contains some fine objectives."
"I shall not repeat them in this Chamber, but they are all important."
"Whenever something is really about to happen, the EU’s good intentions often all but evaporate."
"Unfortunately, there is reason for fearing that that will also happen where this matter is concerned, and I was not in any degree reassured to hear the Commissioner’s contribution, which contained very few practical elements."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has put forward three amendments: one calling for more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, another calling for an end to dependence on nuclear energy and a practical one concerning the problems with waste that we have due to an inconsistent approach to drinks packaging."
"Each year, Denmark alone has 400 to 600 million German beer and soft drink cans floating about the countryside or on their way through the waste incineration system because the Germans allow the Danes to avoid paying deposits on beer cans bought in Germany."
"With a common European deposit system, the Danish countryside and environment would fare much better, as would the cows that at present suffer torture when they chew on some of the many German beer cans lying around the countryside."
"– Mr President, I am much obliged to you for giving me the floor at so late an hour, on what is indeed a very important and interesting report."
"I should like to start by agreeing with Mrs Scheele: it is true that all the policies dealt with by the Union are, and must be, subject to the principles of sustainability."
"The financial situation undoubtedly forms part of this, too, and so not only should we be deliberating where we could be spending still more money, but we must also ask ourselves how we can spare the young generation excessive debt within our financial programming, whilst setting – possibly different – priorities; because debts left behind by Member States for the young generation surely cannot be considered sustainable either."
"I should like to examine one point that seems to me to be very important in connection with this directive."
"Firstly, I believe that strengthening ownership by improving cooperation with the actors in this field is an important tool for actually reinforcing the understanding at grass-roots level that sustainability is not a hollow principle that we only uphold when we get up on our soapboxes – to quote my fellow Members here – but that it affects each one of us quite specifically."
"I should now like to discuss a specific point, namely the financing of Natura 2000 sites."
"As we are of course aware, we in Western Europe, in particular, have a very high level of prosperity, and this is not god-given."
"If farmers suddenly see large sections of their land marked out as Natura 2000 sites with stock protection in force, it will be very difficult to convince them that sustainability is something tangible."
"We have to show these farmers that sustainability has benefits for them, too, by paying them compensation or offering them other ways of earning a living."
"For this reason, we must stipulate in this directive that an effective financing system is necessary for the Natura 2000 network."
"I therefore support this directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go in particular to Anne Ferreira, and it is an agreeable opportunity to be here speaking on this subject."
"Sustainable development is a phrase that should apply to all EU policy and decision-making."
"Sustainable development cannot be separated from industrial, competition or economic policy, and even less so from energy, traffic or agricultural policies."
"For this reason, it was a slight disappointment that this sustainable development strategy was not reviewed at the same time as the EU’s strategy on competitiveness."
"EU competitiveness, of course, relies on increased growth being environmentally friendly both in production and consumption."
"Consumption can be influenced by products and services at the right price."
"The cost to the environment must be priced in."
"This will provide an incentive for environmentally better production."
"To achieve real results, reliable indicators need to be found for policy on sustainable development."
"The rapporteur, among others, is of the same opinion."
"Such indicators can only be obtained by establishing sufficiently ambitious quantitative and qualitative targets."
"Quantitative objectives, if they are set correctly, tell us where the successes have been and what needs improving for us to achieve a state of the environment which no longer causes harm to human health anymore than to nature’s ability to withstand pollution."
"If we set sufficiently high targets, they will also encourage the development, for example, of new environmental technologies, which in turn will boost European growth, and in this way we will attain real sustainable development."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the presentation of the programme of the Austrian Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I extend my very warm greetings to all of you here this morning."
"It gives me great pleasure to be able to address the European Parliament."
"It is an honour to present, on behalf of the Republic of Austria, a brief summary of the programme for the six months of our presidency."
"The European Parliament is a very special institution, embodying as it does, in a unique way, the strength of the new Europe."
"This Parliament is the result of a historic election in 2004."
"For the first time, 25 nations held free elections simultaneously; they elected their assembly to represent them, the , the European people."
"The division of Europe was thus ended once and for all, although the process of reunifying Europe is still proceeding unabated."
"This Parliament is a marvellous illustration of the greatest strength of this new Europe, with its diversity of ideas and experiences, its history and also its life stories and its hopes."
"We know that the tone of Europe is not that of a solo instrument but that of an orchestra, and the same applies to this Parliament."
"Europe is not monochrome but colourful, as the logo of the Austrian presidency symbolises."
"And this strength, this diversity, the numerous identities of Europe, make our Union what it is."
"No country has lost out by acceding to the European Union."
"All of us have benefited."
"We have gained freedom, peace, security and paths to prosperity."
"Yet if everything is so wonderful, you might well ask, why are so many of our citizens distinctly sceptical?"
"We must be quite specific about this and analyse the situation honestly."
"The high points of the historic year of 2004 were followed by a particularly difficult phase."
"After three years of intensive negotiations on a new constitution, the outcome was rejected in referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"Then came the strenuous tug-of-war over the Financial Perspective for the next seven years."
"There were terrorist attacks in some EU capitals, growing concerns among the population about further enlargements of the EU and a real lack of trust among the people of the EU in its institutions."
"For this reason we have made it an aim of the Austrian presidency to tackle this particular problem."
"By the end of our presidency we want to see new growth in people’s trust in Europe, in trust between the Member States and indeed in trust between the European institutions."
"If we want to achieve that aim, we must first seek answers to the major questions that occupy people’s minds."
"A friend of mine, the great Austrian quantum physicist Anton Zeilinger, drew my attention to a facet of physics of which I had never really been aware and which I certainly found extremely fascinating."
"He told me that the question is the important thing."
"In quantum physics, he said, this is far more elemental than in the general ideological context."
"The question elicits the truth, and the way in which the question is asked determines the quality of that truth."
"This is why we must begin by asking these questions."
"They must be straight questions, and we must also be aware of their unpleasant implications."
"We shall not have equally satisfactory answers to all of them, but we must also beware of rapid shortcuts."
"There is a need to listen, for Europe must be both useful and protective."
"The many real threats that exist are helping to focus our minds on these attributes."
"On 1 January of this year, the day on which we took over the presidency, the New Year concert was held in Vienna, an event in which we try to radiate a little optimism as well as merriment."
"Just as the Latvian conductor, Maris Jansons, raised his baton, the Russians cut their gas deliveries, first by 30% and then, in the night of 1 to 2 January, by 50%."
"Martin Bartenstein, the Minister for Economics and Labour, who is responsible for energy affairs, then had the task of seeking solutions with our partners – the Ukrainians, the Russians and our European partners – and with Commissioner Piebalgs."
"This incident brought home to us that, in a matter that has hitherto fallen within the reserved powers of the Member States, major problems can now be resolved only at the European level."
"This is an area where we need more European involvement."
"When it comes to reducing dependence on a single supplier, of diversifying, of stocking sufficient reserves and of making energy-supply networks secure – which will only be possible, incidentally, if we encourage long-term investments and permit long-term supply connections and contracts – we must not take the short-term view and focus on profits for the next quarter; long-term solutions are the only answer for Europe."
"It is also a matter of choices."
"I have always defended the right and responsibility of every country to choose its energy sources."
"We have chosen our way, which does not include nuclear technology and its peaceful use, and I shall uphold that decision."
"But I shall also campaign for every country’s right to preserve its freedom of choice."
"I believe that we must take very great care not to slide into a one-sided approach."
"We in the European Union must work together to put safety standards first, and we must devote more attention than ever to renewable sources of energy and ensure that every option of importance to us and to our environment is fully explored."
"This question of the security of energy supplies will be an important topic in the European spring summit."
"At this point I should also like to thank the British presidency of the Council for dealing comprehensively with this question and showing a good nose for imminent developments by giving it ample attention at Hampton Court."
"We shall cooperate closely with the Commission too in this matter."
"Other topics are the fight against bird flu and the need for a firm stand against the Iranian nuclear modernisation programme."
"In these areas, more Europe and a united European front in the global arena are essential if we are to be able to give security guarantees to people in the world and especially in Europe."
"The second very important topic which is preoccupying people is that of growth and employment."
"It is the key subject of the spring summit, for without jobs, without the prospect of finding work, it goes without saying that the people of Europe will become increasingly apprehensive."
"Many feel that Europe is doing too little for them in this area."
"There are now 25 reform programmes on the table, which the Commission will assess."
"We have opted for a mix of specific verifiable voluntary commitments by the 25 Member States plus recommendations from the Commission with a view to moving into the practical phase of the initiative and achieving visible results."
"No politician can promise jobs today; to do so would be rash."
"But we can create favourable conditions."
"Everyone knows, and you know best of all, that with 1% of Europe’s gross national income, as in the present budget, or with 1.045% or 1.1%, it is not possible to create millions of jobs."
"We can, however, set an example, and we can verify the Member States’ fulfilment of their voluntary commitments."
"Above all, we can put some new items on the European agenda that have perhaps received less attention in the past."
"One of these items, in my view, is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Many such businesses used to complain that they received insufficient attention, that they did not have enough access to capital and to EU programmes."
"We have to realise that SMEs could be the only real job machine in the Union."
"SMEs are a sleeping giant that we must waken."
"SMEs need access to capital markets, research and development, and this is something the Commission must address in the SME programme it presents."
"They need access and consideration when it comes to the allocation of regional support from the structural funds."
"The Better Regulation programme must include specific measures to lower SMEs’ administrative costs."
"Cutting red tape is an important objective, particularly with regard to SMEs."
"Another great source of strength that has not been adequately tapped is the partnership between the representative bodies of management and labour at the European level, the European social partners."
"From our Austrian experience, I can say that democracy and the market economy cannot work properly without free, strong and independent representatives of employers and employees."
"The Austrian model is certainly quite interesting."
"It is not as if agreements are reached without discussion: there are very frequent exchanges of opinion and sometimes even wrangles."
"It would be absurd to think that these things could be settled without arguments in a democracy."
"They often serve to pep up the political debate."
"Under our presidency, I should also like to invite the European social partners to join us in the pursuit of these goals – jobs, growth, energy security – and I have already had very good talks with the European Trade Union Confederation and the employers’ organisation UNICE."
"The Services Directive will be very important in this respect."
"I know that Parliament has been grappling tenaciously with this matter."
"After more than 1 000 amendments, you will have seen for yourselves how difficult it is to combine the opening of such a large sector of the market with the guarantees that the public expect of us."
"It goes without saying that the opening of markets must necessarily be accompanied by resolute action against social dumping and by efforts to protect the familiar public services that our local authorities have traditionally provided."
"We need that balance."
"Openness and protection are what is expected of us."
"I should like to have the social partners with us in this effort so that a proper balance can be struck."
"The key to all of this, of course, is sufficient growth."
"There is no getting away from that."
"Above all, the spring summit must be devoted to the stimulation of growth."
"This requires not only research and infrastructure but enlargement too."
"Enlargement, if prudently and properly carried out, can be a growth strategy for Europe as well as for our industries in the old Member States."
"If we had 3% growth, coupled with at least 1% employment growth, the present unemployment figure of 19 million would be halved within five years."
"That is a hugely ambitious target, but if we also enhance our training systems and create greater flexibility, we can achieve it."
"This is surely where the real work has to be done."
"Faced with fierce competition from Asia and the United States and in the light of present demographic trends, we simply cannot afford to have part of our labour force inadequately trained or fail to maximise its employability."
"A very important issue for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament will, of course, be the negotiation of the Financial Perspective for the next seven years."
"I make no bones about this."
"We need and want your cooperation, because the creation of a seven-year Financial Perspective – a rare occurrence, since most of our budgeting covers a period of only one or two years – naturally brings security and predictability."
"I know there are many in the European Parliament who are not content with what the European Council only just managed to adopt in December after much toil and trouble, but I must also tell you plainly that those who want more research must look first and foremost at the national budgets."
"If we in the Member States were truly committed to implementing what was, after all, our own decision to devote 3% of our national budgets to research by 2010, that would produce not only EUR 200 billion a year for research but 50% more, in other words EUR 300 billion – far more than an allocation in the general budget, however ambitious it might be, could yield."
"I must be frank with you: we are reaching our limits with the Financial Perspective."
"If we go on having to, or choosing to, engage in the surgical removal of membership contributions from national budgets to finance the work of the Union, this will have been the last time we managed to put together a Financial Perspective."
"I shall tell you straight – and some may not like to hear this – that Europe needs to become more self-funding."
"It is not right that we should have to extract all our resources from the national budgets, which are already under pressure."
"That is precisely what drags us into this lamentable tension between net contributors and net recipients, into a situation where everyone looks for winners and losers."
"The idea of a shift in the direction of self-financing may not be universally popular, but my duty as President of the Council is not to say popular things but rather to say what needs to be said."
"I believe we must focus attention on this point, and I know that the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, takes a very similar view."
"It is up to the Commission to put all these considerations on the table in the review of 2008/09."
"It is surely absurd that the profits of short-term financial speculation are completely exempt from taxation today."
"It is unacceptable that tax loopholes exist and that international air or sea travel is practically tax-free."
"Europe cannot tolerate this situation when there are important tasks that cannot be financed."
"I therefore ask the Commission to include this issue in its review, and I also ask explicitly for the support of the European Parliament."
"If we want a strong Europe, we cannot coyly or timidly avoid this issue."
"Here in the front row I see Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and our esteemed High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, who often have to go round cap in hand to raise money for vital peace missions, and all because we have not had the courage to discuss these matters sufficiently."
"The new Europe you represent also needs new solidarity among the institutions."
"It makes no sense for the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to criticise each other. We are all in the same boat, and we have to row in the same direction."
"Not head-to-head confrontation but hand-in-hand cooperation – that is my principle and my motto for this presidency."
"We must listen when some of our citizens bemoan the misuse of EU funding or the squandering of resources within some programmes."
"There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny."
"We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making – in the Council’s legislative activity, for example – or for funding awards to be publicised so that people know who has actually benefited."
"Why not?"
"It is only right that such information should be published."
"This is European taxpayers’ money."
"We must work together on this."
"We must also listen to people who say, ‘It is all very well to have a fairly efficient economy, but what has happened to the protection of ordinary people, to social cohesion and to care for the vulnerable?’"
"A few days ago, in his at the European College of Parma, Jacques Delors made a statement that struck a chord with me. He said, ‘Finding a balance between the market and social policy means recognising social issues as a development factor and not as a by-product of the market economy’"
"‘Finding a balance between social values and the power of the market economy, and recognising social issues as a development factor and not as a by-product of the economy.’"
"I find that incredibly interesting."
"This is the very motto that ultimately sums up our European way of life and that we shall also take with us into the discussion on the future of Europe, with which I should like to conclude my remarks."
"In the first half-year up to the June summit, it falls to us to conduct this discussion on the future of Europe."
"Since last June the Austrian presidency has had a mandate to engage in such a discussion together with the European Parliament here, with the Commission, which we also ask for fresh impetus, with the national parliaments and, of course, with the European public."
"Parliament, I know, will – today or tomorrow – adopt a good and well-balanced resolution on the basis of a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I take that very seriously and will continue to do so during the Austrian presidency."
"It must not be an elitist debate;"
"Europe concerns everyone."
"Many Europeans are longing for involvement, for a stake in the future of Europe."
"It is not only about a document."
"It is about far more than that: it is about the identity of Europe."
"What connects us?"
"What internal forces actually hold us together?"
"It is about a fair division of responsibilities: what can Europe do, and what must it do?"
"Those who seek to resolve the major issues must have both hands free to tackle the task."
"Our hands will not be free unless we let go of other things."
"An earnest desire to resolve major issues presupposes readiness to relinquish responsibility for minor issues to other institutions."
"This is where the word ‘subsidiarity’ comes into play, a concept we are forever invoking in our soap-box rhetoric."
"We must bring it to life."
"To this end, we shall devote a special conference to it after Easter."
"This discussion is also about the boundaries of Europe."
"Translated into concrete terms, this means the criteria that determine the absorption capacity of the Union."
"These boundaries must not be drawn by surveyors or geographers."
"They are a political matter."
"The political debate must focus on absorption capacity."
"It must also focus on the visibility of Europe in the world and within its own borders."
"I think it is wrong that we should only meet in Brussels or here in Strasbourg."
"Europe must be visible in its peripheral areas too, in other aspects of life."
"As a presidency, we see how interesting it is for people to discover, experience, grasp and sense that Europe is not afraid to reach out to its citizens."
"They must even be able to vent their anger on occasion so that this European model can work."
"I am talking about a European way of life."
"I have never understood why, when the Americans talk proudly of their way of life, we Europeans never dare to talk openly, boldly and with pride about our own."
"Peace, security, democracy, human rights, solidarity and quality of life – these are things that are not to be taken for granted, nor are any of them achieved without a struggle."
"In the light of these considerations, we shall present a draft route map with timetables and/or an interim report by the month of June."
"Controversies and divergent points of view are not only deemed acceptable in this discussion but positively welcomed."
"The worst thing would be for me to convene a discussion here to which nobody came or no one contributed."
"As Martin Buber once said, everyone is called to bring something in this world to completion."
"This applies especially to Europe."
"Europe is teamwork."
"The British held the presidency before us."
"We shall build on their work, and this year, we and the Finns have a well-coordinated joint operational programme on the basis of which we shall conduct our presidencies in tandem."
"In so doing, we intend to be reliable partners for you in the European Parliament and for you in the Commission."
"I look forward to our cooperation with great confidence, and I also hope that we can enthuse and inspire the people of Europe with our joint efforts."
"I wish you all the very best."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to take the floor today on the occasion of the presentation of the work programme of the Austrian Presidency."
"We are all aware of the skills and the traditions of Austrian diplomacy."
"If I may say so, I have long been aware of Mr Schüssel’s intelligence and of his devotion to the European cause."
"I am particularly pleased that this Presidency can begin its work already, armed with a vision of the financial perspective, thanks to the agreement obtained at the December European Council."
"As I have already said, this agreement marked an important moment for Europe, a moment in which Europe was able to demonstrate that it continues to be effective and relevant."
"The agreement has enabled a relatively optimistic climate to be created for 2006, which will be a crucial year."
"We must now pursue, and give concrete expression to, this dynamic approach."
"Although the Council took a step forward in December, it is now up to us to take the next step together, that is to say to make very swift progress in negotiating and concluding an interinstitutional agreement."
"I have been saying this for months: the agreement of the three institutions is necessary, and effective cooperation between them is crucial."
"It is now time for us to turn our words into deeds."
"In this context, allow me to lay special emphasis on the measures connected to citizenship, particularly those related to culture and to young people."
"Further efforts are required in this area in order to fulfil our shared commitment to make our people more in touch with our measures and to promote the European dimension."
"As from 1 February, the Commission will be proposing an amended draft interinstitutional agreement, which will serve as the basis for our negotiations."
"As you know, aside from the question of resources, we still need to specify important points on which the Commission has fully exercised its influence: more flexibility and adaptability of our resources, the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the prospect of a revision clause."
"The Commission considers that these elements of flexibility will be crucial in reaching an agreement between the three institutions."
"We must also work together towards the adoption of a set of legislative proposals that will give effect to the interinstitutional agreement, once it has been adopted."
"In that area too, efforts will be required of the Council groups, the parliamentary committees and the Commission services."
"This is a real challenge but one that we cannot overlook. We must in fact see to it that the Union is ready to get down to the job on 1 January 2007."
"If the deadlines were to be missed, then we would seriously run the risk of being late in implementing the Structural Funds, which are key elements for solidarity within an enlarged Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the context of Europe, the forthcoming year is, on the one hand, rich in possibilities and, on the other hand, fraught with responsibilities."
"The Presidency will be able to count on the Commission’s full support and cooperation."
"We see a close interrelationship between the programme of the Austrian Presidency and the objectives pursued by the Commission since taking up its duties, and particularly its strategic objectives."
"Armed with its culture and values, Europe will be able to go forward if it can simultaneously make progress in three areas: economic performance, social cohesion and the sustainable management of its resources."
"To succeed in this, Europe needs a real partnership involving all the actors."
"We need everyone’s contribution so that Europe can release its full potential."
"Mr President, growth and jobs are the core preoccupation of our citizens."
"We must show them that Europe can deliver a credible response to their concerns."
"The Spring European Council in March is the first real test of the determination of all actors to move forward towards economic reform and modernisation."
"Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes."
"The Commission is finalising its appraisal of those programmes and will report to the Spring European Council."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support and look forward to continuing working closely with you on the growth and jobs agenda."
"The parliamentary dimension of the Lisbon Agenda is not window dressing but an essential element in promoting and ensuring support for the implementation of the necessary reforms."
"In that sense, we can say that the revised Lisbon Agenda has already been successful."
"It has managed to create a common vision and a strong consensus."
"Nobody seriously continues to contest that the priority should be on growth for jobs."
"It is now time to turn words into deeds, vision into action."
"The message we need from the Spring European Council is that Europe has made a credible commitment to structural reforms and is determined to exploit fully all its potential for growth and more and better jobs."
"We therefore welcome the Austrian Presidency’s willingness to inject new dynamism into the discussion of some pending proposals that are key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, including the Services Directive."
"The establishment of a well-functioning internal market in the area of services is a key opportunity to free up the potential of Europe."
"The Commission will cooperate fully with the Presidency and Parliament to seek political agreement on directives between the Council and Parliament."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament is actively preparing the ground for a balanced approach, that is to say, an approach that will apply the Treaty provisions on trade in services while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with working and employment conditions for posted workers and recognising the specific nature of services of general interest."
"For this purpose, I believe the role of the European social partners can be a crucial one."
"We will be calling on our social partners for a joint contribution to a balanced ambitious solution for the services sector."
"Let us be frank about this: the services sector and small and medium-sized enterprises are the most important drivers for the creation of jobs in Europe."
"They should receive the support they deserve from political leaders."
"Progress on the revised Lisbon Agenda will have to factor in the work undertaken as a follow-up to the Hampton Court meeting."
"This covers key areas like research and development, universities, demographic change, energy, migration, security and the role of Europe in the world."
"The Commission will propose new initiatives in the fields of research and education, preparing the establishment of a European institute of technology and furthering work on the mutual comparability and recognition of qualifications."
"We will provide a focus for debate on demographic change and on its implications for a fairer work/life balance."
"We shall also present a roadmap for gender equality which will look at different European Union policies and see how they can contribute to reducing gender gaps in employment or unemployment conditions and to addressing the phenomenon of violence against women and trafficking."
"We will seek to strengthen the effectiveness of the European Union in pursuing its external objectives and interests by increasing the coherence of our action."
"Energy issues mark the debut of this Presidency, and I want to thank the Austrian Presidency for its excellent cooperation in dealing with the recent gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine."
"Energy issues will remain a dominant theme of our future agenda."
"The recent crisis and persistently high oil prices teach a lesson to those who normally resist and obstruct the provision of a European dimension for energy policy and to all those who always resist a European dimension in politics and policy-making."
"Europe must have an improved, more coordinated energy policy based on the principles of diversification of sources, security of supply and sustainability."
"Well before Hampton Court, when leaders clearly stressed the need for a new approach, the Commission announced a green paper on secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy."
"We are also preparing a series of new initiatives on energy efficiency and clean technologies."
"We will take up the debate initiated with the Biomass Action Plan and complement it with a communication on biofuels."
"Finally, we will put forward ideas for developing a real pan-European energy market, enhancing cooperation with our neighbouring countries."
"This is an example of common sense driving a common approach, where no option should be excluded."
"National leaders and citizens see the sense of a common, coherent European policy."
"Now is the moment for the European institutions to play their role with ambition and rigour."
"I look forward to working with you over the coming months to give shape to European energy policy."
"This brings me to another important point."
"The Commission has presented sustainable development as an overarching objective and, last December, presented a communication on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy."
"We welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency has chosen to put that at the top of its priorities."
"This will provide the momentum needed to complete the preparation of a new European Union Sustainable Development Strategy."
"The Commission document is an ambitious and concrete one."
"It offers a long-term vision for addressing issues such as climate change, preservation of natural resources, social exclusion and world poverty."
"It sets clear objectives, realistic targets and procedures for monitoring and measuring progress."
"It identifies involving all stakeholders – not only institutions, but business too – in a real partnership as a priority."
"Regional authorities and citizens should work together to deliver concrete results."
"Another issue that will remain high up on the European agenda in the coming months is security."
"I am pleased to see that the priorities of the Austrian Presidency in the area of freedom, justice and security match those of the Commission."
"The translation of the aid programme into practical measures remains our common priority."
"In the area of migration, we shall pursue the debate launched by the Policy Plan on Legal Migration, adopted in December 2005, and come forward with proposals on the long-term resident status of persons in need of international protection."
"During this semester we shall also table a green paper on drugs and civil society, a proposal on the applicable law in divorce matters, and a green paper on conflict of law in the area of matrimonial property regimes."
"The Commission will present the first implementation report on The Hague Action Plan."
"We look forward to achieving significant progress on those important files during the Austrian Presidency."
"One last priority that I want to comment on is our relations with our neighbours."
"The year 2006 will be a decisive period."
"In the spring, the Commission will review the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in preparing for accession and assess the level of their readiness to join the Union."
"On the Western Balkans, we welcome the priority set by the Austrian Presidency."
"Since 2003 the countries of the Western Balkans have had a clear European perspective."
"That process is critical for ensuring peace and stability in Europe."
"The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the careful monitoring of the situation in the region and the region’s relationship with the Union."
"That is why I have decided personally to visit the region in the coming weeks."
"Europe also needs to prepare to take greater responsibility in Kosovo."
"As discussions on Kosovo’s future status reach a critical stage, the European Union has to show that it is able to bring a concrete contribution to a complex and delicate issue."
"Last year, Heads of State and Government launched a period of reflection on the future of Europe."
"Citizens, civil society and political actors are expressing and debating their views, expectations and ideas."
"The Commission is playing its part fully, implementing Plan ‘D’ for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate."
"I am pleased to report that members of the Commission made a total of 68 visits to national parliaments in the course of 2005, explaining our policies and their added value to European citizens, and listening, because a process of dialogue is not just about explaining; it is also, and above all, about listening to the message citizens give to us."
"The European Parliament, with its counterparts in the national parliaments, is putting its weight behind this debate."
"The Commission is ready to cooperate fully with its initiatives."
"European leaders before us were prepared to dream of what could be."
"They had the courage of their European convictions."
"They opened a pathway to reconciliation and progress for Europe which none had walked before."
"Today we are the beneficiaries of that legacy and of their foresight."
"However, at a time when past achievements and current freedoms are so easily discounted, we cannot take future public consent for granted."
"It must be earned."
"My vision is of a stronger Europe which provides a solid political, economic and social framework for our citizens, a Europe based on culture, a Europe based on common values."
"It is of a Europe of democracy, accountability and transparency."
"In our troubled world today, we more than ever need a strong European Union, a European Union which promotes security, human rights and respect for the rule of law."
"Following the June European Council, the Commission will take stock of the preliminary results of the public debate and of discussions under Plan ‘D’. We also intend, at the request of the Austrian Presidency, to propose an agenda for further debate and action at European level."
"This will provide a basis for the Heads of State and Government to determine the way forward for the Union with a renewed commitment to translate our common objectives into actions."
"The Union’s main asset is a core of common values and a rich culture which should inspire our reflection on the future of Europe."
"Institutions are important, of course they are, but institutions are instruments for achieving our goals and we should not forget the main goals of our project."
"We need to provide determined leadership and reinforced consensus to bring Europe forward together."
"We need to concentrate on the essentials."
"We need to focus on delivery."
"We need to communicate our public purpose in plain and meaningful terms."
"I shall conclude by saying, as I told Chancellor Schüssel when I and other commissioners visited him in Vienna, that I think it was a great decision by the Austrian Presidency to choose all the beautiful and bright colours of Europe as its logo."
"I believe it is now time for us to do away with grey and black colours, to insist on the possibilities of such diversity of Europe and to use these very important six months of the Austrian Presidency to show our renewed commitment to a Europe that belongs to the future and believes in that future."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying, Mr President-in-Office, that we expect a great deal of you, because, as you stated yourself, Europe needs trust and progress."
"These great expectations we have of you and your presidency are not a purely abstract wish but are based on our justifiable hope that you will perform your task wisely, in other words with both ambition and realism."
"I remember well when Austria held the presidency of the Council in 1998."
"Your country’s leaders, and you in particular, are convinced Europeans whose commitment to Europe is about action rather than mere rhetoric, and you are competent too."
"I hope and believe that, at the end of this half-year, we shall be able to say that yours was a successful presidency."
"It is still too early to pass judgment, of course, but the basic conditions are favourable."
"You mentioned something that I believe to be the key principle for Europe, namely that public trust in the European institutions must flow from the mutual trust between heads of government."
"I am truly hopeful that you will manage to portray the European Council and the governments as a decisive body that is also united in its desire to move Europe forward, thereby dispelling the impression that all heads of government are unable to look beyond their countries’ perceived national interests and will be the ruination of Europe."
"In the European Council, we must begin to act for Europe on the basis of mutual trust."
"We in Europe must know that there can be no response to the great challenges of the present day without Europe."
"Europe is not the answer to every problem, but the great challenges will not be met without it."
"The President of the Commission said that the European institutions are a means to an end."
"Yes, that is true, and it means that we need the European institutions to ensure that some governments do not take it upon themselves to dictate the way forward."
"This is not confined to the large countries."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are opposed to a Union dominated by the large countries."
"At the same time, having heard the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands say, only yesterday or the day before, that the European constitution was dead, we regard that as no less a bid for dominance, implying as it does that all other countries should follow the Netherlands’ lead."
"We shall not accept that either."
"You spoke of employment, the economy and growth."
"We endorse everything you said, but when we speak of support for small and medium-sized enterprises, we are not asking for subsidies."
"What these businesses want is relief from the burden of taxation and red tape."
"If we can provide that through the European and national ground rules, jobs can then be created too."
"This is why we say that small and medium-sized businesses should be at the heart of our thinking on economic policy."
"This also means, of course, that we say ‘yes’ to European legislation, including the Services Directive."
"You spoke of openness and protection."
"That is precisely the balance we must strike."
"We are working on this in the European Parliament, and I hope we shall succeed in finding an acceptable solution at first reading in February."
"I am delighted that my Socialist friend agrees, but I would never venture to speak for his Group."
"He will do that himself shortly."
"When we speak of the Services Directive, I must also say that Europe’s ability to deal with the major problems arising from globalisation would be weakened in the absence of an internal market."
"This is why we need the single European market as a response to globalisation."
"On the constitution, we ask you to draw up a timetable, so that we ultimately arrive at an outcome which all countries of the European Union can support, because we – and here I am speaking for the PPE section of our Group – are firmly convinced that we need the constitution."
"Finally, energy was mentioned here."
"It goes without saying that the energy debate is partly about our own supply, about ourselves and our prosperity."
"Our prosperity will ultimately count for nothing, however, if it is not rooted in democracy."
"This is why we shall not tolerate a situation in which one of the G8 countries set different prices for countries such as Ukraine, which are democracies, and countries like Belarus, which is run by a ruthless dictator but gets cheaper gas."
"We shall not be a party to this; we want to be an advocate for all our neighbours on the basis of sound social development, on the basis of democracy, the rule of law and human dignity."
"We wish you every success in this effort."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Federal Chancellor – for a German Social Democrat, that form of address already has a wistfully nostalgic charm about it – I listened to you very carefully, and I must say that your speech was impressive, particularly the way it was presented."
"Listening to you, one has the impression that it is a real pleasure to sit on the European Council, that it is great to be President of the Council, a truly noble calling."
"But appearances are deceptive, as your own bitter experience has shown and as you will have realised from the outset."
"For this reason, we intend to look rather more closely at your role as President of this Council and at the results this Council has presented to us and then venture a comparison between what you have described as the necessary aims of your presidency and the financial reality against which these aims must be measured."
"Before I proceed, however, there is something I have to comment upon. You must explain to me afterwards what the New Year concert had to do with the gas taps being turned off in Russia."
"Scarcely had the conductor raised his baton at the New Year concert, you told us, before they turned the gas down."
"And then the plot thickened: when the concert finished, you said, they turned it right down."
"We really must discuss this mysterious link between the New Year concert in Vienna and Russian gas supplies to Europe."
"Chancellor, you identified three aims."
"You said that the people of Europe wanted growth and jobs."
"Yes, you are right there: growth and jobs."
"And the people of Europe do not want Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to have to run round cap in hand when we want to engage in operations to stabilise the Gaza Strip, when we want to contribute to peace in the Middle East or whenever we seek to bring stability to the world’s troubled regions."
"It is undoubtedly correct to say that the citizens of Europe will be right behind us when the objectives adopted in Vienna last Sunday are propagated, namely an efficient fight against terrorism and an efficient European police force that can assist national police forces in combating organised crime."
"With measures like these, we are sure to win the backing of our citizens for the European project."
"That, indeed, was the reason why the European Parliament, in the Böge report on the Financial Perspective, put more growth and employment and greater security within Europe and in the wider world at the heart of its financial proposals."
"Let us now compare our proposals with the decisions you reached in the Council – you included, Mr Schüssel – in December."
"For growth and employment, you proposed 35 billion less than Parliament; for internal security in the form of efficient cooperation between police forces, 7.8 billion less; for foreign policy, 12.8 billion less!"
"In all of the areas you enumerated here as strategic tasks for your presidency, the Council made swingeing cuts, with the aid of your own vote."
"That is the true nature of the European crisis: your promises in the Council and the subsequent failure to deliver."
"That is Europe’s crisis."
"Mr President of the Commission, let me turn now to you."
"I really must say that I fail to understand you."
"To loud applause in this House, you encouraged the British presidency of the Council to proceed in the very direction I have just described, which is, after all, our common policy."
"And in your budget proposal you called for even more money."
"Your Commission requested EUR 1 022 billion as the funding required for the performance of our tasks over the next seven years."
"At the end of the day, this is whittled away to 862 billion, a shortfall of 160 billion, which you then describe as a great success."
"That is what I cannot understand."
"We want an agreement, Mr Schüssel."
"We want Europe to be structured efficiently."
"It need not always involve more money."
"If no more resources can be mobilised, we have to accept that."
"But the expenditure structures must then be organised in such a way that the aims you described can be achieved."
"What we have achieved is an unchanged budgetary structure."
"Moreover, we now have Blair’s theorem, which has taken its place alongside that of Pythagoras."
"Tony Blair should truly be nominated for the Nobel Prize in mathematics for his theorem, which states that the decelerated increase of a sum is equal to the reduction of the sum – brilliant!"
"Since this year marks the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, Chancellor, I reflected on the words of Osmin in his aria in Mozart’s marvellous opera which are actually a good description of what the Council has been serving up to us."
"Osmin sings the following line, which fits the European Council like a glove: ‘All your tricks and all your wiles, all your schemes and all your guiles, there’s none that I know not.’"
"The European Parliament, however, must add the next part of the stanza: ‘But better ones are needed ere your victory’s conceded, for well I know what’s what’."
"The European Parliament is ready to pursue with you the aims you have outlined, but with the necessary resources and structures."
"Let us negotiate on that."
"And you are right, Mr President of the Commission, when you say that Europe needs less grey and black."
"Europe also needs more red!"
". President-in-Office, you are said to be skilled in drawing and adept at mountaineering."
"You have sketched for us a clear picture of your Presidency and you have mapped the contours of your summits."
"Your main task over these six months will be to reach agreement with this House on the Union’s seven-year spending plans."
"As one of the backers of the bid to slash the budget, you have belaboured the Union with its lowest capability ever."
"This budget will meet not even the demands of Europe’s leaders, let alone the ambitions of our citizens."
"That is why Liberals and Democrats will vote today to reject the deal brokered by Mr Blair."
"If you are to rebuild confidence in the European project, you need to convince Europeans that the EU works to serve their interests."
"The Erasmus Programme is one of our most visible and successful projects, yet the Council is seeking to cut the budget for young people."
"The Airbus project is a triumph of common endeavour, yet there will be too little money for research and development to replicate it."
"We trust the Council will show willingness to work with this House to redirect money towards priorities like research and development."
"Each year, large sums are under-spent or decommitted in areas like agriculture or the structural funds."
"These should be kept for EU priorities, not refunded to Member States."
"Likewise, the budget should be based on the actual percentage of GNI, rather than nominal figures."
"With growth just half a percent greater than forecast, for example, 1.045% of GNI could be worth almost EUR 16 billion more."
"Should the Lisbon Agenda truly succeed in making us more competitive, that figure could be even larger."
"Can we count on you to study ideas like these for the Interinstitutional Agreement?"
"Liberals and Democrats look forward to working with you for greater economic competitiveness and more jobs."
"You have described this as ‘the most urgent task of European policy’."
"But this means embracing the opportunities offered by the EU, not shrinking under pressure from protectionists."
"In a wider Union, the gates of Vienna are no longer under siege, nor is your way of life threatened by the European Court of Justice."
"President-in-Office, 2006 is the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"How ironic, then, that you seek to prolong – for the first time in EU history – transitional arrangements which hinder the free movement of workers within our Union."
"Liberals and Democrats reject a two-tier Europe in which citizens of the new Member States are treated as second class."
"Moreover, Europe’s entrepreneurs need all the skilled help they can get in the absence of a consensus on immigration."
"Was it not the celebrated Austrian Simon Wiesenthal who said: ‘Freedom is not a gift of heaven, you have to fight for it every day’?"
"Liberals and Democrats agree."
"And we trust you will maintain our commitment to individual liberties and human rights in a world where they are increasingly trodden under foot."
"Let us ensure that the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna becomes a fully-fledged human rights agency."
"And press for a world-wide Human Rights dialogue to tackle the death of democracy in Russia, the fetters on freedom in China and the hypocrisy of an American President who kills Pakistani villagers in the name of democracy and civilisation."
"I believe that Austria’s Presidency could be a service to Europe, and to the world."
"If you uphold the promise of transparency made in December and start holding Council meetings in public, citizens will better understand the Union."
"If you can rediscover 1998’s ‘Pörtschachsgeist’ and set a positive agenda for action Liberals and Democrats will applaud your efforts."
"If you work with us and your colleagues to put the constitutional debate back on the rails you will breathe hope into the Union’s affairs."
"We wish you courage and accomplishment in the coming months."
"Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, my neighbour has reminded me, Mr President-in-Office, that you play ice hockey."
"In that case you will surely forgive me a few body checks."
"We all claim to be honest, and we are certainly all trustworthy – no doubt about that."
"My friend Albert Einstein told me the following about quantum theory: if the important thing is to ask the right question, he said, you must always try to find out what has been left out of the question, because that is the important thing at the end of the day."
"I shall therefore follow Einstein’s advice and say this to you: of course you are an honest broker, and of course every country should organise its energy provision as it sees fit."
"The problem is: where do we set our research priorities?"
"Do we give precedence to the old energy source known as nuclear energy or to research into (a) renewables and (b) hydrogen obtained from solar power?"
"They cannot both be research priorities."
"Given a choice between water and coal, we cannot choose both."
"You can have your cake, or you can eat it."
"It is high time you announced what you yourself wanted rather than simply saying you will go along with whatever the others want."
"On the subject of small and medium-sized enterprises, I agree with you, but at some stage a decision will have to be taken here too."
"We say yes to flexibility, but also to security."
"It would be wrong for us to organise a society in which those who have difficulties with flexibility must also pay the price of insecurity."
"In short, we must decide on a system that guarantees both flexibility and security."
"You did not say that."
"You went on to tell us that we need a market in Europe."
"Wonderful!"
"We are for that too."
"You also spoke of the Services Directive."
"Interestingly, there is one thing that neither you nor your political ally Mr Poettering mentioned, and I should like to hear what you have to say about it."
"I refer to the country-of-origin principle."
"No one is questioning the principle of freedom to provide services in Europe."
"What we are questioning is a country-of-origin principle that will destroy social justice in the Member States."
"Are you for it or against it?"
"You have not told us."
"That is the problem with social justice: it shows that there is actually a difference between Right and Left in this Parliament."
"Then we come to growth."
"You rightly referred to training and qualifications."
"The European Union, of course, is not responsible for education, but it can disseminate good practice."
"I long for a presidency that will finally get together with the Commission to examine the education system in Europe and conclude, as did the neo-liberal OECD, that the German and Austrian systems are the pits, because they simply do not guarantee equality."
"This is not Cohn-Bendit speaking but the OECD in its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study."
"It is time we understood that."
"Germany’s so-called performance-based system is a disgrace and needs to be reviewed at the European level."
"Let us move on to what you did not say, Mr President-in-Office."
"I should like to know one thing about the European way of life: the European way of life is effectively synonymous with European law."
"Is it possible that there are institutions in this world – the CIA, to be precise – that operate in Europe in a legal framework that has nothing to do with the European way of life?"
"What contribution will the presidency make to support the Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and to spell out to the United States and the rest of the world that Europe is not a place where any imperial power can feel free to do as it likes."
"And I should also like to hear what conflicts Europe is prepared to risk to defend its way of life."
"As you see, my friend Albert Einstein was right: a lot of probing is needed when someone does not speak about certain things."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Schüssel, your Presidency is getting off to a good start, what with Parliament probably challenging the directive on the liberalisation of port services, the general outcry against the draft financial perspective at the European Council and so on."
"You have inherited a minefield."
"Good luck!"
"Some of your predecessors saw their image go from one of triumphant self-confidence to one of pitiful weakness, all in the space of six months."
"You are embarking on your Presidency with more modesty, and I think you are right to do so."
"I will dwell only on one passage from your memorandum. When you mention the debate on the Constitution, you write in paragraph 8:"
"We are trying to restore a higher level of receptiveness to people’s concerns about the preservation of the European way of life in the context of globalisation."
"It is a matter of rebuilding trust in the Union’s political decision-makers."
"There lies the rub, in fact. Yet in the current climate of the people’s disaffection with the European institutions, words are no longer enough: practical, clear and convincing acts are required."
"As an illustrious ancestor used to say: ‘the proof of the pudding is in the eating’."
"With this in mind, I can see no more meaningful a gesture right now than that of a clear and public call for the rejection or the definitive withdrawal of the draft Services Directive and of any other text drawing its inspiration from the same liberal principles."
"Last Thursday, my group brought together in Brussels, to discuss the future of Mr Bolkestein’s symbolic text, more than 200 social actors from throughout the Union, from the confederal secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation to the representatives of the social forum from Poland and Romania, in addition to a large number of local, regional and national elected representatives."
"All of them expressed their strong opposition to the Commission’s text, which was described as being very dangerous by the leaders of the ETUC, for example."
"Mr Schüssel, you yourself took note at Hampton Court, in October, of the phenomenal way in which this draft directive attracted real opposition in the majority of our countries, once our fellow citizens became aware of its content."
"According to some indiscreet sources, you said: ‘We cannot save it; we must withdraw it’."
"In our opinion, withdrawing the text is actually the path we should be taking, but not with a view to coming back with a new and slightly amended draft - a ‘watered-down Bolkestein’, as one of the leaders of ATTAC described it during our meeting on Thursday."
"In truth, this matter has served to reveal what an increasing number of Europeans no longer want: workers being pitted against one another, and their social benefits and rights being levelled down as a consequence."
"It is this same logic that is rejected by all the port workers throughout the Union, irrespective of which trade union they belong to."
"The same goes for the Swedish workers involved in the very symbolic Vaxholm case."
"Other similar reports are reaching us from countries such as Finland, Scotland and Ireland."
"As the years have gone by, we have surreptitiously gone from having European integration achieved through harmonisation of national legislation - that is to say through political acts and through votes, which at least gave us hope that we could harmonise from the top down – to integration achieved through the market, that is to say through unfettered competition, which naturally tends to lead to a levelling down."
"You will not gain the confidence of Europeans, Mr President, without making a clean break with this liberal way of thinking, so as to really place the employee and the citizen – and no longer the market – at the centre of the European project."
"It is primarily in this light that your Presidency will be judged in six months’ time."
". Mr President-in-Office, so very wonderful was Mr Blair’s Presidency and his contribution to Euroscepticism that we had hoped for an encore of a further six months; but that was not to be."
"However, I can assure you that you are our second choice."
"We are very grateful to you for your thoughts that somehow the Constitution is not dead, but presumably merely sleeping."
"Presumably you think that it will be brought back to life at any time, which according to the press shocked even Mr Barroso from his extended period of reflection."
"So carry on as best you can!"
"Never mind the fact that 70% of your own people in Austria do not approve of the way you have been talking this morning."
"Never mind that two-thirds of the British people cannot see any benefit in remaining part of this sham Parliament."
"Never mind about the ‘no’ vote in France; never mind about the ‘no’ vote in Holland."
"From your lofty position your disdain for democracy will be noticed and, I am sure, approved of in many sections of this Parliament."
"Meanwhile, on a more mundane level, this is becoming a very expensive club to belong to."
"Never mind that during the season of goodwill Mr Blair comes along and contributes so much money – GBP 7 billion – that his would-be successor now wishes to have a national patriotic ‘Britain Day’ day to try and undo the damage to the perception of the British people."
"We have a 63% increase in our budget over seven years, and the Working Time Directive is to be brought in, so we cannot even create that wealth."
"What a wonderful agenda!"
"And to all those who came from Eastern Europe in the hope of getting money, I am sorry, but the cheque is not in the post!"
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are confident that the Presidency will keep its promises and rekindle people’s confidence in the Union, as has been mentioned. Citizens must have confidence in a Europe which, as everyone knows, needs not just a common foreign policy, but also – and urgently – a revitalised economic policy, which today is shamefully lacking in respect of the twin needs of restoring competitiveness and not losing the social entitlements that underpin the very existence of the Union."
"The Union has to rediscover the strength and willpower to make its institutions and its citizens work together."
"The only thing that we really have in common today – and then only in 12 countries – is our monetary policy, which is in fact determined by the Central Bank without sufficient political interaction with the other institutions."
"We shall have to debate that as well."
"We appreciate the Austrian Presidency’s commitment to resuming our journey towards the Treaty – with the tickets needed, we hope, to make it a smoother and more feasible ride."
"We look beyond the wishful thinking and dreams, which are often divorced from the reality that we have to deal with, but in any case there is an ability to dare."
"It is important to be able to predict the future realistically and not merely to manage the present."
"The commitment to a more united Europe in which the various institutions’ powers are more clearly defined, to a Europe that is more active and closer to its citizens, should see us united and also determined to address three further problems: immigration, energy and the environment."
"On immigration we need a common policy in order to tackle both the humanitarian aspects of the current situation and the threat of international terrorism, which is often brought in with the flows of migrants."
"There can only be civilised and worthwhile coexistence leading to true integration so long as non-EU nationals, no matter where they come from, respect the laws and constitutions of our countries."
"Without energy there can be no development, just as wasting energy causes irreparable damage."
"Energy cannot be separated from security, waste disposal and environmental protection as a common good and a prerequisite for our very survival."
"The Member States’ finance ministers have not yet taken an active part in tackling the problems associated with climate change, despite the many economic consequences that climate change will have."
"It is to be hoped that during the Austrian Presidency we shall also see the finance and planning ministers working on this problem and thinking about the costs in terms of human lives, housing, agriculture and the countryside, as well as reconstruction costs, which the world has had to pay following the recent disasters."
"A common environmental policy is needed within the Union, just as it is also needed by the Union in relation to the rest of the world, because it is one of the duties and objectives that we set ourselves during the Convention’s work on the Treaty."
"We appreciate the Presidency’s interest in the trade and neighbourhood policies."
"The latter ought to include compliance with the : I refer to the recent inaccurate – not to say incorrect or false – statements made by a Croatian Government representative."
"With regard to trade policy, we must remember to call for human rights to be respected wherever they are not."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, it has been a lively morning."
"Let us continue in that vein."
"Like many other people, I am convinced that Europe would be better off if you were seated on the other side this morning, if you were President of the Commission rather than just the temporary President of the Council."
"In the very limited time at your disposal, you cannot hope to perform any great exploits, but it is certainly possible to set the tone in areas such as energy and subsidiarity."
"In the financial realm too, you can achieve something."
"But please do not let yourself be led astray by those with a historically proven inability to handle money."
"Do not believe that more money automatically brings better results."
"The money is actually there."
"We do have EUR 112 billion."
"The only question is what is done with it."
"You said yourself, Chancellor, that the question was the most important thing."
"You said yourself that trust had to be built up."
"Do that!"
"Take real action!"
"Say who gets what, who pays for what, from the European pots of money."
"How many euros have the influential banking and media mogul Christian Konrad and his friends already received in support payments for things like hunting grounds?"
"How many euros do State Governor Erwin Pröll, his friends and his relative, the Minister of Agriculture, receive in direct subsidies?"
"Is it true that 427 influential farmers in Austria, almost all of whom are closely associated with your party, receive more than EUR 72 000 every year in direct subsidies?"
"I could go on."
"What about Danone and France?"
"What about Müller dairy products and Germany?"
"What about the corporations governed by public law?"
"Open the doors!"
"Create real transparency about who gets what."
"Open the Council meetings to scrutiny, so that we know how such decisions are reached."
"While you are restoring trust, you should concern yourself with the government broadcasting corporation ORF."
"What is the editor-in-chief, Werner Mück, doing there now?"
"And what about the other retainers who keep appearing there?"
"You have opportunities here; grasp them!"
"Transform yourself!"
"Put an end to the age of secrecy in Austrian domestic politics."
"Become a European enlightener!"
"Many millions of European citizens will thank you for it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, may I bid the President of the Council a warm welcome to the European Parliament."
"We Austrians are not the only ones who are pleased to see Wolfgang Schüssel taking over the presidency of the Council."
"Your priorities and political principles, Chancellor, are ours too."
"In the European Parliament, unlike national parliaments, we sit in a semicircle, because we need each other."
"Thank you for urging the institutions to enter into a new spirit of cooperation in place of instinctive confrontation and dis-coordination and day-to-day political posturing."
"Your speech made a refreshing change from what we have been hearing over the past few months."
"This new approach, however, also demands mutual respect and willingness to engage in dialogue, trust each other and make compromises."
"The book , in which you yourself wrote about the strategy of cooperation, contains the following quote from Kofi Annan: ‘We don’t need any more promises."
"We need to start keeping the promises we already made’."
"I see this as the essence of your speech."
"That is why we say yes to efforts to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises but no to a 70% reduction in the funding of the competitiveness and innovation programme for SMEs."
"We say yes to education and must therefore say no to a 40% cut in that part of the budget."
"We say yes to a transparent, accessible, democratic, parliamentary, socially responsible, stronger Europe, but this means that we must launch the debate on the political future of the Union and make our citizens stakeholders in Europe."
"We say yes to the Services Directive."
"Let us develop it into a showpiece of social market economics."
"We say yes to an EU based on the Community principle."
"Let us continue the development of the EU and bolster the common foreign and security policy."
"We must be prepared to talk and listen, because there are many tasks to accomplish."
"Let us get to work!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, let me begin by saying that the Chancellor did not really tell us very much about future enlargement, although that is, in fact, a priority of the Austrian presidency, firstly as regards Bulgaria and Romania and secondly with regard to preparation of the next steps in south-east Europe."
"As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, I should like to remind you of the Council’s promise to discuss in depth with this Parliament whether accession can take place in 2007, as I hope it does, or whether it will have to be deferred until 2008."
"We expect the presidency to honour its commitment to consult us on this matter."
"As for south-east Europe, I regard that region as a very high priority."
"Tell your colleagues in the Council that it is not a matter of incorporating these countries overnight for want of any other option but rather of maintaining the vision and the possibility of accession so that young people see the logic of remaining in the region instead of depopulating it by emigrating."
"There are many tests to be applied."
"One such test concerns the way in which the countries in the region treat their minorities."
"For us in Parliament, the treatment of minorities is always an important factor."
"In this respect, Chancellor, I am already deeply disappointed."
"How do you intend to stand up as President of the Council for the protection of minority rights when, in your own country, you cannot persuade your coalition partner, Jörg Haider, to show a minimum of respect for the Slovenian minority in Austria by having bilingual place-name signs erected?"
"I also hope you will make every effort, during this particular presidency, to ensure that Austria behaves in an exemplary manner, with no backsliding, not least with a view to gaining international trust."
"In connection with enlargement, we sometimes have the impression that heads of government – and you are certainly not alone in this – are very quick to take decisions."
"When it comes to conveying to their own population, however, why steps towards enlargement are needed and what there is to be gained from enlargement, they have very little to say."
"The Council must consider, together with Parliament and the Commission – for we can only do this together – how we should jointly present this great historic enlargement project to the public, because, as you rightly said, there really is a lack of trust."
"We must reflect together on what we can do to overcome that lack of trust."
"On the subject of economic problems and unemployment, I must give you my full support."
"One of the criteria by which we shall measure your performance is the way in which your welcome pledge to combat unemployment is honoured during this presidency and the extent to which you are prepared to lead the way with specific measures."
"In this context it is especially regrettable that, although more funds are available to us for research and development, some of these funds, as you very well know, have been siphoned off from infrastructure development."
"The European rail network that is so important to all of us, and particularly to our country, will suffer from the swingeing cutbacks we have made in that domain."
"We find this unacceptable, and we should try to make another adjustment here."
"Mr President-in-Office, we Social Democrats shall judge your presidency objectively."
"We shall measure your performance by what you have promised today."
"We hope that the Austrian presidency will be a resounding success."
"Such is the importance of Europe to us that we could not wish you any less."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I trust you will forgive me, Mr Schüssel, if I compare you here with Zeus, but in fact most heads of government treat Europe as the supreme deity of ancient Greece treated Europa, namely as a lover whom one woos here but who, back home in the company of one’s wife, is either not mentioned or played down, lest suspicion be aroused."
"And the people of our countries react in exactly the same way as children in a family when this lack of clarity prevails."
"They are extremely unsettled and distrustful; they become rebellious, as we clearly observed in the ‘no’ votes in the French and Dutch referenda."
"So you want to impart new impetus to Europe, Mr President-in-Office?"
"You can only do that by setting a good example and creating that long-overdue clarity."
"The members of the Council must go home and confess to their relationship with Europe, stand up for her more boldly, see to it that she is given a carefully assessed financial allowance to meet her needs and tell the people back home that the prospects of every single Member State in the global competition for prosperity depend entirely on the existence of a strong, self-confident Europe and that it is the task of Europe to cultivate globalisation."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I, too, should like to welcome you here, Chancellor, and wish you success and good fortune wherever you devote yourself to the common European cause."
"Following on from a great and almost despairing speech from the Luxembourg President of the Council half a year ago and a great demagogic address from the British President-in-Office, you have presented us with a kind of lesson in European harmony today and have tried to coax a out of the magic political flute."
"This , however, cannot obscure the reality that Europe is in crisis."
"Its notes cannot drown out the bickering of governments and the constant hubbub of the nationalistic horse-trading bazaar, nor can it drown out Europe’s agonised wailing as governments make it a scapegoat whenever they need one – the very Europe that those governments themselves have created."
"I listened with rapt attention and great respect when you talked about the people of Europe, for it has to be said that most governments deny the existence of a European people; it would have momentous implications for the constitutional issue if the people of Europe were taken seriously."
"But, to come back to something my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit mentioned, the magic flute cannot even be heard above the silence of governments – the silence of their suppressed delight at the collapse of a constitution that would have given Europe, the people of Europe, more rights but would have cost governments some of their power."
"You are not to be seen in the front line when the time comes to break a lance for European democracy: silence on social issues, Chancellor, and lessons in harmony."
"The European way of life is not in danger."
"It is not your responsibility anyway."
"It has many facets. People create the European way of life themselves."
"What is in danger, though, is the European social model, the social market economy."
"Not a word did you say about that."
"It is not for freedom that we need a magic flute."
"But your cooperation in the CIA affair, in a monstrous assault on fundamental rights at the heart of this Europe, …"
"I should first of all like to extend a warm welcome to Mr Schüssel."
"It would be fair to say that two themes will dominate the Austrian Presidency: the failed constitutional process and the services directive."
"To put it quite simply, the Dutch and French people have pronounced the Constitution dead; having been rejected by two Member States, it is no longer an issue, and the sooner the European Union can admit this, the sooner we can start the necessary reforms: reducing EU interference in matters of national responsibility, stopping the money wasting and fraud in Europe and carrying out a real democratisation process in the EU."
"As for the services directive, Austria is seeking a compromise between the different camps."
"If, however, it is the intention to strike a compromise between multinationals on the one hand and trade unions on the other, this will always result in a deterioration of the working conditions in Europe."
"Moreover, it will be impossible to compromise on the core of the proposal, namely the country-of-origin principle."
"Since my party and my group reject competition in the area of working conditions or social dumping as Europe’s future, we also reject the proposed directive."
"Europe did not want a Constitution; it does not want this services directive."
"The Austrian Presidency could end up in the history books as the first presidency to really listen to what the people want."
"If, however, a decision is made in favour of ramming a constitution and this services directive down people’s throats, then this will only strengthen the opposition to European cooperation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian Presidency, to whom we offer our best wishes, has many topics on which to reflect: the rejection of the European Constitution, now dead and departed, and the scepticism spreading among Europe’s peoples."
"We call on it to focus on a Europe of peoples and a Europe of regions."
"I have called for the city of Trieste to be considered the capital of the Europe of regions, since it is a city symbolising a Europe of different ethnic groups and of civilised coexistence among its various peoples."
"On the subject of people’s rights, I should like to mention the presence here outside Parliament of people from Istria, Dalmatia and Fiume."
"I wish to draw attention to the fact that their right to their property has again been trampled underfoot, even though the 1947 peace treaty provided for its protection."
"They are still here!"
"Chancellor Schüssel, I shall give you a dossier on this long-standing and highly sensitive issue."
"Let us uphold people’s rights and not allow Europe to be a Europe of Brussels technocrats."
"The circumstances that have led to people’s scepticism are due to the predominance of that Europe of technocrats and banks, a Europe that hopes that Turkey will join and that the Bolkestein directive will be adopted."
"We are for a different Europe: a Europe of peoples and regions."
"The wise must provide a voice for this deep-held feeling."
"Mr President, I have to say that I was amazed to hear the Austrian Minister for Economic Affairs advocating freezing of the Services Directive, whilst the focus of the Council’s work plan is on institutional issues."
"In this connection, I feel bound to ask whether it is intended to waste six months of our common time debating the rejected Constitutional Treaty?"
"I would also like to enquire as to what action is planned with a view to creating a common market for services within the European Union and lifting all barriers in the labour market."
"After all, it is now quite clear that there is no economic justification for the latter."
"I am particularly interested in the reaction to the illegal actions of the Swedish Trade Unions."
"Following the Latvian Vaxholm case, they are now planning to damage yet another construction company from a new Member State."
"In this case, the company affected is a Polish one named Zojax."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, if the Austrian presidency wants to combat the catastrophic rejection of the EU by broad sections of the European population, it needs to ask the right questions."
"In so doing, it would be wrong to avoid the key question, which is what the end result of this European integration process is supposed to be: a federal superstate with centralist tendencies, to which the abortive constitutional treaty would inevitably have led, or a confederation of states, a Europe of the nations."
"It would also be wrong to avoid considering how far Europe stretches and why some place like Islamic Anatolia should ever belong to Europe, or how far eastward enlargement should go and whether the process should not be more thoroughly prepared."
"The last unavoidable question is why the Union cannot function unless an even heavier burden is imposed on the top net contributors, to which Austria now also belongs."
"I very much hope that you do not continue to circumvent – elegantly, I admit, but embarrassingly – these questions that are central to the very future of Europe."
"If you do, people’s scepticism towards the EU will continue to grow under the Austrian presidency."
"President-in-Office, on behalf of the European Democrats in the PPE-DE Group, and as the first British Conservative to speak, I welcome you and wish you well."
"You take over the Council Presidency at an important time and, in the wake of the opportunities wasted by the British Presidency, you now have the chance to make real progress in a number of key areas."
"I sincerely hope that the economic reform agenda will be taken forward with some urgency."
"It stalled under the last Presidency and I urge you not to be deflected from pursuing the case for reform."
"I am somewhat concerned about the issue of the Services Directive, on which I believe you are planning some changes, and about your plans to coordinate social security systems."
"I hope you will not do anything that would damage the prospects of economic progress under such measures."
"I also ask you not to change the Working Time Directive opt-out which, certainly from a UK perspective, has been fundamental to that country’s economic wellbeing of late."
"I warmly welcome your call for a serious discussion on the role of the European Court of Justice."
"That is an extremely important debate because the Court has seemed in recent years to extend European competences into areas where there was decidedly no European law."
"It is therefore a timely debate and one which I am very pleased will take place."
"You have made a number of comments on the European Constitution."
"I wish to make it clear that we truly believe it would be sensible for the Constitution not to be resurrected at present."
"The remarks by the Dutch Foreign Minister cannot be ignored."
"The citizens of Europe do not want a more centralised State and they do not want a centralised Europe."
"At Laeken, at the beginning of the Convention process, the leaders stated that they wanted to reconnect the EU and its institutions with the people."
"The Constitution failed to do that."
"However, the people do want a Europe that deals with jobs, economic growth, the environment, and cooperation in fighting crime and terrorism."
"We must break out of the tired debate on institutions and constitutions."
"Let us focus on those areas in which the EU can add value to people’s quality of life and living standards."
"I wish you all good luck."
"Mr President, Chancellor, I fully agree with what the Chairman of my Group, Mr Schulz, said about the financial perspective."
"I sincerely hope, Chancellor, that with your negotiating skills you will show the necessary flexibility in the forthcoming negotiations with Parliament."
"The Chairman of my Group also underlined, as you did, how important it is for this spring Presidency to promote more growth and more jobs."
"I noted that you said that a possible perspective might be 3% growth and 1% reduction in unemployment in the coming years."
"This is a marvellous perspective and one that I endorse, but we need to use the right tools to achieve this target."
"Let us do it, but let us use the right tools to achieve it."
"I sent you a proposal a few days ago on a new growth strategy which the Socialist Group and the party share."
"Mr Schulz and I were in London just a day before Hampton Court, and there the Socialist leaders, presidents and prime ministers decided unanimously to bring before the European Union a new common growth strategy, recognising that we cannot achieve it merely by means of a European Union directive – we do not have the necessary competences."
"But we can do it together in a freely decided intergovernmental decision at the forthcoming spring Council meeting."
"I sincerely hope that you share this vision brought to you by the Socialist governments of Europe and that you will bring the forces on the other side together, whether they be grey or of any other colour."
"It is the results that count, as you said."
"This growth strategy has shown that if we boost growth as a combination of reforms and guided demand on intelligent investment in education, in active labour market policy, in child care, in research, in small and medium-sized firms, then we can do it."
"But what we need are common decisions at the spring Council and guarded and guided decisions over the next three to four years."
"I asked Commission President Barroso a couple of weeks ago whether we can do it."
"Could we make a new deal as a new start for the spring summit?"
"I got the impression, Mr Barroso, that you said ‘let us give it a try’."
"You have the opportunity, and if you do it, not only will the people of Europe hear the sound of Europe, but we will hear the voice of the people and then they will begin to listen to us. And then they will be ready to discuss a new treaty for Europe."
"Is that not worthwhile?"
"I think it is."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have many important tasks ahead of you in the next six months."
"You enumerated these tasks, and most of them relate to our everyday work here."
"I believe, however, that you have a far more basic task to undertake, namely to rediscover the European identity."
"If that common identity is not visible, it immediately raises a question: from where does the European Union draw its legitimacy?"
"You must look for answers to the question whether Europe is worthwhile for me or any other individual."
"Is it politically worthwhile? Is it financially worthwhile?"
"How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life?"
"What shows me that I am a European?"
"This is why you must conduct a public debate."
"Allow controversial contributions, for I am convinced that those who shut out criticism do more harm to Europe than its critics."
"At the same time, have the courage to launch unusual initiatives."
"I must say that I am very impressed by your activities in the arts."
"You are, after all, in charge of ."
"You are a team player."
"You are used to playing a tough game."
"Half of your ministers are women."
"So make Europe come alive in people’s minds!"
"That would be a success."
"Mr President, Federal Chancellor, there are three quite specific concerns that I should like to commend particularly to the current presidency of the Council."
"The first relates to the protection of minorities."
"We ethnic Austrians living in the Southern Tyrol/Alto Adige region have always received a great deal of understanding and support from Vienna."
"Let Austria be equally magnanimous towards the minorities within its own boundaries, such as the Carinthian Slovenes."
"What is happening at the present time in the dispute over place-name signs in Carinthia is grotesque."
"The second relates to ratification of the Transport Protocol to the Alpine Convention."
"If Austria does not settle this matter, which has long been a concern of the Alpine countries, who will?"
"The third relates to the need to prevent the construction of the Brenner base tunnel."
"Building a high-speed railway through the Alps is very hazardous for many reasons: mixed traffic on the old line and on the projected new line, high-speed passenger trains travelling through so many and such long tunnels, goods traffic on the Alpine railway, which would cause unreasonable nuisance to those who live nearby, and the premature construction of the tunnel complex itself without the simultaneous construction of the feeder lines."
"This new megaproject would be even more unprofitable than the Eurotunnel under the English Channel."
"Mr President, let me begin by welcoming the changeover to the Austrian presidency."
"Perhaps we shall now have hard and fast policies in place of all the air bubbles we had during the British presidency."
"Yet even so, Mr Schüssel, the programme for your presidency of the EU is alarming, especially in the field of foreign and military policy."
"On the one hand, we are told that the next steps with regard to the Treaty on a Constitution for Europe must be openly discussed."
"That is all very well, but the present constitutional treaty is dead."
"All we need now, essentially, is a date for the burial."
"On the other hand, some parts of the constitutional treaty which are needed for the pursuit of the Union’s military policy are simply being applied without ratification."
"This programme for the domain of military policy poses particular problems for a neutral country."
"Let me cite two examples: firstly, efforts are to be made to have the battle groups combat-ready by 1 January 2007; secondly, special priority is to be given to the so-called European Defence Agency."
"Do not give the EU a military face, Mr Schüssel; let it have a civilian and civilised one."
"– Chancellor, the recipe for success is very simple: take a large photograph of Blair, hang it opposite your desk and write underneath it 'I must not copy'."
"You are sure to succeed."
"The other recipe is not to be conciliatory."
"Stand by what you believe in."
"The conciliatoriness of 3 October 2005 is engraved in our memory."
"Another matter is that you should confine control of the Americans to the area and to the work of the CIA."
"Make sure they do not drag you into new ventures in the Middle East and do not, of course, try to resurrect the Constitution."
"What is dead is dead. It cannot be the vision for the peoples of Europe."
"On the other hand, look at changing the Maastricht indicators, because the developing countries of Europe cannot follow them."
"No to the strong euro which prevents industrial growth and no, of course, to the high interest rates which are ruining households."
"Another thing: when you applied in 1945 to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria, you were told no 'Germanic'."
"Now we are saying no 'Macedonia' in FYROM."
"Today the European Union is faced with such important internal and external challenges that it is not enough for the country currently holding the Presidency merely to continue with the work already begun."
"Does the Presidency’s proposed work programme reflect the essential tasks for the European Union?"
"In my view, the Presidency has pointed out accurately enough those problems which, unresolved, make it difficult to conceive of further successful development of the European Union."
"Clear answers must be found to the fundamental questions concerning the limits of the European Union’s enlargement and the extent of integration."
"This would make it possible to return to the debates on the Constitution with an altered level of mutual understanding."
"In the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy now is the last chance to match the intensity of day-to-day activities with the deadlines for its completion."
"A decision regarding the liberalisation of the services sector would not only open up new sources of economic activity within the context of the European Union market, but would also be the most significant support for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises that the European Union can provide."
"Strategic decisions in the field of security of energy supply are also a pressing task, in order to direct business research and infrastructure development activities into a strategic channel without delay."
"The country currently holding the Presidency should therefore not delay in setting out the fundamental problems and directing the Member States to seek solutions to them during the period of this Presidency."
"I have time to give only a very concise and basic message."
"Today at noon the European Parliament will reject the Council’s position concerning the long-term financial outlook for 2007-2013."
"The Parliament will also send a signal that it is prepared to continue discussing the financial outlook under the Austrian presidency, with the aim of reaching an agreement."
"This may create the conditions for Parliament to approve the budget at its plenary session in late March."
"Unless we are prepared to countenance a crisis within EU institutions, half of the Austrian presidency’s term will thus be overshadowed by efforts to find agreement on the budget."
"Finalising the budget outlook and incorporating at least some of the suggestions put forward by the European Parliament may prove instrumental for the attainment of some of the goals of the Austrian presidency."
"It may also prove instrumental in helping to meet the expectations of EU citizens in areas such as education, job creation, labour flexibility and cohesion policy."
"Mr President, Chancellor, there is no question that six months is not sufficient time to demand that the Chancellor resolve the current crisis in Europe by the end of his mandate."
"Nevertheless, six months may be long enough to point out the appropriate direction for this change and rectification that the European Union requires."
"I am therefore simply going to talk about two urgent issues which I believe are facing the European Union."
"Firstly, having heard all of us, Chancellor, you will see that the European Union has no problem with words, since almost all of us are asking for the same thing: more Europe and the incorporation of real problems into the operation of the European Union."
"The problem is not one of words, but one of attitudes."
"Every institution must adjust its attitude again and again when dealing with issues affecting Europeans."
"When the day comes when the European Parliament does not examine what the President-in-Office of the European Council is doing but rather what the Heads of Government that are not holding the Presidency are doing in the Councils, we shall undoubtedly be dealing with one of the problems of the European Union, which is the lack of tenacity, the lack of constant work on the part of all of the governments, even though they may not be holding the Presidency of the European Council."
"Secondly, Chancellor, within a few years, Europeans are going to have to identify and acknowledge the European Union’s political role in relation to the great problems facing us: energy, immigration, terrorism, growth and employment."
"At the moment, Europeans do not know what the European Union is doing on any of these issues; they do not evaluate, they do not criticise, they do not judge, because they do not know what the European Union is doing in these areas."
"We need to do some political work in order to make the public aware of what the European Union and its institutions are doing in these fields."
"That is the second great urgent issue facing the Union, Chancellor."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have chosen Mozart’s 250th anniversary, Chancellor, as one of the of your presidential programme."
"Some other Members have taken up that theme."
"With all due respect to Mozart, a different Austrian and European whose birth we commemorate this year would probably be more useful to us in providing therapy for Europe’s ailments."
"I am thinking here of Sigmund Freud, whose work included the study of inferiority complexes, frustration and narcissism, all of them conditions which seem to affect the European psyche."
"We have many inferiority complexes."
"You referred yourself to the European way of life."
"That is primarily a model built on social justice, a model we should be exporting."
"We should not be importing neo-liberal models into Europe from other parts of the world."
"I therefore appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, to seek musical harmony with Condoleezza Rice and the Bush Administration but not to sing from their political song sheet."
"Represent Europe self-confidently in the world."
"Frustration, as we know from Freud, derives from unfulfilled expectations."
"These are something that Europe provides all too often."
"For example, we promise thirty priority transport projects, and then a Financial Perspective is adopted which makes it impossible to fund these projects from either European or national resources."
"In Austria itself, your own Deputy Chancellor has already written off a project to which I attach great importance, namely the rail link between Prague and Linz."
"All of this, I believe, has to do with another condition that is especially prevalent in the European Council, namely narcissism and excessive egocentricity, which repeatedly prevent us from bringing Europe any further forward."
"Mr President, Chancellor, Mr President of the Commission, we reject the December budget agreement because it by no means fulfils the objectives of a more dynamic and competitive EU and because it does not guarantee an EU with a larger role on the international stage."
"Both you, Mr Barroso, and you, Mr Schüssel, have good advice on what we in the European Parliament should request and not request in the budget negotiations."
"We should like first and foremost, however, to have a larger and more flexible framework, and both of you have of course shown today that we shall need such a framework."
"Mr Schüssel, you are right in saying that it is time to draw a line under the more ideological opposition to an EU tax, for it is clear that, following enlargement, we are in a new situation."
"Not only are there far more countries around the table, but there are bigger differences between us in terms of prosperity."
"We must find a replacement for the present method of funding, which involves contributions from the national exchequers."
"Each country attaches far too much importance to its net contribution, rather than looking at the bigger picture."
"I agree that that is something we must draw a line under."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, in the , you supplied a vital piece of information: you pointed out that the Court of Justice should not use its judgments for the purposes of transferring powers to the Commission, and this outside the framework of the Treaties."
"We congratulate you on your ability to make things clear."
"In fact, the case law demonstrated by the ‘Marks [amp] Spencer’ judgment of 13 December 2005 shows that the Court of Justice has a teleological take on the Treaties that leads it to go beyond its rights."
"We want our Assembly, taking its lead from your Presidency, to redefine the role of the Court of Justice and to limit the consequences of its decisions."
"Mr Schüssel, if you want to reconcile the nations with Europe, then you should have only one aim: to use your authority to put the power back in the hands of the sovereign nations."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I expect from your Presidency is progress over negotiations on the European Constitution."
"I expect you finally to pluck up the courage to tell our citizens, loud and clear, that the text being foisted upon them by the politicians is impenetrable, iniquitous and, more importantly, does not in any way solve the crisis currently facing the European Union."
"There is in fact a precedent for European integration, an important foundation on which Austria can base this announcement to our citizens."
"Less than a hundred years ago, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was a unique confederation with common ministries for foreign affairs, war and finance, as well as a High Court of Auditors."
"It was made up of 21 European countries, in which the citizens spoke a number of languages, and it lasted for 51 years."
"What was its undoing?"
"Nobody had the courage to solve the kind of problems that such co-existence naturally brings."
"Politicians believed that problems would simply disappear of their own accord over time; and we know what came of that."
"I therefore hope, Mr President, that Austria will not take the same route as its predecessors, but will instead advocate that the European Constitution be recast in such a way that it is workable, concise, comprehensible and just."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian Presidency is starting at not an easy time for Europe, even though the agreement on the financial perspective may represent the beginning of a new chapter."
"The Union is faced, in fact, with a major attack from within and just as dangerous a threat from outside."
"The attack from within is coming from those who do not believe, or no longer believe, in the fundamental role that Europe can and must play."
"They are riding on a credibility crisis that has alienated too many citizens from institutions that they consider distant and governed by an all-powerful but inept bureaucracy."
"Europeans want a political Union that can solve those problems of theirs to which Member States and local bodies are unable to provide answers."
"That is why we must work for a more political Europe that reaches out to take care of people’s interests."
"We need a strong commitment to economic growth, which will create jobs; we need aid for small and medium-sized enterprises – as you mentioned – as well as budget reform and measures to address the important issue of immigration."
"There is also a need for a Constitution to enable us to attain these objectives, to simplify the legislative process, and to guarantee the continuity of political action."
"We are convinced that we can make progress in that direction over the next six months, and we look forward with confidence to 2007, when the German Presidency will happily coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Community Treaties and we can make constructive choices for the future of Europe."
"The Constitution is not dead: having it enter into force is a fundamental objective for us to pursue."
"The threat from outside is that of terrorism."
"We have to defend ourselves by enhancing internal cooperation, not only through judicial and policing initiatives, but above all by means of political action to make the Union a key player in bringing peace to the Middle East."
"The war on terrorism is waged primarily in that part of the world."
"Guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state are the keys to seeing freedom and peace triumph over violence and fundamentalism."
"Chancellor, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorse the Austrian Presidency’s proposals to revitalise Europe’s role and to close the gap between the Union’s institutions and its citizens."
"You can count on our help."
"We wish you every success in your work, Mr Schüssel."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, our discussions on the Financial Perspective are about to take place."
"You said at the beginning, Chancellor, that you were familiar with annual budgets from working with the national budget in Austria."
"We have one of those at the European level too."
"The difference is that we also have to try, within the framework of a voluntary Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council, to lay down common rules for a period of seven years governing both the volume of resources and their use."
"Since this is a voluntary agreement between two institutions, it is hardly surprising that one of the institutions is not prepared simply to accept the figures adopted at a summit meeting of the other institution on the basis of an assurance that the latter had gone as far as it could and that there was no more to be had."
"That would be the last straw!"
"Any Parliament that relied on such an assurance would be jeopardising one of its fundamental rights and reneging on its corresponding legal and practical responsibilities."
"Let us take a close look at your figures."
"We adopted the budget for 2006 only a few weeks ago."
"It amounts to 1.09% of GNP."
"In the Council, you said we should have to make do in future with 1.045%, which is considerably less."
"At the same time, we have major tasks ahead of us that have to be accomplished."
"These, however, can either not be adequately funded from a budget of this size, which would mean disappointing people, or else we must think of ways to achieve greater flexibility, so that we can keep our promises."
"Your pruning strategy gives us decisions to take."
"In which areas do you actually want to make cuts?"
"In the fight against terrorism?"
"I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced."
"In the realm of air safety, for which we are setting up an agency?"
"I do not believe we can afford to make any savings in these areas."
"What about exchanges of school pupils, students and trainees, who travel to other European countries to develop their own skills, work in a European environment and make themselves competitive in years to come?"
"Surely these exchanges are essential!"
"Research, you said, should be a national responsibility."
"Satellite navigation, large-scale lasers, neutron sources, genome banks: should research in all of these fields be limited to national efforts?"
"I do not think that is the way forward. We have done a great deal of work here to put a good proposal on the table."
"We shall negotiate responsibly with you, in a spirit of mutual trust, to determine what is possible."
"As Europeans, however, I believe we, all of us, should consider what this Europe is actually worth to us."
"Before any figures in billions are bandied about, let me say that I worked this out for the other German Members and myself."
"Our proposal means that every German would have to spend ten euros a month in future to make all these things happen."
"Anyone out there who says that we are utterly irrational in the European Parliament or that we are overshooting the mark really has no idea what Europe is worth."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Schüssel, ‘A whole new way of thinking is needed in order to solve the problems we have created with the old way of thinking’, said Albert Einstein, whom we mentioned earlier."
"I therefore have some specific questions."
"What, in practical terms, does the Presidency intend to do for small and medium-sized enterprises?"
"You say that you intend to create jobs through energy policy."
"Can you explain how?"
"Do you intend to support voluntary or compulsory targets where alternative energy and biomass are concerned?"
"That is also a very important issue."
"As is well-known, it is easier to fight for one’s principles than to live up to them."
"You talk a lot about the environment and consumer power."
"I therefore wish to ask, on the subject of the Chemicals Directive, whether you will fight to ensure that it is possible to replace the most dangerous chemicals of all and whether you will improve the Council agreement reached in December?"
"Will you add the right for the consumer to know which dangerous chemicals the product contains?"
"Finally, I should like to thank you for a very good conference in Vienna last week and wish you good luck with the Presidency."
"Mr President, I listened to you very carefully, Mr Schüssel, and I wish you every success as this new year begins."
"The UK Presidency was all about fine speeches."
"Your own Presidency has to be all about action."
"Humble proposals and effective action are required."
"What Europeans expect from you is not more flowery rhetoric and endless broken promises; they expect real practical action relevant to everyday life."
"I approve of your desire to restore confidence among Europeans, but you will forgive me if I am still sceptical."
"I will take just the one example, which is particularly close to my heart: paediatric medicines."
"Today, our children have very few medicines developed specially for them."
"We can conclude this matter as quickly as possible."
"Our Parliament voted at first reading, and the Council gave its political agreement, but the common position seems to be held up for unjustified reasons."
"I am waiting for you personally, Mr Schüssel, to make a commitment - before us in this Chamber - to make this text a priority with a view to bringing it to fruition under your Presidency."
"I am concerned because I have not, in your programme, found the slightest mention of this extremely important matter, which is designed to benefit our children and which shows everyone the added value contributed by Europe."
"I await your support and, in return, you will be able to count on my determination."
"Mr Schüssel, restoring the European Parliament’s confidence in the Council will be a hard task because Europe cannot survive without a real budget."
"There is so much that we need to do, build and develop and so much that we need to bring to each citizen."
"Well, with what the Council is proposing – with this poor Council agreement on the financial perspective – we can, as it were, stop our parliamentary activities immediately, shut up shop and go on holiday."
"Keep that squarely in mind."
"Mr Schüssel, I wish you luck."
"Mr President, as regards the 2007-2013 budget, please make every effort as Chancellor of the neighbouring state to ensure that the Interinstitutional Agreement is concluded, because new Member States have no time to waste."
"If the seven-year draft budget is not in place, we will lose two thirds of our assistance, and if the draft is delayed any longer, we will not be able to prepare for the large structural and cohesion projects."
"We believe that it is very important to have a better budget, but we would like to preserve all the positive, significant opportunities given to new Member States in December in respect of the utilisation of structural and cohesion funds."
"As regards the Constitution, this was the first enlargement that had not been preceded by deepening."
"Deepening cannot be achieved without the Constitution, and you can count on Hungary in this respect; two states cannot block 23 others."
"As regards the competitiveness of the European Union, the Services Directive and the liberalisation of the free movement of labour are indispensable."
"In Ireland, for instance, unemployment did not rise, but actually fell following liberalisation of the free movement of labour."
"Finally, as a Hungarian, I am very pleased that you are dealing with the Balkans, because there is a great danger: if the status of Montenegro and Kosovo is not settled by the European Union, there will be destabilisation in the West Balkans, because the Americans do not know much about minority issues."
"At the same time, as President of the Minority Intergroup, I would like to repeat what Mr Hannes Swoboda has already said, and I look forward to your answer, Mr President, regarding the issue of the Austrian Slovenes."
"President-in-Office, President Chirac says he would like piecemeal reform."
"Mr Sarkozy says he wants a concentrated constitution and a core group of the six larger Member States."
"Mrs Merkel says she would like a social protocol."
"Mr Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt want a renegotiation of the treaty."
"Mr Bot says that the project is finished."
"Prime Minister Blair maintains a profound silence on the whole question."
"Which of your colleagues can be right?"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, we broadly welcome the main guidelines, and as I have just two minutes, I shall touch on two points which, to my mind, should be examined without double standards."
"The first of these is energy security."
"Most of our fossil fuels come from areas suffering major political instability, such as the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria."
"No matter how much we reassess our reserves, and we negotiate long-term contracts, there will always be a threat to our energy supplies in Europe."
"The time has come to examine the nuclear option with a cool head, because otherwise we will be living with this sword dangling permanently above our heads."
"The second issue to which you referred, Mr Schüssel, was that of growth, employment, globalisation and the Lisbon Strategy."
"On this issue, we must once again avoid double standards."
"I cannot recall any European project that has not been realised, developed and monitored by the Commission."
"The time has come to say that this strategy, which has been pursued not on the basis of a Commission proposal but on the basis of intergovernmentalism, has stagnated and is not working."
"The Commission must be called upon to do more."
"It needs to set out and monitor a roadmap, as happened with the internal market and the single currency."
"We still believe that the notion that intergovernmentalism can help the Lisbon Strategy to thrive is deeply flawed."
"We must not pull the wool over the citizens’ eyes; what we should say is: give the Commission the power that it needs to help the Lisbon Strategy to work."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened to your programme I feel relieved, firstly because of the clearness of a sentence that you uttered early on in your speech: ‘There is a need for more Europe’."
"I do not think that that is a mere cliché, because in my view it represents the crux of the difference between us at this time."
"There are some who think that we can only find a way out of this impasse by taking a leap forward along the road to integration and a political Europe, whereas others delude themselves that we can have great projects and great objectives while cutting back on Europe’s ambitions, resources and policies."
"That is a fallacy, a deception that we have seen before from those who actually have a hidden agenda and from those in the Member States that do not want to accept their own responsibilities."
"The other significant word, Mr President-in-Office, is ‘consistency’: if we want that Europe of which you have spoken, we shall need your help."
"Please help us – Parliament – over the coming weeks to change the financial perspective, which was the result of national fears and self-interest, and is likely to destroy Europe instead."
"Help us to get the constitutional process off the ground again, in order to aim for greater integration, to put the Treaty of Nice behind us as soon as possible, and to ensure that, insofar as the Treaties allow, we and the countries that so desire can at any rate press ahead with policies that are essential for the Union."
"I speak of consistency because that is the most difficult concept to guarantee at this time."
"It is inconsistency, however, and those declarations that are sometimes heard even here in Parliament but are not confirmed by events, which are today the main reasons for the gap between Europe and its institutions and Europe’s citizens."
"Mr President of the Commission, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start with an observation about this debate. It is very striking, to my mind, that the arguments that are used on the extreme Left, on the extreme Right and by the independentist forces are identical."
"Maybe this is food for thought."
"Let me now turn to the presidency’s programme, Mr Schüssel."
"First of all, also on behalf of my group, I should like to wish you all the very best with it."
"Above all, though, I should like to congratulate you on, and wish you well with, the focus on the Balkans with a particular emphasis on the Western Balkans, and wish you all the best for the conference in Salzburg."
"In these times of what is known as enlargement fatigue, this is a very important sign, for which I, on behalf of my group, am particularly indebted to you."
"Mr President, most continents take billions of years to develop."
"The Erste Bank, which one can certainly regard as a continent, started out in 1997 with 60 000 customers and has grown to the point where it has, today – according to what I have just read in an advertisement – 12.5 million account holders in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia."
"Mr President, Austria has made use of the unique opportunities provided by reunification, and is to be congratulated for it. At the same time, Austria is one of those Member States who know very well what still needs to be done before we take the enlargement one step further, to ensure that the 2004 enlargement is effective, opportunities are gradually equalised and dissimilarities are reduced."
"Economic growth, more jobs – this is the topic of the Presidency Conference to be held in March."
"In order to achieve this, we expect the Austrian Presidency to ensure that Europe is not divided by unjustified or artificially induced fears."
"The free movement of people or services must be on the agenda."
"What we need is an obstacle-free common market."
"The countries that joined in 2004 suffer from the complete absence of a strong stratum of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We expect the Austrian Presidency to propose initiatives in conjunction with national governments to ensure that SMEs, which create the majority of jobs, are encouraged to take root and develop in these countries, as well."
"Regulation or a framework programme for competitiveness must be on the agenda."
"We expect the Austrian Presidency to ensure that, together with Parliament, we achieve a numerical improvement in the seven-year budget."
"And when this is done, we must immediately facilitate the utilisation of available funds!"
"Let us eliminate, at last, the obstacles that hinder the already difficult utilisation of funds, whether by delays in time or the excessive restrictions imposed."
"The objective is not repayment at the end of the year, but utilisation."
"We need a more flexible budget."
"Mr Chancellor, we welcome the Austrian Presidency and count on you."
"Mr President, I could have been Austrian because I come from a region – Brittany – in which, in the 15th century, the daughter of the Duke was married to Maximillian of Austria."
"However, the marriage was unconsummated and broken off, which makes me a sixteenth generation French citizen."
"I used this historical reference for the purposes of capturing your attention and of illustrating a strong argument regarding the budget."
"Firstly, be wary of this Parliament because it is a parliament under construction, and therefore it sometimes rebels: Mr Buttiglione did not bow down to the criticism made of him."
"As for the dockworkers: the intention is to serve us up the same old menu, but we are not going to eat from it and we are going to cast a simple majority vote."
"Be wary of this Parliament. ‘Wary’ is not the right word, but Parliament can react and it can rebel."
"Parliament therefore needs to be given a bit of money or, rather, a bit of extra money."
"I am going to point out a heading that I would like to see receive a bit of extra money: citizenship, youth, education and culture."
"Put a bit of extra money into that!"
"Why?"
"Because, as a French citizen, what took place in my country on 29 May has left a deep impression on me."
"As far as I am concerned, 29 May is an historic date."
"It is not just any old date, and the debates in which I have participated have at times been harsh: it is all very well talking about the market and the euro, but you should put a few more resources into that heading."
"Do it for the sake of European awareness, because history is reversible."
"Any treaty that has been concluded can be broken."
"Mr President, at the start of the Austrian Presidency I should like to wish Chancellor Schussel every success."
"I trust the European Union’s common foreign policy will be part of that success."
"Democracy, human rights and peace are crucial to a number of issues the Union is currently dealing with."
"I refer to Iran, Russia and China."
"Europe should speak with a single common voice in all three cases, not only because what Europe says should demonstrate the ethical dimension of European foreign policy, but also to ensure that the relevant instruments are applied, even though we do not yet have a Constitutional Treaty."
"Two Member States of the European Union are permanent members of the UN Security Council."
"Four Member States of the Union belong to the G8."
"One of these countries ought to be authorised to represent the European Union and speak on its behalf."
"I hope this will come about during your term in office, Chancellor."
"Mr President, to the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission I want to say the following: let us stop talking about the Lisbon Process as a process in itself."
"Let us instead talk about what we have done and what we need to do in order to turn the relevant aims and demands into reality, by which I mean achieve European competitiveness."
"Otherwise, all references to the Lisbon Process will be no more than a device for distracting attention from what is not being done."
"Let us talk about what needs, in actual fact, to be done."
"Implement the Services Directive."
"That is the most practical thing we can do to strengthen European competitiveness."
"Ensure that it is done on the basis of a respect for European diversity that makes the most of each country’s competitiveness."
"That is not only the most important measure for strengthening European competitiveness, it is also the most important thing we can do to bring about the reunification of Europe and ensure that all European countries can experience growth, as well as relations unimpeded by borders."
"Ensure that the long-term budget that emerges from the negotiations with Parliament is characterised by higher priority being given to research and development."
"This is one of the individual measures we can take that will help more than anything else to turn Europe into a leading knowledge-based society."
"Ensure that Europe can take vigorous unified action in the context of its policy on Iran, which is at present conducting a policy that is neither acceptable in the international community nor in accordance with the demands that need to be made of every country."
"A country that threatens to annihilate another country, that secretly develops nuclear fuel technology and that supports terrorism must be confronted by a common unified European policy in alliance with our international partners."
"These tasks are basically European ones that show why European cooperation is needed."
"The Council and the Commission have a great responsibility to ensure that policy is characterised by practical efforts to implement the relevant measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, almost two years ago, as we were about to join the distinguished and respected association which the European Union undoubtedly is, it was our assumption that we would become equal members, accorded the same status as the other members, and that the citizens of our states would enjoy the same rights, just as when Austria acceded to the EU."
"It appears, however, that some countries are finding it difficult to uphold the full range of freedoms on which the EU was initially based."
"I would like to urge Mr Schüssel and the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero Waldner, as Austria’s representatives in the European Commission, to make sure that these highly discriminatory measures are dismantled during the Austrian presidency."
"I am an MEP for Slovakia and I firmly believe, Chancellor, that the citizens of the Slovak Republic as well as the citizens of all the other Member States that have recently acceded to the Union should be enjoying the same rights as the citizens of the other EU Member States."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, you can be certain that, after a presidency that was characterised by stagnation, our expectations of the Austrian Presidency are particularly high."
"It is up to you, Mr Schüssel, building on the report that is due to be issued during your period in office, to outline perspectives for the future of Europe."
"This is not just about the European Constitution, although the fact is that Europe cannot grow any further without it."
"It is also about Europe’s future prosperity, growth and employment."
"The Council must set priorities, thus giving true shape to the Lisbon Strategy."
"That is also how competitiveness is strengthened and the European model of prosperity safeguarded."
"It is also about the future of the European social model, which Mr Schüssel was right to mention this morning."
"Six months ago, Prime Minister Blair was unstinting in his efforts to modernise the European social model."
"An additional summit was dedicated to it, albeit without any tangible results to show for it."
"No answer has been found to the challenge of globalisation and no measures have been taken to re-anchor the European social model in a society that is changing and ageing, one in which the number of young people is decreasing, and a society in which borders are no longer borders."
"I would urge Mr Schüssel to ensure that his presidency goes beyond fine rhetoric."
"Let us work together to breathe new life into our European social model, and let us then tackle those who create differences between the market and its smooth functioning on the one hand and social policy – which is so crucial to our citizens’ well-being – on the other."
"It is not a matter of doubt that Christian Democrats, too, see the socially oriented market economy as the cornerstone of a society that builds on people."
"I admit that in my own circles, and among the Socialists too, free market thinking is gaining ground and that one sometimes has the feeling of being a voice in the wilderness."
"I hope that this presidency, along with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is set to report on this, will manage to put this on a surer foundation."
"I would thank the President very much for being accommodating in this respect."
"– Mr President, now that the financial crisis at the December European Council has been successfully headed off, we are facing the tasks of overcoming the institutional crisis and of putting the Union on the kind of footing that will enable it to address the challenges posed by the globalised world."
"I warmly welcome the fact that one of Austria’s stated priorities is to put the European Constitution back on the agenda."
"In this regard, however, I should like to warn of the pitfalls lying in wait along the route that the Commission – and Parliament, albeit only in part – have chosen to follow, which is to hold more and more debates on citizens’ expectations, and subsequently to prepare a new text that would seek both to resolve the issue of institutional reform and to address all of Europe’s economic, social and security-related problems."
"If we strike out on that path we shall be repeating the mistake that lay at the root of last year’s failed referendums, when anyone harbouring reservations over the EU’s internal policies rallied in opposition to the Constitution, irrespective of their views on the Union’s institutional framework."
"We made the mistake of putting forward for ratification a Constitution which, alongside the rules on the functioning of institutions, also contained a summary of all common policies."
"What we now need, ahead of the forthcoming enlargement and in the light of ongoing changes to the international order, is to separate the constitutional framework, namely the first and second parts of the constitutional treaty, from the common policies in the third part."
"The first and second parts of the Constitution were not the subject of debate before the referendum, and their ratification would enable us to seek workable solutions to the most contentious issues currently affecting the continent, by reforming the rules governing institutional competencies."
"If we wish to solve everything in one go, we shall once again end up solving nothing."
"The main outcome of the Austrian Presidency should be a workable plan, whereby debate over the reform of Europe’s institutions is kept separate from the general debate on other problems affecting Europe."
"Mr President, Presidents of the three institutions, ladies and gentlemen, there is no such thing as a miracle formula for a successful presidency, but ambition and constructive cooperation between the institutions go a long way towards that end, and, as you have heard, you can count on our group’s support."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we will not be able to assess whether your presidency will have been successful until six months down the line, but in order to put you on the right track – or keep you on it, for I greatly appreciated your introduction – there are two concrete suggestions I should like to make."
"Firstly, I would urge you to find a structural solution to the long-standing issue concerning the definitive list of goods and services that are eligible for the optional reduced VAT rate."
"We have procrastinated long enough."
"We must now take decisions."
"The industries that are shown the carrot of the reduced rate – which includes the catering industry, but also other SME sectors – do not get what they want."
"Those who have emerged from the experiment with labour-intensive services, which has been extended three times, are in untenable legal uncertainty."
"Since I do not believe that the Commission will be able to tolerate manifest infringements of the sixth VAT directive for much longer, this strikes me as a priority area for action."
"Secondly, I am delighted to hear that you would like to combine openness and protection in the services directive."
"In this House, we do not shirk the hard work either in order to reach a widely supported, positive majority."
"If you compare the Commission’s original proposal with the result of the work in this Parliament’s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, you will see that a different approach is possible through amendments."
"If the Council supports us in this long-term ambition, this delicate dossier may well be able to turn a corner under your presidency."
"I wish the Austrian Presidency – in the service of the European Union, as you yourself have put it – much success in these two, but also in the other, items on the agenda."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, allow me to adopt something of Mr Poignant’s tone and add a few things of my own to this budgetary wish list."
"Unfortunately, the budget is too small."
"Your country, Austria, is a member of the ‘club of six’, the ‘one per cent club’, the ‘club of penny pinchers’ which wants more Europe with less money."
"Yet, as the Presidency, Mr Schüssel, you must allocate more money to the Neighbourhood Policy in the East and to this new challenge constituted by EU energy security."
"Otherwise, we are going to rebel against the overly greedy Councils, just like Mr Poignant said."
"The Austrian Presidency’s intention to work for growth and jobs, competitiveness and the Lisbon Agenda is most laudable."
"Such objectives can be achieved only through the completion of the internal market."
"The best service we can render to Lisbon, growth and jobs is to open labour and services markets."
"Austria has explicitly recognised in its White Paper that the Services Directive is essential for completing the internal market and reinforcing European competitiveness."
"Yet when it comes to taking concrete steps to achieve the declared objectives, the Presidency’s pronouncements are much less reassuring."
"Soon there will be an initial review of the transition period for introducing freedom of movement of workers."
"But Austria declared that it will use this opportunity to extend the transition period in the area of free movement of workers, and it takes the reductionist position on the free movement of services."
"Are Austria’s declarations as Presidency consistent with its intentions as a Member State?"
"On the one hand, the Presidency’s declared objective is boldness in fighting for Europe’s competitiveness, on the other, Vienna strives to stifle Europe’s potential."
"Enlargement was supposed to bring the European Union great benefits, increasing its competitiveness in global trade, largely through the influx of highly qualified, mobile and relatively cheap labour."
"Now, certain Member States, including Austria, regardless of the positive examples of Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden, want to forgo those crucial benefits, introducing transition periods immediately after enlargement."
"Mr President, Mr Federal Chancellor and President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually very happy with the way in which roles are allocated in the European Union, with Chancellor Schüssel as both Chancellor and President of the Council and President Barroso chairing the Commission."
"This arrangement is beneficial for the European Union and also for our own country."
"Fortuitously enough, the commencement of the Austrian Presidency of the Council coincides with my departure from the European Parliament at the end of ten years in which I have had the privilege of leading the delegation of the Austrian People’s Party – ten years in which the European Union has undergone drastic changes, and so have we."
"Pride of place among these dramatic changes goes to the enlargement of the European Union, for which I worked in many different capacities, and which has strengthened both the European Union and Austria."
"Our growth from 15 to 25 members is not now, any more than it was before, cause for our people to feel unsettled."
"It was not too rapid; it was the right response at the right time after the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new start in Europe."
"While a further process of growth is of course necessary, what is important is something to which I am glad that the President of the Council referred, namely the standards that we must adhere to when incorporating new members into the European Union – standards that we must take seriously, standards that we cannot and must not undermine and subvert with a nod and a wink."
"Europe’s growth is dependent on the fight against corruption, the fight for the rule of law and for proper, democratic and transparent administration."
"Both institutionally and psychologically, Europe’s businesses and industries, Europe’s people and the European Union itself must be capable of absorbing the impact of enlargement; this is a criterion that we must apply in the forthcoming enlargement rounds involving Romania and Bulgaria, both of which will, I hope, meet the requirements in good time."
"In his speech, the President of the Council referred to a number of things that I would like to highlight."
"The first is that Europe needs strong own resources."
"If, my dear Wolfgang, you manage to inject new ideas into the European debate and get Europe to at last get down to actually having this debate on own resources, that would be a great step forward."
"I have to say, by the way, that I think you have enough negotiating skill to solve the major problem of the forthcoming Financial Perspective by an accommodating attitude towards the European Parliament, which will make it easier for Parliament and the Commission to draw closer to the Council on this issue."
"The second aspect that I would like to highlight is one that I regard as positive, namely Europe’s need for solutions to be reached between the two sides of industry and its self-evident inability, in this dynamic and global growth process, to abandon the concept of partnership between them."
"That is an important and basic premise."
"You have seen the dockers demonstrating here; social partnership cannot be used to put the brake on economic growth, but must, on the contrary, be a motor for it."
"At the end of the day, Europe and the European Union do need energy, not only in the literal sense of the word, but political energy too, and so let me conclude with an appeal."
"We need to give more attention to the neighbourhood policy, to the policy that makes it possible for the European Union to devote its attention to a country as important as Ukraine."
"There can be no ‘one size fits all’ approach where this is concerned."
"We need to give special attention to the development of democracy in Ukraine and to that country’s economic independence."
"I am certain that a number of things will be done about that under this Presidency."
"Thirdly, there is a need for restraint where the proliferation of nuclear weapons is concerned."
"We wish Mrs Stenzel the best of luck in her new position in her country."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by joining in a great big ‘thank you’ to Ursula Stenzel for the ten years’ work she has done for Austria and for Austria’s citizens here in the European Parliament – with people in every political grouping and every institution."
"Perhaps I might add that she will, in a sense, be in charge of me, as she will be a sort of Mayor of central Vienna, which makes me now one of her charges and subjects."
"I wish her all the best for the future."
"Perhaps I might, very briefly, address certain topics that have been raised in this debate."
"I am grateful to all those who have raised the issue of enlargement, with particular reference to the prospects for the Balkans."
"I shall be brief about this, for I have already been in touch with almost all the groups about it, and I know that you know that this is a high-priority issue for Austria, for the very simple reason that the Balkans are right next door to us – according to an old joke, the Balkans begin at the Rennweg in district III in central Vienna – and we are directly affected by what goes on there."
"If we in Europe do not export stability, we will end up importing instability."
"There must be no unstable zone in between Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Italy and Greece."
"There must not be a grey area there, but rather a place with prospects, without which the necessary impetus for reform and the reconciliation of the various ethnic groups in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo will not, at the end of the day, be possible."
"That is something that everyone must be aware of."
"It is with that in mind that we are committing ourselves, and we have now also given the UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari a base and an office in Vienna, where in-depth discussions are a daily occurrence."
"We know that this is a task for us all to perform."
"I might well add that the Balkans is one of Europe’s great success stories."
"It may well have been the Americans who defeated Milosevic by military means, but 90% of the troops keeping the peace there today are Europeans."
"What we present to the world there now is not the military face of the European Union, but the pacific countenance of Europe."
"That is something of which everyone must be made aware."
"It is worth mentioning that we are celebrating not only the 250th anniversary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s birth and 150th of Sigmund Freud’s, but also the centenary of the first award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to a woman, Bertha von Suttner."
"Her slogan, – lay down your weapons – is a real programme, and particularly relevant to the 21st century when one thinks of Iran, about which I had a conversation yesterday with Mohammed El Baradei – the IAEA, too, is based in Vienna."
"Iran is an issue of the utmost concern."
"Mr El Baradei said, in a readable interview in the latest issue of , that, even after his inspectors had spent three years in intensive talks, closely examining and monitoring Iran’s nuclear programme, it was still not possible to confirm that it was peaceable in character, and that is an issue to which we will be devoting a great deal of attention over the coming months."
"It is not for us to make threatening gestures about it; on the contrary, we have to send a clear message from Europe that bids Iran go back to the moratorium, back to the negotiating table, with no unilateral actions that could end up putting the peace of the wider world in jeopardy, and that message must be carried by your House, by the Council, by the Commission, and by our representatives Benita Ferrero-Waldner and Javier Solana."
"That is the only way in which we will gain credibility in that part of the world."
"Let me turn to the subject of energy, which is something else that I do not want to mince my words about."
"I do know, of course, that every country has its own way of dealing with this issue, but I have campaigned for every country, at the end of the day, to have freedom of choice when it comes to its means of generating energy, and even then there are a number of issues that are certainly open to debate."
"I personally believe that it would be very, very dangerous to go down the road that leads to a revival of nuclear power, and there are many issues around it that have not yet been resolved."
"It is a field in which public concern must not be underestimated."
"At European level, though, we can address the issue of renewable energy, about which Mr Barroso has come up with some truly first-class ideas, and biofuels, in which, might I add, the Americans are investing five times as much as Europe and its Member States combined."
"This is an area in which we need credibility."
"We have renewable resources, we have wood, we have biomass."
"As I see it, that presents agriculture with an opportunity over the coming years and decades."
"Without, of course, disregarding the need to take account of the differences that do of course exist between the Member States, this is an issue that we should address very honestly and very frankly."
"The next issue I would like to look at is that of the trans-European networks."
"I have been a member of the European Council for ten years; once, when I was foreign minister, I was even in charge of an Austrian Council Presidency."
"For ten years, we have been talking about trans-European networks, and, so far, not one single project has been brought to a conclusion."
"Let me make that clear to you; we must succeed in this."
"It really is an ambition of mine – and I hope that the Commission will help us in this – to get at least the first sod dug on the Brenner railway tunnel project during our Presidency."
"If we want to get traffic off the roads, we have to have a competitive rail infrastructure to get it on to; to that there is no alternative."
"What I ask is that we should play our part in eventually making a success of these Trans-European networks; everything else is rhetoric."
"One thing that I forgot to mention when discussing international issues is the CIA question, and that we are taking very seriously."
"If I may be perfectly frank about this, there must be no difference in standards here; human rights are indivisible, and so is the rule of law."
"At the time the American public started to debate this, I happened to be with the Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington, where we met with the Republican Deputy Majority Leader in the Senate, Senator Bennett, and we addressed the issue in precisely those terms."
"We therefore give our entire support to the Council of Europe in its investigations, and I would also ask the Member States to conduct their own where necessary."
"There can be no double standards here: hidden jails, secret flights, the handing over of undesirable persons, are things that must of course, where they as suspected, be pursued with the full rigour of the law, but it must be done in accordance with our own legal standards."
"I have no doubt that your House and our Council will take the same approach to this and go forward together."
"I am much obliged to you for the observation that we have to give much more consideration to children’s rights."
"We note with great concern that appalling things are going on in this area, with child pornography being transmitted around the globe via the Internet, with people trafficking involving the sale of children around the world, with far too little understanding even in European, developed societies of the need to protect children’s rights, support families, and balance work and family life – all these matters are clearly, of course, for nation states to deal with, but they can be raised at Community level."
"Some of you have raised the subject of the rights of minorities in Austria, and it is one that I am happy to deal with."
"During my term of office – since the year 2000, that is – town signs in the Croatian and Hungarian languages have been set up in Burgenland; this has been the occasion for great popular celebrations, has involved a great deal of public participation, and there has been a consensus in its favour."
"Last year indeed, only a matter of a few months ago, as part of the celebrations of our State Treaty’s anniversary, 20 towns and villages acquired additional bilingual signs, and this was a great success."
"In some boroughs, things have not progressed far enough."
"Last Friday, I met with 12 mayors in their boroughs in the quest for a shared solution."
"Although I am making this commitment to your House, it is not your House that should be concerning itself with this issue; on the contrary, it is primarily a matter for us back in Austria."
"I will not accept the accusation that we, in Austria, take less account of minority rights than do other regions of Europe, but I do want consensus among the political forces, and I want to seek it with the people."
"I am also confident that we will succeed in finding it."
"Turning to the labour market, an agreement has been reached with the ten or twelve new Member States."
"Ten are already on board, and Bulgaria and Romania are yet to be added."
"I am actually very confident that the new governments will be very cooperative about this in order to be able to keep to the 2007 target date, but these agreements include transitional rules that apply not only to the new countries but also to the existing Member States."
"I want to say, very frankly, that this has been done by mutual agreement."
"It is also my duty, as head of the Austrian Government, to take care that neither side of Austrian industry is put under excessive strain and that the balance between openness and protection – to which a number of speakers here have referred – is maintained in this case."
"I would also add that, in border regions, we are endeavouring to help by way of flexible arrangements for specific sectors – the care sector, for example – and so far, in fact, they have worked very well."
"All I want to do where the European Court of Justice is concerned is to start off a debate in this House, without going into details."
"Here, too, there needs to be a certain balance between compliance with Community law and its implementation on the one hand and the subsidiarity clauses contained in the Treaties on the other, for there are such things as national rights, and national legislators, national law courts and the European Court of Justice need, in interpreting laws, to take account of them, and also to assess proportionality, as the German, Austrian and French Supreme Courts routinely do."
"All these things need to be kept in a reasonable balance, and I do not doubt that the European Court of Justice is aware of its responsibilities in this respect."
"In closing, I would like to come back to the point that Mr Schulz made about Mozart and Freud and the magic flute, and to what others said about Zeus."
"I am far more modest and believe that six months’ worth of Presidency can never, realistically speaking, be enough to change Europe. That much is clear."
"We can, however, get things started."
"For example, we want to get the financial perspective off the ground, and we want to do it together with you."
"For that to happen, we need your agreement, and we will seek it."
"We have to give thought to what are the ideal means to this end."
"It was Austria that had originally proposed that the European Investment Bank should get some EUR 10 billion extra as a research facility – that is an important forward step made possible by a public/private partnership."
"There are different ideas of what flexibility means – with amounts between approximately EUR 1 billion and some EUR 3.5 – 4 billion between them – and they leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre."
"These issues need to be addressed in a dialogue founded upon trust."
"First, of course, I need a mandate, and Austria will be getting one from the other Member States in a matter of a few weeks; we will be able to start talking with you as soon as the Commission has come up with its own practical proposals for sharing this out among the various headings."
"I am sure that we will be able to make more funds available to you in the areas you are interested in – namely research and competitiveness – than was made available during the previous period."
"There is something else that should not be overlooked: the financial perspective provides for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s costs to be fully covered by the common agricultural policy, so that adds up to EUR 8 billion included in the current financial perspective."
"In real terms, resources are being cut by 4%, and EUR 8 billion are additionally being set aside for Romania and Bulgaria."
"If we look at these things in a realistic and practical light, then I believe that we will certainly, by way of dialogue founded upon trust, be able to sort something out."
"I have no magic flute to hand, any more than I have a conductor’s baton or a magician’s wand, but, if I may refer back to Osmin, it is interesting to note that he actually ends up losing, and what is also interesting is what Constanze, who for our purposes is Europe, says to him at the end: ‘Nothing is as hateful as revenge, but only to great souls is it given to be humane and kindly and to forgive without self-seeking.’"
"Let us, then, be great souls and do something for Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schüssel has already answered questions concerning the programme of the Austrian Presidency."
"To conclude, let me simply sum up by giving you a broad outline of how I see this Presidency evolving."
"There will be two key moments: the Spring European Council and the June European Council."
"The first is designed to implement the new system of governance and the new growth and employment strategy, and the second to take decisions on our measures concerning Europe’s future."
"First, a very important issue needs to be settled with the European Parliament: the question of the 2007-2013 financial perspective."
"You are well aware of the Commission’s position on this matter."
"You know how hard the Commission has worked to reach an agreement that is as ambitious as possible."
"We believe, in fact, that it was important to obtain an agreement among the Member States."
"Imagine what the state of mind would be in Europe today if we did not at least have the agreement that it was possible to reach in the European Council."
"That being said, there is still room for manoeuvre where the negotiations are concerned."
"My appeal and that of the entire Commission is a very sincere appeal for realism in these negotiations."
"We believe, in fact, that any further delays could really jeopardise the application of the new financial perspective starting from 1 January 2007."
"If that were to happen, then those who would suffer the most would be precisely the new Member States or the regions of Europe that require more solidarity."
"We therefore believe that there is still room for negotiation, but we need to embark on these negotiations with ambition and realism and with a great sense of responsibility."
"If we succeed in resolving this problem, then we will be best placed to ensure that the Spring European Council is a great success."
"This is the first time that we are applying the new Lisbon system of governance."
"The Member States have all already submitted their national reform programmes."
"We are going to present our assessment on 25 January, and I will come to this Chamber to present it to you."
"I believe that we now have the conditions necessary to give Europe a boost in the areas of growth and employment."
"We must be clear on this subject, however: we have priorities."
"Mr Schüssel highlighted some of these priorities, including research, small and medium-sized enterprises and energy, all cases in which the Hampton Court Agenda usefully supplements the Lisbon Agenda."
"Yet, if we really want growth in Europe, then we genuinely need to have a single market in Europe."
"The great task now – that of the Commission’s and Parliament’s mandate – is to ensure that the single market works in an enlarged Europe."
"There are 25 of us now, and we need to remember that fundamental freedoms exist that were at the heart of the European Community project: the free movement of goods, undoubtedly, but also the free movement of capital, services and persons, including workers."
"While we genuinely want Europe, we know that it has to be far more than a market: Europe is a political project and a social project."
"For Europe to be both of these, we must guarantee fundamental freedoms throughout its territory, by taking care not to create any divisions between the old and the new Member States."
"We are all now members of this European Union, which is based on the idea of solidarity."
"Finally, the June European Council must take a decision regarding Europe’s future."
"While we are on that subject, I believe that Mr Duff’s question is very important."
"It is true that there are some appreciable differences, and we are of the opinion that we need to tackle this debate carefully, with an awareness of our responsibilities."
"On that basis, we believe that it is possible, with the June European Council in mind, to finalise the broad lines of the agenda on Europe’s future, to reach a new consensus with a view to progressing our European project and to find the best opportunity for resolving the institutional issues that do, in fact, need resolving."
"The debate is closed."
"– The Austrian Presidency is beginning its term of office at a particularly critical time in the life of the EU, and with a number of important tasks pending, such as negotiations with Parliament on the financial perspective to ensure that it addresses the need for solidarity and economic and social cohesion; the rejection of proposals for directives on the liberalisation of ports, and of the notorious Bolkestein Directive on the creation of the internal market for services, which will undermine the rights of workers, consumers and service users; and a clear decision to reject the so-called European Constitution in light of the results of the French and Dutch referendums."
"There also needs to be a sea change in monetarist policies and macro-economic priorities if we are to address the socio-economic problems faced by a number of countries."
"Such a change will involve scrapping the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a proper Social Progress and Development Pact, which will promote public investment, the fight against unemployment and inequality and the redistribution of income."
"Statements made by the Presidency have fallen well short of addressing all of these issues."
"This is nothing new, given the positions of previous presidencies, although we do welcome their words on being open to dialogue. This is not much, though."
"I congratulate the Austrian Presidency on its desire to propose serious paths with a view to improving the decision-making process within the European Union."
"France and Germany have also made proposals designed to move things forward in this area."
"We can only encourage them in this regard and, as from this week, the European Parliament will play its full part in this exercise."
"It is not a question here of rhetoric, but of ensuring that, after an in-depth consultation, decisions can be made about European matters with no delays or obstacles."
"We need to go beyond the ‘reflection stage’ and move on to the stage of realistic and courageous proposals to be implemented over the next few years."
"For Europeans, growth and employment are the most worrying issues."
"They therefore require a strong political commitment and a precise action programme on the part of Europe, its Member States and its Parliament."
"I hope that the 2006 Spring European Council succeeds in getting the revised Lisbon Strategy back on track in order finally to rescue us from the incantations and to focus our attention on the real issues and, in so doing, to provide a clear indication once again of the direction in which European affairs should be steered."
"Mr President, under Rule 19(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask you to rule on an issue relating to the proper conduct of parliamentary business."
"According to the screens, one of the groups in the European Parliament has scheduled a press conference this afternoon on a subject that Parliament is now voting on, and is seeking to criticise Members of the European Parliament by giving it the title: ‘Parliamentary autism’."
"I do not wish to comment on the substance of the press conference, but would ask you to rule that using a disability as a derogatory term is an act of discrimination against disabled people."
"I would ask you to rule that the group should withdraw that title immediately as it is offensive to people with autism."
"Mr President, actually I have a similar complaint to make about the homophobia title."
"I am absolutely opposed to discrimination against homosexuals, but the title of the report is unsatisfactory."
"If we are to speak here about a real problem, that of discrimination, why on earth use a word like homophobia, which is totally inappropriate?"
"Phobias are different kinds of anxieties. They are fears which are considered to be neurotic disorders, and therapy is needed to help them: they cannot be treated through political control ..."
"– Mrs Korhola, we cannot reopen the debate on points that are scheduled for the vote."
"Thank you, but I have to cut you off."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, following consultation with the Liberals and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like, with particular regard to the wishes of the latter, to change the wording of our amendment from ‘non-UK consumers’ to ‘non-European citizens’."
"I do not need to give an explanation for this; it is self-evident that ‘non-European citizens’ is a great deal broader a term than the reference only to ‘consumers’."
"Consultation with the Liberals leads me to ask that ‘UK legislation’ be changed to ‘UK and/or EU legislation’."
"That is self-explanatory and the purpose of the change is obvious."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr Markov, had very clearly requested that we proceed to an electronic count of the vote on Amendment 1."
"I believe that the balance of power was the same as that for the vote on Amendment 3."
"I should therefore like a scrutiny of the vote on Amendment 1."
"– Mr Wurtz, I cannot grant you what you want, simply because the balance of power on Amendment 1 was totally different."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor under Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I am not speaking as the chairman of the committee in question, although that role encourages me in formally calling for the draft directive to be referred back to committee."
"I am calling for a referral because it would have the same result as a rejection, with the difference that the opportunity to express our opinion during this parliamentary term would remain in the hands of this Parliament."
"We might otherwise run the risk of showing total acquiescence."
"Today – and this is my reason – we are not ready to vote."
"We are ready neither in relation to the content nor on account of the emotional climate in which we are likely to vote."
"We are not ready in relation to the content because Parliament’s consultations on the proposal – and I apologise for my share in them – remained too concerned with the history of the first proposal that was rejected a few years ago."
"The debate this time has not allowed us to take account of the changes that have occurred in the world scenario, which is witnessing a revolution in port procedures, or to consider competition among ports, or to consider state aid in ports."
"In brief, we are not ready because we are also likely to vote from an emotional point of view in a climate that may well force us into taking one of two inappropriate positions: either displaying arrogance …"
"– Mr Costa, your request is quite clear."
"Under Rule 168, we ask for one speaker in favour and one against."
"– Please let me finish."
"It is fundamental because of what happened the other evening outside this Chamber."
"We run the risk of either being arrogant towards those who have demonstrated quite properly, or instead being …"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the opposition of the Socialist Group in this House to Mr Costa’s amendment, and will say two things to justify that stance."
"Let me begin with the last point that Mr Costa addressed."
"What went on here the day before yesterday was, predominantly, what one would expect of an ordinary demonstration by men and women who feel their social security threatened."
"These men and women can count on us."
"Those who cannot count on Socialists such as ourselves are those who never wait to hear the end of an argument and those who believe that violence can be a political instrument."
"We are not in solidarity with them."
"They were in a minority, and we repudiate what they did."
"Mr President, the ports package is ripe for the vote, it is ripe for rejection, and so we ask that the vote be proceeded with now."
"Mr President, we are well aware of what we are voting on, as we already were in 2003 when we rejected the proposal, and there is a large majority in this Chamber who will reject it again."
"With the procedure you are now proposing, this majority in favour of rejection will, however, be hidden in an attempt to have the matter referred back to committee."
"We should therefore take a vote in the Chamber on whether the proposals recommending rejection should be voted on before the procedural proposal."
"It is completely insane that the Presidency should administer a procedure that can conceal the attitude of the majority in this Chamber."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say, for the purposes of clarification, that those who want to throw out the port package must vote ‘yes’ in the first vote, that is ‘yes’ to its rejection, for the avoidance of any doubt."
"Please vote ‘yes’ in the first vote!"
"Vote ‘yes’, and throw it out!"
". Mr President, I will be brief."
"I made it clear throughout the debate that I was there to listen to Parliament and that I was awaiting Parliament’s vote. Before outlining what I intend to do, I should like very briefly to mention something that I regret has happened and something that I want to happen."
"Firstly, I regret that the procedure has not enabled Parliament to give its verdict on the amended text."
"Your rapporteur’s amendments were such as to allay certain fears on the part of the various actors in our ports, fears that were felt as much by businesses as by workers."
"In view of that, I pay tribute to the work of your committee."
"The Commission was in a position to accept the amendments."
"That is my regret dealt with."
"Next, I should like us not to lose sight of the aim of this text, an aim that, I might add, often came up during yesterday’s debate."
"It is a question of helping European ports efficiently to respond to the increase in maritime traffic and to the risk of their becoming overstretched in terms of capacity."
"Efficient port services enable us to increase European competitiveness and to facilitate growth and employment."
"Obviously, I will give the College of Commissioners a faithful account of yesterday’s debate and of today’s vote."
"I will suggest that it draws conclusions from them."
"I will also suggest that it continue the work being done with all of the actors concerned – the Member States, operators, users and trade unions – in cooperation with Parliament, in order to lay the foundations of a European port policy that enables us to manage and to reassure investors."
"I hope, in fact, to provide, in the best possible way, the answers European ports are waiting for, whether in relation to the transparency of tariffs or to the use of infrastructure, to recourse to State aid or, more globally, to the integration of the ports into the intermodal chain."
"Our debate has clearly highlighted the need for every aspect of this overall approach."
"I shall read the text in English, since that is how it has been discussed; it would read as follows:"
"‘Calls for a solution to the problem of the so-called caveats which impede a proper cooperation among the different national contingents in the country.’"
"– That concludes voting time."
"We seek a settlement with the Council on a new interinstitutional agreement on budget discipline and improvement of the budget procedure."
"As our point of departure in the negotiations, we have the European Parliament’s resolution of 8 June 2005 on political challenges and budgetary resources of the enlarged European Union for 2007-2013."
"We therefore support the European Parliament’s resolution on the European Council’s common position from 15 to 16 December 2005."
"We cannot, however, support the wording on an improved European dimension to the EU’s agricultural policy."
"We look forward to the overhaul of the EU’s income and expenditure in 2008 and hope that it will lead to a more modern structure for the EU budget and reduced expenditure on the common agricultural policy."
". The British Conservative delegation supports the Böge report in its call for the rejection of the European Council's common position on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 in its current form."
"We support the report in its call for a firm commitment to undertake a review of the financial perspective with a clear role for the European Parliament, and we very strongly support the call for sufficient accompanying measures to ensure better implementation and control of expenditure of funds in the Member States."
"We note with concern, however, the call for the Committee on Budgets to negotiate on the basis of the European Parliament's position of 8 June 2005 which, if agreed, would increase the commitment appropriations by EUR 112 474 billion over the period."
"For this reason we have abstained on the final vote."
". We abstained from the final vote on the resolution on the financial perspective for 2007-2013, because we do not accept Recital No 4 of the resolution."
"We believe that the minimum agreement was ultimately a good one for Europe, as it headed off a serious political crisis in the Union, albeit temporarily."
"The use of the word ‘rejects’ in Recital No 4 conveys the idea to the European public that Parliament is seeking to re-open the financial debate, which as things stand is not feasible, let alone appropriate."
"Accordingly, we consider the word ‘rejects’ to mean the same as ‘disagreement’, which obviously does not undermine the agreement that was reached."
". It may surprise people that UKIP has, for the first time ever, voted for a report that is overtly federalist in tone."
"We do so because the adoption of this report kills the deal brokered by Tony Blair in December."
"To us, a 63% increase in the UK's contribution to the EU is unacceptable."
"The surrender of £7 billion of our rebate is unacceptable."
"The current financial perspectives are a bad deal for Britain."
"If this report is accepted, we fall back on Article 272 of the Treaty and annual negotiations of the budget."
"Though we disagree strongly with the reasons behind this report, we are happy to play our part in re-opening a debate about how UK taxpayers' money is spent."
"The more people are exposed to the workings of the EU, the less they like it."
"By consigning the Council’s common position on the financial perspectives 2007-2013 to the waste paper basket, the majority of the European Parliament is putting the functioning of the European Union on the line, and this is something with which we are not in agreement."
"First of all, it is the Member States that collect the contributions for the European Union."
"Parliament is punching above its weight if it wants to force the Member States to make more money available for the EU."
"Secondly, given the principle of subsidiarity, there are items in the European budget that should receive far less funding, if any at all: external policy, education, social affairs, employment, culture and health care."
"Furthermore, paying out for EU propaganda and subsidies for ‘pro-European’ think tanks does not serve any useful purpose."
"Thirdly, the cohesion and structural fund policy must focus its efforts on the disadvantaged regions in the Member States where the GDP is less than 80% of the EU average."
"Logically, this results in a shift of the structural support policy from the southern to the eastern Member States."
"In the interest of the citizens, this House should adopt a more resourceful attitude and reduce the EU to its core tasks, in short, do more with less money."
"We are not satisfied with the settlement reached in the Council on 16 December."
"We wish to reduce expenditure on agricultural policy and the Structural Funds and allocate more resources to research and development and to the common foreign and security policy."
"Parliament has the right of codecision on the financial perspective and has announced that it will push its own budget policy very hard."
"We do not support the expansive budget policy advocated by Parliament but do support other proposals such as that to increase the appropriations to research and development."
"In the light of this, we did not vote against the resolution in the final vote but abstained, given that we are able to support parts of Parliament’s proposal."
"I chose today to abstain when the European Parliament voted on its resolution on the financial perspective."
"In its resolution, the European Parliament rejects the Council’s agreement."
"I am certainly very disappointed in the Council’s agreement whereby my priority areas will obtain resources fewer than those proposed by the Commission."
"These are areas such as research, innovation, measures to combat cross-border crime, environmental measures and the Structural Funds set aside to help small and medium-sized businesses."
"The Council has, however, taken a reprehensibly long time, and I do not wish to delay this process any further."
"It is important for us to secure the funding for projects and programmes for the years 2007-2013 so that these do not have to be discontinued because of uncertainty and the absence of cofinanciers."
"It is especially important for the ten new Member States."
"I have therefore chosen not to derail the financial perspective that has now been agreed on."
". The UK PSE Group will abstain on the final vote on the Böge report of 18.01.2006 for the following reasons:"
"1."
"We are concerned about the reference to enhancing agricultural policy in paragraph 7 which is something we have been fighting against for a long time."
"2."
"The UK PSE Group is against the first sentence of paragraph 4 which states that the EP 'rejects the European Council's common position'."
"First, we believe the UK Presidency had a difficult task on its hands trying to reach agreement on this sensitive and divisive issue."
"Few believed the UK would be able to achieve the final compromise given the sometimes diametrically opposed positions taken by the 25 EU Member States on this issue."
"In the second place, we think it is not the EP's role to reject the position of the Council: all we can do is take note of their position and decide upon our own position which may disagree with the Council's position but does not reject it."
"3."
"The UK PSE Group supports what the EP is trying to do in terms of improving accountability and the flexibility of the budget to respond to future challenges facing the EU given its role as a major global actor."
". In December, the Council ignored Parliament’s codecision powers/obligation and omitted to fund the central policies of the Lisbon Strategy and policies relating to Europe’s place on the world stage."
"Consequently, the Commission is devoid of resources for funding citizenship policies – for example youth, education, research and culture – the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Union’s external commitments, such as peace missions and measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I therefore voted to reject the agreement in its current form, and would call for negotiations to begin with a view to bridging the shortfall in resources."
"The Presidency should be mandated to negotiate with Parliament on reserves for flexibility that would guarantee all necessary resources and to agree on a revision clause that would make it possible to re-examine spending in 2008 – including diverting funding from the CAP into competitiveness and innovation policies – and to reconsider the Union’s budgetary resources."
"This is not a matter of reopening what was agreed upon in Brussels in December, but rather of reinforcing it with the means necessary to finance policies and measures essential for a more cohesive, competitive and responsible Europe that has greater credibility on the world stage."
". The agreement on the Community budget for 2007-2013 adopted at the December European Council is woefully inadequate in terms of financial resources and unsuitable in terms of the priorities and instruments required to address the economic, social and environmental needs and problems of a Union enlarged to 27 countries."
"The much-trumpeted concept of ‘solidarity’ has been pushed down the order of priorities, and funding for cohesion policy has been cut back from 0.41% to 0.37% of Community GNI; this in spite of the fact that economic and social disparities arising from the enlargement have increased."
"There have also been cuts to areas such as the social, environmental, agricultural, cooperation, research and culture. At the same time, areas such as ‘competitiveness’, migration control, border control, security and the common foreign and security policy have seen their funding increase, at the expense of development aid."
"This seals victory for the interests of the most economically developed countries and the large economic and financial groups in those countries, to the detriment of the interests of what are referred to as the ‘cohesion’ countries, such as Portugal, and of those of the workers."
"The entire ‘negotiating’ process has been characterised by proposal after proposal, each worse than the preceding one."
"In this context, although the proposal before us rejects the Council’s agreement, it reaffirms Parliament’s negotiating position, itself inadequate in terms of funding and priorities."
". In the text adopted on the financial perspective, there are two points that should have been dealt with differently."
"The first of these is the sentence which ‘rejects’ the agreement reached at the Council."
"There would have been more appropriate ways of expressing non-acceptance of the agreement."
"The second is the manner in which agricultural policy is referred to."
"The way in which some Member States have received more significant funds from the Union budget via the CAP has hampered the progress of the European project, blocking more appropriate criteria for granting funds."
"The agreement reached in the Council is a positive one for Portugal."
"Parliament has every right, however, to seek to start the process of fine-tuning that agreement."
"In this process, there has not been any significant about-turn in budgetary methodology, the criteria for the global distribution of funds not having undergone any changes."
"There must be continued solidarity with the cohesion countries of the south and east."
"Support for greater competitiveness in Europe must not place currently less competitive economies at a disadvantage."
". To be very clear: I do not reject the European Council's common position."
"However, the European Parliament, as one arm of the legislative and budgetary authority, should be able to play its full parliamentary role in the definition of policies, their reform and their budget."
"I therefore support the willingness of this House to enter into constructive negotiations with the Council."
". Although the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is satisfied with the reduction of the EU budget, particularly with the improvement of the Dutch payment position, we are still very critical of the way in which the remaining funds are being spent."
"To this day, the imbalance in the distribution of agricultural subsidies exists, funds are still being pumped around without any purpose and prestigious projects are still being promoted."
"That the budget agreement should be reached at the expense of the really poor Member States is indefensible."
"The resolution rejects the Council’s agreement on the financial perspective."
"I believe, however, that it is unwise of the European Parliament to reject the proposal, and I have therefore chosen to abstain from voting."
"The road leading to the Council’s agreement has been long and difficult, and it would have been problematic if the Council had not in the end succeeded in agreeing on the issue."
"Certainly, Parliament has the right of codecision on the issue and is entitled to reject the Council’s proposal, but it would be unfortunate if the long-term budget were not to materialise because of power games between the institutions."
"Parliament must now assume its responsibility and, together with the Council, do its best to arrive at a long-term budget."
"I think it good that the Council agreed on the financial perspective and that the level of expenditure was not too high, but I am also critical of large parts of the budget."
"For example, the budget has the wrong profile, with too much money being spent on agriculture and regional aid."
"Parliament wishes to allocate more money to important areas, but advocates an unduly high total level of expenditure and, like the Council, wishes to allocate too much money to agricultural expenditure and regional aid."
"I do not therefore support Parliament's position."
"Tough prioritising of the way in which EU resources are allocated is of crucial importance to bringing about the changes needed by Europe."
". Today, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Europe’s multi-annual budget."
"I welcome the compromise which the Council achieved in December 2005 and consider this to be a good basis for further negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council."
"As far as I am concerned, this does nothing to detract from the successful efforts of the Dutch Cabinet, in the person of Finance Minister Zalm."
"The Council’s decision to cut the Dutch contributions to the EU by one billion does not fall within Parliament’s remit, and will therefore not form part of the negotiations."
"Believing as I do that Europe should invest more in knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship, I do not think that the present compromise adequately reflects them."
"Furthermore, I take the view that the European Parliament, like any national parliament, should shoulder its responsibility when it comes to determining the budget."
"The negotiations which the European Parliament will open with the Council are similar to the debate which the Dutch Lower Chamber holds with the Cabinet in response to the Queen’s speech."
"– The European Council arrived at an agreement on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, after hard bargaining as to who would give less and who would get more of the peoples' money, so that European monopolies would be able to benefit from it and improve their profitability and privileges."
"At the same time, it laid the foundations for the new review of the CAP and for reducing agricultural spending, which will wipe out even more small and medium-sized holdings."
"The peoples' money under the financial package is being used, enhanced by 110%, to reinforce the repressive policies and the strategy of the anti-grass roots Lisbon agenda, while resources for farmers are gradually being reduced."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece reject the decisions on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, because they are to the detriment of the peoples and their rights."
"Nor, however, do we agree with the reasons for rejection expressed in the resolution by the European Parliament, because it comes under the philosophy of not contesting the anti-grass roots policy and militarisation of the ΕU, in that it calls for the 'competitiveness and security' of the EU to be strengthened, together with controls of spending in the Member States."
"This philosophy favours capitalist restructurings, harsher exploitation of the workers and the strengthening of repressive and anti-democratic mechanisms."
". The prime concern of all joint decision-makers is to act responsibly."
"The public are only too aware that the process leading to the adoption of the financial perspective in December was a complex one, which was indicative of just how difficult these negotiations can be, in particular in the circumstances in which they take place today."
"As I have previously stated, the final outcome of the December summit, although it fell short of what was required and of what I had been seeking, is broadly positive and favourable to European and Portuguese interests."
"I therefore feel it is legitimate to seek to improve upon this agreement, whilst making sure that there is no danger that we will lose the consensus that we reached."
"The stakes are too high for the main concern to be in the context of the institutional balance."
"I voted against the Council agreement on the financial perspective, because I feel that it is symptomatic of the crisis facing Europe: it is meagre, lacking in ambition and uninspiring."
"It is meagre in financial terms compared with other partner institutions, and also because the Council’s proposal is more a summary of the claims made by the different Member States than an expression of political will of any kind."
"The lack of ambition can be seen in the glaring signs of inconsistency with previously adopted policies."
"The citizens of Europe have become increasingly frustrated with the perceived lack of efficiency of Europe’s institutions; one day, decisions are taken that are presented to the public as clear signs of progress in certain areas of interest to Europeans, and on the very next day the same Council fails to provide the financial perspective with the resources needed for these measures to be pursued."
"Lastly, this agreement is wholly uninspiring, as it fails to honour commitments entered into with candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania."
"This kind of attitude is what is known as hypocrisy."
". The outcome of the Council meeting at dead of night in Brussels last December fails Scotland and fails Europe."
"It is unacceptable to the Parliament and I am pleased to support this motion to reject the deal as agreed and to start negotiations on making it better."
"Parliament has been instrumental in forcing the Member States, the UK being chief among them, to act reasonably, but we can still do better than the deal before us today."
"I think Parliament is right to hold out for a better compromise and am glad that we have passed this motion today and look forward to the negotiations."
". I welcome the decision of the European Parliament's Conference of Presidents to appoint 22 MEPs to a Committee of Inquiry charged with investigating the case of citizens, as many as 6 500 of whom are Irish, who were robbed of their savings due to the crisis at insurance company Equitable Life."
"I support the petition which Equitable Life investors have submitted to the European Parliament's Petitions Committee."
"It is entirely right that their case will now be investigated fully by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry."
"The Irish Government should now appoint an investigator who will represent Irish citizens' interests in this matter and work with the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry."
". Constituents across Scotland have contacted me seeking action on Equitable Life, not just words."
"Today we have answered their pleas, and I am glad that Parliament has taken this decisive step when the London government has not."
"People had their savings and pensions plans thrown into chaos when Equitable Life collapsed, and it is right that they continue to seek answers."
"I look forward to working with the committee to get to the bottom of this issue."
". In the Europe of freedom and values, it must be made perfectly clear that citizens’ rights and the primacy of the rule of law deserve complete protection."
"Combating terrorism should fall into this category."
"Accordingly, we must not abandon our heritage and the broad international support we enjoy. What separates us from the terrorists is our profound respect for people and for all of their rights."
"This temporary committee must carry out its mandate to collect and analyse any information that may prove relevant in discovering the truth behind reports, backed up by Human Rights Watch, that appeared in the Washington Post."
"We must get to the truth, not only because lingering doubts feed suspicion and foment speculation, but also because under no circumstances can we allow European territory to be used for the purpose of secret detention. That would be shameful and would fly in the face of international rules on human rights, and of European rules and values."
". As regards the decision to establish a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry to investigate claims of secret CIA prisons and the torture of prisoners on EU soil or in countries seeking EU membership, if EU Member States or candidate countries had been involved, actively or passively, in running 'extra-judicial prisons', there would have been violations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is important that we get to the root of the matter."
"We must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities."
"We want to know the truth, nothing more than the truth."
"If we do this, then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture."
". I voted for the setting up of a European Parliament inquiry into allegations of CIA activity in relation to alleged abductions, 'extraordinary rendition', 'detention at secret sites', 'detention incommunicado', torture, cruelty, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners on the territory of the EU, including acceding and candidate countries."
"It is important, in light of widespread concerns, including those in my London constituency, that the EP inquiry makes a serious effort to assess the veracity of the allegations."
". – In the face of the disclosures and commotion caused by the action of the CIA, with citizens being abducted, suspects moved, investigations carried out and jails in European countries, the European Parliament is trying, in setting up the Committee of Inquiry, to pull the wool over the eyes of the peoples of Europe."
"It is displaying hypocritical concern about the infringement of human rights on European soil and trying to save the 'lost honour' of the ΕU."
"However, it is a fact that the EU itself and the governments of the Member States have concluded secret agreements with the USA, have fallen in fully with the so-called anti-terrorist strategy and are now trying to play at being surprised and innocent doves."
"It insults and underestimates the peoples when the political groups in the European Parliament, whose parties are in government and have signed the agreements, make a show of protesting about their results."
"The ΕU and the USA are jointly responsible for the unaccountable action by the secret services which, apart from anything else, are preparing to apply the terrorist laws to strike the grass-roots movement and unleash wars against countries and peoples."
". During conflict situations, especially the one in which the United States and the Allies are currently engaged, it is even more essential that our fundamental, civilised values be upheld; we need to be all the more vigilant in extreme circumstances."
"I therefore share the view of all those who, in Europe and the United States, have raised their voices against any abuse or violation of these values."
"That is my unequivocal position, and one that I have expressed on previous occasions."
"That being said, with regard to the so-called ‘CIA flights’, I must express my disappointment at the way in which this debate has been conducted. It has been based largely on a conjecture, suspicion and accusation, and the word of our allies and our most esteemed political leaders of EU Member States appears to be the one that holds the least value."
"Against this backdrop, I feel that the Conference of Presidents managed to reach a solution that was appropriate and, above all, balanced and suited to the role that Parliament could play on this issue."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". The allegations that our friends and colleagues the Americans have used European airports as staging posts in flights which would be illegal under our laws are worrying in the extreme."
"It is right that we in the European Parliament should seek to shed light on this murky business, as this issue is of importance to all our citizens."
"I for my part do not believe that the Americans are guilty of half the things they stand accused of, but we will only be able to answer these allegations by getting to the truth of the matter, and I look forward to working with the Inquiry to do just that."
". The EU must maintain a clear and consistent position in defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, in relation to what ought to be, in the broadest sense, the Middle East peace process."
"In this particular case, the steps that have been taken in Lebanon require our effective support both in word and in deed. In practice, we need to work together on any leads that may uncover the truth behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report before us. I should also like to mention the procedural issues raised by the rapporteur, which I feel are worthy of further attention."
"We welcome the adoption of the final report, approved by the Conciliation Committee, on the management of waste from the extractive industries, which is very much of interest to Portugal."
"This new legislation will strengthen the environmental rules in a number of Member States, and impose more stringent obligations on companies to tidy sites after completing their industrial activities, and in so doing honour their responsibility to protect the environment and public health."
"The inventories that must be carried out on existing situations, in order that appropriate measures can be taken, are of similar importance."
"We trust that these proposals will be put into practice across the board."
". This directive is an important legislative text on the environment."
"Following the laudable work done by both the rapporteur and Parliament’s delegation in the Conciliation Committee, I must express my backing for this report, which contains important measures that will pave the way to reducing the detrimental effects on the environment, and the risks to human health resulting from waste from the extractive industries."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Sjöstedt report."
"There are some 20 000 bathing sites in the European Union, and people have no idea of what dangerous bacteria lurk in their waters."
"Swimmers swallow on average some 50 millilitres of water, and children sometimes swallow ten times that amount while splashing around, so the absence of any risk of contracting an illness must be guaranteed."
"There are various agents that can cause illnesses ranging from nausea to skin eruptions, but also others that are potentially fatal."
"It is all the more encouraging, then, that the European directive has been able to improve the quality of bathing water over recent years, but it has made drastic incursions into the capacity of smaller lakes, such as those in the Austrian Alps, to regulate themselves."
"It follows that we can no longer rely solely on the provisions of the law, on prohibitions and investments, but must instead try to demand of the public that they cooperate actively and be aware of environmental issues."
"The EU should not, of course, have a common directive governing bathing water quality."
"We have voted in favour of the report, since Parliament listened to our criticisms and is cutting back on the regulations we have at present."
"The report also vigorously rejects the proposals for further regulation that existed when Parliament debated the issue last time."
"It should be pointed out that the previous proposal clearly showed how difficult it is having detailed rules that are to apply under quite different conditions."
"In countries with long coasts, large stretches of water, short bathing seasons, low water temperatures and sparse populations, the requirements should be different from those in countries with heavily populated beaches to which many people travel in order to bathe in warm water during long seasons."
"We Swedish Conservatives are pleased that we have obtained a hearing for our criticisms."
"I naturally support this proposal. It is of particular importance to my country, Portugal, whose coastline covers half of national territory, which boasts a number of rivers and other waterways, and where a population of bathers enjoys water sports in increasing numbers."
"This proposal represents a significant step in terms of protecting the population’s health and the environment, as the amendments on the table will bring clear improvements in terms of the understanding, monitoring and quality control of bathing water."
"The text that emerged from the Conciliation Committee will plug gaps and bring up to date the regulation on bathing water currently in force."
"There are now stricter requirements, such as new bacteria limit values for water to be considered of ‘sufficient’ quality, the fact that public information and participation is now mandatory and the EU-wide standardisation of signs, which will help to reduce health risks and to prevent disease and infection."
"I have today chosen to vote in favour of the Conciliation Committee’s joint text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality."
"I do so on the basis that this is an issue to which subsidiarity applies, by which I mean that it should be dealt with at local or regional level in this case."
"Bathing water is an issue that affects many Swedish municipalities that have a huge number of bathing beaches."
"It is therefore important for the directive not to place a burden of increased bureaucracy on the municipalities."
"My having, in spite of everything, voted in favour of this draft has to do with the fact that it is in many ways an improvement on the 1976 bathing water quality directive that applies today."
"Firstly, it is simpler and, secondly, it contains improved health and environmental requirements."
"A slimmer but more efficient EU needs to look at whether issues such as this should not be passed back to the Member States to be dealt with at national or local/regional level."
". The most important aspect of the solution that has been reached is that the 1976 directive on bathing water quality, which had been rendered out of date by developments in scientific knowledge and increased health demands, has in some aspects been brought up to date."
"According to the rapporteur, these amendments will result in a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 7.5%."
"The conciliation process was a difficult one, given the highly divergent positions involved, and the outcome was satisfactory but inadequate, particularly as regards the parameters that have now become mandatory."
"The greatest gains have been made in the area of informing the public."
"It is hoped that up-to-date information will be made public and will be visible at the bathing sites themselves."
". The text obtained in the Conciliation Committee and brought before us for the vote today contains very welcome amendments to the proposal tabled for second reading on 21 April 2005."
"The fact that the proposal to remove the distinction between coastal and inland waters was not incorporated and that the category of ‘sufficient’ quality was not removed from the final text safeguards Portugal’s overriding interests in this matter, and meets the most recent WHO recommendations."
"I welcome the proposed parameters for assessing bathing water quality, along with the methodology adopted for evaluating and classifying it. I am therefore in favour of the adoption of those parameters."
"I feel that it will thus be possible not only to improve the environment but also to protect and better inform the citizens on the quality of the bathing water that they use."
"This report deals with an issue that should not be on the EU’s agenda."
"It does not, of course, make sense to compare the status and requirements of bathing water in the Mediterranean with those of thousands of lakes in countries such as Sweden and Finland."
"The Bathing Water Directive is an example of how, in practice, the EU rarely applies either the principle of subsidiarity or the principle of proportionality."
"That is regrettable."
"The proposal in which the conciliation procedure has resulted has certain advantages compared with the directive that currently applies."
"For example, there are fewer criteria that the Member States will have to apply."
"At the same time, absurd new requirements have been introduced, such as the requirement that signs identical across the EU should be introduced at bathing sites."
"We are confident that the Member States are able independently to deal with issues concerning water quality at bathing sites."
"We are thus opposed in principle to the Bathing Water Directive and have voted against the Conciliation Committee’s compromise."
"I have chosen to vote in favour of the Conciliation Committee’s joint text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality."
"In principle, I do not believe that bathing water quality is an issue that should be dealt with at EU level."
"It should be dealt with by the Member States at national or local level."
"I voted in favour of the draft because the proposal significantly simplifies an earlier, 1976 directive on bathing water quality."
"Voting in favour of this proposal is part of the fight to simplify EU legislation."
"It also, of course, involves changes for the better where health and the environment are concerned."
"In order for the EU to be more effective and show more dynamism on the major cross-border issues, policy-making in certain areas needs to be handed over to the Member States."
"This is one such area, and it should be dealt with in places closer to the people."
"I voted for this report because the new fourth water quality category as introduced by the Council is maintained, and the four categories are now combined with better figures for the level of toxicology defining them."
"These new figures should help decrease the risks to bathers' health by improving the category levels."
". The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on the directive on the management of bathing water is based on new criteria for assessing water quality and informing the public."
"Stricter rules and better information for the public are extremely important for Portugal, given the extent of the Portuguese coastline, and given the social, cultural and economic value that that coastline and its innumerable waterways bring to the country, in terms not only of tourist activities, but also of socio-cultural activities."
"Every effort must be made to prevent and reduce health risks."
"I therefore feel that this proposal is a highly significant step towards protecting the people’s health and the environment."
"These amendments will lead to clear improvement in terms of the understanding, monitoring and quality control of bathing water, and will help to strike the required balance as regards the cost of introducing new quality criteria."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Maaten report."
". The subject of this resolution, the quality of bathing water, is important, but should in my opinion, from the viewpoint of subsidiarity, be dealt with at the national level."
"There is no added value in regulating this subject at the European level."
"For this reason I vote against this resolution."
". Mr President, annoyingly, my speech had to end as time ran out, and I would like to remedy that."
"I will read what I meant to say, so that environmental organisations will not misunderstand what I said:"
"An example of this is the letter that came this week from the biggest environmental organisations, which gives a misleading picture of the right to access to justice that is now possibly opening up to them."
"They mention that industrial countries are able to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and now this legislation would only bring them to the same level."
"The letter fails to mention that at present the environmental organisations do by no means aspire to the same level as companies, regarding which there is a call for this decision to affect them ‘directly and individually’, in other words, as an interested party."
"Instead, the environmental organisations should now be able to choose, within the entire Union and ignoring criteria relating to interested parties, which area they are interested in."
"It was misleading that this essential detail was left unsaid."
". I very much welcome the draft regulation to apply the provisions of the Århus Convention to EC institutions and bodies."
"Citizens have a legitimate right to information and environmental justice, including from the EC."
"In particular, I believe the definition of 'environmental information' set out in the proposed regulation should include information about the state of progress of proceedings against Member States for infringing EC law."
"All too often, the only way EU citizens can find out about the failure of their Member States to respect the commitments they have freely entered into is by monitoring Commission press releases."
"This is not sufficient and has to be put on a firmer footing."
"Lastly, I regret the failure of the Council to reach agreement on the related draft Directive on Access to Justice, as endorsed by the EP with amendments on 31 March 2004, and I urge the Council and the Commission to redouble their efforts on this particular initiative."
"In our view, the amendments adopted today to the report on application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in the European institutions are highly significant. In the report, priority is given, firstly, to the public’s right to information on procedures for participating in the decision-making process, namely how to use those procedures, secondly, to the right of access to information; and, lastly, to access to justice in environmental matters."
"Amendments have been brought in, for example, on defining priorities regarding environmental policy and public involvement in defining environmental policy. It is now compulsory to indicate clearly how information can be obtained, such as information on the state of progress of proceedings for infringement of Community law and to make information available by assessing the outcome of various consultations."
"In some areas, however, it falls short of the requirements of the Convention, in particular with regard to access to justice, insofar as there are no established support mechanisms for reducing or eliminating recurring financial obstacles; indeed, access to justice is often restricted precisely because those seeking justice do not have the necessary financial resources."
"Broadly speaking, however, this is an important step towards ensuring, on the one hand, effective participation, via procedures developed within a reasonable timescale, and, on the other, access to information, which will enable sound, democratic participation."
"I voted against some of Parliament’s amendments on the application of the Århus Convention."
"I am obviously in favour of the public being as fully informed as possible. Yet, I do not believe that this information should lead certain NGOs repeatedly to initiate legal proceedings, when the former are still not recognised as representative."
"If the general interest is proven, then it must take precedence over often selfish considerations."
"We believe that the Århus Convention constitutes a valuable legal tool for guaranteeing public access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making processes."
"The Convention has a constructive purpose, then."
"We have voted against Amendment 25."
"Purely as a matter of principle, we believe that lawsuits should be brought before national courts that apply current law."
". In a society that is based on democratic values, I believe that each party should be accorded the same rights."
"These also include equal, non-discriminatory access opportunities to justice for citizens, companies and NGOs."
"Article 230(4) of the Treaty already provides for this and is therefore sufficient."
"That is why I considered it appropriate to vote against Amendments 19, 22, 24 and 25."
"Mr President, it was, in fact, already evident after yesterday’s debate on the liberalisation of port services, that a large majority of Members of this House were, and are, sensitive to the justified arguments put to them by the European dockworkers, which is, of course, a good thing."
"We can only hope that the somewhat other-worldly European Commission does not persist in its anger and in that respect, we should not hold out too many hopes because we will, I believe, again be presented with the Bolkestein directive as early as next month."
"Having said this, I take a great deal of pleasure in pointing out that, by rejecting Mr Jarzembowski’s report today, we have clearly opted for the principle of ‘jobs for our own people first’."
"We have protected our own national dockworkers against unfair competition from countries that apply entirely different working conditions."
"I am delighted that the left and the right in this House have for once put their own people first. They have for once put the fundamental interests of our own citizens above ideology."
"It is to be hoped that this is an example that will be followed."
"Mr President, I did not reject the proposal for the port directive."
"In my view, we should have amended it and improved on it, for a balanced package of amendments was before us."
"We could have done as the trade unions requested, and removed the self-handling clause from the directive."
"We could have prepared a framework for licences and contracts, for the selection of port service providers by the port authorities."
"We could have drafted a clear legal framework for the pilotage services."
"We could have drawn up clear transitional arrangements for existing licences."
"A majority in this House regarded that as unnecessary, even though European port policy has been the subject of discussion for ten years now and even though we are probably familiar with all arguments by now."
"I am not prepared to indulge in short-term thinking and bury my head in the sand."
"We, politicians, have a duty to carry out our legislative work, which was not the case today."
"We are now passing on policy to the judges at the European Court of Justice, who will decide what the free movement of services in our ports means."
"Our Parliament was short-sighted today."
"I was of a different opinion."
"Mr President, I was the EPP rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee for the Port Services Directive, and obviously I voted to reject it - but for completely different reasons from almost everyone else in this House."
"This directive was a step back from the liberalisation that we have already undertaken in the United Kingdom."
"Whilst many in this House were burying their heads in the sand to the fact that we are now operating in a global economy and our competitors are better and quicker at doing things than us, I was concerned that this pretty pathetic proposal for a directive emanating from the last Commission, which should never have been resubmitted by the current Commission, did not go far enough."
"There are many reasons why we should be aware of and concerned about our global competitors."
"Sticking our heads, necks and everything else into the sand, and forgetting that we are in a global market, is no way to deal with that situation."
". I voted against the proposed Port Services Directive as I believe it would have serious implications for the main port in my constituency: Belfast Port."
"By imposing the usual 'one-size-fits-all' solution on all EU ports, the directive would subject Belfast Port, which handles 66% of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade, to unnecessary and commercially restrictive practices which would damage its economic viability."
"In particular, Belfast's on-going investment programmes, crucial to the docks' future and currently being rolled out, would be adversely affected because of the need to constantly re-tender, which is not practical in securing long term infrastructure."
"While it is quite right that certain markets should be open to competition, I consider it unnecessary to apply such requirements in this form to markets which are already the product of open contractual competition, such as that of cargo handling in Belfast Port."
"Northern Ireland relies greatly on the maintenance of a competitive and efficient port infrastructure."
"In my opinion, this unnecessary directive would only stymie the development of Belfast and other ports."
"I therefore totally reject this proposal, whose effect would be stultifying and regressive."
".With our European ports featuring among the most modern and most competitive in the world, I fail to understand the need for a directive aimed at liberalising port services in Europe."
"I also fail to understand the Commission’s obstinacy in wanting to impose a law that the shipowners, the managers of European ports and, above all, the dockworkers find unsatisfactory."
"This is stubbornness verging on a denial of democracy, when it becomes clear that the Commission is daring to trot out the same proposal already rejected by Members of this Parliament."
"By introducing self-handling, this text threatens not only the jobs of thousands of workers in European ports but also the safety and security of goods and persons, because these workers are made to compete against crews who are employed on a casual basis and who often have no professional qualifications."
"By voting against this iniquitous text, I therefore wanted to assure those who champion the survival of their profession that they have my support. I call on the Commission finally to get down to work in order to ensure a high employment rate and upwards social harmonisation, instead of engaging in the systematic and shameless dismantling of our fellow citizens’ social benefits, coupled with unrestrained social dumping."
".The Commission wants to bring into force a directive that was already rejected three times by the European Parliament during the last legislative term."
"This is a denial of democracy."
"There is, however, no reason to adopt this text today. It is a text that seriously threatens people’s safety and jobs."
"By means of self-handling, which allows ‘novices’ to do dock work and to handle cargo, this text introduces social dumping and calls safety arrangements into question."
"Out of all those groups working in the ports, not one is satisfied with this text: not the shipowners, not the pilots and not the boatmen."
"Why, then, if not in the name of free enterprise, do we want to turn our ports into supermarkets by selling off the port structures to the private sector?"
"European ports are competitive, and if we were to make laws, they would relate to maritime safety, the safety of the straits, spatial planning and the very high concentration of crews in the North Sea to the detriment of the Mediterranean Sea."
"The Commission proposal does not meet the current requirement of our ports."
"It must be rejected."
"This month, it is the port services directive and, next month, it will be the ‘Bolkestein’ Directive."
"When are we going to listen to what Europeans have to say?"
". I voted against this proposed directive and I welcome its rejection by Parliament."
"This rejection shows that the system of checks and balances in the EU’s institutional system actually works."
"Without the existence of the elected European Parliament, there would have been a real danger that, if left to their own devices, the Commission and national ministers in the Council would have adopted this undesirable piece of legislation."
". The ALDE Group believes that port services must be covered by a Community legislative framework which takes account of their particular conditions."
"Such a framework should allow fair access between the suppliers of services to port activities and would represent an essential asset for the development of the ports."
"It would also be an opportune moment to consider the role of the port authority or the operating methods of the port."
"In addition, a very clear clarification of the conditions of attribution of State aid must be carried out in order to guarantee transparent and fair competition between ports."
"In the absence of such a framework, the Treaty would be applied on a case-by-case basis, which would lead to a situation where the disputes would be resolved in the courts – a de facto government by judges – and where the two legislative arms of the European Union would be left aside."
"The European Commission proposal was not sufficiently complete or clear to gain the support of the European Parliament without substantial amendment."
"Following the rejection of this proposal, and for all these reasons, ALDE urges the European Commission to conduct a comprehensive consultation process with ..."
". The EU can only develop and establish itself if it is based on values such as solidarity, non-violence, law and order and the resolute promotion of public non-violence."
"Parliament’s discussion on the directive on market access to port services took place in an atmosphere loaded with undue pressure and violence, leading to material damage and injuries to people which can never be justified."
"Those responsible for breaking the law and disturbing the peace must not derive any benefit from their actions."
"Consequently, regardless of the intrinsic value of the issues addressed in this directive and the balance of social interests that was reached, I opted to abstain."
", . We voted to reject the proposal for a directive because we believe that the unbridled liberalisation of access to the public services market will create serious public health and safety problems, and will hinder the guaranteed provision and sustainability of the service – a public service, let us not forget – thereby leading to a reduction in the efficiency of that service."
"Three years after the Commission’s first proposal in this area, which was rejected at the time, we find ourselves once again debating a proposal for a resolution that was voted down in the Committee concerned, a vote that sends a clear message to Parliament: any text capable of creating a series of legal inconsistencies with the existing international legal framework and with current Community law – for example Regulation (EEC) No 1191/69 concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service – and of leading to the complete deregulation of auto-handling services cannot be deemed positive."
"This message actually goes further, and clearly demonstrates that a proposal applicable to substantially different ports, in which forced liberalisation is liable to lead to economically damaging monopolies and, lastly, a proposal with terrible social consequences cannot realistically be accepted by representatives of the people of Europe."
".The European Commission’s directive on the liberalisation of port services is nothing more and nothing less that a Bolkestein directive applied to the ports."
"It has come back to this Assembly, even though it had been rejected in its previous - almost identical - form a few months ago."
"Like the Bolkestein Directive, this text engineers social dumping on the very territory of the Union, threatens jobs and provides no guarantees whatsoever: not in terms of competitiveness, of growth, of efficiency or of safety."
"This is nothing more than a ‘liberalisation’ exercise in the name of a form of competition that is viewed as sacrosanct, with no regard for the actual consequences."
"There is no doubt that European ports are not as competitive as we would like them to be."
"There is no doubt that we need to relieve the congestion on land routes."
"There is no doubt that a great deal could be said about certain trade union monopolies and their corrupt practices."
"Yet, it is not by destroying jobs, by proposing ideological texts devoid of impact studies or by opening up our economies to unfair international competition that you will resolve these problems."
"Our main aim has to be one of defending the European jobs of European workers and, for us in the , one of defending the French jobs of French workers."
"Our decision to reject the text is final."
"The Port Services Directive constitutes an example of superfluous EU legislation."
"We voted against the report and recommend that the Commission’s proposal be rejected."
"We chose to support those amendments aimed at limiting the scope of the directive."
"We thus voted in favour of proposals whereby pilotage services and self-handling are to be excluded from the scope of the directive."
"We are critical of the Port Services Directive for a number of reasons."
"– The Port Services Directive takes no account of the principles either of subsidiarity or of proportionality."
"Political decisions on pilotage, unloading and self-handling must be taken at national level."
"– Under the proposal for a directive, employees doing the same jobs can belong to different union organisations."
"This paves the way for stoppages and militates against peaceful and orderly relations within the industry."
"– The Port Services Directive will scarcely promote competition."
"Ports are companies that compete with one another."
"The Port Services Directive is an attempt to force them to accept a situation in which other companies are able to take over parts of their business against their will."
"That is absurd."
"No one would come up with the idea of forcing Volvo to accept subcontractors they do not want."
"Competition between port companies is a good thing and leads to more efficient solutions."
"If a large-scale enterprise in another industry is not efficient and customer-friendly, it is driven out of business."
"That is also the way things work in the companies constituted by European ports."
".This is a directive which imposes regulations and controls which are neither necessary nor wanted."
"The directive, as proposed, endangers the livelihood of port workers in many countries among them Malta."
"This is fundamental for us."
"As drafted, this directive brings with it a lower quality of services, lower levels of safety and more threats to investments which have been made or which are still to be made aimed at improving the infrastructure in a number of ports."
"Contrary to what is being said by members of the Commission, this directive will neither create new markets, nor make competition more just and much less will it create new opportunities for workers."
"On the contrary this will affect negatively not only those who work in ports but also other sectors of the economy."
"We have to understand that with the enlargement of the European Union, diversity of Member States has increased and so one must be careful that when we legislate we do not put all countries in the same boat and assume that what counts for one country, counts for all."
"Therefore in solidarity with workers in Malta as well as in many other countries, I am voting against this directive which creates disadvantages for workers and which ultimately creates more problems than it solves."
".I voted against rejecting the text. In fact, I should have liked the opportunity to give my verdict on the amended text."
"The proposed amendments would have enabled us to help European ports meet the needs of international competition."
"The emotion of the moment has prevailed over the future of our ports."
"I should like to highlight the unacceptable attitude of the dockworkers."
"We would never have seen a national parliament attacked like the European Parliament was attacked yesterday."
"By throwing paving stones, steel bars and the like, the dockworkers laid the blame on Parliament, when Parliament is the institution in Europe that does the most to defend workers."
"I therefore condemn their ploys."
"While I share their concerns on some points, I will never give in to violence used as a pressure tactic."
"It is a question here of an attack on democracy."
"Yes, it is inconceivable that unqualified personnel should work in our ports. However, we cannot constantly go on about economic development, competitiveness and social progress if we do not provide ourselves with the resources to take action in these areas."
"It is imperative that we offer the ports in Hamburg, Marseille and Antwerp services that are at least as attractive as those offered in Asian ports."
"Their survival depends on our doing so."
". Our proposal to reject the directive on port services has, I am pleased to say, been adopted."
"For the second time, attempts to liberalise port services have been defeated, following a significant mobilisation of the workers in the sector, who, from the very outset, have fought against this new onslaught on jobs with rights. This had also been an attempt to put this sector, which is so important to national development, in the hands of the major shipowners, thereby driving the two sides even further apart."
"We must remain alive, however, to any fresh attempts at EU level to table again a proposal that has now been rejected twice."
"Any attempts at privatising port services, via the inclusion of the sector in the unacceptable proposal for a directive on the internal services market, or by stealth via the re-submission of the proposals on intra-Community shipping, must be resolutely combated."
"As the workers have emphasised, there is no justification for a Community directive on the sector."
"At this time, the victory for the port services workers must be saluted. This is a victory that forms part of the workers’ struggle in different countries against the EU’s neoliberal policies, which pander to the interests of the major economic and financial groups, attack workers’ rights, and undermine the national public sector and services."
". Port services must be covered by a legislative framework taking into account their specificity."
"A Community framework would allow equitable access to port activities."
"Furthermore an integrated policy is necessary to facilitate the development of European ports."
"It would also be the opportune moment for due consideration of the role of the managing body of the port as well as the operating methods of the port."
"In addition, very clear clarification on State aid rules is essential in order to guarantee transparent and fair competition between European ports."
"Decisions on a case-by-case basis, which would lead to a 'Gouvernement des juges', where the two legislative bodies of the European Union are left aside, are not acceptable."
"The European Commission's proposal was not sufficiently complete to gain support."
"Following the rejection of this proposal, and for all reasons mentioned, I urge the European Commission to enter into a vast consultation process with all parties concerned, also giving voice to those parties neglected until now and representing the demand side, and to propose an ambitious white paper on European seaports policy in its entirety, and this at the earliest possible opportunity."
". I voted against the report and against the directive just as I had done the first time this proposal came before us."
"Port owners and managers did not want the Directive."
"Employees and trade unions did not want it."
"I am pleased that MEPs have once again rejected the proposal and I hope that this time the Commission will listen to our democratic voice, not attempt to reintroduce their unwelcome plans."
"The Danish Liberal Party’s Members of the European Parliament voted in favour of the first amendment, recommending rejection of the Commission’s proposal, as it is impossible to bring about a satisfactory outcome in the light of that proposal."
"There is a need for a port services directive, but not in the form proposed by the Commission."
"The process of obtaining legislation in this area must be started afresh."
".Job cuts, wage dumping and social dumping and the lowering of safety standards and professional qualifications: this is what the European Commission is proposing to us in its third version of the directive on the liberalisation of port services."
"The thousands of dockworkers throughout Europe who demonstrated in November 2003 to denounce these wrongdoings will not have been enough to make people see sense."
"The anti-national and anti-social ultraliberalism sanctified by the Commission admits of no exceptions: on the model of the approach to the draft European Constitution, rejected by France and the Netherlands in referenda, there is a still an omnipresent desire in Brussels to put this port services directive back on the European agenda."
"A true ‘little sister’ of the Bolkestein Directive, the directive on the liberalisation of port services has the sole aim of allowing employees to be pitted against one another through the use of foreign, under-qualified labour on board ships that all too often sail under a flag of convenience, and this to the detriment of national workers."
"Having attacked our public services and our textile, coal and iron and steel industries, these Taliban of free trade are now, therefore, attacking port workers by seeking to impose their anti-national philosophy, which consists of giving preference to foreign workers in the job market."
"As always, the , for its part, is in favour of defending French jobs."
"What the Commission is proposing to us with this directive on the liberalisation of port services are nothing more or less than ports of convenience."
"We want nothing to do with these, any more than we do with flags of convenience whereby unscrupulous shipowners take on poorly trained and underpaid labour."
"The liberalisation at any price desired by Brussels in this area is synonymous with unemployment and social destitution."
"In the name of its ultraliberal and anti-national ideology, the Commission is notifying us of a reduction in costs to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services."
"Demolishing the monopoly enjoyed by dockworkers will lead not only to yet another graveyard of society but will lead to insecurity in European ports and will ultimately make them less competitive."
"In November 2003, thanks to the terrific mobilisation of dockworkers and port agents from the whole of Europe, this ‘Bolkestein Mark Two’ directive was derailed, and an unjustly stigmatised profession thereby prevented from being opened up for the benefit of under-qualified workers from the developing countries."
"Once again, it is the preference for employing foreigners that is endorsed and, with it, the end of professionalism, skills, traditions and social benefits."
"If there is one subject that awakens passions within the European institutions and provokes reactions in the Member States, it is the liberalisation of port services."
"In 2003, the European Commission achieved the feat of getting thousands of basically French, British, German, Belgian and Dutch dockworkers onto the streets in order to demonstrate, sometimes violently, against a draft directive that would jeopardise their status and lead inevitably to large job losses in their profession."
"Indeed, the most controversial aspect was that of self-handling, that is to say the opportunity for a shipowner, using his own staff and equipment, to take care himself of certain port services that, until now, had been the preserve only of dockworkers."
"The document proposed to us today has not abandoned the principle of self-handling, thereby leaving the door wide open for anyone to engage in the activities of dock work, pilotage, towage and mooring and for unscrupulous shipowners operating coffin ships to use under-qualified and underpaid staff."
"Whatever the objective pursued, Europe must not be constructed in a way that is to the detriment of safety standards and standards of professional qualification."
"From the comfort of their ivory tower, our European leaders are, once again, going to have to try and come up with something better, or else shelve their proposal."
". I find it utterly incomprehensible how the European Commission, scarcely a year after the failure of its first proposal for a directive on market access for port services just before the end of its term of office on 13 October 2004, can put forward a new proposal for a directive that not only contains drastically more stringent provisions but also retains the same core rules that were the downfall of its predecessor."
"I believe that the proposed directive represents a departure from the hitherto accepted model for European competition policy, which was about ensuring workable competition, and according to which regulatory interventions in a market or in individual market segments can be justified only if structural market conditions or attempts by participants in the market to restrict competition are interfering with economic efficiency."
"I am relieved at the outcome that has resulted from this debate, as also at the evident effect of the extensive protests (although I do of course condemn most forcefully the outrages perpetrated in Strasbourg), for the proposed directive constitutes an intervention in competition for loading services in ports, although no action is required on the basis of the market’s structure, the way it operates or the results obtained from it."
". I voted to reject the Port Services Directive as I believe that Member States should regulate the internal workings of their own ports, provided that they are in line with European competition and state aid laws."
"The tidal wave of ultraliberalism and unbridled free trade had, for 20 years, been breaking destructively over our coalmines and steelworks and over those industries of ours whose products included textiles, leather, machine tools, electrical goods and motor vehicles. It laid waste our fishing ports, our farms - including our sheep, cattle and poultry farms - our vineyards in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, our banana plantations in the West Indies and our plantations in Réunion, leaving women and men, including our countries’ workers of both sexes, suddenly without social protection."
"The people do not want to see our forms of social protection dismantled any further. Nor do they want any longer to see preference given to the base exploitation of foreign ‘workers’ by the Bolkestein directive and its younger sister, the Directive on Port Services."
"This Wednesday, 18 January 2006, the Front National’s MEPs have secured a parliamentary majority for refusing, for the second time, to allow European dockworkers, port pilots or any of our personnel responsible for stowage and other dock work to be sacrificed in Europe for the sole benefit of the multinationals that hold sway over maritime freight."
". With regard to the Commission text on the table, I share the concerns of many Irish stakeholders who made submissions to the Irish government, and which are also shared by many fellow Member States."
"The principal concern is that the Commission is proposing legal requirements which could adversely impact on the essential commercial and trading remit of the major ports covered by the proposed directive."
"Therefore, the workability of the Commission proposal for mandatory licensing of all internal port activities is questionable."
"As regards Irish seaports, governmental research (Sea Ports High Level Review) has shown there to be strong competition in the market for services internal to ports."
"Indeed, the landlord model is working to great effect in major ports where it is the common standard that internal services are provided on a competitive basis, with no single dominant operator."
"This has been important in facilitating private sector involvement in port service provision."
"The research also highlighted high levels of competition on and between Irish Sea routes."
"As an island, enhanced competition between ports is also vital, but future attempts at achieving European port policy must have the support of the port sector."
"– I voted against the report on the liberalisation of port services because, instead of strengthening the transparency of investments and state aid, it focuses on strengthening competition between European ports."
"Through a system of invitations to tender, private companies will be able to use their own crews in ports, while permanent dockworkers will lose their jobs."
"The ‘self-handling’ proposal is absolutely unacceptable."
"There is already sufficient competition in our ports which, it should be noted, are also among the cheapest in the world."
"Further price reductions and increased competition will have negative consequences both on safety measures and on environmental protection."
". I voted against the report because there are provisions which affect the commercial activities of ports in a detrimental fashion and which also affect the health and safety issues of workers at ports."
"I am not satisfied that these issues have been dealt with."
". This package has been roundly rejected by ports, unions and other bodies across Scotland."
"As a maritime nation we already have efficient port services and the competition model the Commission seeks to create in this package is not suitable to Scotland's needs nor, I believe, to those of Europe as a whole."
"The protests we saw at the beginning of this week were marred by the disgraceful violence of a minority, but the irony is that they were protesting in front of the one EU institution which supports their cause."
"I am glad that we have today sent the Commission home to think again, and hope that the Commission will now accept our view on this matter."
"I voted in favour of referring the document back to Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism. This would have enabled more thought to be given to the document, with new amendments being added, have permitted a variety of professionals (shipowners, pilots, boatmen, towage workers and dockworkers) to be consulted again and have allowed the European Commission to be asked to withdraw the text, and all this in an atmosphere of calm."
"I voted against rejecting the proposal for a directive, firstly because the proposal, with its proposed amendments, would have constituted a sound basis for Parliament’s work, this being only the first reading."
"Many professionals want to see a regulatory framework, and we need European rules in the interests of fair competition and in order to favour investment in ports and establish legal certainty in this sector."
"Nor did I want to echo the position of the Left which, in rejecting the text, has caused amendments to be rejected which would have provided guarantees in terms of maritime safety, training and social standards."
"Finally, I refuse to yield to the pressure exercised by the dockworkers, whose demonstration on Monday was unacceptable, involving, as it did, injuries to at least 12 people and damage to the tune of EUR 300 000 in Strasbourg."
"I genuinely regret that it can today be said that MEPs gave in, faced with the dockworkers."
", . I have voted in favour of rejecting the directive because we had only been given the option of voting for or against the original Commission proposal."
"This proposal for a new Port Directive leaves a great deal to be desired in many areas."
"Although Mr Jarzembowski had produced a substantial and sound package of amendment proposals, there was insufficient support for them."
"As we have no choice but to carry on with the discussion on a European port policy in the broad sense of the word, I have urged the Commissioner to come up with a discussion document that we – it is to be hoped – get our teeth into."
"Mr President, I was with the delegation that went to the Afghan elections in September, and even then we were saying that the large amounts of money that the European Union, among others, was investing in development cooperation in Afghanistan meant that a special parliamentary delegation would be necessary, and I think it extremely important that we have, by our resolution today, provided for one."
"One of the tasks that I believe this group of Members will have will be to monitor the European Union’s political objectives in Afghanistan, above all else developments in the field of human rights and women’s rights."
"We support Afghanistan’s development towards peace, stability and democracy following the fall of the Taliban regime."
"However, we view the EU’s ever more prominent military role in the country with concern."
"Afghanistan is not in the immediate vicinity of the EU. Nor, therefore, is it the EU’s task to station troops there."
"Rather, that is the task of individual countries or defence organisations acting on a mandate from the United Nations, which should be given a better basis for taking military action in trouble spots around the world."
"In view of the above, we are abstaining from voting in the final vote on the resolution, but we support the proposals concerning the protection of human rights."
". The most shocking thing about this House’s Joint Resolution on Afghanistan is that it contains not one word of criticism of the West’s military operations."
"Instead, it endorses the NATO ‘International Security Assistance Force’ (ISAF) operation and the so-called ‘war on terror’ in the shape of ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ (OEF)."
"It is far from enough that the Greens should call merely for the separation of ISAF and OEF’s command structures, for, in their operations on the ground, ISAF and OEF are inseparable."
"The extension of ISAF’s mission into southern Afghanistan, into what is more evidently a war zone, with the consequent deeper involvement in the war, will make matters worse."
"The substantial European troop presence in Afghanistan will have the effect of relieving the pressure on the US troops and hence on the occupying forces in Iraq."
"It is also necessary to close down the military bases that make an armed presence in Afghanistan possible in the first place, especially the German military base at Termez in Uzbekistan, through which pass all the troops sent to be stationed in Afghanistan."
"What makes the collaboration with Uzbekistan such a scandal is the fact that the country is under the rule of an authoritarian regime, one that, in particular, bears responsibility for the Andijan massacre."
"The closure of the forces bases in Afghanistan is also long overdue by reason of the latest offence against international law, the bombing of a village in Pakistan by CIA units."
". The purpose of this explanation of vote is to say that I share Parliament’s satisfaction, in broad terms, with the process of democratisation in recent years."
"Long gone are the days of the Taliban regime, with its horrific abuses and its breaches of the most basic rules and principles of human rights."
"Much remains to be done, but today’s Afghanistan is, most assuredly, a better place than it has been for a number of decades."
"This expression of satisfaction must not cover over two points."
"On the one hand, as previous speakers have mentioned, there is a great deal still to be done at various levels in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the international community, and not least the EU and its Member States, must continue to provide practical support, both material and human, aware as we are that this is a time-consuming, yet, as we have seen, encouraging process."
". We have abstained in the final vote on the Afghanistan resolution."
"We were against the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan and we demand the withdrawal of the United States-led coalition forces."
"We believe that the ISAF forces should be formed by countries which have not been involved in the United States coalition forces, and mainly formed by Muslim countries, in order to facilitate communication with and understanding of the Afghan people."
"The ISAF peacekeeping forces should be under the direct command of the United Nations, independent of NATO."
"But in the resolution we also note several important points on the need to develop democracy, the living standards of the people and gender equality, as well as the need for a stronger regime of development aid to Afghanistan."
"The conclusion for us is therefore to abstain in the final vote."
"Mr President, I am absolutely opposed to discrimination against homosexuals."
"I nevertheless regret that the report’s title was so completely unsatisfactory and that on some points it was necessary to abstain."
"If we are to speak here about a real problem, that of discrimination, why on earth use a word like homophobia, which is a totally inappropriate word used in psychology? Phobias are different kinds of anxieties."
"They are fears which are considered to be neurotic disorders. Therapy is needed to help them: they cannot be treated through political control, no more than claustrophobia or arachnophobia can."
"Real phobias often develop as a result of something that happened in childhood, and there may be a very good reason for them."
"I am worried that if we start putting people on trial here for their feelings or phobias, it will only result in one new form of discrimination and manipulation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I deplore the methods used to arrive at the drafting of the joint resolution."
"I consider it unacceptable that the talks were shamefully held in private, without the involvement of the group that I represent."
"I am well aware, of course, that all the political groups are equal, but evidently some are more ‘equal’ than others."
"My group firmly believes that there should be no room in a democracy for injustices or discrimination on the grounds of gender, race or religion."
"I have, however, felt it necessary to reject a resolution that is not mine and which, above all, contains paragraphs that in my view are inconsistent with the purpose of the document itself."
"I read that homosexuals should be fully recognised as victims of the Nazi regime: of course they were!"
"Does that mean, however, that other persecutions were perhaps less serious?"
"Are we forgetting the cruelty they suffered under Communist regimes, and under others too?"
"Given that the freedom to express one’s own sexuality has to be guaranteed, I believe that it should always be exercised with respect for the values and principles that set our society apart."
"The family has always meant a father and a mother, a man and a woman, and I do not believe that the European Union, by promoting campaigns against hypothetical discrimination, can give itself the right to ride roughshod over national governments just to endorse the wishes of certain not exactly worthy lobbying groups."
"The European Union cannot act on matters of values, culture and the family as if it were dealing with the single market, asking the Member States to legalise homosexual unions for the sake of uniformity and a misplaced duty to protect people’s rights; instead, it would be running the risk of undermining the system of values that lies at the heart of our age-old society."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the resolution, and on this subject I have to agree with Minister Tremaglia, who once said that ‘poofs’, or at least those who support them, are in the majority in Europe."
"Nevertheless, all lovers of political correctness – and I am proud not to be one of them – should also think about linguistic correctness: ‘homophobia’ is the opposite of ‘xenophobia’."
"The European Parliament does not accept xenophobes and it does not accept homophobes: what, then, should a person be?"
"I voted against the motion for a resolution on homophobia in Europe because I think it reductionist to treat the fight against homophobia as being, principally, a fight against forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"This confusion between homophobia, the definition of which is ‘fear of what is the same’, and an aversion to homosexuality is a source of misunderstandings."
"Setting aside issues relating to marriage and children, in relation to which political reflection and the demands of society deserve parallel periods in which to come to fruition, I am naturally in favour of combating all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation, but I consider that, on the one hand, the issue of human beings being treated unequally and, on the other, fear of people similar to ourselves deserve better than this resolution."
"Whilst the Dutch delegation within the Independence and Democracy Group will support the resolution on homophobia tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, it will not support those tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, or, indeed, the common draft resolution on homophobia in the European Union."
"The Dutch delegation is able to endorse the resolution by the UEN Group, because only in that resolution is it clearly stated that policy measures in the area of discrimination fall within the remit of the Member States."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here."
"Furthermore, we would like to say that we condemn the incitement of hatred against homosexuals and violence inflicted on people on the basis of their sexual orientation."
"We believe that the enactment of policies intended to prevent discrimination on the grounds of religion, race or sexual orientation is a matter for the Member States."
"The resolutions of the different groups overlook this principle by directing their attention to the political situation in a number of Member States."
"– European countries seem to be victims of an infectious homophobia that is cause for concern."
"It is a homophobia all the more shocking because people no longer appear to have any hang-ups about it and because it is everywhere rife, expressed in verbal or physical violence, the persistence of discrimination and the introduction of new legislation (for example, the Latvian Parliament has tabled an amendment to the Latvian Constitution to prohibit marriages between persons of the same sex)."
"Whether in disguise or taken for granted, homophobia has no place in the European Union."
"Non-discrimination is guaranteed in the texts (the Treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights)."
"It ought to be so in actual practice."
"Moreover, it is very much to the credit of this European Parliament always to have been in the vanguard of this fight."
"It has committed itself to promoting people’s rights and lessening discrimination (February 1994, September 1996, July 2001 and June 2005)."
"It must do so again today."
"That is the ambition behind this resolution, which is unambiguous in condemning discrimination in all its forms."
"It relies on the will to bring about change, demanding that the arsenal of anti-discrimination measures be supplemented on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty and that a communication be issued on the obstacles to the freedom of movement of homosexual couples whose partnerships are legally recognised in the EU."
"It is a clear and necessary political signal."
"I shall vote in favour of it with determination and conviction."
". I welcome today's vote on this issue, and especially Parliament's overwhelming commitment to treating same-sex partners with equality of respect."
"I very much regret Parliament's unwillingness to say what is going on within our own Member States."
"We know that what Parliament says and does affects public perceptions."
"Recent events and statements in Poland and parliamentary debates in Latvia and Lithuania have been shameful in my view."
"Some of the debates have amounted to hate speak."
"This sort of behaviour runs counter to Council of Europe Conventions and EU Treaties, so the European Parliament should be brave enough to speak out and confront this."
". I share the concern expressed in this motion for a resolution, in common with others previously discussed here in Parliament, with specific regard to a number of principles with which I identify and which I advocate."
"All forms of hate should be rejected; all forms of discrimination by the law should be combated."
"In this resolution, however, there is a range of proposals which I believe go beyond what I feel should be Parliament’s scope and which, to my mind, impinge upon what should be the scope of individual countries."
"There is a trend among certain political groups, with which I have no truck whatsoever, to try to adopt what has been rejected in their home Member States in the EU’s institutions."
"I object to this."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that phobias, as the manifestation of behavioural problems, cannot be combated in legislation nor at parliamentary level."
". We are all opposed to all forms of discrimination and violence."
"Unequivocally, there can be no exception to respect that is due."
"That being said, the free and democratic debate taking place in Member States on their own civil legislation, on laws relating to the family or regarding personal status, must not be confused with ‘homophobia’."
"This would be tantamount to creating an atmosphere of undue intellectual pressure and restriction, totally at variance with an open democratic society."
"Opposing views must not be confused with ‘homophobia’."
"It is wrong to foster or invent feelings of hate and intolerance."
"To classify differences as ‘phobias’ is in itself an example of extremism."
"Much of this resolution does not in fact tally with the definition of ‘homophobia’ as it appears in Recital A, which means that it loses all relevance and meaning."
"Furthermore, there are several parts that run counter to the principle of subsidiarity, a guiding principle and cornerstone of the entire Union, which would only serve to undermine the European project."
"This is why I voted against."
"Homophobia means ‘fear of those who resemble us’."
"There is nothing pejorative or malicious about the term."
"A phobia is a neurosis characterised by extreme anxiety in the presence of the source of distress, and it requires suitable treatment in the form of deconditioning, analysis and the use of drugs."
"I voted against this resolution, which does not deal with homophobia."
"Any form of violence against anyone is to be condemned."
"There are no different categories of citizens."
"The right to life, liberty and security, together with respect for human dignity, apply to all human beings."
"These rights are guaranteed under law."
"The right to respect for private and family life and to freedom of thought, conscience and religion are fundamental rights protected by the international treaties."
"The Member States must respect the right to marriage, which stipulates that, as from marriageable age, a man and a woman are entitled to marry and to start a family in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of this right."
"The European Union has no competence in these areas and cannot judge the constitutions and national laws of its Member States which, having all signed the European Convention on Human Rights, are accountable in the matter of such rights to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I was one of those involved in drafting the resolution on climate and who attended the Montreal Summit."
"I cannot consider the result achieved at the Montreal Summit to be anywhere near as favourable as we, in the name of political correctness, now feel obliged to say it was here."
"Only one quarter of all emissions will be covered by the obligations to cut them, and I therefore think it is somewhat intellectually dishonest to speak of achievements."
"Sooner or later the EU will have to end all this sweet talk and face facts."
"If three quarters of the world’s producers of greenhouse gases are allowed to continue to increase their emissions, it will be time for us to say that this solution has failed and to start to take some other form of political action on climate."
"Will it be a matter of political pride, however, if we are unable to admit such a thing?"
". We broadly welcome the resolution tabled as a follow-up to the 11th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Montreal, as it underlines the desire of the parties to honour the Kyoto Protocol and regrets the continued reluctance of the US administration to join any significant partnership on climate change."
"We are opposed to some points in the final resolution and regret that our proposals were not adopted."
"We were especially disappointed at the rejection of the proposal to which we put our name calling for an urgent review of the relevant flexible mechanisms before the Community emission trading scheme can be extended to other areas, such as aviation."
"We believe that this extension must undergo an analysis demonstrating that it will help to combat climate change and that there will not be any bias in favour of wealthier countries and regions over developing countries and industries."
"We also object to the emphasis on the trade in rights to pollute, even in respect of an assessment."
"Global climate change constitutes a significant problem that there are good reasons for dealing with at international level."
"The June List would, however, reiterate the position it put forward earlier, namely that the European Parliament should not take over the Member States’ foreign policies by calling on third countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so."
"Individual national governments can make appeals of this type independently."
"We also believe that the Member States should be able to adopt their own positions in connection with negotiations on international climate issues."
"We presume, however, that agreements entered into will be observed by all the parties."
"We are critical of the proposal to set up a communication strategy at EU level to inform people about climate issues."
"EU cooperation is based on the Member States having confidence in one another."
"We are convinced that individual Member States can successfully take the measures required for giving the general public access to appropriate information on climate issues."
"The position we are expressing through this explanation of vote constitutes the attitude we adopt on principle regarding this issue."
"The explanation of vote thus applies to future matters of a similar kind."
". The Cree Indians have a saying to the effect that it is only when the last tree has been uprooted, the last river poisoned, and the last fish caught, that man will discover that he cannot eat money."
"It could well soon come true."
"For all too long have we heedlessly tampered with nature’s delicate framework."
"Only now have we started to give more attention to the protection of the environment and set in motion the first and vital joint projects aimed at saving it."
"We will, though, have to redouble our efforts."
"The fact is that we are slowly but surely turning our backs on the Gulf Stream, our natural source of heating, and, every day, as we do so, ocean currents altered by global warming are robbing us of some 86 million tonnes of arable soil, some 225 000 more human beings are being born, and desertification proceeds at a headlong and ever-faster rate."
"Europe is threatened by the most devastating change in its climate for a good 5 000 years."
"With ice melting to the north of it, and deserts spreading out to the south, with, at the same time, enormous ‘reserves’ of carbon dioxide accumulating in the permafrost and the tundra, things will become pretty uncongenial in the foreseeable future."
"Various experts have worked out an immense range of possible solutions, which languish in their desk drawers; the time has come for us to give our closer attention to them and to their implementation, and, at long last, to work together towards a common goal."
"The June Movement has voted in favour of paragraph 45 of the report on the environmental aspects of sustainable development, but wants minimal directives to be used in introducing ecotaxes at Community level so that more far-reaching requirements might be laid down in the individual Member States."
"Paragraph 45:"
"‘Supports the introduction of ecotaxes at Community level; stresses that, like the other market instruments, they are an essential tool for an effective pollution reduction policy; calls on the Commission to make proposals and the Member States to adopt the first European ecotax by 2009 at the latest;’"
". We voted in favour of the report before us, which seeks to assess the environmental aspects of sustainable development and offers some criticisms of the Commission’s position, with regard to the inadequacy of certain directives and the scarcity of financial resources."
"Although it does not specifically tackle the policies that lie at the root of environmental problems, such as the emphasis on competitiveness at the expense of people and the environment, with the profit motive always to the fore, there are positive points, such as the promotion of less polluting forms of transport, the role of territorial and forestry planning and the need to ensure food supplies."
"We also welcome the connection that it makes between poverty and the environment, although it is appalling that the most important aspects in this field, namely that liberalisation is not the answer to poverty and social exclusion, were rejected in plenary. The criticisms of the inadequacy of the proposals in the fight against poverty, social exclusion and increasing inequality were similarly rejected."
"This report deals with a list of significant issues within the area of sustainable development."
"The June List believes that there are good reasons for EU cooperation on cross-border environmental issues."
"However, the report addresses a number of crucial political areas that should lie outside the EU’s competence."
"The following are examples:"
"– the investment to be made in public transport or, as the case may be, the development of road networks in the Member States;"
"– debt cancellation for developing countries;"
"– environmental taxes at EU level;"
"– the inclusion or otherwise of environmental education as a subject on the curricula of primary schools in the Member States;"
"– tax on labour in the Member States;"
"– employment and social integration."
"We are very critical of the fact that the EU institutions have a voracious appetite for increased influence."
"We have thus chosen to vote against the report as a whole but are well disposed towards individual paragraphs, mainly those dealing with genuinely cross-border environmental problems."
". Sustainable development is unquestionably one of the EU’s key objectives and a global challenge."
"Accordingly, sustainable development strategies require a long term political vision at the highest level."
"We must address social, environmental and democratic challenges responsibly, not only at public authority level, but also at the level of the citizens."
"We ensure, however, that all of the measures to be taken tally with our objectives of social and economic growth and development, which are crucial to the future of our societies."
"This report examines the progress made since 2001 and sets out fresh measures."
"As part of the process, we must reiterate the need to ensure that sustainable development is a priority for the future of Europe, and retain our objective of meeting the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report."
". Sustainable development must take higher prominence across all of our policy areas, and I am glad that this report provides a starting point on how to achieve this and am glad to support it."
"In my own country, Scotland, we have a unique contribution to make in terms of renewable energy, with our vast natural potential offering us the opportunity to become Europe's green powerhouse."
"But this potential will not be developed without strong encouragement from government at all levels, and we must redouble our efforts to take the ideas in this report and build upon them."
"The Spanish Socialist Delegation is pleased with the approval of this own-initiative report, which is intended to improve the prospects for achieving genuine sustainable development."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point out that, in the second part of Amendment 2 (paragraph 15), we have decided to vote against because we believe that the water protection and management policy must be based on criteria of rationality, efficacy and efficiency and not solely on the adoption of measures to reduce water abstraction, since that could have negative consequences of a different nature."
"The next item is the report by Johannes Voggenhuber and Andrew Duff, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the period of reflection: the structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union (2005/2146(INI)) (A6-0414/2005)."
"Mr President, this is Parliament’s first response to the crisis created by France and the Netherlands in rejecting the Constitution."
"It is a chance for us to reflect on what will be lost, especially for Parliament, should we be incapable of salvaging the project and bringing it to a successful conclusion."
"It is a chance for us to respond to the cacophony of sounds emerging from the ranks of the Council – some simplistic, some in breach of the Treaty, some improbable politically."
"It is a chance for us to encourage the Commission to be more forthright and incisive to assist us in finding a way forward out of the crisis."
"It is a chance for Parliament to fill some political space and to bring a focus to the period of reflection."
"We know that we cannot achieve all this by ourselves but must have the close collaboration of national parliaments."
"I must say that I find it fairly curious in this context that the Presidents of the Austrian, Finnish and German Parliaments seem somewhat reluctant to cooperate with us."
"It is up to the parliaments to decide whether or not they turn up."
"Those who choose to turn up will have a decisive say in fashioning the decisions about the future of Europe."
"The proposals, which received strong support from the committee, set out a parliamentary process."
"We seek to establish a series of parliamentary forums to debate some fundamental – perhaps even primitive – questions about the nature and purpose of Europe."
"We want to have the debate about the reform of common policies that the first Convention was in some part frustrated in being denied."
"This policy debate can and should be radical, but it must take place within the constitutional context and be closely related to issues of competences, to instruments and to procedures."
"The first of these forums will take place on 9 May and will address its conclusions to the European Council, which is to take some first decisions about the furtherance of the project."
"We would like to draw the period of reflection to a close at the end of 2007 with a firm, clear decision on what to do with the Treaty."
"As the resolution states, there are, in theory, several scenarios we could follow, but in practice there are only two."
"The first is to supplement the present Treaty with interpretative protocols or declarations."
"The second is to make rather more substantive changes to Part III so that we address the legitimate concerns and disquiet expressed by citizens in France and the Netherlands and in some other Member States."
"Between and inside the groups there is certainly controversy about the appropriate way to express ourselves."
"However, on the essentials of salvaging the Treaty, we are strongly united and I commend the resolution to Parliament."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today sees us presenting the report on the period of reflection on the European Union, from which, after many months of debate, and endorsed by the overwhelming majority on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, emerged a road map showing a way out of the constitutional crisis."
"Little time now remains before Parliament takes this great step, this great decision, but if I had no more than a minute in which to speak, I would use it to thank my fellow rapporteur, Mr Duff, for the extraordinary honour and pleasure of working with him on this."
"From him I learned that the future – by which I mean the future we share in this Europe of ours – can be found by looking in the most diverse directions, and for that I am very grateful to him."
"If the combination of a Green Austrian and an English Liberal is not a handicap from the word go, then I do believe that other combinations can work just as well."
"Of course, not even the harmonious notes sounded by the President of the Council’s magic flute this morning could mask the crisis that is going on in Europe, and, while he did not mention it, I would like to, and I would like to say something about what is at the heart of this crisis."
"At the centre of this whole, newly-ignited, dispute, the disagreements we have, and the European crisis, is a single sentence uttered by founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, who said, ‘We are not uniting states; we are uniting people’."
"That is what today’s argument is about."
"Are we to have a Europe of chancelleries, governments and elites, or the union of citizens to which this constitution has opened the door?"
"Those who talk as if the constitution were dead are rejecting the human Europe, giving the intergovernmental Europe a shot in the arm and conjuring up the ghosts of the 19th century, those primal misfortunes from Pandora’s box: nationalism, rivalry between states, the concept of the balance of power, the striving for dominance, a fragmented Europe incapable of maintaining its own peace, let alone of becoming a power for peace."
"That is what this dispute is about."
"Before we entered the Chamber, there were fellow Members there to welcome us dressed as ostriches."
"They had no need to dress up, for we knew perfectly well who they were, and we are not blind; we know that the nationalists regarded the temporary failure of the ratification process as presenting them with an historic opportunity for a nationalist renaissance."
"To them, by this report, and with virtual unanimity, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding ‘no’."
"The Constitution is not dead, for people’s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds, and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order, a political architecture, a political space, in which such a future is possible."
"The crisis that the report we are presenting today attempts to resolve is a crisis of confidence, the crisis of a Union that cannot tell the difference between a union of citizens and a union of states, a Union in which people’s expectations are disappointed as a veritable matter of course."
"It has no answer to social issues, it suffers from a democracy deficit, fundamental rights are not secured, there is not enough transparency, and the power of governments is unbridled and subject to few controls."
"This constitution, though, is a step forward, and if it is beset by difficulties, then we will try to keep it on course."
"What we have conceived is a European debate; I see us as bringing the process back to the people, and that adds up to nothing less than taking the elites’ project and turning it into a , a popular cause."
"I hope that this House – if it adopts this report – will join us in appealing to all the parties, to the population at large, to the municipalities and regions, to the trade unions and to civil society, to carry on with this debate, to take up the future of this Europe of ours as a popular cause and to join with us in contending for it."
"We did not envisage that this debate should be without form."
"We, in all the groups, agreed on six questions, covering many issues that people fight shy of talking about: the goal of European integration, the borders of Europe, the future of the economic and social model, Europe’s role in the world, the area of security, freedom and law, not to mention the social issues – and, even if the constitution does not do all the things we want it to do, which it goes without saying it will not, then I do nonetheless hope that this plan brings us a good deal closer to this objective."
"Perhaps I might say one more thing about precisely where our difference with the Constitutional Affairs Committee lies."
"What the rapporteurs want, and what they have fought for, is another step forward rather than the continued ratification process being regarded as the end product of this debate; they want it also to be possible to improve the constitution, to retain what is at its heart and, in 2007, to revise it in a more open process and a more credible debate, with the revision to be presented to the public in a Europe-wide referendum."
"My hope is that, aided by the Commission’s level-headedness and this House’s courage, this further step may be taken."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy to me to be speaking today in your plenary and meeting you, both of these things for the first time."
"I am particularly glad that the mandatory dialogue between the institutions has reached a topic that is particularly demanding of cooperation."
"As both the rapporteurs have already said, it is true to say that 2005 was a difficult year;"
"Mr Voggenhuber went so far as to use the word ‘crisis’."
"We are indeed going through a crisis of confidence where the European public are concerned."
"We must answer those questions that they have every right to ask of us."
"I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity, of which all of us together – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – must make use."
"It is at this point that I would like to extend most especial thanks to your House, for you were wrestling with this issue at a time when the governments were not yet willing to make a serious start on debate."
"The Duff/Voggenhuber report has been the occasion, in this House, for a debate that will help us to move on."
"The Austrian Presidency has, from its very first day, endeavoured to engage in this debate, to carry it further and develop it."
"You will all have been able, as you followed it, to note how very vigorous it has been from the very outset, with the whole spectrum of opinions being given voice, and the report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee reflects that."
"One thing that does come across clearly is that there are no quick fixes, no tricks and no shortcuts, whereby we might, so to speak, throw a bridge across the confidence gap between Europe and its citizens."
"Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term."
"Our belief that this debate must be a wide-ranging one reflects the view expressed in your report, which we are debating today."
"What we need is not just a debate about the constitutional treaty or the legal dimension, but a broad debate on what sort of Europe we want, where we want to go, where Europe’s borders are, and how we can address the European public’s fears and worries."
"We, in the Council, want not only to continue with this debate, but also to conduct it in greater depth."
"We have planned a series of events at which we want to have broad-based discussions with the European public."
"Only yesterday, we were discussing with the Commission and with your House the methods and strategies whereby we might communicate this Europe of ours and what it stands for to the public and by what means, in what discussion forums and in what depth we might best meet the expectations that people have of Europe."
"As the President of the Council said today, we do intend, at the same time as we kick off the debate, to consider the issue of European identity."
"On the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, in Salzburg, we intend to address the question of ‘What is Europe, what is the European identity?’"
"Right through to the end of the Austrian Presidency, there will be a whole series of other events, for the debate on Europe’s future is a many-sided one, and it is only when all of its sides are lit that all the dimensions with which we have to do become apparent."
"Important though this public debate is, there will also have to be practical work done in order that it may be clearer to us which way we should go, and it will have to be done by the governments of the Member States."
"The Council Presidency’s most important task is to get all the Member States on board, for it is only together that we will be able to move forward."
"As the Chancellor has already said, what we want to achieve is to be able, at the end of our Presidency, to produce a sketch of the way ahead and to agree on how we can best cooperate in achieving our common goals."
"I hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe, and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens."
". Mr President, honourable Members, in this first plenary part-session of the year I should like to wish all of you an excellent 2006."
"From the Constitutional point of view, I believe it can only be better than last year."
"I hope, as the person responsible both for Constitutional issues and for interinstitutional affairs, that we can continue our fruitful, effective and close cooperation."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs for this report on the period of reflection and the motion for a resolution."
"I have already discussed it on several occasions with the two Members of the European Parliament who were members of the European Convention."
"I would like to underline the considerable progress made since the initial considerations and congratulate the co-rapporteurs for the job they have done and also for their ability to take on board the many views expressed during the intense discussions in committee."
"I will limit my remarks to four points."
"The first is that we all wish to achieve a constitutional settlement, to make Europe more transparent, more democratic and more effective."
"The question is how to achieve that settlement after the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes."
"I was happy to see that all options regarding the Constitution remain open in your resolution."
"During the reflection period it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties, and national and regional parliaments without prejudging the result of the wider dialogue and debate."
"If we do not, this exercise will lose all its value."
"I also took note of your favourite option."
"Maintaining the Constitution, however, will not be possible without French and Dutch support with, if necessary, additional clarifications and measures."
"Recent Eurobarometer surveys have shown that European citizens’ support for the concept of a Constitution for the EU has increased by two percentage points over the past five months to 63%."
"Therefore, as has been said many times in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it is important to change the context rather than the text."
"That is why the dialogue has to focus on the European project in connection with Constitutional reform, and on the ultimate objective linked to the instruments to deliver it."
"It is only after the listening exercise based on the results of national debates is complete, that we will be able to draw conclusions on the best Constitutional settlement for Europe."
"That is also why the Commission wants to focus on policy priorities addressing citizens’ concerns on growth, jobs, employment and security."
"Secondly, I fully share your resistance to proposals for core groups of certain Member States."
"What we want is a Europe for everyone, not just for some."
"The Union is in the process of consolidating the most recent accession process."
"We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States."
"My view is that any enhanced cooperation must, in all circumstances, be undertaken within the existing Treaties and remain open to all Member States."
"You can rest assured that the Commission and myself will not support any proposal for enhanced cooperation outside the European Union institutional framework."
"Thirdly, it seems reasonable to me to draft final conclusions on the reflection period in 2007, under the German or Portuguese Presidency."
"The June 2006 European Council is clearly a major milestone in this process, but it should not be the end of it."
"It will, of course, be up to the European Council to decide on any potential extension of the reflection period beyond the June 2006 extension already suggested by the Austrian Presidency."
"In any case, as announced in Plan D, the Commission will prepare a communication for the June European Council setting out its thinking on the initial feedback received during the period of reflection, and this will be based on the national visits currently being undertaken by the President, myself and fellow Commissioners, a special Eurobarometer report, discussion forums and the 9 May conferences."
"This synthesis report should explain the background and approach taken by the Commission over the last year, outline the initial results of the listening exercise and provide a series of conclusions for the Austrian Presidency on the next steps to be taken."
"This will complement the factual report that will be prepared by the Austrian Presidency on the basis of contributions from the Member States."
"Fourthly, I support your rejection of piecemeal implementation of the Constitution."
"The reason for that is simple - it has to do with respect."
"Respect for those who said ‘no’ and for those who have already ratified, and respect for the institutional balance."
"Cherry-picking could give the impression that the Union is trying to circumvent the results of national referenda and is liable to impair the overall institutional balance."
"We should respect the difference between our institutions and those in the Member States and, most of all, when we embark on various praiseworthy initiatives and projects we should always respect each country’s democratic traditions."
"All of us play important, but different, roles."
"In conclusion, I would stress that we cannot discuss these issues without entering into political debate and discussing political priorities."
"European citizens will see that there are political differences in Europe."
"This is another forum for discussing political priorities, but without it and without any discussion on constitutional matters nothing will work."
"We have to combine this process with creating legitimacy for our institutions by delivering the political results that European citizens want, so we have to consider their daily concerns as well as the constitutional issues."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, largely because of the national parliaments, which constituted the largest group in the Convention, it and the Intergovernmental Conference gave the draft constitutional treaty a balanced reception, with fourteen countries ratifying it, two of them by means of a referendum, while two did not."
"This failure, which had to do not only with national issues but also with the mood in Europe as a whole, represents a failure on the part of national politics, but also of European politics, in that we have not succeeded in justifying Europe."
"We have to take the public’s concerns seriously, not least in France and in the Netherlands; we cannot simply disregard them, but should spell out why we need this sort of Europe."
"That is what the period of reflection needs to be used for; it is not a period for debate on details in the constitution, but a time when Europe must be justified to people."
"It has to be clear to us, and we have to make it clear to others, that the constitutional treaty contains things the absence of which the public formerly criticised, such as greater capacity to act in foreign and security policy matters, on which the opinion I have drafted concentrates, and which, according to all opinion surveys, is precisely what the public want."
"They want Europe to be represented to the outside world, and it is precisely so that it may be that there are rules in the constitution, rules that only it provides for and which we, under present conditions, cannot lay down without it."
"It creates a new form of subsidiarity involving the national parliaments, thereby making centralisation impossible, and backs up this concept of subsidiarity with solidarity."
"Citizens’ rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have a major part to play in this."
"This constitution makes the citizens into decision-making actors and also provides them with protection."
"It must also be clear to us that in future, for example, the President of the Commission, as head of the European executive, will emerge directly from the elections to the European Parliament, with the public having a part to play in that."
"That is why we should focus on the fact that Parts I and II are the actual constitutional treaty itself, whilst Part III is the Treaty of Nice, about which there have been misunderstandings that we have not been able to eradicate, and so I am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its willingness to put forward a ‘road map’ and glad that Germany, during its presidency, intends to take new initiatives."
"We should now concentrate on dialogue, assess the reflection period, and put forward our proposals in 2007."
"It follows from this that we cannot take action right now, as Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber propose; that would be premature and does not reflect what the public wants."
". Mr President, I am very grateful to both the rapporteurs for their report."
"I know that the issues that Mr Brok has just raised have prompted a great deal of debate, not least within the political groupings in this House, and there is much to be said for both positions."
"Perhaps we have to begin with the issues of substance, which we may well have neglected to some degree; how, for example, can we persuade the public that Europe needs a constitution of the kind that has been drafted?"
"I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing, but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House."
"I refer, of course, to the issue of energy."
"It was pretty surprising, indeed pretty astonishing, to see how many Members of this House who had, until recently, perhaps taken a rather sceptical view of such things, are now forthright advocates of a common energy policy;"
"I was delighted to hear what Mr Saryusz-Wolski had to say on the subject."
"The Federal Chancellor is a constant advocate of subsidiarity; today, as President of the Council, he argued strongly in favour of a common energy policy."
"This is just one example showing how important it is that the powers and prerogatives that we, particularly in the Constitution, have accorded to the European level be used to the utmost."
"I see this as the road down which we must go."
"I could, at this point, for example, talk about space policy, which has been another topic for debate in this place, and which is not about sending Europeans into space, but rather about monitoring the environment or giving warnings of tsunamis in good time."
"There are plenty of other things that are realistic and feasible and capable of being explained to the public if we focus on matters of substance rather than the institutional issues."
"What we in this House expect, of course, is a road map or sketch of how things are to progress."
"I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in all the weighty matters with which you will have to deal over the coming weeks and months of this Presidency, to highlight how much better we could handle them if we had a European constitution."
"That is absolutely vital."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as somebody brilliantly put it, for fifty years the European project has been a football match played behind closed doors."
"With the referendum on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the citizens who wanted to get in and watch from the terraces went beyond that and organised an actual invasion of the pitch."
"Today’s crisis in Europe also lies in the fact that it is no longer possible to go back behind closed doors, back to the Europe of the Treaties and elitist decisions, and that, at the same time, no one knows how to get the people back onto the terraces so that they can express their opinions properly as fans normally do."
"Reinventing a system of participation and accountability, whereby the Union answers directly to the citizens, without the self-seeking, distorting and misleading mediation of the Member States, is a prerequisite for setting the European project in motion again, whatever its new content may be."
"The question is, however, accountability for what?"
"We must avoid the mistake of turning the pause for reflection into a pause of inaction."
"No Plan D will be a success if, in addition to the ‘D’ for ‘debate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘democracy’, it does not also include ‘D’ for ‘delivery’."
"Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution, and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be."
"That is why even self-inflicted failures, like today’s refusal to regulate market access to port services, can become symbolically dangerous."
"There are areas of recognised European competence in which the existing treaties already provide for qualified majority voting and the interinstitutional codecision procedure – transport is one example. There are also areas where subsidiarity should properly be interpreted in reverse: not letting the Member States do badly what can be done better at a European level."
"In these areas of competence, the Union must raise its delivery rate and dare to show how useful it can be."
"Today it is no longer enough to see the Union merely as a clever solution to the problems of war, including the Cold War."
"What we need is a Union that is equal to the global challenges of the third millennium."
"We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow, but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today, or we would risk invalidating all our reflection, no matter how clever it might be."
". – I am a proud member of the Independence and Democracy Group, which has been portrayed none too accurately as Eurosceptic."
"It may therefore have come as a surprise that I was appointed to draft the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in respect of the report on the period of reflection following the rejection of the Constitution."
"I consider this a sign of the openness with which our Committee approached this issue."
"The principle of – let the other side be heard – is one of the fundamental preconditions for real dialogue."
"My views provoked constructive debate in committee, resulting in a compromise that was well thought through, and anything but toothless."
"The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee, with no votes against, and four abstentions."
"This demonstrates that dialogue on the future of the Union is possible."
"Our report in fact advocates principles that are missing from the report of Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber."
"I refer in particular to the principle of legal precaution, by which we should be guided, so that we do not, in the regulations which we approve during the period of reflection, constantly refer to a Constitution that is currently dead from a legal standpoint but which might be resurrected in its original form."
"It is naïve and misguided to believe that the more often we refer to the Constitution the more we will boost its chances for resuscitation."
"Such rules may needlessly be undermined at some future point."
"Our Committee’s report also recommends that we enter into cooperation with the institutions of national and regional parliaments, which possess a high degree of qualification and legitimacy, and that we do this more than just once a year for the sake of appearances, as recommended in the report before us today."
"Unfortunately, there are other parts of the report that strike a discordant note, the most surprising of which is that it sets out what the result of open dialogue ought to be."
"It evens states that the now dead Constitution is to be ratified in 2009."
"This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States."
"If we are to prescribe the outcome of dialogue in advance, if we reduce dialogue to the level of a stage-managed performance involving unrepresentative bodies, if we continue to spend money in such a way that only the most gratifying opinions are heard, the EU will never have any chance of developing effective structures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on the even-handedness of their report, and that I am very glad to be able, today, to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on it."
"This House has had a long fight where codecision in agricultural matters is concerned, and the draft constitution’s incorporation of codecision – which goes back to the Treaties of Amsterdam – in the fields of environmental protection, food safety and the protection of consumers is something to be welcomed."
"Where agricultural policy is concerned, however, the Council of Agriculture Ministers can still disregard the opinions of the European Parliament, since the codecision procedure is not, under the current Treaty, applicable to the common agricultural policy."
"Although the draft constitution, when considered in the light of the above, held out the prospect of increased democratic legitimacy, in that all decisions on agricultural policy were to be subject to codecision, the Agriculture Committee does believe that the existing text is still in need of some improvements."
"The objectives of the common agricultural policy, as set out in Article III-227, contradict the goals of the European Union described in Article I-3, and no longer serve any readily explainable purpose."
"They must, as a matter of urgency, be updated to take account of the multifunctional nature of our present agriculture, which provides work for 10 million people in the EU, is the sole guarantor of the sustainable development of rural areas and cannot be considered in isolation from them."
"This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large, and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy, and, in particular, to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 (2) and III-231 (2) of the text as it stands at present."
"Since the CAP is so very important and occupies a predominant position in the EU’s Budget, the European public have every right to the highest possible degree of transparency and, above all in this sensitive area, codecision – which, as I see it, can mean nothing other than full codecision for the European Parliament on all matters relating to agricultural policy, consumer protection and the safety of food."
". Mr President, on this occasion I really am speaking from the heart when I say that both rapporteurs are to be congratulated, not only on the report that is now before us, but also on their sustained commitment to the idea of a constitution, even at times when there was little support for it."
"I hope that that state of affairs is now a thing of the past."
"I have had the honour of drafting the Legal Affairs Committee’s opinion, which is very much in line with the content of this draft report from the lead Committee."
"The Legal Affairs Committee’s particular concern has been that we should not prematurely abandon the present draft constitution."
"In the subject areas that really matter to us, such as the composition and powers of the European Court of Justice, the reordering of the lawmaking process and comitology procedure, and judicial cooperation, we simply do not see that a completely new start would enable us to make any real improvements; indeed, it is more likely to have the opposite effect."
"While I do regret having had to listen today to the Austrian Presidency’s critical views of the powers of the European Court of Justice and the fact that such criticism comes now not only from that source, it does lead me to think that the solutions provided in this draft constitution really are very good after all."
"We have good legal reasons for objecting to any hasty division of the draft Constitution."
"Part I contains a very large number of fundamental principles, and we all know that it was only the derogations contained in Part III that made them politically acceptable."
"We also, albeit with some regret, have good legal reasons for regarding Parts I and III as connected, and no new structure will be possible without fundamental reworking of Part III."
"I will conclude by expressing my grave disappointment with the letter from the three presidents of national parliaments."
"The sight of many former members of the Convention in this Chamber reminds me of the dedication with which members of the national parliaments worked with us on the draft constitution, of the important proposals they had to make, and, in view of that, I simply cannot regard this letter from the three presidents as being the last word on the subject."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mrs Wallström, on 28 November 2005, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the opinion I had prepared for it by a large majority."
"What does this opinion say?"
"First of all, it points out all the improvements provided for by the Constitution in relation to the current Treaties."
"The improvements in terms of security, liberty and justice were many and significant and, above all, they were the subject of consensus on the part of the nations comprising Europe."
"I am not going to list them all, but I shall simply mention four points that are likely to get us over this bad patch and that the excellent report by my colleagues, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber has put back on the agenda."
"Firstly, the widespread introduction of qualified majority voting and the simplification of the legislative acts enable us to devise a policy rather than be thwarted by the finer points of such a policy."
"Next, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which is a factory of Community law when Parliament is at a loss, is extended."
"The definitive strengthening of Parliament’s role as co-legislator might also be mentioned, this being something that we need to promote."
"Finally, integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the very wording of the Constitution confers legal value upon the latter."
"There are, of course, other positive points, but those I have just listed are genuinely fundamental."
"Forgive my alluding to these possibilities still open to us, but I wanted to emphasise the advances entailed by this Constitution in an area not discussed throughout the EU Member States, namely that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the area of freedom, justice and security."
"Therein lies, indeed, the material for constructing a framework right now, pending the advent of a new document."
"Why, therefore, do the Member States not take more advantage of this material in order to try to bind together again an EU that is being given a rough ride?"
"Finally, we consider it a matter of priority systematically to take account of the impact of EU policies on fundamental rights and, so that we might not delay in presenting an initial bill, we emphasise how urgent it is to set up an independent Agency for Fundamental Rights, as requested by Parliament on 26 May 2005."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Commissioner. Seldom do we discuss more important issues than the one we are discussing now."
"Our thanks should go to the rapporteurs who have taken the initiative and, on the basis of broad-ranging discussions, have presented this topic."
"The future of Europe is our common problem, equally important for the young and the elderly, for men and women."
"As Mrs Wallström has emphasised, most European citizens see no problem in the decision-making mechanisms of the European institutions."
"Their problem is primarily a lack of clarity in the vision they have of their own future, their prospects, their security and the new challenges which they are still struggling to find a response to."
"Uncertainty and fear of the future were clearly the main factors behind the NO outcome in the votes on the Constitution."
"Clearly, we are all responsible for finding a way forwards."
"Those of us here at the European Parliament should be aware of the messages and signals we are sending out when we take decisions, for instance, on cohesion instruments or the transfer of pension rights or when we give preferential treatment to migrants from third countries rather than to the citizens of new Member States."
"The governments of Member States must bear their share of responsibility for frequently behaving as if European matters, such as the work-life balance goals formulated in the Lisbon Strategy, do not concern them."
"A fundamental question remains as to whether we will be able to develop a sufficiently appealing common vision and as to whether our European values will be strong enough to produce an adequate level of social cohesion."
"Mr President, women account for more than [half] of all European citizens and voters."
"They have their own specific problems, which call for a sensitive approach and satisfactory solutions."
"The views of women should therefore be accorded sufficiently serious consideration in the forthcoming debate."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise in conclusion that, in the opinion of the Committee for Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, a repeat of the split between the core countries of Europe and the remaining ones would be one of the worst possible outcomes of our efforts to find a way forwards."
". Mr President, I would like to make three points."
"First, it is nice to start talking about the Constitution again."
"The budget is out of the way; we can start focusing on other things."
"To me, it seems as if the Constitution has been in intensive care for the past eight or nine months."
"Now it has been slowly taken out and I think the process of recovery will be slow, but I think we should be looking at 2009."
"I think the message of this report is that all options are open; easy does it; let us not say that the Constitution is dead; let us not start renegotiating; let us not say that this Treaty cannot enter into force."
"We have time and we have to think about it."
"The second point is that recently there has been some controversy between the European Parliament and the speakers of three national parliaments."
"We need to turn that into a positive."
"The European Parliament should not, and must not, be arrogant or paternal towards the national parliaments."
"Yes, let us have a European forum, but let us do it together and have a real debate about the future of the Union."
"My final point is that from some sections in the past few months we have heard talk about ‘core Europe’."
"I think that talk is absolute and utter rubbish, because the people we hear it from are usually the people who want to put the brakes on integration."
"Let us start by ratifying the Constitution; let us get the ball rolling, let us work together and, most importantly, let us work together within the institutions of the European Union."
"I cringe at any talk about ‘core Europe’ outside."
"The best way forward is to do it inside the Treaty, do it together, and I am sure we can overcome this and have a Constitution by 2009."
". Mr President, just one year ago this Parliament endorsed the Constitution by an overwhelming majority."
"Now there are at least two views within that majority."
"One view is to say that this text of the Constitution is dead following the referendum defeats in France and the Netherlands; that we had better start thinking of something else and preparing a different way forward."
"The other view is to say: wait a minute, this text has actually now been ratified by a majority of Member States."
"The heads of government themselves in the European Council did not declare it dead, they extended the period of ratification and opened a period of reflection."
"In that period of reflection we must listen to those who said ‘no’, but we must also listen to the majority who have said ‘yes’ and find a way forward that can ultimately bring the two together."
"This report achieves a synthesis of those two viewpoints."
"It says that it is too soon to conclude now; the period of reflection must be extended at least until 2007."
"Until then we need to keep all options open."
"We need longer and deeper reflection."
"Of course – as is to be expected – we say that this Parliament would prefer to maintain the text, but we recognise that that would only be possible if measures were taken to reassure and convince public opinion."
"What those measures are is left open."
"There are, in theory, many options: supplementary interpretative declarations, extra protocols, rewriting part of the text, rewriting the whole text, starting a new text."
"That we will conclude at the end of the period of reflection, but for now let us keep on with that reflection, deepen it, broaden it and reach conclusions in a year’s time."
"One thing is certain, Mr President: the status quo – that is, the current Treaties – is not sufficient for this Union in its enlarged form to function effectively or democratically."
"This issue will not go away."
"Mr President, the Liberal Democrats in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe warmly welcome the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the period of reflection."
"We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework."
"We considered the Constitutional Treaty to be an efficient tool for moving the EU forward and for giving it the political dimension and social perspective that are both necessary."
"We have not changed our opinion, and we do not think that the Constitution should be declared defunct before we have examined it for signs of life."
"Otherwise, it will be impossible to declare that the patient is dead."
"Nor, however, can the fact be ignored that, during the process of ratification, a disjunction appeared between the desire for deeper integration, demonstrated by the European elites, and the feelings of a section of European society."
"This disjunction is not only of relevance to the two countries that refused to ratify the draft Constitution."
"It is a serious problem."
"Jean Monnet used to say that, faced with a serious problem, its context sometimes has to be changed."
"That is precisely the purpose of the period of reflection."
"The great public debate on the future of the European Union should create a new context for the European constitutional enterprise."
"It is for the European Parliament to define the framework and the arrangements for these debates, to have the national parliaments and civil society take part in them, to specify the questions and to draw up the necessary agenda."
"It is in that way that it will be possible for the European forum to appear, and to do so in the form of a public space for Europe."
"We must not decide just yet on the future of the document."
"That time will come after the period of reflection, after the European debate and after having changed the context."
"The report presented to us states this very well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Duff-Voggenhuber report."
"The European Union needs a democratic Constitution and cannot just stumble along with Nice."
"The debate that must take place on the Constitution has to be a European debate, and the letter sent by the three presidents of national parliaments shows that responsibility for the debate cannot be left at national level, but that there is a need for a truly European body, like this Parliament, to conduct it and – all right, yes, we must say it openly – to steer it as well."
"Two things are missing in the report, however, and we hope to be able to introduce them with the vote in this House."
"In fact, Mr Corbett, I do not agree with you: it is absolutely not true that the movement of those who voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution is split between those who now want to get rid of the text and those who want to keep it."
"It is not like that."
"The amendment that we shall put to the vote tomorrow explicitly states that one possibility – not a theoretical one, but a practical one – might be to change the text and that, if that were to happen, it would require a new constitutional process, which might also end with a referendum."
"To think, however, that the only proposal that we, as the European Parliament, should put forward is to maintain the current text and nothing else is false and short-sighted, and it is that attitude that might really divide the pro-European movement, that is to say the movement that obtained broad support for the Constitution in this House, with 500 votes."
"I therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament, because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options."
"Perhaps no option is better than the others, but I believe that they should all be discussed, including the one that right now sounds strangely drastic, which is that we should reopen the debate on the Constitution with the citizens as well."
". Mr President, the period of reflection decreed by the European Council following the victory of the 'no' camp in France and the Netherlands has achieved its first result: it has improved people's manners."
"For example, the two co-rapporteurs of the resolution we are now debating did not consider it appropriate this time to describe the majority of the electorate in France and the Netherlands with the unkind epithets that some levelled at them a few months ago."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Duff for emphasising here, at least in their resolution, that the citizens have in fact, and I quote, 'expressed concerns and worries which need to be taken into account', and that we need to respect their decision and 'to analyse carefully the reasons for the negative results'."
"That is a step forward."
"This would be even clearer if the report stated that the draft treaty is now dead and that the debate now centres on what should replace it."
"My group is prepared to take an active part in the debate on the future of the Union with our fellow citizens. As regards the topics put forward for those discussions, we agree with them in essence."
"The question that arises is this: what will be the political result of this debate?"
"How far are you prepared to go in transforming the policies and structures of the EU as it is, in order to meet the demands being made by most of Europe's societies, which were demonstrated most spectacularly by the rejection of the constitutional treaty?"
"That is where the problem lies."
"The report now before us proposes only, and I quote, 'to reassure … public opinion', given that, and again I quote, 'in any case … the Constitution enters into force during 2009'."
"In that case, it is no longer a debate, but a communication campaign."
"It would be a shame if we followed that route."
"It would be a missed opportunity."
"That is why my group, almost without exception, will not go down that path."
". Mr President, I should like to ask the ostrich majority in this House: have you not heard that 55% of French voters voted ‘no’, against the advice of 90% of their deputies and senators?"
"Have you not seen that 62% of Dutch voters did not follow the advice of the 80% in the national parliament?"
"Have you not read the Treaties calling for unanimity in Treaty changes?"
"Why break your own rules?"
"You seem to have both eyes and ears."
"Use them!"
"The proposed Constitution is dead!"
"Still you urge national parliaments to break the law."
"You continue to propagate the text."
"On the outside of this building you still proclaim ‘yes’ to the Constitution."
"Could you imagine a national parliament praising Labour policies and condemning Conservative ones on the front of the parliament building itself?"
"No, you could not, could you?"
"You still use taxpayers’ money to distribute millions of brochures propagating what was rejected."
"You started ratification of a text which had not yet been properly translated."
"You refused to publish a reader-friendly edition of the Constitution, because you wanted the text approved without being read."
"You manipulated the time schedule for holding referendums and hoped to drive the UK into a corner after 24 ratifications."
"But, dear colleagues, you lost, as I have done several times."
"Now it is your turn to follow the verdict of the voters."
"Instead, you finance further propaganda: EUR 300 000 to the European Movement;"
"We demand a free, fair and open debate with equal representation of the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ sides."
"Shame on those of you who will vote for overruling the Dutch and French voters!"
"The SOS Democracy Intergroup has started a minority report."
"We reject the idea of a state constitution, ask for the existing Treaties to be reviewed and for a cooperation agreement to be established instead."
"A new agreement could be drafted by a directly elected convention and put to referendums in all the Member States, perhaps at the same time as the next European elections."
"Then we would know the verdict of the citizens."
"The French voters have not regretted their ‘no’; many Dutch voters have changed their minds, but they were the ones who voted ‘yes’."
"Listen to the voters, let us make a fresh start."
". Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work and what they have tried to achieve with this report."
"Secondly, and most importantly of all, I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having the political courage to take this issue out of the esoteric area and put it back on the political agenda."
"One of the most important issues we have to look at – and it follows on from what Mr Bonde has just been saying – is: when is a ‘no’ really a ‘no’?"
"When is it that one country can stop every other country from moving forward?"
"When is it that two countries can prevent other countries from moving forward?"
"The uniqueness of what the European Union has been about is that it has striven to find common ground between very different and varying interests."
"Just because we have hit a barrier with regard to progress in constitutional change and treaty change aiming at a more efficient and effective way of decision-making, does that mean that we have to stick our heads in the sand, as some of my colleagues would say?"
"The ostrich, whilst it may stick its head in the sand at some stage, is also the fastest runner on the ground."
"We have to learn very quickly how to become fast runners to deal with the concerns that people have."
"Those concerns are not just related to the model of the European Union."
"Many of those who voted ‘no’ in France or Holland voted that way because of domestic political reasons."
"They also voted out of fear."
"As we discovered in Ireland some years ago, there was an irrational fear in some people when they voted ‘no’, a fear of the huge influx of immigrants taking all our jobs, stealing our social welfare and ruining our country."
"The reality was totally different: integration is possible; common sense and calmness is possible, but most importantly of all, this is true not just within this insular House and not just within national parliaments."
"Until such time as we convince the citizens and allow them ownership of the European Union project, only then and truly then can we say that we have a citizens’ Europe that rightfully belongs to them."
"Mr President, after the Constitution so spectacularly failed its own test for survival, namely, approval by all Member States, a report which denies the resulting reality could only have come from the rarefied atmosphere of unreality that is the Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"With breathtaking arrogance this report, and indeed the last speaker, seeks to second-guess and repudiate the democratic verdict of the people of France and Holland by declaring that those results were not about rejecting the Constitution, but about dissent and other issues."
"Nonsense!"
"The question on the ballot paper was about one thing only – the acceptability of the Constitution – and the answer was equally clear."
"Why not face the truth?"
"You lost."
"Instead, the Europhiles in this House have a new catchphrase. They think it is very clever: ‘Context, not text, is the problem’."
"How fitting that it begins with the word ‘con’."
"For that is what this period of reflection is all about."
"How can the text be repackaged so that next time they can con the voters into buying the soiled goods that is the Constitution?"
"Mr President, on the basis of what the last speakers had to say, I have to conclude, to my great astonishment, that a citizen is important when he says ‘no’ and apparently not when he says ‘yes’, but could I just say at this point that there have also been positive referendums and that 13 Member States have already approved the Constitution."
"That is just as important to me, which does not mean one should not take the ‘no’s’ into consideration, for they also send out a strong message we should take into account."
"That is only a negative message, though, one that does not offer an alternative, whilst, paradoxically, the fear that this ‘no’ expresses would probably be best allayed in a European Constitution, in a European response."
"Indeed, as the Commissioner was right to point out, looking at Eurobarometer, we notice that the citizens know very well that a number of cross-border problems require a European response and ‘more Europe’."
"I particularly have the second and third pillars in mind, which is mainly what the Constitution would have catered for."
"Another paradox is that during the referendum debates, the strengthening of this political Europe was virtually overlooked in the second and third pillars."
"I do think that it is indeed now time to actively use the period of reflection provided for by the Commission’s plan D. We should, in other words, take all the time we need and not rush into anything."
"That is why I endorse the report that is before us now, because it points in that direction, although I fear that certain amendments which the rapporteurs have re-tabled seem to favour the short cuts and draw conclusions prematurely."
"I think that we should take the time, together with the national parliaments, mainly to provide a response to the basic question mentioned in the report."
"Mr President, I would like to remind the Commissioner and certain fellow Members that, twenty years ago, Spain joined the European Union."
"It was good news for my country and surely for the whole of the Union."
"I say this because we Spanish joined twenty years ago and a little more than a year ago we held a referendum and voted ‘yes’ to the European Constitution, with the same rights, duties and responsibilities with which other countries, France and the Netherlands, voted ‘no’."
"A ‘yes’ is worth the same as a ‘no’, whether expressed by referendum or by a parliament."
"And today an absolute majority of members of the Union have said yes to the European Constitution."
"This report – I have had the opportunity to work with its two rapporteurs for four months, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group – is a balanced result, which essentially says four things:"
"Firstly, this Parliament still considers the Constitution to be the best instrument for creating a more democratic and effective Union."
"Secondly, if it does not enter into force, the Union’s political and institutional problems will worsen, not just persist, and furthermore it will be impossible to carry out more enlargements on the basis of the Treaty of Nice following the entry of Bulgaria and Rumania."
"Thirdly, we must begin a genuine period of reflection and debate, amongst the institutions and with the citizens, in order to seek solutions to the current crisis."
"At the end of this period we will have to draw conclusions that allow us to move forward and complete the political union."
"Fourthly, to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005, a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text, which would only be possible with the appropriate measures."
"We shall then define the appropriate measures."
"Given the current political context, we can say that there are new elements on the basis of which we can move ahead with the Constitution and refute two positions: firstly, the statement that the Constitution is dead – well, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated – and, secondly, the idea that we must first deal with unemployment, immigration or fighting crime, a view which ignores the fact that, in order to do so, we need this Constitution."
"This is not just an issue for institutionalists."
"Mr President, for my part, I would like to move from medical metaphors to cooking ones: I would like to invite this Chamber to say 'no' to this plate of microwaved leftovers."
"We have before us a dried-up, cold dish that has lost all its flavour and all its aroma."
"We could, of course, use the same ingredients to make a different meal, perhaps adding a few spices and removing the most unpalatable ingredients."
"But the citizens of Europe are entitled to a new recipe, a new meal that will be to everybody's taste and will not just be yesterday's leftovers reheated."
"I have to say, with the greatest of respect to my fellow Members, that I sometimes have the impression, when I hear some of them talk amongst themselves, that they are too personally attached to the corpse of the Constitution – to return to the medical metaphor."
"I wish these Members could have the courage to let go of this text that they saw come to life in their arms and the courage to take a new step: inventing the new recipe that Europe and its citizens need."
"Mr Joan i Mari, I would ask you not to continue this speech, because the interpreters are under instruction not to translate from Catalan."
"If you continue speaking in Catalan, the Members of this House will not be able to understand what you are saying."
"As I said to you, Mr Joan i Mari, your speech has not been translated by the interpreters and the text of the speech will not be reproduced in the verbatim report of proceedings."
"Mr President, there is one sentence in the report that cannot be given enough emphasis, and it is this one: ‘the Treaty of Nice is not a viable basis for the continuation of the European integration process’."
"To it I would add that this Treaty represents the beginning of the end for an enlarged Union of citizens."
"What, after all, is Nice all about?"
"It is about there being no fundamental rights binding in law, no citizens’ initiatives, no clear demarcation of powers, no full budgetary rights for the European Parliament, right of national parliaments to intervene in response to proposals from the Commission, no parliamentary control of Europol, no foreign minister and no European diplomatic service."
"The list of all the things that Europe stands to lose without a constitution is a very long one; there must be no march back to the past."
"Are we then to say, in all seriousness, that Nice must be cast in concrete?"
"I do not want the European Union to degenerate into a free trade zone with limited social liability; a core Europe that draws new dividing lines across Europe is unacceptable, and so the constitutional process must go on."
"Europe needs a new Treaty."
"The one thing that is blindingly clear is that ‘as you were’ will get us nowhere."
"People’s worries and problems must, at last, be taken seriously – that is the message that comes over, loud and clear, from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution."
"What we need is a political shift in the European Union, in the shape of a move towards a social Europe."
"It is only then that there will be active public support for the enlarged Union and for a Europe united in peace."
"Mr President, the tone of the report by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber reminds me of the plenary debate a year ago, when this House made a great show of embracing the Constitution, and nothing seemed to stand in the way of its being successfully ratified by all 25 Member States."
"To my disappointment, I now have to conclude that Parliament has not learnt anything from the lesson of the double ‘no’."
"This House is not reflecting on the future of Europe, but a strategy for getting the twice rejected Constitution ratified after all."
"All of this, of course, under the guise of considerable measures to put the mind of public opinion at rest."
"Against the backdrop of these transparent attempts to ignore the express will of the French and Dutch electorate, I should nevertheless like to express my appreciation for a number of amendments tabled by both rapporteurs."
"They, at any rate, are not obsessively holding onto the present Constitution; they also appear to have understood the ‘no’ in France and the Netherlands better than the Members of the large groups and they also display a greater willingness to really look at the issues."
"I heard my dear fellow Member, Mr Voggenhuber, speak about nationalism."
"I have so high a view of his intellectual capacities that I assume that he does not include all opponents to this Constitution in this, for that is really not what I am about."
"I would like to thank Mr Duff for a worthy report."
"In the eyes of many European citizens the EU spends its time discussing bananas, the shape of a carrot and solar radiation levels, but not the issues that relate to the everyday life of European citizens."
"Seven out of ten citizens in Slovakia know very little about the EU and its structure."
"Citizens view the Union as something distant from their daily problems."
"It came as a shock that more people cast their votes in a recent Big Brother reality TV show than during the elections to the European Parliament."
"Mass media play an important and crucial role in informing European citizens."
"Citizens are interested in the EU and want information on how it functions."
"The mass media should begin to inform them about the work of European institutions and the ways in which their decisions can affect everyday life."
"For this to happen, however, the right conditions need to be in place."
"I can appreciate that a journalist may find it difficult to explain draft legislation containing thousands of amendments, especially if the text is published just a few days before voting takes place and is not, for that matter, published in all languages."
"If the media are to inform citizens objectively about the work of the EU, they must focus on genuine work rather than titbits or scandals."
"At the same time, however, we must create the conditions for citizens to become better informed; we must eliminate the complex nature of European legislation and restrict the number of debates taking place behind closed doors."
"Mr President, I hope that you will understand me because I am going to speak in an official language."
"I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation."
"I believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points."
"Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention."
"Firstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have."
"And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted ‘no’ in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text."
"That is the reality."
"Those who say ‘no’ are people who reject but do not build."
"They are not proposing anything."
"Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu."
"Secondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution."
"Why?"
"For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept − and this Parliament is right to state this in its report − the idea of taking one thing but not another."
"We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking"
"Thirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason."
"We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution."
"This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution."
"Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteurs for working through a very important issue at a rather difficult time."
"The Duff/Voggenhuber report has sparked lively debates, and is as such part of Commissioner Wallström’s Plan D."
"What has come out of our deliberations is, then, something very encouraging: the overwhelming majority in this House holds fast to the European constitution."
"Far from disappearing, the reasons for the new European treaty have become more pressing: greater effectiveness, more transparency, more democracy."
"All the reforms and advances that the constitution brings with it are urgently needed."
"The debates in the Netherlands and France have done nothing to consign them to oblivion."
"I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency is breathing new life into this debate."
"Over the last few months, we have been in some sense paralysed."
"What we need for 2006 is a wide-ranging debate in all twenty-five countries, and I can tell the President of the Council and the Vice-President that I hope all twenty-five of them will make their contribution."
"I have seen the interim report from the December summit; it left a great deal to be desired."
"In most of the Member States, the debate has not even begun yet, and so it would be quite wrong, now, in January 2006, to present the results of a debate even before we have had one."
"What we have to do now is spend a year discussing the great issues of European policy with all the stakeholders in all the Member States, and then we will be able, in 2007, to come to conclusions as to which procedure we opt for to bring this project to a successful conclusion."
"There are various options available to us; my country’s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe, and that is a way forward that we should discuss."
"This period of reflection will endow us, and European democracy, with new strength."
"We have every chance of coming out of this crisis in better condition than we were in when it started."
"Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty is dead, long live the Treaty."
"Although it is true that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected more on account of context than text, it is also true that the text of the Constitutional Treaty proved too weak to solve the problems in context."
"It lacked a sufficient number of bold and engaging ideas."
"Why do we not give the citizens real power and get them to directly elect the President of the Commission, for example, or create the possibility of a European collective referendum – so not 25 or 27 small referendums, but a true European referendum – or why do we not create a truly European political space, in other words a European ?"
"With regard to context, the Dutch citizens – like, I assume, those in most other Member States too – do not in any event want to discuss the institutions for the moment, thank you very much."
"What they do want is a Europe that becomes competitive, creates jobs, combats terrorism and cross-border crime, that pursues proper external policy, and that, at long last, simply does what it is expected to do."
"If we do not succeed, then, breathing new life into a Treaty review is like flogging a dead horse and all talk then becomes academic."
"Certainly, we need a new Treaty in order to make Europe more democratic and more efficient, but there is no rush."
"Some of the many excellent ideas which our rapporteurs have floated are intended to extend the period of reflection to late-2007, to keep more options open and also in general, I welcome a method to indicate how we should hold the debate."
"What we do not need, though, is a document entitled ‘Constitution’ which frightens people off rather than involving them."
"After all, a rose smells just as sweetly under another name."
"As a result, holding onto the name and the text for dear life is for my group an insuperable problem."
"If the solution is to submit an improved text – and I truly hope we will succeed in this, for it is important – then I am in favour of submitting it to all European citizens in a referendum, to coincide with the next European elections."
"Mr President, this is not a Voggenhuber-Duff report, it is just a duff report."
"The question is, is the Constitution dead or is it just sleeping?"
"If the answer to all this had been ‘yes’, there can be no doubt that the Commissioners would have had no difficulty in explaining what ‘yes’ meant."
"It is just us poor peasants who happen to believe in ‘no’ who now need to have it explained to us what ‘no’ means."
"‘No’ in this case means sheer arrogance on the part of the Commission in presuming to go ahead with this project, when 70% of people in Austria do not want it to go ahead; when two-thirds of the population of Great Britain do not see any benefit in future membership of this sham Parliament; when the people of France have voted ‘no’; and when the people of Holland have voted ‘no’."
"What part of ‘no’ does the Commission not understand?"
"‘No’ means that large proportions of the population of Europe do not want to continue with this pretence."
"We thought we were joining a common market and it has grown and grown and grown like Topsy until this final report, which is pushing us towards full political union."
"Well, it will all fall apart, without any doubt, because that is not what people thought they were voting for."
"I am glad that UKIP will not fail, because nothing can stop an idea whose time has come, and that means national freedom."
"Mr President, Europe arose in the Middle Ages with Christianity as its foundation."
"The European Union originally came about in order to prevent further wars."
"Nations and peoples tend to join together either around something or against it."
"Europe is now a thing of the past."
"It has been replaced by the European Union, which still lacks a common vision binding its members together."
"At present, every one of us can come up with a reason for rejecting the Constitution."
"Some believe the budget is too small, others that it is too large, whilst others have concerns about Turkey."
"The new Member States are unhappy about the unfair common agricultural policy and the closed labour market."
"Nonetheless, we want to stay together."
"We need to do away with all divisions between us before taking the Constitution to the citizens again and this time we must listen to what the latter have to say and take it into account."
"Mr President, although the minority is always much noisier, many of us here in Parliament believe that in order to function appropriately, the European Union needs a Constitutional Treaty, particularly in areas such as increased transparency and the increased controlling role of Parliament, or even the protection of minority rights in Europe."
"However, the main reason for the crisis that has developed is not the content of the Constitution that ensures a better regulation of the future functioning of the European Union, but the fact that in the eyes of many citizens, the performance of the European Union is not satisfactory and it is not convincing."
"The institutions and the elite running the European Union have lost the trust of a number of citizens."
"I agree with the opinion of the European Commission, and as I mentioned in my accepted motion for amendment, it is important to ensure that one of the objectives of the period of consideration is to find ways for the European Union to regain the trust of citizens."
"We also believe that in order to ensure success, we need a debate on how the European Union can increase its performance and how it can contribute to the solution of the real problems of people."
"The Constitutional Treaty, or its most important sections must be preserved."
"But we must know that the trust of European Union citizens cannot be regained by complicated texts, but by the performance of the European Union, by jobs, economic growth and the effective representation of common European interests in the world."
"And if we regain their trust, people will also support the Constitutional Treaty."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the co-rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber."
"They have done some tremendous, very open-minded work, which forms an excellent basis for discussion, as has been said."
"I myself am a former member of the Convention, a socialist and a Frenchman, in no particular order, and I would like, at this stage, to step into this infamous debate on the death or otherwise of the Constitution."
"I have every respect for the people who voted for this text – I myself voted 'yes' – but, at the same time, we cannot act as if nothing had happened, as if the French and Dutch votes made no difference to the situation."
"Neither can we act as if there was now only one possible solution, only one result, namely the ratification, after a few detours, of the original text rejected by the French and the Dutch."
"That is why we need to help the rapporteurs, and to that end I have co-signed, with them and with Mrs Berès, a number of amendments calling for reality to be taken into account."
"I would refer you in particular to three amendments: Amendment 18, Amendment 24 and Amendment 27."
"I think that, if we adopt them, if Parliament adopts them, it will give itself a wide range of options, it will be open-minded, it will make a real contribution to the debate, and it will not get bogged down in a single solution, idea or way of thinking."
"When all is said and done, I want to vote in favour of this text, as do the French socialists, but we cannot do so if it is just a one-way street."
"Therefore, let us continue to move forwards tomorrow by voting in favour of these amendments."
"Mr President, with the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the draft Constitution has been rejected."
"Of that there can be no doubt."
"Two countries have voted against it in referenda and done so with large majorities and high turnouts."
"The fact that the European political establishment is now trying to explain this away is a democratic scandal."
"Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how the results of these referenda are to be circumvented."
"They have, of their own accord, the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries."
"They are beginning to calculate how many countries were in favour of the draft Constitution, in spite of its being clear that all the countries have to approve the proposal."
"Rarely has it been so clear how wide the gulf is between the political elite and the populations on EU issues."
"Everything indicates that the draft Constitution would have been rejected in Germany, too, if there had been a referendum there."
"The same applies to the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and perhaps other countries too."
"The EU’s power-wielding elite talks shamelessly, however, about difficult setbacks that made their presence felt last year."
"I wish to point out that democratic outcomes are only setbacks for those who have come off worse because they lack grassroots support."
"There is no getting around that fact."
"Mr President, listening to this debate I am reminded of Bertolt Brecht’s lines:"
"– ‘ - Would it not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?"
"The peoples of two core founding States have thrown your projects out, my friends."
"I know it is hard to accept rejection, but look at the figures: 55% of French voters; 62% of Dutch voters."
"You might try to argue that the voters have got it wrong; that they are suffering from what Marxists used to call false consciousness; that they need better propaganda; that it is up to us – the Euro-elite – to point them in the right direction."
"To which I say, ‘Do your damnedest’."
"Current polls in the Netherlands show that 82% of Dutch voters would now vote ‘no’ – a tribute to the level-headedness of that brave people."
"But if you think you can turn them around, dear colleagues, be my guests."
"Doing so would at least prove your commitment to the democratic ideals you so frequently invoke."
"Far more outrageous would be to push ahead with the implementation of the Constitution – or, at least, of its contents – without popular consent."
"Yet this is precisely what you are doing."
"Look at the number of policies and institutions envisaged by the Constitution that have been or are being enacted regardless: the European External Action Service, the European Human Rights Agency, the European Defence Agency, the European Space Programme, the European External Borders Agency, a justiciable Charter of Fundamental Rights: none of these has any proper legal basis outside the Constitution."
"By adopting them anyway, you demonstrate that you will allow no force – internal or external, neither your own rule book nor the expressed opposition of your peoples in the ballot box – to arrest the rush to political assimilation."
"In doing so, you vindicate the severest of your opponents’ criticisms."
"In the words of my countryman Oliver Cromwell ‘I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken’."
"Mr President, the resolution we are currently debating is a sound and appropriately balanced compromise document."
"In addition, it was dealt with in record time."
"It links in very well with the Austrian Presidency’s priorities presented to us today and also with the Finnish Presidency and the future German Presidency."
"This means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded."
"It is not a thing of the past."
"On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas."
"As a result of the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it."
"All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want."
"By way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred."
"It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are."
"We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law."
"It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties."
"I should like to add one final comment."
"A country’s approach to the European Constitution is not simply a test of its will to help build a common Europe."
"It is also a test of that country’s credibility as a partner in international relations."
"– Mr President, Parliament has today kicked off a major debate."
"Political institutions and social actors, along with the media, will take on the responsibility of addressing the following question: does Europe want to secure the future?"
"The constitution issue is not a simple matter of the architecture of the institutions."
"It is more about the way in which Europe ensures that its institutions act in accordance with a moral awareness of the world."
"All of us, citizens of Europe, in the corridors of power, on the Union’s front line, feel the weight of this challenge."
"How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area?"
"How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europe’s boundaries?"
"How can we build a way of life not based on tradition?"
"How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order?"
"How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model?"
"How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world?"
"How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world?"
"How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy?"
"How can we connect justice with efficiency?"
"How can we open the doors to new political models?"
"The future allows us no room for fear."
"We have an urgent need to discuss political integration, to discuss the introduction of a cosmopolitan and more human way of life, to discuss the extent to which the Constitution itself represents and constructs our European identity. After all, our European identity was not born out of tradition, but out of morality, desire and reason."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a real risk that the European project may collapse, and we have the evidence for it."
"To build or rebuild the people’s trust we need vision, effective policies and means, and the means include financial resources and the institutions."
"I believe that we, as Parliament, must not abandon the prospect of the Constitutional Treaty. As for the diatribe about the current text, I think Parliament must defend everything that has been gained through it."
"Will the debate be able to move on?"
"I do not think it will be easy but, quite frankly, I am not going to rule out that path, either."
"Moreover, as has already been emphasised, I should like us to take that path in close collaboration with the national parliaments, since the way the debate on the subject has been conducted, particularly by European governments, has, in my view, been neither thorough nor correct."
"I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate."
"Let us hope that from now on the various institutions can be more in tune with each other."
"– Mr President, I shall not repeat the arguments heard today from the rapporteurs and other speakers about the Constitution."
"Nor shall I refer to the detailed, extensive and exhaustive discussions held last year; I shall refer to the dialogue to which they refer."
"I wish to express the opinion that the dialogue which we need to hold must revolve not around the Constitution but around the existential problems of the European Union, which are: firstly, the degree to which the European Union is still necessary; secondly, if the European Union is necessary, what type of European Union do we want and, thirdly, how enlarged a European Union do we want."
"If there is no common answer to these existential questions at the level of both policies and citizens, I greatly fear that no form of Constitution for Europe will ever be acceptable to the citizens of Europe."
"If and insofar as we in the European Union believe that it needs to be unified and strengthened, then our challenge is to convince the citizens also of the correctness of this way forward."
"Confidence and faith in the European vision are the basis of the universal consent of states and citizens to constitutional arrangements for the functioning of the European Union."
"If the citizens of the European states do not realise the importance to mankind of the existence and further unification and strengthening of the European Union, then I predict that no constitutional proposal will be accepted in future."
"That is why I believe that we should not waste any more time."
"We need to build on what we have and what we have today is the Constitution."
"That is what we need to work on and that is what we need to build on, because I greatly fear that any other effort we make to create an alternative will fail and will be a final failure which will be at the expense of the unification and progress of the European Union."
"– Mr President, eight months after the rejection of the text of the Constitutional Treaty in the referenda held in France and the Netherlands, we are still in an interminable period of reflection on how to word it."
"It is time we got to work."
"What is this work?"
"In my opinion, it is not analysing ourselves in interminable discussions about the precise definition of the new social state, EU financing and so on. If we believe that we shall find common ground between us on all these questions as a precondition to trying the Constitution again, I believe that we shall never have a European constitution."
"On the contrary, in my opinion there should only be one final objective to this period of reflection."
"Irrespective of each person's political convictions, we need to persuade ourselves that, for all these major European wagers, we can, as Europeans, address them better jointly than separately."
"This is perhaps also the most important context which is missing for any text if it is to be acceptable to everyone."
"Mr President, I have no sympathy whatsoever with the idea of democracy espoused by certain critics of the EU, who usually dig themselves in behind their national flags and try to enlist other European citizens in their cause."
"We are now hearing it said, over and over again, that 70 % of Austrians do not want this constitution – an obvious reference to the latest Eurobarometer surveys and no more revealing than they are, combined with a flagrant disregard for the democratic rules and procedures that apply in Austria, my own country, where both houses of the country’s Parliament have ratified the Constitution by massive majorities."
"Some, however, attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law."
"Nor do I have any sympathy with the adopted by those who already want to discuss alternatives, even before the ongoing ratification process is completed."
"Those who are now calling for new alternatives are treating as worthless the decisions democratically reached in most of the Member States of the European Union."
"More to the point, where are these alternatives?"
"In the Convention on the Future of Europe, we had long discussions on all of them; discussions about a more democratic Europe, a more social Union and so on."
"Over and over again, we came up with the same results."
"Desirable though they might be, every improvement of that kind would end up producing more Europe, and a stronger Europe, and hence the very thing that most of the Member States and the people who live in them do not at present want – a continuing loss of power on the part of the nation states."
"Let us then do what the majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed; let us try to inform the European public about what really is, and is not, in the 2004 Constitutional Treaty, and let us have a second run at getting a consensus in support of the best constitution currently on the market."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I found it a very interesting experience to take part in this debate and to follow the exchange of opinions."
"A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate."
"I agree with Mr Leinen that the Presidency of the Council, at this stage of debate, would be ill-advised to try to pre-empt results, and would indeed risk doing damage were it to do that."
"What we need now is a discussion."
"Let me reiterate my gratitude to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to the rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, for initiating this debate."
"The Presidency will respond to it."
"We too believe that all the opinions voiced in this debate have to be respected."
"As the Vice-President Wallström so aptly said, ‘what we want is a Europe for everyone’."
"Building that Europe is a task that the Austrian Presidency of the Council, too, has set itself."
"Together with the other Member States and in consultation with the other institutions, we will work on the road map to which reference was made earlier."
"To the statement made today to the effect that the public are not interested in any debate about institutions, I would counter that this Europe of ours does, however, need the institutions and institutional structures that will enable it to do what its citizens expect of it."
"I very much hope that what the President of the Council has said today will have made it plain that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is very definitely in earnest about addressing the problems that affect the European public and are of interest to them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really have only two brief things to say."
"The first is to quote Mr Brok who, at the beginning of the debate, said that the citizens are the stakeholders."
"It is Europe’s citizens who are the most important target group and who have the most to gain or to lose from how we handle the issue of a new Constitutional Treaty for Europe."
"The second is to say that democracy is no spectator sport."
"It requires us to engage in debates and in a dialogue with people, to involve our political leaders and our citizens in every possible way and to help each other play our different roles in this connection."
"Having so many times heard wry comments along the lines of ‘what is it in the “no” vote that you do not understand’, I want to add that, in actual fact, opinion polls and interviews have told us precisely why people have come out in favour of, or voted against, the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is not something we have invented."
"We know that every referendum, the scope of which includes constitutional issues, involves a risk of one’s in actual fact obtaining answers to questions that have not been asked."
"That is something of which politicians in all our Member States are aware."
"Nor is there anything particularly odd about the fact that 25 Member States engaging in a debate about how we are to rise to the constitutional challenge posed by a Europe whose membership has grown from 15 to 25 countries should, in actual fact, wonder how we are to extricate ourselves from a situation in which two Member States have rejected the Constitutional Treaty while 14 have approved it."
"How do we deal with that situation?"
"Are we now simply to bring the process to an end, or is there a way out of the situation?"
"There is nothing odd about these reflections."
"You are making things rather too easy for yourselves."
"What is most interesting is that those who represent UKIP (the UK Independence Party) and call this Assembly a sham parliament appear to be all too happy not to contribute a single constructive idea of their own and to let European taxpayers pay their salaries as Members of that sham parliament."
"I think we need, in actual fact, to buck up our ideas and conduct an intellectually honest debate about the issues concerning Europe."
"We know a very great deal, and there is no short cut."
"However much you may laugh, all we can do is engage in debate and dialogue with people and to discuss factual matters before linking them to the constitutional solutions that are necessary if we are to obtain a more open, more democratic and more efficient Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12 noon."
"It is easy to see the speck in your brother's eye, but not so easy to see the plank in your own."
"The same people who yesterday denounced the unbelievable denial of parliamentary democracy that led the Commission in Brussels to re-present its directive on port services when it had been rejected, are today prepared to adopt a report which, even more seriously, is a denial of popular democracy."
"The European Constitution has been rejected by two of the founding members of the European Union, the Netherlands and France."
"In the opinion of all the independent observers, the people's decision was a well-informed one."
"They did not just vote according to a context, they voted against the text."
"Ten Member States have not yet expressed an opinion and several of their leaders do not think they will do so. This is because the Constitution, according to the law and according to the text itself, cannot enter into force, because several of the signatory states have refused to ratify it."
"It is dead."
"All this Parliament proposes to do, though, is to consider the best way to serve the same dishes, in the same words, to the citizens, and to brainwash them with propaganda campaigns, with the connivance of the media."
"This is scandalous and unacceptable."
"I cannot support this report."
"The text fails to recognise that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected by electors in two Member States."
"Undoubtedly if given the opportunity of a referendum, other rejections would also be delivered."
"The two rapporteurs want to somehow revive the core of the current, rejected, text."
"This does not seem to me to be credible."
"How can French and Dutch voters be expected to accept such arrogance."
"We are in a so-called period of reflection, let us make it a period in which to rethink, replace, and not just regurgitate a document which has already been resoundingly rejected."
"On behalf of Parliament, I would like to welcome Paavo Lipponen, President of the Finnish Parliament, and his delegation."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Chechnya after the elections and civil society in Russia."
". Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the conflict in Chechnya is still a source of instability in the northern Caucasus."
"The political, economic, social and human rights situation in this Caucasus republic continues to be extremely unsatisfactory and a real cause for concern."
"All of the European Union's institutions are well aware of how important this matter is in our relations with the Russian Federation."
"As you know, Chechnya held parliamentary elections on 28 November last year, its first legislative elections in eight years."
"Unfortunately, the European Union and the OSCE were unable to send observers to these elections for security reasons."
"However, the simple fact that, for the first time in eight years, it was possible to hold parliamentary elections in Chechnya was viewed by the then Presidency as a positive step, even though, it must be emphasised, there were some serious problems."
"The European Union helped to train local observers for these elections, and the Commission provided aid amounting to EUR 60 000 to support objective and professional local election observers from various civil society organisations."
"Immediately after the elections, the then EU Presidency issued a statement noting that the elections had not been problem-free and that some observers had raised concerns."
"It strongly urged the Russian authorities to investigate reports of irregularities or intimidation."
"The statement concluded that the further strengthening of democratic institutions, as part of an inclusive political process, is essential for the sustainable and peaceful long-term development of Chechnya as well as for peace and stability in the northern Caucasus as a whole."
"The European Union has frequently raised serious concerns regarding the political process in Chechnya and continues to strongly urge the Russian authorities to give this political process greater transparency and legitimacy."
"Issues of human rights and democracy are regularly and repeatedly raised in the context of relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, in laying the basis for relations between the EU and Russia, refers to respect for shared values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"Chechnya is an important topic in the twice-yearly human rights consultations with Russia, which were officially launched in March 2005 under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The EU makes a particular point of using these consultations to express its concerns regarding the disappearance of people and the general failure to punish violations of human rights."
"The most recent round of these extremely important consultations was held in Brussels on 8 September 2005 and they will be continued this year under the Austrian Presidency."
"We need the European Union and its Member States to make a sustained commitment here, as these consultations provide a forum where such issues can be discussed very openly and constructively."
"Following the outbreak of the second Chechnya conflict in September 1999, the European Union has taken and maintained a clear position on the issue of respect for human rights."
"The EU continues to advocate a political solution to the conflict, and has called on the Russian Federation to work closely with international human rights mechanisms, in particular with the United Nations and its special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and also with the Council of Europe, particularly the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and of course with the OSCE."
"A resumption of the permanent presence of the OSCE, in the form of a field mission in Chechnya, would in any case be welcomed."
"The OSCE has already played an extremely important role in the efforts to find a solution to the first conflict in Chechnya, and a comparable role would also be of great significance this time."
"At the EU-Russia Summit in November 2004, Russia agreed to the European Commission's EUR 20 million aid programme to support socio-economic recovery in the northern Caucasus, in addition to continuing humanitarian aid."
"This programme is intended to contribute to promoting an open and democratic political process in Chechnya."
"With regard to civil society, the situations of non-governmental organisations and human rights activists, judicial reform and freedom of the media in Russia are areas that give particular cause for concern and that are regularly raised in discussions between the EU and Russian representatives."
"The EU is firmly convinced that it is in Russia's interest to have a strong and independent civil society."
"At the end of December 2005, the Duma and the Federation Council adopted the draft law on non-governmental organisations."
"The EU has repeatedly expressed its concern at this draft, notably in its letter of 22 November 2005 to the Speaker of the Duma, Mr Gryzlov, and at a troika démarche on 2 December 2005."
"I also expect that we will make our feelings known once again on this matter now that the law has been signed."
"According to the draft as it stands, foreign NGOs must provide the Russian authorities with reports on their programmes, funding and organisation."
"Russian NGOs may be prohibited from working in restricted areas, which of course severely limits their activities in sensitive areas and regions, or even makes them impossible."
"Russia's Presidency of the G8, since 1 January 2006, was expected not only to give the country an incentive to improve its image on the international stage, but also to help it make more active and sustained efforts than previously to resolve the conflict in Chechnya and thus to improve the situation in the southern Caucasus, where the three conflicts in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh, although frozen, urgently need to be resolved."
"The EU has announced that it will closely monitor Russia's actions during the G8 Presidency."
"The issue of civil society will also be raised repeatedly at the twice-yearly human rights consultations with Russia."
"Mr President, we must remain determined to continue the dialogue with the Russian Federation with regard to Chechnya and other human rights matters, regardless of all the difficulties and resistance, and to press for an improvement in the situation."
". Mr President, President-in-Office, honourable Members, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commission’s view on the future of Chechnya after the elections."
"It is positive, as the Presidency mentioned, that the elections took place without violence, even if one cannot ignore the deficiencies in the process."
"Three parties received sufficient support to be represented in the new parliament, with the pro-Kremlin United Russia far outweighing the others."
"We hope that this constitutes a step towards greater political representation, greater stability and eventually peaceful democracy."
"Neither the OSCE nor the Council of Europe sent a fully fledged observer mission, since the conditions on the ground did not permit it, but the latter did send an eight-member fact-finding mission."
"We therefore have no official reports, but we are aware of statements by members of the latter mission and by other organisations drawing attention, in particular, to deficiencies in the process, and we expect such allegations to be properly investigated."
"While we welcome the Russian Federal authorities’ commitment to allocate significant funds for reconstruction, a number of other actions need to be taken if these elections are to be a step towards more peace and democracy."
"Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, unfortunately a culture of impunity remains."
"Reported cases of disappearances and torture should be fully investigated and the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, brought to justice."
"We note that Russia has expressed its willingness to cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms including, for instance, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Louise Arbour."
"These assurances should be put into practice and there should be cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteurs."
"It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya be seen to be carrying out his duties impartially, as well as effectively."
"As has already been mentioned, I would like to emphasise that the European Commission is playing its part in the region."
"We have agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socio-economic recovery in the North Caucasus, because we believe that to be one of the root causes of that conflict."
"This is in addition to humanitarian assistance, for which we are already the biggest donor through ECHO."
"This gives a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region."
"Our programme will help support the much-needed rehabilitation of the health and education sectors and assist in job-creation and income-generation activities."
"In my former capacity as Austrian Foreign Minister I visited Chechnya as chairwoman of the OSCE."
"I remember my visit very well."
"We saw health establishments at first hand and a lot of improvement is indeed necessary."
"It is also our intention to open an office in the North Caucasus region, possibly in Vladikavkaz, which would help us to monitor the implementation of our programme and keep us better informed on the situation on the ground."
"I should, however, express our concern at the continuing difficulties that NGOs have to face – as the Presidency mentioned – including those receiving support from the European Commission, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod."
"This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme."
"In that context I should like to draw your attention to the recent amendments to Russian legislation on NGOs."
"We expressed our concerns about the effect of that legislation on NGOs financed under ECHO in the North Caucasus through the EIDHR and TACIS programmes to the chairwoman of the Presidential Council on the development of social society and human rights."
"I also discussed the matter with the Foreign Minister, Mr Lavrov, who assured me that there would be changes to the proposal at second reading in the Duma."
"The text of the legislation finally approved by the Duma does indeed take some account of concerns expressed by the European Union and the Council of Europe, which we welcome. However, we remain concerned that some of the provisions remain too far-reaching – for example the scope for denying registration to local NGOs and the controls exerted on both local and foreign NGOs."
"We are taking careful note of the way in which these provisions are implemented."
"That is our task now."
"And we shall also be taking every available opportunity to make the Russian authorities aware of any concerns that arise with regard to that implementation."
"Our regular political dialogue with Russia and the next round of EU-Russia human rights consultations set for March are an excellent chance to do this."
". Mr President, Russia clearly faces a serious criminal and terrorist threat in Chechnya, and the surrounding northern Caucasus remain unstable, with daily killings of both the security forces and criminals."
"There are also frequent civilian kidnappings that go unpunished and are carried out by unaccountable ugly paramilitary units."
"Everyone remains conscious of the tragedy of Beslan."
"And I still have had no satisfactory reply from my Government, the British Government, as to why it grants refugee status to Ahmed Zakayev, who is part of the same so-called Chechen Government-in-Exile as the wanted terrorist Shamil Basayev, who was behind Beslan."
"There is nevertheless still also a westward flow of genuine innocent Chechen refugees caught up in this brutal war."
"So, the EU has every interest in calling for human rights to be respected, as well as becoming more critical of the democratic standards of the elections in November 2005."
"There is current concern, for instance, at the decision of a local court to shut down the operations in Ingushetia of the Centre for Peacemaking and Community Development, a Russian-British humanitarian group."
"It is also considering a request to ban another charity, the United States-based International Medical Corps."
"This shows the degree of hostility to foreign presence of humanitarian NGOs operating in the region."
"It illustrates the phenomenon of increasing authoritarianism across the whole of Russia, as has been well documented recently by Freedom House, and as we have seen over the recent Duma bill on foreign NGOs, where even the final version still permits refusal of registration to any foreign group that threatens Russian sovereignty, cultural heritage and national interests – grounds which are vague and open to local administrative interpretation."
"Our resolution today aims to keep the pressure up on the Russian Federation for higher standards of human rights in this tragic region which has been so besieged by conflict for so long."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been passing resolutions on Chechnya for about fifteen years now, and they have always been critical."
"Parliament also sent a delegation to Chechnya the year before last, and I was its chairman."
"That of course has already been forgotten about in today’s resolution."
"There are many critical issues regarding this conflict in today’s common position."
"It suggests that the Duma should establish a research committee of enquiry to investigate the action of the authorities in Chechnya."
"Another proposal is to set up a temporary international tribunal to investigate these crimes."
"There are other proposals."
"Our proposals have not led to any significant results during all this time."
"I asked the country holding the Presidency whether we could deal with the entire conflict jointly, and not just those parts which vex Russia, putting the whole issue on the table with Russia."
"We, of course, can provide assistance for that, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said."
"We all have an interest in mollifying Russia and the Russian leadership has asked for some good advice, so surely we should be seeking a way out of this together."
"The head of the country holding the Presidency would have good means of contact with President Putin in this respect; he could speak to him directly."
"Mr President, Chechnya is a running sore on our continent, with hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed and with thousands of children traumatised and orphaned."
"With the appalling refugee crisis, this is a human tragedy in every respect."
"Atrocities are being committed by both military and paramilitary forces, and no one has been brought to justice or called to account."
"Both sides are responsible for the excesses, but Chechen civilians have suffered out of all proportion."
"This means that the international community and we in the EU have an obligation, indeed a duty, to intervene."
"We cannot remain indifferent."
"We must condemn the outrages and demand that Russia step up its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem."
"In addition to the very constructive things we are already doing, we in the EU may also in time be able to offer help in the form of mediation, reconstruction and further rehabilitation."
"In a way, the election was a success, in spite of everything."
"The situation is very uncertain, however, and an enormous amount remains to be done."
"The democratic forces in Chechnya need to be identified and an attempt made to initiate a dialogue, because negotiation is the only possible way forward."
"Naturally, we condemn the terrorist acts committed by the Chechen separatists, and the abominable events in, for example, Beslan and in the Moscow theatre can never be condemned enough."
"With such negotiations in prospect, developments in Russia are very worrying."
"Both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have said as much."
"As a result not only of the legislation that puts obstacles in the way of the voluntary organisations’ work but also of the successive restrictions on the media, it is difficult to initiate a dialogue."
"It is difficult both to make criticisms and to make any progress."
"It is gratifying that the President-in-Office of the Council is so clear in his criticism of Russia."
"Here in Parliament, we have for a long time sought a more coherent strategy on Russia."
"Unfortunately, we well know how, for example, the need for energy means that too many of the individual Member States continue to be hypocritical when it comes to our large neighbour’s human rights record and its violations of the rule of law."
"Chechnya must always be there on the agenda."
"That is something we owe both the Chechen and Russian peoples, and it is something we owe ourselves if we are to remain credible."
". Mr President, Mr Winkler, Commissioner, when I hear you talking, then I am delighted that we are MEPs, that we are fortunate enough not to be diplomats and that we have not lost touch with reality."
"Luckily, we are still entitled to express our surprise or indignation."
"It is for that reason that the European Parliament has, in recent years, taken the lead in condemning what has been going wrong in Russia and Chechnya."
"There is a definite sense of lawlessness that pervades Chechnya and the whole of the northern Caucasus."
"There are a growing number of abductions, abuses and random killings."
"It is fair to say that the Russian Federation has no control over the situation. Indeed, the contrary is the case; the conflict is spreading from Chechnya across Ingushetia to the whole of the northern Caucasus."
"For the Council or Commission to claim that elections organised while this sort of thing is going on went reasonably well is a real disgrace, and so I would urge the Commission, the Council, Foreign Affairs Ministers and particularly the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister who is currently Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, to say it as it really is."
"In conclusion, I would like to make an appeal for help for Russia at this point to …"
"Mr President, as has been pointed out in this Chamber, the elections in Chechnya did have significant deficiencies and shortcomings."
"There is no doubt about that."
"At the same time, they are a step forward."
"There is now an opportunity for building political institutions in Chechnya and for doing so with a little more credibility."
"What is quite obvious after all these years of atrocities and war is that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Chechnya."
"The idea that it will, as the Russian Government believes, be possible to crush all opposition in Chechnya is a myth."
"Ultimately, a political process and negotiations are required."
"It is a fact obvious to us all that the loathsome acts of terrorism committed by Chechen separatists have to be condemned."
"It is also important to see that Russia has, in actual fact, also conducted a policy of terrorism against parts of the Chechen population."
"It has committed huge acts of cruelty without anyone being held to account."
"This is something that plays directly into the hands of the most extreme forces in Chechnya."
"Only when acts of this kind cease will there presumably be an opportunity for dialogue and for a peaceful solution."
". Mr President, today’s debate in the House exemplifies the democratic nature of this Parliament."
"I should like to thank previous speakers for their accurate and reliable assessment of the situation in Chechnya."
"Nonetheless, it must be stated quite clearly that although such a debate can be held here in the European Parliament, it cannot be held in Russia, because democracy as we in the West understand it does not currently exist in Russia."
"Moscow and Saint Petersburg are not on a war footing."
"If there is no democracy in those areas there will certainly be none in Grozny or the rest of Chechnya, where there is a war on."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner stated today that the European Union had been unable to send observers to monitor the elections in Chechnya because the conditions on the ground did not permit it."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her honesty."
"Nonetheless, I am bound to point out that if the conditions on the ground were such that it was impossible to guarantee the safety of any observers, how can we accept that the conditions were right for elections to be held in the first place?"
"They simply were not."
"One of the reasons for this was that in terms of international law, Chechnya is an independent state under foreign occupation."
"I must emphasise this most strongly."
"The Chechen people have never freely expressed a desire to form part of the Russian Federation."
"Chechnya declared its independence and the whole world saw how Russian tanks rolled into the country in response to that declaration."
"Regardless of the political party we represent in this House, if we truly share the fundamental values such as democracy and the right to self-determination upon which our Community is based, we must send out an urgent appeal from Parliament calling for freedom for the Chechen people."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the European Union and Parliament do not miss a chance, often on scant objective evidence, to criticise and oppose the authorities and governments of countries with which it would be in their interests to cultivate good relations instead."
"That is what they should be doing with Russia, rather than wasting millions of euros of European taxpayers’ money on doubtful initiatives to support so-called ‘democratic monitoring’ organisations."
"In order to create a Europe for everybody, it is essential to think rationally and objectively when assessing security and antiterrorism measures that have influenced, or may influence, the peace and stability of our Union as well."
"I do not think I have to remind this House of certain terrible crimes committed against the civilian population in Chechnya and in Russia by those who claim to be fighting for the self-determination of the Chechen people."
"I have to say, however, that some people insist on interfering and criticising, and that double standards are often used in assessing similar situations in different parts of the world."
"The resolution on Chechnya is the umpteenth example of this, and yet again I will not endorse hypocritical resolutions that also go against the interests of stability on the Union’s south-eastern borders, interests that should consider the need…"
"Mr President, according to Russian human rights groups, these so-called elections took place only on paper."
"Participation by the local population was very low – almost non-existent."
"Instead, and scandalously, thousands of Russian army soldiers took part in the vote, together with an armed faction of the Kremlin-appointed leader Kadyrov."
"These elections must therefore be seen as a masquerade to cover up the continuing violence and oppression."
"In 2000, during the attack by Russian forces on Grozny, human rights defender Lida Yusupova sat in the cellar of a half-ruined house."
"The people there felt defenceless and abandoned."
"Somehow they had information that at the same time in Strasbourg the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was discussing the situation in Russia."
"Listening to a radio set the elderly inhabitants asked Mrs Yusupova: ‘Are they going to help us?"
"Strasbourg is our only hope.’"
"Six years later this question has still not been answered."
"Yesterday’s meeting of the representatives of the Russian civil rights organisations confirmed the concerns we have been expressing for a long time."
"The last major expression of this concern was the Malmström report."
"Today’s resolution sadly states that both the Council and the Commission have not adequately addressed these concerns and human rights violations."
"One could even say that they have failed to do so."
"Therefore, it is now high time to take a principled and united stand on these issues, because massive human rights violations in Chechnya, which remain unpunished, are spreading throughout the Russian federation like a virus."
"Lastly, today’s resolution ..."
"Mr President, I shall begin by expressing my deep regret that President Putin reportedly signed a new bill yesterday to control non-governmental organisations, coinciding with the decision by the Ingush Supreme Court to deny authorisation to the UK charity , whose Moscow representative I spoke to this morning."
"This is an organisation that had been providing humanitarian aid to about 1 000 Chechen refugee children and shows what a crackdown that bill represents."
"It is clearly incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and it is essential that the European Union does not simply protest but takes action, including insisting that non-governmental organisations take part in the EU’s human rights consultation with Russia."
"Instead, what we see appears to be an attempt at a military solution by Mr Putin, accompanied by flagrant abuses of human rights, including arbitrary detention, forced confessions and torture, and some 2 500 disappearances since 1999."
"President Putin calls neighbouring Dagestan a ‘mini Iraq on Russia’s doorstep’."
"We cannot allow things to progress in that way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the law on NGOs was signed in secret by President Putin."
"The first three aid organisations in Ingushetia have already been banned, including one that provided humanitarian aid to refugees."
"The attitude of authoritarian regimes towards civil society reflects the undesirability, in their eyes, of independent, accurate information on such subjects as the tragic war in Chechnya."
"NGOs such as Memorial provide us with information on infringements and violations of human rights in Chechnya, where free elections are impossible."
"In the same way that Chancellor Merkel had brought up the subject of Guantanamo in Washington, she brought up the sore point of Chechnya on her visit to Russia, and the Russian President's response to her was to say that there were deficiencies in democracy and human rights in the West, in other words in the EU, too."
"All I can say to that is: in the EU we do not have such massive restrictions on freedom of opinion, as terrible a war as in Chechnya, a judiciary that disregards the rule of law as completely as in the Yukos case, or prison conditions as inhumane as those experienced by Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev."
"Human rights are universal and indivisible and must not be disregarded."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to note that the proposed resolution is much more substantial than any of the previous ones, in which the massacre of the innocent Chechen people was judged depending on who was doing it – the separatists or the Russian army units."
"The first case was referred to as terrorism, while the latter one was referred to as a violation of human rights."
"The conclusion may be drawn that our judgments are not dependent on the fact itself, but rather on whether the violator is powerful and has oil and gas resources."
"However, I would like to say that our resolutions will never be effective unless the foreign policy of the EU Member States is adjusted with regard to the content of such resolutions."
"And, as a matter of fact, why should President Putin react to our sobbing, when he is further warmly welcomed in our states and is even entrusted with some very honourable and responsible duties, such as chairing the G8 meetings."
"Therefore, while proposing that we approve the draft resolution, I would like to see it supported by the appropriate diplomatic actions, so it does not become just another resolution that does not change anything in essence."
"(Mr President, as the European Parliament is debating Russia, the trial of Stanislav Dmitrijewski, senior editor of the newspaper and head of the Russia-Chechnya Friendship Association, is continuing in Nijni Novgorod."
"Mr Dmitrijewski is one of the most distinguished human rights’ defenders in the Russian Federation."
"The Russia-Chechnya Friendship Association’s web site is the main platform presenting the situation concerning human rights and political freedoms in the Southern Caucasus, notably in Chechnya."
"The next hearing in Mr Dmitrijewski’s case is set for 3 February 2006."
"When discussing Russian we tend to express concern about the state of democracy and also about the restriction of human rights and the activities of non-governmental organisations."
"It is only right to remember, however, that a different kind of Russia exists as well."
"The latter is a country of human rights’ defenders and of politicians ready to face up to the authoritarian political system."
"It is also a Russia with a flourishing culture and a sensitive civil society that constitutes a genuine link between contemporary Russia and the European Union."
". Mr President, honourable Members, we take the concerns and worries expressed during this debate regarding the situation in Chechnya and human rights in Russia very seriously."
"This morning, the President of the European Council, Chancellor Schüssel, said something that I would like to reiterate here: for us, human rights and basic freedoms are indivisible."
"They are European values, and I would stress that that obviously also applies to Russia."
"The European Union – and I am particularly referring here to the activities of the Council – repeatedly discusses these human rights violations in Chechnya with Russia at all levels."
"Whether or not the language of those discussions is too diplomatic for your taste, it is the language we use with our Russian partners."
"It is particularly important to maintain dialogue, because it is the only way that we can raise our concerns about these violations of human rights."
"That is why the human rights consultations that have been initiated, and which we will be holding on a regular basis, are particularly important."
"They will be taking place again in March, and the Council is preparing for these consultations very conscientiously."
"We also share, of course, the concerns raised here regarding the law on non-governmental organisations."
"We find it regrettable that this law has been signed."
"Rest assured, the Council will raise those concerns and we will be monitoring the position of non-governmental organisations in Russia very closely."
"I also agree, naturally, with the honourable Member who said that we must strengthen those forces in Russia that are committed to democracy and human rights."
"I can assure you that we are doing exactly that."
". Mr President, I should like first to come back to the election."
"It was the Council of Europe which sent an eight-member fact-finding mission; we did not send an election observation mission."
"The elections were not free or fair, there were deficiencies, but at the same time progress was made, because for the first time they took place without violence in such a difficult environment."
"A local service, financed by the Commission, said that there were some irregularities, but, generally, voter participation was higher than ever before: there was a 55% turnout."
"We see that there is some progress, but we know that the situation on the whole certainly is not satisfactory."
"Having said that, let me also say what the reasons are for it."
"There is a political conflict that needs a political solution, but there is also much poverty and therefore the root causes of poverty also have to be addressed."
"That is what we in the Commission are trying to do currently with our Tacis Programme in three areas: health, education – especially job-creation – and income-generation."
"We know that the main reason for many people breaking out is because they do not have jobs."
"Thirdly, as I mentioned very clearly, as regards the NGOs we will now be taking very careful note of the way the provisions are being implemented, since it was only yesterday or today that President Putin signed this law."
"We now have to look at it."
"I agree with the Presidency that it has to be in regular political dialogue with Russia."
"You can be sure that we always mention things."
"As I said before, I have been speaking with Foreign Minister Lavrov on this issue and at least a few amendments have been taken into consideration, but on the whole I agree with those who say that, as regards Russia, we need a coherent policy that encompasses energy security."
"We know that Russia is an important supplier for us, it is a strategic partner for us, but it is also a partner with whom we sometimes have dialogue where critical remarks are made."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0676/2005), with questions to the Council."
"Before we begin Question Time, I would like first of all to make an announcement and secondly to inform you that, after it, Mr Winkler will be addressing you."
"In agreement with the Council, we are introducing a new system for Question Time as of today."
"Details of this system were given to all Members in a Notice to Members dated 9 December 2005."
"Question Time will now be divided into two parts."
"During the first part, the Minister responsible for General Affairs will deal with four high-priority questions, to be selected by the President."
"During the second part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on this occasion, will deal with nine questions, specifically questions 5 to 14, which are all topics within his specific area of competence."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have my first opportunity today to be here to take your questions."
"I would like to take this opportunity to talk about something that you have already mentioned."
"We in the Presidency are well aware that Question Time is an important democratic tool, because it enables MEPs to get answers from the Council to questions that are important for their political work."
"We have therefore been reflecting, together with your House’s Bureau, on how we can make best and most effective use of Question Time as a tool."
"As Mrs Kaufmann has already said, this has resulted in some ideas for reforms that we would like to try out together for the first time today."
"This new type of Question Time aims to deal first with current topics of general interest and then to spend the rest of the time discussing a particular specialist field, in other words to raise questions to be answered in person by the President-in-Office responsible for that field."
"This, I believe, will help us to deal with the issues that interest you in a more targeted manner."
"We hope that this new procedure will provide your House with a better service and also contribute to more successful and better founded interinstitutional dialogue, to which the Austrian Presidency is particularly committed."
"We are doing this even though Austria is a country with a relatively small government and therefore with relatively few ministers who are available for this new style of dialogue, but we want to make this effort in the common interest."
"It was also not particularly easy to convince the other members of the Council to agree to these changes, but we managed it."
"I hope, Madam President, that as many Members as possible will take us up on this offer, and that their presence will in future make Question Time a more lively occasion."
"We now come to Question Time."
"Can the European Council make a statement as to the success or otherwise of the UN Convention on Climate Change which was held in Montreal in Canada the week commencing 5 December last?"
". Madam President, as Mr Aylward will be aware, the European Council recently welcomed the positive results of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which took place in Montreal from 28 November to 10 December 2005."
"Under the Montreal Action Plan, future climate change discussions should now follow two parallel paths."
"Firstly, the parties that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol will launch negotiations on the legally binding emissions targets for the developed countries in the second commitment period."
"Secondly, all parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States and the largest developing countries, have agreed to enter global discussions regarding long-term coordinated measures in relation to climate change."
"All in all, the Kyoto Protocol has now achieved full functionality, and we believe that the path has been smoothed for progress within the United Nations framework."
"May I begin by welcoming Minister Winkler on his first official occasion at Parliament, wishing him and his Government colleagues well during their term of Presidency, and thanking him for his comprehensive reply."
"I welcome the outcome of the Montreal negotiations, which were relatively successful in the end."
"However, I would like to address a question to both the Council and the Commission, in relation to the decision which was made in Sydney on 12 January 2006 by the AP6 countries, namely, China, India, South Korea, Japan, the United States and Australia, when they decided that they represent 45% of the world’s population and account for almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions."
"I wonder, because they are going it alone and there is no mandatory mechanism whereby they must adhere to certain principles, how we will provide leadership in the Council and the Commission to deal with that."
"Mr Aylward, although I have been very indulgent towards you on account of your friendly welcome to the Presidency of the Council, I must remind all Members that they have only 30 seconds for supplementary questions."
"If we all overrun, we will unfortunately be able to deal with very few questions, so please be so kind as to stick to the time limit for supplementary questions."
". Madam President, it is clear – and has also been demonstrated by the negotiations in Montreal – that the biggest producers of greenhouse gases are now getting more involved in the dialogue regarding a future climate protection mechanism, and it is important that nobody goes it alone."
"The future mechanism may well entail structural changes, which should make it considerably easier for Europe to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the efforts made so far."
"There have also been some significant developments outside the international climate process, and various regions have established a number of initiatives."
"The Gleneagles Action Plan, if I may bring that up on this occasion, places the emphasis of the EU's most important trading partners on technology transfer and on managing the effects of climate change, and involves a commitment to dialogue and technological cooperation with India, China and Russia."
"It is in the interests of the European Union to work with all countries within and outside the international climate dialogue to ensure that our common goals of reducing emissions are not undermined by the actions of groups or States."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, industry reports show that the emissions trading system distorts the energy market and unnecessarily increases electricity prices, and has a negative impact on national climate strategies."
"Does the Council take the view that the EU Emissions Trading Directive is meeting its original goals, and do you believe that a carbon dioxide tax could provide funds for the European Union?"
". Madam President, the EU's emissions trading system is one of the cornerstones of the fight against climate change."
"It is the first international CO2 emissions trading system in the world, and covers around 12 000 plants, or getting on for half of all Europe's CO2 emissions."
"It helps the Member States to reach their emissions targets."
"No other system allows emissions to be reduced so cost-effectively."
"The Council is well aware of the problems to which you alluded in implementing the EU emissions trading system during the pilot phase."
"This initial period provided some valuable experience, which should help us with the future development of the system."
"Building on these initial experiences, the directive already provides for a full review in 2006."
"This review will enable us to examine all the possible improvements and to implement them for the period post-2012."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, I would like to thank you for your very detailed comments on this subject."
"We are aware that this climate change agreement also entails costs for industry."
"Despite that, what do you see as our options for improving the competitiveness of European industry so that it can continue to be successful on the international market?"
"Do we have any options? If so, what are they?"
". Madam President, the European Union has always endeavoured to achieve global cooperation on climate protection."
"The European Union and its representatives have also made this clear in every international forum as well as in the Council's conclusions."
"Our implementation of the Kyoto Protocol provides credible proof of our commitment and shows that climate protection is feasible and compatible with economic growth."
"In our opinion, economic interests and climate protection are not contradictory."
"For example, the EU's chosen option of an emissions trading system is the most cost-efficient way to reduce emissions."
"Furthermore, international studies have repeatedly shown that failure to act would result in much higher costs than funding climate protection measures right now."
"The sooner measures are taken to protect the climate, the lower the consequent costs will be for the economy."
"It therefore makes economic sense for the European Union to take climate protection measures on the grounds of energy efficiency – and your House frequently debates energy issues – that also create new jobs."
"Question No 2 has been withdrawn by the author."
"Human rights questions are playing an ever greater role in an EU context, too, and proper coordination with other organisations in this area, in particular the Council of Europe, is therefore necessary in order to prevent duplication of effort."
"Compliance with human rights in the fight against terrorism, as repeatedly demanded by Parliament, is equally of major importance."
"How, firstly, does Austria propose to strengthen cooperation during its presidency between the EU and the Council of Europe, but also the OSCE, and, secondly, what is Austria’s stance on the question of safeguarding human rights in connection with combating terrorism?"
". Madam President, let me say, in response to Mrs Stenzel's question on coordination between the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and on human rights compliance in the fight against terrorism, that we have excellent relations with the Council of Europe, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs, and I would add that it was only today that I had my first opportunity to speak to its Committee of Ministers regarding the Austrian Presidency's priorities, and I made very particular reference there to the shared interests and cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union regarding respect for human rights."
"I would like to take this opportunity to mention that we attach a great deal of importance to the meetings that every Presidency since 1997 has held with the troika of the Council of Europe."
"The agenda for the most recent meeting with the Council of Europe on 7 December 2005 particularly included the Council of Europe's guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism."
"With regard to foreign affairs, the Council's working party on the international aspects of terrorism is also in regular contact with the Council of Europe."
"The Council working party on human rights is also closely following the international efforts being made in other arenas such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the United Nations with regard to respecting human rights in the fight against terrorism."
"We want to ensure that the EU can play an active role in all these efforts."
"The Austrian Presidency is happy to confirm that it intends to continue with this form of cooperation with the Council of Europe."
"The Council of Europe summit in Warsaw in 2004 decided to conclude an agreement with the European Union, regulating every aspect of cooperation between the organisations in the aim of structuring, improving and intensifying that cooperation."
"Under the UK Presidency, a draft was drawn up, which has already been sent to the Council of Europe and is now being examined by them according to their procedures."
"In this regard, the Austrian Presidency, in close cooperation with the Commission, will hold intensive talks with the Presidency of the Council of Europe, which, as you know, will be held by Romania for the next six months, so that this important document can be finalised in the next few months."
"When I spoke to the ministers' deputies today, I made a commitment to do everything possible on the European Union side, so that, if at all possible, this memorandum can be finalised before the end of the Romanian Presidency, in other words by the end of May this year."
"With regard to the OSCE, the two organisations are in close contact both and at institutional level, and these links will be strengthened further in future."
"I would like to point out that, over the next few years, three EU Member States in succession, namely Belgium, Spain and Finland, will hold the chairmanship of the OSCE."
"Almost 50% of the OSCE participating States are now also Member States of the European Union, and their common positions and actions are generally shared by another 10 States."
"In the decisive debates within the OSCE on improving its efficiency, particularly regarding the activities of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which works to protect human rights, the European Union has in the past systematically and successfully argued that the organisation should be fully autonomous, so that it can continue to perform its important activities in promoting democracy and human rights in all OSCE participating states without discrimination or restrictions."
"The Austrian Presidency will continue to pursue this policy, which is, of course, endorsed by all Member States."
"Madam President, many thanks for this very detailed answer to my question on coordination on human rights and the fight against terrorism."
"I have one supplementary question: what is the Presidency's position on the Council of Europe's investigations into suspicions of illegal CIA flights and secret detention centres?"
". Madam President, the Austrian Presidency supports – as Chancellor Schüssel made very clear in his comments today – the efforts undertaken by the Parliamentary Assembly and Secretary-General of the Council of Europe to shed light on this matter and to put the facts clearly on the table."
"Any doubts as to the commitment of all Council of Europe Member States to the rule of law and human rights as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights must be dispelled."
"With the same end in view, we will also support the European Parliament’s investigations into this matter."
"My supplementary is on the exact point that Mrs Stenzel has just made: will the President-in-Office speak to each of the other 24 Member States, in his capacity as President-in-Office, to encourage them to cooperate fully with the European Parliament’s temporary committee of inquiry into CIA flights?"
". We will certainly make this the subject of consultations among all members in the Council."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, I would like to raise a more general point, as it has become clear during today's debate that the issue of strengthening human rights in the framework of the EU as a whole is one of the Austrian Presidency's top priorities."
"The EU intends to develop the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, currently based in Vienna, into a Human Rights Agency."
"Do you consider there to be opportunities for coordination and useful services in the context of the problem being discussed here?"
". Madam President, we regard the establishment of a European Human Rights Agency as a major contribution to strengthening the hand of all the EU institutions."
"We are endeavouring, in dialogue with the European Parliament and also with the Council of Europe and other institutions, to make this Human Rights Agency an effective instrument with the ability of making a real contribution to discussions on the matters you have raised, namely the issue of defending human rights in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"This agency, which we hope will come into being during the Austrian Presidency, and which we envisage being able to start work on 1 January 2007, is not intended to compete with any other existing institutions."
"We have no desire to compete with the valuable and important institutions of the Council of Europe, the Court of Justice or the Commission Against Discrimination, or with other institutions."
"We want an efficient agency that will have the Monitoring Centre on Racism in Vienna as its core and foundation, but will have broader competencies and will thus increase the credibility of the European Union in the domain of human rights."
"Revelations concerning the illegal abduction, arrest, detention and interrogation of dozens of Pakistanis living in Greece, a few days after the bomb attacks in London, have become a political issue of the highest order."
"According to a BBC report, allegations made in addition to the complaints to the Greek authorities include interrogations in English lasting for days, psychological torture and disappearance."
"The entire affair is related to the operation of British intelligence services in Greece and the illegal transfer of prisoners through European airports."
"Does the Council condemn the practice of abduction and the use of torture by intelligence services or any other investigative government agencies or forces operating under cover of a government mission and will it take the necessary measures to safeguard the national sovereignty and the independence of each country?"
"Will it take initiatives to put an end to the growing number of cases of such practices, which give rise to suspicions of concerted action between several parties and countries in the context of anti-terrorist hysteria?"
". Madam President, on Mrs Manolakou's question on the abduction and arrest of Pakistanis living in Greece, I would like to say the following: the Council has always emphasised that the war against terrorism must be fought in complete compliance with the general principles of international law and with the provisions on human rights laid down in national and international legislation."
"The Council would stress once again that it categorically condemns torture and other illegal practices, and it would underline the necessity of complying with the general legal principles at all times."
"However, the Council cannot and will not comment on the details mentioned by the honourable Member."
"These specific cases of what the question describes as abduction are currently being investigated by several international bodies, in particular by the Council of Europe."
"Until we have the results of these investigations, it would be premature to take a position."
"– Madam President, the Minister has just said two contradictory things to us: on the one hand, he made a general pronouncement that the infringement of human rights is condemnable and, on the other hand, he said that he refuses to take a position on the specific events which have caused an outcry in Greece and which relate to action by the British secret services."
"This is not action by the CIA; it is action by a service in a Member State of the European Union."
"That is why we consider that the pronouncement about protecting human rights is hypocritical."
"What we want to point out is simply that all these incidents are the result of the application of the ‘anti-terrorist’ measures, the ultimate objective of which is not to combat so-called terrorism, but to terrorise the peoples as a whole."
". Madam President, if the European Parliament wants to investigate these accusations, it does of course have the option of adopting a resolution to that effect."
"From our point of view, as I said, a whole array of international bodies are engaged in investigating these accusations, and I think we must wait to see what results they come up with."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the highly reliable BBC referred to the incidents which you too wish to learn about."
"The British parliament has set up a committee and is investigating the matter."
"The Hellenic parliament has also spent hours debating the matter."
"Do you, as President-in-Office of the Council, intend to communicate with the authorities in these two Member States, so that they can tell the Council what happened?"
". Madam President, if the European Parliament wants to investigate these accusations, it does of course have the option of adopting a resolution to that effect."
"From our point of view, as I said, a whole array of international bodies are engaged in investigating these accusations, and I think we must wait to see what results they come up with."
"What measures does the Council intend to take to implement and give real face to the agreements adopted at the recent Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference?"
"Madam President, in response to Mr Medina Ortega's question regarding the Barcelona Conference, I would like to say that, at the Euro-Mediterranean summit marking the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process, agreement was reached on a joint five-year work programme to reinforce the partnership and on a code of conduct for countering terrorism, which clearly shows our shared commitment to fighting all forms of terrorism."
"The five-year work programme sets medium-term goals with regard to the political and security partnership, sustainable socio-economic development and reform, and education and socio-cultural exchanges."
"It also deals with issues related to migration, social integration, justice and security."
"The Presidency thinks it is important for every Presidency to submit a report to the Council, setting out in detail its plans for implementing this work programme, and it calls on the Commission to keep the Council regularly informed on the progress with implementation."
"The agreements reached in Barcelona will enable us to make progress in our regional cooperation with our partners in the Mediterranean region and at the same time to push the European neighbourhood policy forward by negotiating additional bilateral action plans."
"A number of important results were achieved at the summit: a governance facility to support and strengthen political reform was approved, the liberalisation of trade in services and agricultural products was confirmed as a common goal, and there was a willingness to combat illegal immigration – including through the conclusion of readmission agreements – while the EU has agreed to make legal migration easier; in this connection a future ministerial meeting is expected to deal with all immigration-related issues."
"Other results included an increase in funds for education via a university scholarship programme and the promotion of gender equality."
"Finally, the conclusion of a code of conduct on countering terrorism is a major political success and proves that, despite the sensitivities in the region, the partners in the process are willing to act together to combat this scourge that affects us all."
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the information you have given us."
"I believe that it is quite complete and, above all, that it has focused to a great extent on the fight against terrorism, which is the immediate objective."
"As you know, however, and as you have also mentioned, behind terrorism there is a more serious problem: the whole southern flank of the Mediterranean is suffering from great under-development and there is immense migratory pressure in the direction of the European Union."
"The figures I have seen in the financial perspectives approved recently by the Council talk of a total sum of EUR 800 million over a period of seven years."
"The European Parliament is currently being highly critical about this."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the figures included in the financial perspectives are sufficient to resolve these problems facing the southern flank of the Mediterranean?"
". Madam President, I would first of all like to confirm that the Council agrees that, in parallel with the measures we are taking to counter terrorism and illegal immigration, it is also important that we develop programmes – as the European Union has been doing for some time – to improve conditions in the countries of origin."
"We are committed to that, and it is also part of the agreement that the governments have reached on the financial perspectives."
"We think that the funding is adequate."
"It is now up to the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on how to fund the individual programmes from these overall figures that have been agreed."
"Then the negotiations with the European Parliament must result in agreement on the financial perspectives."
"Madam President, when the Environment Ministers of the Mediterranean region met in November, they painted a very bleak picture of the management of water resources in the area and said that in years to come there are going to be significant water shortages."
"This is not just an environmental issue, but a security issue."
"If there is a dispute over water supply it can affect the stability of the region."
"Will the Minister consider urging that this be put on the agenda of the next Euro-Mediterranean summit?"
". I thank the honourable Member for his contribution and for his suggestions."
"We will take them to the Council and consult with other Council members to see whether we can or should take them to the next conference."
"Nonetheless, I thank you for these very interesting suggestions."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"What steps is the Council planning to take to help bring about a definitive clarification of the question of the status of Kosovo before the end of 2006?"
"Talks on the future status of the region have begun with a meeting between Martti Ahtisaari, head of the UN team which will take part in the talks on the final status of Kosovo, and the President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova."
"Does the Council continue to share the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the UN in respect of Kosovo must precede the final settlement of status?"
"Will it raise with the Kosovan authorities the question of the existence of a Guantanamo-type prison at the American base of Camp Bondsteel?"
"2006 is a crucially important year for the development of the West Balkans."
"One pending challenge is to resolve the future status of Kosovo."
"Regardless of the outcome of the status negotiations, Kosovo must be incorporated into a European vision."
"What tangible form should that European vision take?"
"What are Austria’s European Neighbourhood Policy plans, especially in connection with Ukraine?"
". Madam President, I will start with the questions by Mr Posselt, Mr Papadimoulis and Mr Karas on Kosovo."
"According to the Thessaloniki Declaration, which the EU and the western Balkan states issued at their summit in June 2003, the future of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is within the European Union."
"The Council's attitude to Kosovo is based on a set of principles that the European Council adopted at its meeting on 16 and 17 June 2005 as part of its declaration on Kosovo."
"Any solution for the status of Kosovo must be fully compatible with European values and norms, comply with international legal instruments and obligations and the United Nations Charter, and contribute to realising the European prospects of Kosovo and the region."
"Any agreement on status must ensure that Kosovo does not return to the pre-March 1999 situation."
"The determination of the future status of Kosovo must be based on multi-ethnicity, and on full respect for human rights, including the right for all to return home."
"The status must also offer, and this is very important, effective constitutional guarantees to ensure that minorities are protected, including mechanisms to ensure their participation in central government and local administrative structures."
"It should also include specific safeguards to protect the cultural heritage and religious sites and to promote effective mechanisms to combat organised crime, corruption and terrorism."
"The status of Kosovo must also reinforce the security and stability of the region."
"Thus any solution which was unilateral or resulted from the use of force, as well as any changes to the current territory of Kosovo, would be unacceptable, and there will be no partition of Kosovo, nor any union of Kosovo with another country or with part of another country."
"The territorial integrity of neighbouring countries must be fully respected."
"The Council is also of the opinion that further implementation of both current and future standards is of particular importance, especially with regard to the protection of minorities."
"In this connection, the Council has repeatedly emphasised that it values and supports the work of the UN's Special Representative for Kosovo, Mr Jessen-Petersen."
"The Council is determined to work extensively to determine the status of Kosovo and to contribute to the related negotiation process led by the United Nations."
"To this end, in November 2005 the High Representative, Mr Solana, appointed Stefan Lehne as the EU's representative, to work closely with the UN's Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo, Mr Ahtisaari."
"The Council endorsed this appointment."
"The EU's representative provides the UN Special Envoy with contributions for the negotiations and also helps the EU to prepare for its future role in Kosovo in the follow-up period to Resolution 1244."
"He also works closely with the Member States and the Commission."
"The European Commission will also be represented in Vienna, where the UN Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo has his headquarters."
"Areas such as respect for human rights, minorities, cultural and religious sites, the rule of law and economic development will be of particular interest for the European Union."
"The UN Special Envoy has indicated his willingness to work closely with the EU on these and other issues."
"At the same time, in connection with the restructuring of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission In Kosovo (UNMIK), the EU has held informal consultations with the UNMIK together with other international organisations and partners."
"The aim is to assess the options for a future international presence in Kosovo without pre-empting the outcome of the discussion on Kosovo's status."
"Against this background, Mr Solana and Commissioner Rehn presented their second report on how the EU can prepare for the coming challenges to the Council in December."
"The new international formation for the follow-up period to Resolution 1244 will involve everybody and have a strong EU presence."
"The EU should play a vital role in the areas related to the rule of law, including a police mission, capacity building and in the economy."
"The body responsible for all issues regarding the international military presence in Kosovo led by the UN is KFOR."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, many thanks for your excellent response – I would not have expected anything else."
"This January, it is 100 years since the Moravian Compromise came into force, which was quite exemplary; the only problem was that it only applied in Moravia."
"We are now making the same mistake: we are seeking specific settlements and setting varying standards."
"While provisions regarding minorities are being carefully drawn up in Kosovo, there is nothing similar in the Preševo valley or in Vojvodina."
"I would just like to ask you to develop uniform or comparable standards for the region objectively: it is the only way we will be able to reach a peace agreement."
". Madam President, Mr Posselt and I already know each other from elsewhere."
"I am, of course, very pleased to take on board your opinion and your suggestion."
"I also take the view – as I have already said once today – that human rights and minority rights are indivisible."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke for six minutes, but you spoke in very general, very 'round' terms."
"I therefore ask you, is UN Resolution 1244 still an axis for the Council's policy?"
"What will happen, not only with the right to return, but also with the ability to return of the Serbs and Roma forced to leave Kosovo?"
"As you said that Kosovo's place is in Europe, do you intend to bring to the attention of the authorities the accusations about a Guantanamo-type prison at the US base in Kosovo?"
". Madam President, I can confirm that the Council continues and will continue to take the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the UN in respect of Kosovo must precede the final settlement of status."
"The resolution is binding, it is applicable, and it is the axis on which the solution will be based."
"Discussions have now commenced on the status of Kosovo, and we will follow them attentively."
"According to the Thessaloniki Declaration, to which I have already referred, the future of Kosovo – and I would like to emphasise this again, because you mentioned the European Union's principles and values – is within the European Union, and that of course means that the EU's values must be accepted."
"With regard to your question about the camp, that is a question that cannot be answered by Kosovo."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, in my question I also referred to the European neighbourhood policy."
"I would just like to ask you about the Austrian Presidency's programme for strengthening the neighbourhood policy, particularly with regard to Ukraine."
"I would like to know whether the EU has provided sufficient resources to ensure that it can play an equivalent role in Kosovo during and after the status process."
". Madam President, to start with the second part of the question, it is the case that the European Union is required to provide adequate resources, and it will indeed do so."
"The CFSP budget has recently been increased considerably for the current year."
"Since, however, the scope of our future activities is not yet certain – we cannot yet tell what sort of presence the European Union will have in Kosovo – it is currently not possible to say precisely what funds will be needed for this."
"It would also be possible to raise the gas budget rapidly during the budget year with the agreement of the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"If the duties assigned to the European Union make this necessary, it will happen."
"With regard to the European neighbourhood policy, it has already, in its first year, made a valuable contribution to the EU’s committed involvement in its neighbourhood, and we also support the Commission's related proposals."
"The gradual, systematic and nevertheless individual introduction of EU standards and rules should and will be pursued."
"The neighbourhood policy's declared aim is and will continue to be to offer and enable a significant level of integration."
"This is achieved – as you mentioned – by means of European neighbourhood policy action plans, and both we and the Commission feel that those with Ukraine and Moldova have been a success."
"An initial review of the first year of the action plans for Ukraine and Moldova will be carried out in 2006, during the Austrian Presidency."
"As of next year, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will also provide us with a new financial instrument enabling even more targeted support."
"We also feel it is important to negotiate and conclude action plans as soon as possible with all states under the European neighbourhood policy."
"This includes in particular the three Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and this, too, is a task that will fall on the Austrian Presidency."
"Political consultations with these three countries were launched just last December. In this context, the Commission declared firmly that negotiations on action plans with these three countries in particular should be pushed forward rapidly."
"The Austrian Presidency very much supports this."
"With regard to Ukraine, we are very supportive of its connection to the European Union within the framework of the ENP."
"Now that Ukraine has met the technical criteria for market economy status, we assume that that status will soon be formally granted."
"In that connection, we consider it to be particularly important for Ukraine to join the WTO in the near future, as this would smooth the path for the creation of a free trade area with the European Union."
"A feasibility study on this is currently being finalised by the European Commission."
"We think that implementation of this proposal constitutes another important step in relations with Ukraine, and we will work hard to make further progress in this direction."
"There is growing evidence of persecution or harassment of Christians in a range of countries."
"How does the Council intend to raise such issues with the governments concerned?"
". Madam President, regarding Mr Bowis's question on the persecution and harassment of Christians, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is enshrined in international legislation on the protection of human rights."
"I would refer you in particular to Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which applies worldwide and in which freedom of thought, conscience and religion is laid down as an individual right."
"This right, according to that article, includes freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one's choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one's religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching."
"This human right is extremely important to the European Union, and it therefore regularly holds discussions with third countries on this subject, most recently in New York, where the EU Member States successfully proposed, in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief."
"The Council has repeatedly condemned all forms of intolerance based on religion and also pays close attention to developments in the field of human rights."
"The Council uses the opportunities offered by its dialogue with third countries to make clear its concerns regarding intolerance towards religious and other minorities."
"Does the Minister agree with me that there is an ever-increasing list of countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Nigeria, Vietnam, and China – the list goes on and on – where Christians are being persecuted and the Governments either connive at it, or take ineffective action to stop it?"
"These are countries with which we do business. Will Austria now give a lead to the Council and the European Union to stand up for the religious rights of Christians in those countries with whom we deal, just as we rightly stand up for religious freedom and tolerance within the European Union?"
". As I have said, the European Union raises the question regularly in all dialogues as well as in international fora, which is very important."
"We have raised it at the United Nations."
"We do not name and shame, but we are very clear when we speak to the countries concerned if we believe, or have reason to believe, that there is persecution or restriction of the right to religious freedom."
"To give you an example: we very much emphasise the question of religious freedom in our human rights discussions with China, because we believe this to be an issue that must be raised in the context of our dialogue with China."
"The same is true in other areas."
"The adoption of a resolution, which was adopted by a large majority of members of the United Nations, is a step in the right direction."
"This will give us even more leverage in the future to raise this question in our relations with those countries."
"The fact that we do business with those countries does not prevent us from speaking out clearly when it comes to violations of human rights."
"I now have three supplementary questions before me."
"They are permitted under our new system."
"We are now in the second part of questions to the Council, so Mr Rübig has the floor first for his supplementary question."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, Christians in Turkey still have to deal with many difficulties. What does the Presidency propose to do to improve their situation?"
". Madam President, the European Union is monitoring the situation of the non-Muslim minorities extremely closely."
"According to the EU-Turkey Accession Partnership, it is vital to the success of the accession negotiations that the Turkish Government undertake further reforms with respect to freedom of religion, particularly regarding the training of clerics and granting legal personality to non-Muslim minorities, in order to come more into line with the standards within the European Union in these areas too."
"We will monitor this very closely in the process of the accession negotiations, but we will also support Turkey in implementing the necessary reforms."
"Minister, raising these issues with the countries is all well and good, but surely we need an ethical policy that produces results."
"Is it not time to make a very direct link between trade with these countries and respect for human rights?"
"When we liberalise trade with such countries who persecute Christians and others, should we not make it conditional upon them liberalising their human rights regime so that minorities within those countries have the rights that we take for granted?"
". There are cases where we link certain things that the European Union does for those countries with respect for human rights."
"In some countries where there are violations of human rights certain sanctions are in force, for example in Myanmar/Burma."
"In other cases we also have to bear in mind that we need to support the people who live there."
"We must be very careful about applying sanctions, because very often it is the people and not the government who are hurt."
"We believe that each case should be considered individually."
"We believe in a frank, open and direct dialogue."
"If such a dialogue does not lead to the desired results, then we have to discuss in the Council other methods we might wish to pursue."
"Thank you for having the courage to talk to China."
"I would just like to mention the position of the underground church and the detention of bishops and other religious figures, and also to echo Mr Rübig: have there been any new developments in Turkey regarding the law on religion?"
". Madam President, Mr Posselt, I do not really think it took any courage to talk to China."
"Our dialogue with China – in which I have taken part myself – is very open and direct."
"The issue you raised is, of course, being pursued not only in relation to China, but also to Turkey."
"We have raised our concerns on the matter in our discussions with Turkey and will obviously continue to insist in future that the legal and administrative measures being established by Turkey in this respect are in line with our expectations in this domain, which of course correspond to international standards."
"As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses."
"Sweden has been active in the democratisation process in Colombia."
"Yet we all know that problems persist with regard to democracy and that human rights violations are on the increase."
"One concrete example is the rapidly increasing production of palm oil."
"There is a rising tide of opinion against the expansion of large-scale oil plantations."
"It is a question of recognising the land rights of local and indigenous populations."
"Many EU countries use palm kernel meal as animal feed, and many of us use cosmetic products which contain palm oil."
"What will the Council do to ensure that EU Member States continue to support the democratisation process in Colombia and continue to seek a halt to human rights violations in Colombia?"
". Madam President, with regard to Mrs Segelström's question on Colombia, although it has been reported by several sources that violations of human rights in Colombia are decreasing, any violation of human rights is a cause for concern."
"The continuing internal armed conflict in Colombia is at the root of most of those violations, which are predominantly committed by illegal armed groups."
"The EU is therefore constantly appealing to the parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and it is also in regular contact with, in particular, the Colombian authorities and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota."
"I would also add that the Colombian vice-president was in Austria just before Christmas – I spoke to him myself, and in particular we had some very intensive discussions on the issue of human rights."
"In its conclusions of 3 October 2005 the Council reaffirmed its full support for the Colombian Government, in particular in its efforts to impose the rule of law throughout the country and in the fight against terrorism and the production of and trade in illegal drugs."
"The Council also reaffirmed its long-held policy of supporting the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including direct talks with the illegal armed groups that are willing to engage in a negotiated peace process."
"We therefore welcome the fact that there has recently been contact between the illegal armed groups and the Colombian authorities, and we call on all those involved to do everything in their power to reach a peaceful resolution and thus to put an end to the internal armed conflict, which has now lasted for more than a generation, as the primary cause of human rights violations."
"Thank you, Secretary of State, for your answer."
"I am delighted that you have an established contact of that kind."
"I believe it is needed, because Colombia is in the process of becoming one of the world’s largest refugee disaster areas where, it is said, up to three million people have been displaced and forced to leave their homes."
"That is why I wonder whether what we are doing now in the EU is enough or whether there is more we can do to bring pressure to bear."
"The problems involving drugs and corruption are, as you say, also part of the picture, but so too are the changes going on that affect the land and the fact that people will want to exploit the palm-oil, which is so valuable."
"."
"Madam President, Mrs Segelström, you have asked a question to which there is really no answer."
"Are we in the European Union doing enough for the suffering in many countries?"
"This is a question that cannot really be answered in abstract terms."
"We are doing our best."
"However, I would like to point to some concrete initiatives connected with the Council's conclusions of last October, to which I have already referred, although I would add that most of these initiatives fall within the competency of the Commission."
"For example, the Commission decided in December 2005 to provide EUR 1.5 million as part of the rapid reaction mechanism."
"It remains to be seen whether that is enough or whether we can still do more."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, what is your view on the proposal to hold a G24 conference to support the peace process during the first half of 2006?"
"."
"Madam President, I cannot say at the moment whether such a conference will be held in the first half of 2006: it will depend on the troika of the G24 group – led by Mexico – reaching agreement with the Colombian government."
"Any such conference would certainly take place very close to the EU-Latin America summit in mid-May 2006 and to the presidential elections in Colombia at the end of May."
"The EU-Latin America summit, by the way, takes place exactly in the middle of the two stages of the election, and it is therefore not certain whether the Colombian President will be present at this conference in Vienna."
"As the author is not present, Question No 12 lapses."
"Despite an international outcry and expressions of intense disapproval, a draft which is distinctly anti-Communist in tone has once more been put to the vote in the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly following a change in title from 'condemnation of communist Ideology' to 'The Need for International Condemnation of Crimes committed by communist Regimes'."
"What stance does the Council intend to adopt in response to these growing attempts to rewrite history and to justify the crimes committed in the name of fascism and imperialism? Will it seek to ensure the freedom of all political parties and an end to measures penalising the communist movement and banning communist parties?"
"."
"Madam President, with regard to Mr Pafilis's question, I would refer to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Although I am sure he is familiar with this document, I would nevertheless like to quote an extract from it: 'The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States'."
"These rights include freedom of expression, and it is not up to the Council of the European Union to interfere in the decision-making process of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly."
"The question relates to the activities of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, on which I cannot comment."
"– Madam President, I could never have imagined that the Council would avoid answering directly on the question of the anti-communist memorandum."
"It is known in every country in Europe, thousands of people from all political areas have condemned it, it is a new fascist text which equates Nazism with communism, it is disrespectful to millions of communist victims who sacrificed their lives to conquer fascism, it criminalises the political action and ideology of communists and, precisely – as you referred to Article 6 – it infringes fundamental democratic rights."
"We demand that the Council take a position on this memorandum."
"."
"Madam President, I can only repeat what I have already said: the European Union cannot comment on the activities, discussions and decisions of a body of another international organisation."
"Madam President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly is located very close to us here, and it naturally has a much better overview of political circumstances."
"Do you think it would be possible for them, too, to initiate a debate on the European Constitutional Treaty, because the Treaty could, of course, also support the future stability of those countries?"
". Madam President, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly can discuss any subject."
"It is up to the Assembly to decide for itself which topics it wants to discuss. However, it is of course also possible to put forward such proposals in discussions with national Members of the Parliamentary Assembly."
"The European Union itself and the Council itself certainly cannot make this proposal to the body of another institution."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"– The next item is the report by Charles Tannock, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European neighbourhood policy (2004/2166(INI) (A6-0399/2005)."
". Mr President, first I should like to pay special tribute to my predecessor, Mr Laschet, from whom I inherited this report after his departure from the House."
"I was initially sceptical when the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) concept was first floated in the 2003 communication on a wider Europe."
"The chief conceptual problem was how to coordinate a policy on countries that appear to have different and contradictory aims, such as Libya wanting to host the African Union at the time, and Ukraine wanting to join the European Union."
"Political leadership is about turning concepts into reality and the ENP is now an established political reality accepted by the partner states."
"My report seeks to review its workings, bring additional recommendations from Parliament and clarify some of the misunderstandings surrounding it."
"The ENP offers a privileged relationship between the EU and all its current non-Member State neighbours to the south and east."
"It excludes the current EU candidates for membership and the potential candidate countries of the western Balkans which have separate special arrangements."
"But what does the privilege bring?"
"In short, two things: firstly, the greater sharing of democratic values, and secondly, aid and trade for promoting those values."
"The ENP is therefore two-tracked: one lane promotes the values that underpin the European Union, namely, a commitment to common values regarding the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, the promotion of good-neighbourly relations and the principles of market economy and sustainable development; the other entails sanctions for failing them by restricting aid or trade privileges."
"The aim ultimately is to establish a circle of friends around the European Union in which the essential task of promoting and enhancing prosperity, stability and security is carried out in partnership and to mutual advantage."
"There will be increased financial assistance through a single dedicated European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), also applicable to Russia, which from 2007 onwards will replace the current TACIS and MEDA programmes."
"However, I am concerned that the Commission might decouple the ENP from the ENPI budget, which will entail a substantial erosion of Parliament's powers of oversight and scrutiny."
"The Commission has already presented a strategy paper and country reports on a series of ENP countries, followed by action plans."
"A regular reviewing process will monitor the implementation of those, for which I seek more parliamentary involvement."
"Seven action plans have been adopted with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, the Palestinian Authority, Ukraine and Moldova."
"Five more are in preparation with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia and Lebanon."
"I strongly support improved access for ENP countries to the single market and, in some cases, the eventual conclusion of neighbourhood agreements and the establishment of fully-fledged free trade agreements with the European Union."
"I also support participation in the ESDP/CFSP, including the various Council working groups, and membership, where appropriate, of the EU devolved agencies."
"We also need better focus on drugs, weapons and people-trafficking and enhanced exchanges of criminal intelligence between national agencies in the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, as well as renewed efforts for the peaceful resolution of outstanding territorial disputes, including the frozen conflicts."
"By coincidence, today in London, Armenia and Azerbaijan are meeting to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh question."
"Several ENP partner countries, such as Azerbaijan and Algeria, are rich in energy resources, as are the producers or transporters of oil and gas."
"Therefore, energy policy and EU energy security will be a key pillar of the ENP."
"The recent Russia/Ukraine gas crisis illustrates how energy policy and foreign policy now interface."
"Lastly, I do not consider the ENP a fixed, long-term alternative to full EU membership for those democratic European countries entitled to apply which have expressed a desire to do so, such as Ukraine and Moldova."
"The report goes some way towards recognising their European aspirations."
"In contrast, as for other former Central Asian Soviet states, such as Kazakhstan – although currently not a part of the ENP – the EU should give serious consideration, in my view, when their PCA agreements eventually expire, to extending their right to participate in this ambitious project if they so wish."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for this very good report on the European neighbourhood policy, which will give me the opportunity to come back to the priorities for the next several months on this important issue."
"As we have reiterated on several occasions since its inception in 2003, the neighbourhood policy is an ambitious policy."
"It remains the number one issue – at least in my own portfolio – in EU external relations, because it is so important to promote prosperity, stability and security."
"The stakes for our neighbouring countries are very high."
"It is clearly in the interests of the European Union to have well-governed and democratic partners in our neighbourhood which can finally join in the positive dynamics of sustainable social and economic development."
"As you mentioned, it is also in our interests that conflicts in our vicinity are peacefully resolved and that issues like migration, border control, organised crime and terrorism are tackled in a more effective way through closer cooperation."
"The year 2005 has been the first year of delivery for the ENP, with the beginning of the implementation of the first seven ENP action plans."
"What do we want to do in the future?"
"The Commission has been active on a broad front, including, for example, progress on market economy status; visa facilitation and energy issues for Ukraine; the border assistance mission on the Moldovan/Ukrainian border; creating new fora in which to discuss issues such as democracy, human rights and governance, for instance with our Mediterranean partners – I need only recall the Euromed Conference in Barcelona in November; the preparations to pursue our educational cooperation and in particular to extend twinning and technical assistance and information exchange programmes to TAIEX programmes to our partners; and our proposal for a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – the ENPI – that will not be decoupled from the neighbourhood policy."
"It must be said that for 2006 and 2007 it will be crucial for the further development of ENP to deliver, and there is a considerable onus on our partners regarding implementation, because we will continue to deliver on our own commitments, but how the partner countries react is very important."
"We will continue the implementation of the ENP action plans in close cooperation with our partners."
"At the end of 2006 we will issue a full progress report covering the implementation."
"We will also open certain programmes and agencies to ENP partners."
"For instance, we will start negotiations on agricultural and fishery products with our Mediterranean partners."
"We will work on visa facilitation issues with Ukraine and Moldova."
"For Ukraine the mandate is already there."
"We will also adopt the ENPI as soon as possible and hopefully provide it with adequate resources so that it can be fully operational from January 2007."
"We are convinced that the ENPI will give us a better, more flexible and more focused instrument with which we can support reforms and cross-border cooperation."
"Both we and our partners are facing a major challenge to turn the commitments contained in the action plans into real concrete action."
"Implementation is always the most important test and will depend very much on the partner countries’ political will and on our capacity, but also their capacity, to implement the commitments taken in the action plans."
"Let me assure you that we will do everything in our power to do so."
"Let me also briefly say that the gas dispute of 1 January has shown how important the energy question has become."
"Let me also say that we must urgently draw the consequences of this gas dispute and the energy question for our external policy."
"I intend to give the highest priority to developing an effective foreign energy policy which will aim at the most effective guarantee possible of the security of the EU energy supply."
"We are not starting from scratch, as many instruments already exist, but they need further exploitation and an energy dialogue with Russia that has already covered much ground and provided us with a good basis to address bilateral aspects is there, but we have to make it really profound and we have to go on."
"We recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on energy and, in addition, we will provide expertise to Ukraine and Moldova."
"Therefore, there is a multidimensional aspect and we shall address that through institutions such as G8, the International Energy Agency, the OSCE and others."
"We have the Energy Charter Treaty, which Russia has not yet joined, but we also have the South-East Europe Energy Community Treaty as instruments on which we will build."
"That means the neighbourhood policy will certainly also have to tackle these questions in the right format."
"But, again, as I said today in another context, we will also need coherence from the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank both the rapporteur for his work and his predecessor Mr Laschet for what he did by way of preparation for it; I am also grateful to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for her contribution to the fact that the neighbourhood policy is taking us into an extremely important area."
"This not only helps these countries, but is also a policy for stability and peace in our own interests."
"I think that the action programmes must be based on an adequately funded financial instrument, and also that, in cooperation with the European Parliament – in line with the division of roles we have to respect – important areas must be included."
"Involving our neighbours in several policy areas increases the bonds between us in terms of economic policy, including aid for their political development, respect for human rights and much more. The example of energy policy has already been mentioned, which involves, for example, providing aid to Ukraine."
"I would like to emphasise that this is equally important for Eastern Europe and for the Mediterranean."
"In individual cases, however, we may use different methods and arenas to achieve the goals of the neighbourhood policy."
"For the countries of Eastern Europe, there is a European perspective that is important in legitimising domestic reform efforts and in supporting the government so that they can do this."
"This does not, however, mean that every country automatically has the prospect of accession, as the French Prime Minister, Mr De Villepin, said today in his speech in Berlin."
"We may also have to find methods that do not necessarily result in accession at the end of the road."
"We should therefore also consider whether the development of this policy should also lead to a 'European Economic Area plus'."
"I am using that just as a working title and as a multilateral offer that, in principle, leaves the door open for EU membership if the countries are capable of it and the European Union is willing and able to accept them."
"We in Parliament are currently debating whether this could be a possibility."
"However, that is not the purpose of this report, which acts as an intermediate step for some of the Balkan states with which accession negotiations have not yet been started, without calling into question the Thessaloniki accession commitment."
"We have a lot to do here, Commissioner, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to offer you the support necessary to make progress in close cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Tannock, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to invite the Commission to take the report before us into serious consideration, since it did not do so with the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2003."
"That resolution, in fact, contains a series of useful suggestions for enhancing the neighbourhood policy, which is one of the most important challenges facing Europe."
"The constructive relations that we shall be able to develop with our neighbours in fact represent the only prospect for creating peace and security around our borders."
"There are two main reasons why this will not be an easy task."
"The first is that we are surrounded by areas of great instability and conflict: from Chechnya to Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East."
"Secondly, the aim of this policy is not accession to the Union, which makes it more difficult to succeed in influencing both internal reform in the various countries and relations among those countries and between them and the Union."
"Some of the countries currently involved in the neighbourhood policy look forward to achieving full EU membership – the rapporteur has already mentioned the cases of Ukraine and Moldova."
"Even if we do not rule out that prospect, we should at least be honest and say that membership is not currently feasible, both because of the Union’s internal situation and because of the progress that those countries themselves still need to make."
"All that, however, provides further support for this policy."
"The aspect that I have chosen to emphasise is the enhancement of the overall vision of the neighbourhood policy, even though it covers diverse areas in the east, south-east and south, as well as countries that differ greatly among themselves."
"Security, energy, immigration, the environment and human rights require vision and political dialogue, as well as specific institutions in order to be able to make progress together."
"Together with the action plans that the Commission is negotiating, this is the dimension that needs to be enhanced, including by means of specific policies, such as the energy policy, which the Commissioner singled out."
"Back in 2003, Parliament pointed out that energy was an area that required attention in relations with neighbouring countries; today we reiterate that need for attention and call for a communication to be drawn up on those aspects of energy policy that concern our foreign and neighbourhood policy."
"I shall conclude, therefore, with my initial appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner, who has an excellent relationship with us: do not undervalue the European Parliament’s contribution."
". Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is very happy with the content of Mr Tannock’s report, but we would have liked to see a few conceptual improvements to it."
"The Commission originally used the expression ‘neighbourhood policy’ alongside the concept of a ‘Wider Europe’."
"That has generally referred to the whole of Europe in both scientific and political debate."
"Mr Tannock’s report contains a lot of views on how to develop pan-European cooperation, including that within the framework of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but this is not taken into account in its subheadings."
"We would therefore propose replacing the unfortunately worded subheading after point 30 with the words ‘Wider Europe’."
"The Liberal Group also proposed that the concept of the ‘Southern Dimension’ should have a place in the report."
"It would be a more apt description of the Union’s external relations with the south, the Mediterranean region, the wider Middle East and the countries east of that."
"It would be logical to speak of the Northern and Southern Dimension of Union policy at the same time."
"Our third conceptual suggestion was that the report ought to have contained the idea of Europe developing as a system of concentric circles, consisting on the one hand of flexible differentiation within the Union and, on the other, of the creation of functional circles of cooperation around it."
"This notion provides an opportunity for seeking a solution to the conflict between the Union’s consolidation and expansion."
"The idea received support in discussions between the groups but no one wanted to include it in this report."
"I wonder why not."
"As we did not receive sufficient support from the other groups for the realisation of this or any of our other proposals for conceptual improvements, we will not be including them in the voting sessions."
"We will wait until a more appropriate time to adopt them."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Tannock, for his excellent levels of cooperation, and especially for having adopted our proposal to endorse the Northern Dimension in the report, and also the proposals relating to pan-European cooperation, even though this important Wider Europe concept was omitted."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Tannock, who took up the torch on this report, for his availability and his willingness to listen with regard to the very complex issues that arise when defining the neighbourhood policy."
"The neighbourhood policy became a necessity with the arrival of the new Member States and, in involving all the bordering countries to the East around the Mediterranean, it has become one of the key elements and strong points in the EU's external policy."
"For this action, the Union has taken on a considerable responsibility and it will have a tough job to avoid dashing the hopes of our neighbours."
"Indeed, a new dynamism has been born in these countries, which now expect that the Union will support them in the process of democratisation, stabilisation and sustainable development that they have launched. In some countries, it is even a prerequisite for future accession."
"We therefore have to avoid a number of pitfalls if we are to make a success of the neighbourhood policy."
"It must include a multilateral dimension and provide an institutional framework within which the partner countries are fully involved in defining European policy."
"It must not be limited simply to a free trade area but be based on a real sharing of common values, democracy and human rights."
"The neighbourhood policy must work to consolidate civil society by setting up a civil forum where NGOs can follow the action plans, which, Commissioner, will not be cooperation plans Mark 2 but specific and effective plans, with a Union determined to monitor them and implement them according to specific criteria."
"It is with a certain amount of pride, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that I will support the action plans for the countries of the southern Caucasus, because the fact that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are part of this neighbourhood policy is thanks to us in the European Parliament and not to the Commission and the Council."
"Today, these three former Soviet republics bear a heavy burden of history."
"The neighbourhood policy should help them to find an answer to their frozen conflicts."
"The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh must be dealt with; the refugees – particularly the Azerbaijanis – must be able to go home; the destruction of historic Armenian monuments in Nakhichevan is unacceptable;"
"Turkey must reopen its border with Armenia;"
"Russia cannot, on the one hand, have a privileged partnership with the EU and, on the other hand, issue passports to Georgian separatists; and the EU must support the peace plan in Georgia for South Ossetia and help to draw up a plan for Abkhazia."
"As you can see, strong involvement from the EU, via the drafting of a stability pact in the southern Caucasus to achieve a peaceful resolution to these conflicts, is absolutely vital and will be a win-win strategy."
"It will help these countries to find the path to development and lasting peace and it will bring the EU considerable credit in a region dominated by the influence of Russia and the United States."
"Let us make the neighbourhood policy the spearhead of a successful common global security policy."
". Mr President, neighbourhood policy can take two forms, and they are both very different."
"The first is based on pure self-interest, on attempts to make the environment subservient to the economic and military demands developed within the European Union."
"Countries pursuing this model are happy to have as neighbours countries that supply them with oil and gas, that keep refugees from their territory and that subject their own people to dictatorial measures designed to stop the interests of the countries adhering to this model from being adversely affected."
"In a model of that kind, neighbourhood policy is also a means of keeping those countries that experience a lower standard of living, less democracy and fewer human rights out of the rich Fortress Europe once and for all."
"All that those countries are needed for is to provide cheap labour."
"Neighbourhood policy of that kind is very reminiscent of the way in which the United States treated Latin America for two centuries."
"There is also a totally different form of neighbourhood policy possible, namely one that recognises that we in this part of Europe have organised many things better than in other countries and that we have something to offer them."
"Promoting democracy and human rights in Belarus, Tunisia, Algeria and those Palestinian regions that are still occupied is in keeping with this type of policy."
"It also means that we contribute to economic development which should raise the level of prosperity in those countries to our level."
"In a number of cases, namely the Western Balkans, but possibly also in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Turkey, it could also represent a transitional phase to full EU membership."
"Whilst my group emphatically denounces the first form of neighbourhood policy, it wholeheartedly embraces the second."
"Fortunately, it is this second variant that dominates Mr Tannock’s report. Also, most amendments put democracy, human rights and solidarity above economic and military advantage."
"If the Council and the Commission follow this line, then our neighbourhood policy is bound to move in the right direction."
". Mr President, Mr Tannock is right to devote some of his interesting report to the current situation in one of the EU’s neighbouring countries, namely Belarus."
"Particularly in Paragraph 56, he calls on all European institutions to increase their support for Belarus’s civil society activities and of its political opposition."
"With that in mind, I should like to ask the Commissioner how the Brussels plans to post a delegation to Minsk are coming along."
"That delegation should be able to actually operate on the basis of its own objectives, on the basis of the shared commitment of the Union’s Member States to the democratic rule of law."
"An ideal channel for communication between the Commission and Belarusian civil society, it could, eventually, also be a for adopting an active neighbourhood policy with Belarus."
"I am afraid that President Lukashenko’s current authoritarian regime would not be very keen on this."
"It would probably prefer a toothless European delegation on its own territory as a means of legitimising itself in the eyes of the international community."
"I would ask the Commissioner if this attitude from Minsk might hinder the European delegation being posted to the Belarusian capital."
"Mr Tannock also calls on all parties involved to come to a political settlement of the long-standing Transnistria issue."
"Ominously for Moldova, two of the parties involved, namely Russia and Ukraine, issued a joint declaration about the Transnistria conflict, without involving Chisinau, just a month ago, in mid-December 2005."
"In fact, Presidents Putin and Yushchenko did not involve the United States, the European Union or Romania either for that matter."
"Between the two of them, they appointed themselves as ‘guarantee powers’ in Moldova and Transnistria."
"Could this be a repeat of previous action taken by Yevgeni Primakov in 1997, which, in fact, received no international backing whatsoever and was emphatically rejected by Moldova?"
"In passing, Putin and Yushchenko have now also appointed themselves as being responsible for ‘peace, stability and the well-being of the people of Moldova, Russians and Ukrainians on both banks of the Dniester’."
"That is simply tantamount to a Russian-Ukrainian condominium."
"At the same time, on 15 December 2005, Kiev and Moscow accepted each other’s solutions for the Transnistria conflict as being ‘complementary’."
"These are transparent proposals which, in my view, amount to the confirmation of a geographical division of Moldova, of an international legitimacy of Russia’s military presence in Transnistria and of a ‘democratic, neutral state of Moldova’."
"I would ask the Commissioner how he interprets this bilateral agreement between Putin and Yushchenko on Moldova’s future in the context of the European neighbourhood policy."
"I am looking forward to your response to my two questions."
". Mr President, I would like to highlight a number of key principles that should feature in any sound and effective neighbourhood policy."
"Firstly, such a policy must not be presented as something diametrically opposed to membership of the European Union."
"On the contrary, in the case of a European country, a successful neighbourhood policy should bring membership closer."
"Clearly, neighbourhood does not automatically entail membership, but it can result in membership."
"Secondly, it should be emphasised that the level of aid must be conditional on the willingness to comply with democratic standards demonstrated by the neighbouring or partner country."
"This applies especially to the case of Belarus, where it is not possible for us to cooperate with the government."
"It also ought to apply to Russia, however, because there has been a notable drop in compliance with democratic standards in that country during the actual period of implementation of partnership agreements."
"It is my impression that what we are doing in Russia is helping to build roads that are subsequently used to transport people sentenced unfairly, or oil pipelines from which we are subsequently denied oil."
"The third principle is as follows. Wherever an inadequate level of democracy is noted, we ought to make a particular effort to support civil society and democratic forces."
"To be able to do this effectively, we need to be able to rely on a special instrument for human rights."
"Such an instrument should be sufficiently flexible to serve as an effective tool in a hostile legal and political environment."
"These principles are contained in the Tannock report and endorsed by it."
"My group is therefore pleased to vote in favour of the report."
"Mr President, the European neighbourhood policy, today’s debate, and the resolution before us prove that although the Union is experiencing a crisis, we have not yet lost the ability to think strategically."
"We recognise the importance of opening up to our neighbours."
"The economic problems of the enlarged Union and the difficulties over the adoption of the Constitution must not deter us from developing a vision of the future beyond the next elections in our individual countries."
"Relations with our neighbours to the east and south-east are particularly important aspects of our neighbourhood policy."
"The draft resolution quite rightly refers to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and the countries of the Southern Caucasus in general."
"It is also right that we should recognise the mistake we made by not exerting appropriate influence on Russia to ensure the latter played its part in stabilising rather than destabilising the situation in the former Soviet republics."
"I should like to make an observation to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"We cannot expect anyone to conduct Europe’s neighbourhood policy on our behalf."
"It should not be foisted onto the G8 or the OECD or become a political football."
"We need to keep a fundamental principle in mind too. This is that financial aid within the framework of the newly created European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument must be controlled, as Mr Szymański mentioned earlier."
"We must not further the interests of undemocratic governments."
"The latter must be required to support democracy in those societies and governmental structures, and to promote human rights standards."
"In conclusion, the European neighbourhood policy is an opportunity for the Union, not an onerous duty."
"We would do well to remember this."
"Mr President, we all firmly believe that the European neighbourhood policy is a key element in the development of a common foreign and security policy for the European Union."
"We are also aware that our neighbourhood policy needs to be such that it can be adapted to the needs of individual countries."
"After all, it will affect countries that are very different from each other, such as Morocco and Ukraine."
"We are also aware that whilst retaining the flexibility of this instrument we should not forget that we are dealing with two kinds of situations."
"It is worth highlighting this fact."
"There are situations where what is involved is deepening and broadening cooperation in areas such as energy and security, and moving on into other appropriate areas."
"The North African countries are a good example."
"We also have to deal with the situation in quite different countries such as Belarus and Syria, where we are confronted by dictatorships and undemocratic scenarios."
"The European neighbourhood policy should serve as an instrument through which we can press for the democratisation of those countries."
"We are pleased to note that the Tannock report responds to these challenges and it is therefore worthy of support."
"A very good point of departure is that this neighbourhood policy should not be perceived as an alternative to the future accession of these countries to the European Union."
"Nobody seriously believes countries like Moldova, Belarus or Ukraine will soon join the European Union."
"What is important, however, is to leave the door open to enable European countries to apply for membership pursuant to the treaties."
"We also call for Amendment 55 and Amendment 52 tabled by Mr Klich to be supported."
"Amongst other things, they entail referring to the Belarussian regime as what it is, namely an undemocratic regime."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this resolution on the European neighbourhood policy."
"It comprehensively covers all the priorities set by Parliament for this policy: human rights, democracy, immigration, the environment and free trade."
"However, one vital subject is completely missing: development cooperation."
"Let me remind you that, of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood policy, 12 are developing countries, and a third of those are regarded as low-income countries."
"The current reform of the external action instruments means that these 12 developing countries will not be covered by the future cooperation and development instrument."
"As a result, if the neighbourhood policy does not include a development policy, these 12 countries will no longer get any development assistance from us."
"I find it regrettable, however, that a text with as general and broad a political focus as this one makes no reference to cooperation."
"We cannot reasonably talk about increasing the prosperity of a region without, at the same time, making a commitment to eradicating poverty."
"Are the basic needs of the people of Azerbaijan, Moldova or Palestine currently being met?"
"How can these countries fight dictatorship and be competitive in the market economy when some of their people do not even have access to drinking water, social services, healthcare and basic education?"
"How do we expect to achieve the Millennium Development Goals if we cannot even combat poverty on our own doorstep?"
"As I see it, adopting a resolution on the neighbourhood policy that chooses to overlook the objective of eradicating poverty would be a serious error of judgment for which, unfortunately, we would have to bear responsibility in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to speak as Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and of the Delegation to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"I was sorry to see paragraph 43 of the report, which rather churlishly lumps these countries in with the rest of our neighbours and/or puts them on a par with Andorra and the Vatican State."
"Sadly, it is not the first time that has happened in this Parliament."
"By my amendment I wanted at the very least to refer to EEA-EFTA."
"Indeed, we should appreciate that our own Member States are members of the EEA."
"This is a close and deep relationship which already entails full participation in the internal market and other EU programmes."
"Further, the EEA-EFTA countries are in fact already our partners and fellow contributors in building democracy and other activities within our new neighbours."
"I think Mr Tannock will understand a British footballing analogy."
"Whilst these countries do not currently aspire to the Premiership, to be full members, they are currently in the Championship and certainly not down at the bottom somewhere in the Conference League."
"I believe we hope to repeat a meeting with the EEA-EFTA Foreign Ministers and our Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I hope my amendment will save some embarrassment about the way we perceive our oldest and closest partners and neighbours and also about our understanding of EEA-EFTA."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we too welcome Mr Tannock's report, and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Laschet quite particularly for his previous work."
"An important point in this report is undoubtedly point 4, which once again states that it must be ensured that there are stimuli for democratic reform and that economic development is promoted."
"The EU must pay closer attention than in the past to ensuring that the democracy clauses in our agreements with third countries are taken seriously, and that they have consequences – both positive and negative."
"The report refers in this connection to an effective monitoring mechanism."
"It would be a major step forward if we could establish the Fundamental Rights Agency that we are going to discuss here on another occasion, as it would give us an instrument with which we could effectively assess the situation in the partner countries."
"However, it is also the case that the bilateral approach that the European neighbourhood policy has been following since 2003, which we expressly support, can do justice to the variety of countries."
"We must not forget, though, that there is another approach: the Barcelona Process with its regional approach."
"We would be well advised to treat them as complementary and – in order to forge a homogeneous policy for the European Union – to combine the strengths of both approaches."
"I would also like to refer particularly to the field of migration policy, which unfortunately currently plays no part in the Barcelona Process."
"We would be well advised to discuss this matter with the southern Mediterranean countries."
"We all remember the terrible images from Ceuta and Melilla, which affected us in the European Union."
"We obviously need to discuss issues of borders, readmission agreements and asylum procedures. At the same time, though, we also need to talk about the humane treatment of refugees and to improve the overall situation in these countries."
"I am delighted that the European Union is strengthening its activities regarding education. We must do a lot more in this field."
"I am thinking in particular of the young people in the countries to the south of the Mediterranean, who must be given a chance for future participation in their countries."
"Only if young people have opportunities in their own countries will they stay there and use their knowledge to improve the welfare and democratic organisation of their societies."
"Finally, I would like to remind you of the situation in Egypt."
"We are all aware of the detention of the opposition politician Aiman Nur, and I think that I speak for all of us when I express our solidarity with him, and with everybody else campaigning for democracy and human rights there, at times under difficult conditions."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs drafted by Mr Tannock is thorough in many respects."
"It contains many views in politically delicate areas for which nobody needs to take responsibility."
"The report has been produced on the committee’s own initiative in an area in which the European Parliament has no competence."
"The report reflects the trend where hope of help and support has to be given to countries not in the Union."
"That way there is a desire to bind the countries included in the neighbourhood policy, many of which are not neighbours of the EU, to the Union politically."
"The report’s position on which countries may accede to the European Union is not clear."
"One does not want to tell Ukraine, for example, that it is not eligible or that is eligible, even though Ukraine is a much more European country than Turkey."
"In actual fact, Ukrainian membership in the long term is such a long way off that it is not in sight at all."
"For what are very flimsy reasons, the report includes mentions of the EU Constitution instead of reflecting on how membership of the Union might be approached via, and from the point of view of, a structure such as the European Economic Area."
"A corrupt administration is part of daily life in many neighbouring countries."
"It would, for example, be interesting to know who owns Ros-Ukr-Energo, which administers the gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine."
"Can even the President of Ukraine be innocent regarding that issue?"
"Since the ‘orange revolution’ Ukraine has been an example of corrupt government."
"Azerbaijan, for example, or Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which are where the original sources of gas and oil are located further east, should also be assessed from this standpoint of state abuse, just as Belarus is, and not just from the viewpoint of gas and oil deliveries."
"Mr President, the European neighbourhood policy calls for the consolidating of democracy and the rule of law in the EU's neighbouring countries."
"How can the EU seriously consolidate democracy in non-EU countries when the central driving force of EU membership is itself the inexorable removal of any real, meaningful, democratic accountability in its Member States?"
"How can the EU seriously call for the extension of the rule of law in non-member countries when the EU itself ignores its own laws?"
"I speak, of course, of the proposed EU Constitution which should be dead under Treaty law because of the 'no' votes in the French and Dutch referendums."
"Instead, however, the Constitution is being kept on a life-support machine until the inconvenience of democratic rejection can be overcome by some underhand means."
"Mr Tannock would do better to concern himself with the interests of those he was elected to represent rather than those who did not elect him."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Tannock provides excellent testimony to the problem and to the European Union’s capacities to enforce its own interests and policies in the geopolitical area surrounding the European Union."
"Of course, a democratic, stable and prosperous neighbouring country is the best guarantee of development and security."
"As the author of the report states with good reason, however, the EU neighbourhood policy ought to be made more effective through increased precision in the criteria for its objectives, priorities and evaluation."
"In implementing the European neighbourhood policy, the experience of the new EU Member States ought to be utilised in encouraging reforms in the Caucasus, Ukraine and Moldova."
"The report states, with good reason, that the success of the neighbourhood policy in individual countries is dependent on relations between the European Union and Russia."
"However, it is difficult to believe that a Russia thinking in terms of the old geopolitical categories will prove a trustworthy ally."
"In fact, the invitation to achieve the democratisation of Belarus together with Russia seems comical even."
"It is a well-known fact that with every day that passes the Putin regime is moving further and further away from being a democratic administration and is becoming authoritarian."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the bilateral dialogues between Mr Putin and Mr Schröder, Mr Putin and Mr Blair and Mr Putin and Mr Chirac are unfortunately fulfilling Russia’s desire to negotiate with a fragmented European Union."
"This is bringing about a retreat from the principles and requirements of the EU neighbourhood policy."
"Balancing Russia’s and Ukraine’s gas prices in line with Turkmenistan’s so-called cheap gas is a monopolistic provision, and not the action of the market."
"I am worried."
"It is difficult to understand why, at a time when Russia’s economy is growing, the cofinancing share contributed by Russia itself within the framework of the European Union, the Northern Dimension, the Global Partnership and the programmes for decommissioning weapons of mass destruction is not increasing."
"The report, however, mentions the judicious and effective use of the neighbourhood policy’s resources."
"It really is worth taking the greatest pains in the development of regional and sub-regional dimensions."
"It is worth reflecting upon the significance of the geographical, historical and political aspects of Eastern Europe in creating a reliable European Union neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, I do not think it detracts in any way from Mr Tannock’s work when we conclude that this European neighbourhood policy, in fact, represents an enormous missed opportunity for the Commission, namely to ensure, as a matter of priority indeed, that our neighbouring country Turkey is included in that policy, occupying, as it should, first place and a very privileged one at that."
"It should be clear by now that the majority of our European citizens are categorically opposed to Turkey’s fully-fledged EU accession, and that it would therefore be very undemocratic to simply ignore this emphatic non-approval."
"I would like to remind you again that Turkey is not a European country, not in a geographical, historical, religious or in any other way."
"Turkey is a neighbouring country, though, with which we want the best relations and which could have easily played an important, and most prominent, part in the European neighbourhood policy."
"That is, therefore, a missed opportunity, and a mistake which will sooner or later cost us dearly."
"I should like to add one more observation to the report’s considerations about our relations with the Maghreb countries."
"I regret the omission of one very important aspect, that being the recent statement by the Moroccan Government calling for a re-immigration policy, for a return of a large section of the 2.5 million Moroccans who are currently based in Europe, the young people of whom, as you know, either face 40% unemployment or else end up being looked after by the state in another way."
"That is an extremely important about-turn on the part of the Moroccan Government, and one that we Europeans should actively support, not least by our neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, links with neighbours are extremely important to both people and countries."
"Relations with neighbouring countries are also important to the European Union."
"They must be positive relations framed within the objective of creating a circle of countries around the Union that are peaceful, prosperous, respectful of human rights and stable and that share our principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"Achieving that circle is necessary to the Union’s interests, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged."
"With globalisation and interdependence, it is clear that no wall can isolate the European Union from its closest neighbour countries; hence the importance of an active and generous neighbourhood policy."
"As the report by Mr Tannock indicates – and I thank him warmly for his work – I believe that specific neighbourhood policies must be differentiated essentially according to the neighbouring country in question."
"The difference must not depend on the continent to which the country belongs; if that were the case, we would be giving the impression that we have one first-class neighbourhood policy and another second-class one for the non-European neighbouring Mediterranean countries."
"That would be a mistake, since many of these Mediterranean countries have very close and long-standing relations with the Union, closer and more long-standing than those that the Union has with several European countries which are also subject to the neighbourhood policy."
"In accordance with our commitments, these Mediterranean countries hope to achieve the closest possible relations with the Union."
"Furthermore, they need greater cooperation from us in order to remedy their backwardness in the fields of institutional democratic development, economic and social growth and so forth."
"A closer European neighbourhood policy, however, also involves promoting reforms geared towards democracy, respect for human rights and the market economy."
"There must also be progress in fields such as economic openness, border control, and cooperation in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration."
"It is clear that progress in these fields will benefit the neighbouring countries in question as well as the whole of the region."
"Mr President, I would like to make an additional comment."
"I very much regret that, at the Barcelona Summit of last November, the level of attendance by our neighbours from the South of the Mediterranean was so disappointing."
"I believe that they have squandered a perfect opportunity to demonstrate their interest in enhancing their relations with the Union."
"Despite this disappointment, however, we must look to the future and to the Union’s strategic imperatives."
"This means that we must prioritise our relations with our neighbours, not just for their benefit, but for our own as well."
"– Mr President, I too wish for my part to thank Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and to highlight the particularly positive contribution by my honourable friend Mr Tannock to the wording of the final text."
"I should like to mention certain matters, on developments in which the implementation of the ambitious objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy will depend."
"Firstly, there can be no reliable European Neighbourhood Policy without a balanced geographical approach."
"We must do everything we can to prevent the Member States from taking a customer-orientated approach on the basis of their individual national interests."
"The basic precondition for the efficacy of the neighbourhood policy is the political will of the Member States to make use of the mechanisms for which provision is made for the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms."
"The negative experience in this sector from the Barcelona process should make us all wiser."
"The neighbourhood policy needs to be combined with the implementation of the European security strategy, especially in the sectors of combating international terrorism, organised crime, energy security and environmental challenges."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy should not produce overlaps or create confusion as to the European prospects and the future integration into the European Union of the Balkan countries."
"Relations with the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process also need to be defined with greater clarity."
"Greater coordination and better cooperation are needed with the international financing organisations for the implementation of action programmes."
"More reliable financial planning in 2006 is needed for the adoption of the relevant regulation on the new financing mechanism."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy needs to develop in a process with the participation of the citizens and of third country communities."
"Regional cooperation and the integration and strengthening of regional customs union also need to be developed and extended."
"The crucial international energy situation is such that the European Union needs to harmonise and integrate its energy markets with those of the neighbourhood policy countries."
"To close, I wish to emphasise the need for negotiations on the adoption of action programmes with the countries of the South Caucasus to be speeded up, especially negotiations with Georgia."
"Particular account should be taken of the human rights situation and the situation of the Greek ethnic group in the Tsalka area of Georgia, where there are serious problems with both the human rights and property rights of the Greek community."
"Mr President, this is a very constructive and important report on one of the most important issues concerning the future of the EU."
"What kind of relations are we to have with neighbouring countries?"
"How are we to step up cooperation on issues in respect of which we have to cooperate, such as the fight against terrorism, environmental problems, security and energy?"
"How are we to help strengthen democracy and the rule of law in the countries in our vicinity?"
"My view is that, in the present situation, we should not define Europe’s borders."
"Those European countries that are able and willing to fulfil all the criteria should be given clear prospects of membership."
"We have seen what this has meant for the transformation of our new Member States."
"For them, EU membership has operated as a carrot and stick, and it has been extremely important to their transformation."
"Membership is also incredibly important to democratisation and the process of reform in the Balkans and Turkey."
"My view is, therefore, that we should give Ukraine the prospect of membership."
"Naturally, the EU cannot expand to just any size, which is why the neighbourhood policy may offer an alternative to membership."
"In that case, it must, however, offer an attractive alternative."
"Parliament’s message is clear on this point."
"We need further to specify and define what we are to do with the policy."
"What are our priorities to be?"
"Can we resolve the institutional issues that will arise in connection with these countries?"
"Common values and common policy areas are needed."
"Furthermore, the cooperation agreements must be tailored to individual needs because, as has been pointed out, there are incredible differences from one country to the next."
"The focus must be on the issues relating to democracy."
"The transitional or democracy fund proposed by Mr Tannock is a very good idea."
"Again, I wish to thank my fellow Member, Mr Tannock, for a very constructive report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if we want the neighbourhood policy to be a real success, we must have full cooperation from our neighbours."
"From this point of view, I would like to draw your attention, a few weeks after the Barcelona summit, to the fact that most of the Mediterranean heads of state or government boycotted that summit, even those who are our partners under the neighbourhood policy."
"I feel it is important for the Commission and the Council to draw their own conclusions from the attitude of the partner countries and to take care not to produce the same results in the context of the neighbourhood policy."
"This boycott was in part a demonstration of the disapproval of the partner countries of, firstly, the considerable pressure placed on them by the Commission and the Member States to conclude cooperation agreements on migration policies and on the fight against terrorism and, secondly, the lack of budgetary prospects for the implementation of a true cooperation and development policy."
"Can we be sure that the European Union has learnt all its lessons from that?"
"All of the action plans that have so far been negotiated as part of the neighbourhood policy include sections on cooperation in securing the European Union's borders: the fight against terrorism and against illegal immigration."
"It is unacceptable for the European Union to pursue this policy aiming to make our neighbours take on the role of policing our borders."
"It is unacceptable because the partner countries do not support it and because the European Parliament has already been very clear in its condemnation of this trend."
"But were we consulted at any stage of the negotiation of these national action plans?"
"In order to be successful, the European Union's policy must be reciprocal, in other words it must respond to the interests of both sides."
"It is also important for the European Union's policy to be consistent."
"We cannot, for example, ask our neighbours to conclude readmission agreements, while certain Member States do not respect the provisions of the Geneva Convention."
"Nor can we, on the one hand, encourage them to respect human rights and democratic principles and, on the other, close our eyes to flagrant breaches of those rights and principles committed in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"With regard to human rights, the Commission is negotiating the setting up of 'human rights and democracy' subcommittees."
"These are important forums for evaluating our effectiveness in this regard."
"I therefore find it regrettable that the European Union is not making of an more effort to set up such subcommittees with certain states, such as Israel, for example."
"Thank you, Mr Tannock, for an excellent report dealing with the relations of the European Union with its neighbours and the creation of a ring of friends around the European Union."
"In helping our neighbours we are, in fact, helping ourselves."
"The ring comprises countries that do not aspire to EU membership but are keen on close cooperation with the EU, as well as other countries that would like to become members but are as yet unable to meet the criteria for becoming candidate countries."
"It is commendable that association agreements and action plans have been signed with these countries, and that these countries are committed to taking all the necessary steps to participate in the EU’s internal market and are harmonising their legislation with that of the EU."
"As we review the implementation of these agreements several years on, it appears that some of the goals were ambitious but not realistic."
"The EU is offering substantial financial assistance to the countries covered by the neighbourhood policy."
"It is, however, necessary to oversee compliance with other important provisions of the agreements, dealing with respect for human rights."
"The violation of these provisions can lead to the suspension or cessation of financial assistance."
"It seems that these provisions exist only on paper and that the countries in question continue to receive financial assistance in spite of blatant human rights violations."
"I therefore urge the improvement of compliance monitoring in this field."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I want to say that Mr Tannock’s report on the European neighbourhood policy is a document I fully support, and I can only congratulate him on his excellent work."
"His report shows that he is very familiar with European history and the current lie of the land."
"It is only those who are knowledgeable about the past who can also respond to the challenges of tomorrow."
"The conditions under which he has worked have not, however, always been easy, for the European neighbourhood policy now extends to include, on the one hand, European countries that are entitled to apply for membership and that may become EU Member States and, on the other hand, non-European countries that cannot become EU Member States."
"In my personal opinion, the neighbourhood policy should only apply to countries that are neighbours of Europe."
"Countries that are European and that wish to accede to membership should not be regarded as neighbours but as potential EU Member States and should be given clear prospects of joining the EU."
"Moreover, the debate on these issues has recently shifted considerably."
"When we talk about the European neighbourhood policy, we are speaking about a long-term perspective."
"As for a short-term perspective, there is often no such thing."
"Does this mean that opinion both within and outside Parliament has changed, or do we lack political courage?"
"A year ago, for example, the view regarding Ukraine was that it had very clear prospects of EU membership and that there was no doubt whatsoever that it belonged to the European family."
"We all remember the many orange-coloured scarves to be seen in this Assembly in support of Ukraine’s democratisation process."
"Had the issue of the status of negotiations for Ukrainian membership been discussed at that time, I am quite convinced that there would not have been so many who would have opposed that country’s membership."
"Today, the situation is different."
"Certainly, we still tell Ukraine that we wish to see it become an EU Member State, but we emphasise that this will take some time and that it should not be in a hurry."
"Turning now to another state, the situation in Belarus resembles that of a dictatorship and is anything other than satisfactory."
"Its road to possible EU membership will be a long one."
"In spite of this, I believe that, alongside our calls for democratisation, we should send out clear signals that, when it one day becomes democratic, Belarus too will have its place in the European family."
"What I am looking for, both in the neighbourhood policy and in the European debate generally, are visions and optimism."
"Without optimism and clearly expressed desires regarding what we want to bring about and what kind of Europe we want to see in the future, shall we rise to today’s challenges, either."
"– Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Tannock on his report on the new European neighbourhood policy, which is set to be one of the EU’s most strategically important instruments, not least from the point of view of global security, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to whom I also wish to pay tribute, pointed out."
"There is no point in the Union shutting itself inside a fortress behind its borders to protect itself from such dangers as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and the trafficking of women and children."
"No matter how high the walls, there will always be a way around them, Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla being dramatic illustrations."
"Good neighbourhood means enhanced mutual security for the neighbours concerned."
"Hence the importance of correctly implementing this new policy, which will enable us to support our neighbours by means of specific programmes with a direct influence on reinforced security – both their security and ours."
"By helping them to solve their security problems we will also be helping to extend the area of stability around us."
"Yet the south-western section of the security ring around Europe that this new policy seeks to build would be breached if Cape Verde were excluded from this instrument. To exclude Cape Verde would be to overlook its strong ties with Europe and its common border with the EU via the Canary Islands."
"This report needs to provide a solution whereby Cape Verde would be eligible for programmes under the scope of the European neighbourhood policy."
"The EU must not let Cape Verde become a weak link in its chain of neighbours."
"If it is able to enjoy the benefits of programmes within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy, Cape Verde will be able to play an important role in European and worldwide security."
"The authorities in Cape Verde must be helped to prevent their territory from becoming a platform for organised crime, illegal immigration and terrorism."
"Accordingly, with my group’s support, I have tabled two amendments, which I hope will be supported by the majority in Parliament."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that Mr Tannock’s outstanding report on the European neighbourhood policy has been written."
"It offers practical answers to problems that the EU must solve if it is to appease the anti-globalisation doom-mongers."
"It is simply not possible with every round of EU enlargement simply to shift the lines of latitude and longitude on the map of Europe and to mark out our territory in the sand; the same sand, incidentally, in which one may always bury one’s head, rather than face the problems of the world around us, including those of the EU’s neighbours."
"It is precisely this phenomenon, in my view, that the report addresses and attempts to solve."
"The European neighbourhood policy is about the offer of privileged relations between the EU and its nearest neighbours, supported by financial instruments such as TACIS and MEDA, which are to be replaced by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in 2007."
"On the other hand, however, the EU often seems unaware that it should not claim the right to dictate to neighbouring countries what they should and should not do, on the grounds that it is providing them with financial support, and I am not afraid to say this."
"We are not talking here about irresponsible or inferior countries and this is something that the Union often forgets, in its sometimes arrogant navel-gazing."
"The EU must fully respect its neighbours and not attempt to put pressure on them."
"This is the only way in which we can talk about good neighbourhood policy."
"We are talking about one of the core policies of the European Union, and I am pleased to be able to thank Mr Tannock for a very good report, and you, Commissioner, for ambition of the highest order."
"EU security is vitally dependent on the quality of democracy and economic development among our neighbours."
"I support the clearly expressed political will that we will not be satisfied with the status quo for pragmatic reasons, but will actively support the development of democracy, respect for human rights and the development of a social market economy on a permanent footing amongst neighbouring countries."
"I especially support the appeal to the Commission to establish clear criteria for assessing the political achievements of our neighbours, and I assume that respect of human rights will occupy a key position among these criteria."
"I must reiterate the exceptional importance of regional cooperation, as well as projects at a local level."
"Moreover, as part of any action programmes I would also like to see youth cooperation projects, and in particular projects aimed at the development of civil society."
"May I close with an expression of strong support for the opinion regarding the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"I firmly believe that the European Union can and must achieve more through the OSCE than it has to date, including in regions beyond the borders of our closest neighbours, and I have in mind in particular Central Asia."
"Thank you for your attention, and I hope that in future we might also strengthen the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that this very topical report has been completed."
"After the most recent enlargement, the European Union needs a determined and flexible neighbourhood policy more than ever."
"The European Commission must very clearly formulate the objectives and priorities of the neighbourhood policy, and the criteria for evaluating its success."
"The neighbourhood policy as it is presently being implemented is fading away."
"The countries covered by the policy are slipping into a grey area."
"As the leader of the delegation of the European Parliament, I have had to observe this course of events in Moldova."
"Moldova is a hostage of the Transnistria problem, a fact that we must not neglect."
"The Transnistria conflict is one of the most significant reasons for the slow rate of economic development in Moldova."
"Yet Europe, as is also noted in this report, has not taken full advantage of its strategic partnership with Russia to resolve the conflict."
"Today Chancellor Schüssel praised his government for its successful intervention in the Russian-Ukrainian gas problem."
"He was seconded in this praise by Mr Barroso."
"The fact that Moldova’s analogous problem has received no attention whatsoever, and as a result suffered a gas crisis that lasted for nearly three weeks, shows the inadequacy of the present neighbourhood policy."
"Ignoring a partner in the neighbourhood policy, ignoring a country in the middle of Europe with a population of four million is not a pattern of behaviour that the European Union should continue to practise."
"I support the rapporteur’s call to recognise the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova regarding accession to the European Union, and I welcome the demand to offer them the possibility of becoming members of the European Union; that is, when all three of the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled."
"The opportunity to obtain membership of the European Union is of the utmost importance for democratisation and economic reforms."
"That was the very argument that was emphasised in justifying the commencement of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"If we can give an opportunity to Turkey, whose population will soon be greater than that of Germany, then why can we not send a clear message to Ukraine, which is half that size, and Moldova, which has a twentieth of the population of Turkey?"
"In that sense the neighbourhood policy report is a generous exception in the European Union."
"Once again, many thanks to the rapporteur, and thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to Commissioner Verheugen for his work in securing the successful enlargement to include the Baltic States."
"Could Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in her reply to this debate, clarify an aspect which is somewhat confusing?"
"We talk about our 'neighbourhood policy', but Russia is a new neighbour of the European Union."
"Is Russia part of the neighbourhood policy or do we have an EU/Russia policy that is distinct?"
"George Orwell, one of my countrymen, wrote a book called and he used the expression: 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.'"
"I hope that the European Union Member State governments do not share that view but rather subscribe to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to the idea that there will be no bilateral negotiations with any of our neighbours."
"An American poet, Robert Frost, talking about neighbourhood, said that: 'Good fences make good neighbours.'"
"I hope that Russia will very soon find itself in a position to be able to ratify the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia."
"It is very difficult, however strong our view about good relations may be, if not only Member State frontiers but our own EU borders are not recognised by a neighbour."
"Perhaps the Commissioner might be able to comment on the progress made with President Putin and his colleagues towards agreement on what must be a fairly fundamental issue."
"We are obviously investing a great deal with our Russian colleagues and friends, but unless they recognise our fences, it is surely very difficult for us to have that mutual sense of confidence and trust."
"Two minutes is not a great deal of time to discuss this vitally important subject, but I would refer colleagues to paragraph 1 of Mr Tannock's excellent report, which says that the European Parliament 'declares that the aim of privileged neighbourhood relations with the EU's neighbours includes, as an essential precondition, an active and concrete commitment to common values in the fields of the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the principles of a transparent social market ...'."
"I hope that President Putin may find time to read at least paragraph 1 of Mr Tannock's report."
"– Mr President, I too wish to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Tannock, for their integrated positions."
"There is no doubt that the European neighbourhood policy is a successful policy."
"However, the time has come, I think, for us to consider whether it perhaps needs to acquire an institutional basis."
"My proposal is specific and refers to the following: all these states which are today taking part in the European neighbourhood policy should form a commonwealth, an improved version of the British Commonwealth."
"In this way, the European Union would create around it a large zone of peace, freedom and prosperity."
"In this regime, in this commonwealth, customs union will be valid for all the countries, but citizens will not be free to relocate to the countries of the European Union or to participate in the Community decision-making institutions or the single currency."
"This special relationship will offer economic and other advantages in sectors such as infrastructures, energy, the environment and transport, which will constitute incentives for joining the commonwealth."
"The institution of the commonwealth may develop into a valuable reserve solution in the event that the full integration of a country into the European Union encounters serious obstacles."
"It could also be the way in which the countries on the periphery of Europe will converge more quickly with Europe."
"It would create a zone of European-orientated countries and would resolve once and for all the dilemma between the constant enlargement and the deepening of the European Union."
"At the same time, it will deflate in good time many of the problems within Europe and will head off new dilemmas and new polarisations in the Union before they damage its unity."
"It will unite us and will strengthen us at the same time, without any significant cost and with far less risk."
"Mr President, this evening’s debate in the House concerns one of the most important challenges facing the European Union."
"I refer to the development of a Neighbourhood Policy that will enable the area of security, democracy, political freedom and economic development in the contemporary world to be broadened in the immediate vicinity of the European Union."
"The European Union has become a global player, always on the basis of its principles such as respect for peace, the quest for compromise, plus the defence of human rights and of a liberal democracy."
"In particular, it is engaged in an effort to promote democracy in countries in North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe."
"It should be noted that this policy involves a whole network of reciprocal political, economic, scientific and cultural links."
"I should like to draw attention to the human rights aspect of the European neighbourhood policy."
"Societies struggling against the lack of democracy and respect for human rights in their countries perceive the European Union as a partner and as a guarantor of democratic processes."
"The European neighbourhood policy should take into account the aspirations of societies in those countries."
"It should support civil society and assist with visa policies."
"It should also bring about a genuine opening up of the European Research Area to include countries outside the European Union."
"Finally, the European neighbourhood policy should not become an obstacle to European countries hoping to seek membership of the Union in the future."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days and weeks there has been much talk about Europe’s energy dependence on outside sources."
"EU Member States remain largely dependent on supplies of crude oil and natural gas from the countries covered in this report, such as Russia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and Azerbaijan, as well as other countries in transition, such as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia, across which flow these supplies of strategically important raw materials."
"In this regard, I should like to turn to one aspect of the neighbourhood policy to which we have yet to pay sufficient attention, namely regional cooperation."
"I am of the opinion that the neighbourhood policy should not be based solely on the consolidation of bilateral relations, but rather on regional cooperation between these countries on an economic, cultural and political level."
"If we look, for example, at individual regions such as the Southern Caucasus, we see that such cooperation is either fraught with problems, or does not actually exist at all."
"And yet the existence of good neighbourly relations, involving regional cooperation between the countries around us, is one of the preconditions for fulfilling the aims of the neighbourhood policy, not least in order to ensure energy supplies to EU countries."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission to place greater emphasis than it has done hitherto on boosting regional cooperation and on solving regional conflicts, when implementing the individual practical stages of the neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I really admire your physical capacity."
"I address that comment to Mr Tannock too."
"The last round of EU enlargement dramatically changed the European external dimension."
"Enlargement took place and we introduced the European neighbourhood policy."
"Today's ENP makes me think of NATO's Partnership for Peace and enlargement."
"The Copenhagen European Council set out the criteria for enlargement and ten countries were ultimately admitted."
"The process lacked concept, planning and project management."
"Let us not repeat the same mistake."
"Point 1: Let us say that enlargement is enlargement."
"The ENP should be everything but enlargement."
"Let us speak about the ENP."
"Point 2: We also need privileged partnerships."
"Every power in history has had special relations."
"The EU needs them as well."
"A special, new 'A minus' category should be clearly defined."
"We all know that, for security, energy, economic, trade and even social, cultural and political reasons, there are already countries with which we have and need special relations, yet they will never – in the foreseeable future – become members of the EU."
"Let us call that system the ENP."
"Point 3: The biggest mistake is the current situation: We do not speak about the ENP; we speak about whether or not the Balkans, Ukraine and Turkey – with or without a clear set of criteria – should be eligible for enlargement."
"Clearly, the ENP must be dissociated from the names of countries, and concepts and criteria should be introduced."
"Point 4: Criteria."
"Geographical criteria should be discussed on the basis of the Treaty."
"Not all eligible countries have the capacity to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"We cannot lie to ourselves as regards the full respect of individual human rights, equal economic opportunities, full liberalisation and privatisation."
"We should concern ourselves with defining the 'A minus' Copenhagen criteria."
"Only if we are serious and transparent can we upgrade the region."
"Point 5: Institutions and our capacity."
"Four freedoms should be analysed."
"The free movement of goods is acceptable but the free movement of people should be limited, as should the free movement of capital, but not the free movement of services."
"Transparency and accountability are the cornerstone of stability, understanding and the fight against frustration, extremism and radicalism."
"Let us be open, transparent and logical."
"We will all be secure and prosperous as a result."
"– Mr President, I should like to make clear my wholehearted support for Mr Tannock’s outstanding report and also the Commissioner’s excellent, practical neighbourhood policy."
"Nevertheless, I cannot and shall never accept certain concepts."
"What do the ancestors of many western Ukrainians have in common with the ancestors of the Commissioner or myself, of Mrs Hybášková or Mr Rouček, of Mr Peterle or of many others in this room?"
"They were citizens of a Central European state called Austria-Hungary."
"No one has yet been able to give me a rational explanation as to why some of these citizens should suddenly be Western Europeans and others Eastern Europeans, or why, indeed, some of them – as some people thoughtlessly say – should suddenly be Europeans and others Europe’s neighbours."
"The neighbourhood and enlargement policies, like economic policy, need the concept of regulatory policy."
"The fact is that Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova are unambiguously European countries – as are the South-East European countries that we curiously label ‘Western Balkans’."
"All of these must ultimately be given the prospect of full membership of the European Union, even if we currently know that, for some, such as Ukraine, Belarus or Moldova, this is a very long way off."
"For this reason, the European neighbourhood policy makes perfect sense as a staging post."
"We must simply distinguish here, however, between those for whom this policy represents the prospect of European membership, on the one hand, and those with whom we wish to have permanent associations as neighbours, such as the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, on the other."
"In this regard, I very much liked the remark by Mr Özdemir of the Greens today that we need greater interlinking of the Barcelona process and the Mediterranean countries with the European neighbourhood policy, as our Mediterranean policy will have to be a neighbourhood policy in the classical sense in the long run."
"That is why, today, we have to come to terms with the concepts and categories as they are currently set out."
"We should not lose sight of the realities of the situation, however, or a rude awakening is in store, something of which we saw chilling signs this winter in the form of the situation between Russia and Ukraine."
"Mr President, in crisis situations like the one that arose recently when Moscow turned off gas supplies to Ukraine and Moldova, the European neighbourhood policy ought to play a key role and provide a formula for creating a common vision of European Union policy."
"Gas has become a means of exerting political pressure, so one of the priorities for European neighbourhood policy has to be to participate in a dialogue on energy with third countries, and become involved in the organisation of trans-European energy networks."
"The most important reserves of oil and natural gas in the world are located in areas surrounding the European Union."
"Many of the Union’s neighbours are producer or transit countries."
"There is therefore considerable scope for action in the context of a policy aimed at the creation of a friendly zone around the Union."
"Action to date in this regard has proved unsatisfactory."
"I could mention the political consent to the construction of the northern European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea."
"Not only is this system detrimental to the interests of Member States, in the longer term it will have a negative impact on countries beyond the European Union’s Eastern border affected by our neighbourhood policy."
"I refer to countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and to the countries of the Southern Caucasus."
"European decision-makers failed to react decisively on this matter."
"This meant that a strategic decision was taken over the heads of several Member States, with negative repercussions for a number of transit countries."
"I would be grateful if the Commissioner would comment on the matter and make her views clear."
"The European neighbourhood policy must become an effective tool for the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law in countries close to the European Union."
"It must also encourage change in countries where there is no effective democracy."
"The activities of democratic movements in neighbouring countries should be supported, by facilitating access to independent media and information."
"The European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights can play an important role in this regard."
"In a flexible and effective manner, this instrument ought to be able to support initiatives to promote parliamentary democracy."
"I would remind the House that this is the only external Union instrument that does not require the consent of the recipient country."
". Mr President, first of all I should like to greet my colleague Mr Verheugen, who is behind the neighbourhood policy."
"It is a happy coincidence that he is here today."
"Secondly, I should like to repeat that I am very appreciative of the very broad support for the report by Mr Tannock and for the neighbourhood policy."
"It is indeed a very broad policy and it was therefore a broad discussion."
"This is a policy directed towards the EU’s neighbours in the East, but also towards its neighbours in the Mediterranean."
"I will come to that in a moment."
"On the European perspective, it is clear that the neighbourhood policy is one that is distinct from enlargement, but at the same time I should also say that the future is not set in stone."
"At this stage we have a policy totally distinct from enlargement."
"I could not be clearer in distinguishing and defining that policy."
"There is also a regional perspective."
"This is very clear, for instance, in the Mediterranean process, Euromed."
"It is regional and the neighbourhood policy is the bilateral, complementary part of it, so the two work together."
"For instance, we have always very strongly supported the south-south Agadir Cooperation between the countries."
"Naturally, with regard to the East, that aspect can still be broadened."
"There is still a lot to be done."
"However, I can also tell you that during the energy crisis the regional dimension was also apparent."
"We have also very much enhanced, helped and encouraged Ukraine to help Moldova in the very times it has experienced recently."
"In the energy field as a whole we are trying to work towards an integrated energy market."
"In the Mashreq there is an integrated gas market."
"There is also the cooperation between Palestine and Israel, which is at least aimed at more effective integration."
"Let me answer a few specific questions. Many have been asked here."
"First, the inclusion of the southern Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy – something originally demanded by the European Parliament – is very welcome."
"The report suggests fully utilising the ENP to promote inter-state confidence building."
"That is very important."
"It is crucial for the southern Caucasus countries to create stability."
"I agree with everyone who has said that we have to promote and reinforce the currently-frozen conflict solution in those countries."
"That is what we are trying to do."
"The development of the ENP, as regards the southern Caucasus, remains a high priority."
"You all know that technical missions have been going to those countries in order to negotiate the action plans, notably because we also want to contribute to regional stability and reinforce EU support for resolving the conflicts there."
"We know that this will take time, but it is highly important that we are fully engaged in it."
"Another question referred to Belarus."
"To date the Commission has been represented through its delegation in Kiev, which is accredited to Belarus."
"I have requested, as a first stage, that a regionalised delegation mission be established in Belarus, headed by a chargé d’affaires under the head of mission of Kiev."
"I am still awaiting a positive reply from the Belarusian authorities."
"However, my understanding is that if we have a delegation there then we can work much more closely with the government in Minsk and try to reinforce our own criteria."
"Many of you will know that our assistance to Belarus is characterised by a two-track approach."
"There is also a strategy for more democratisation and human rights to meet the needs of the population at large, and a decentralised programme."
"That means new funding for support to democratisation, which is available under the EIDHR and direct work, for instance as regards the radio station and the possibility of directly influencing information through our independent broadcasting to Belarus."
"That is already under way."
"But we are also working for higher education and for training, if you bear in mind the closure of the university in Minsk and our work in Vilnius."
"The whole question of the Transnistrian conflict has been mentioned."
"In line with the commitment in the action plan, we have taken a much higher profile in supporting the mediation process."
"Since October 2005 we have tried to work, together with the US, as observers."
"We now have a special representative for Moldova, Ambassador Jacobovits de Szeged, who is working for a solution to the Transnistrian conflict."
"In this connection we set up the Moldovan-EU border assistance mission on 1 December."
"It is designed to assist Moldova and Ukraine in ensuring transparent management of their common border, thus stepping up cooperation on border issues and trying to combat corruption and the misleading of customs."
"I disagree with those who say that the Barcelona Summit was a failure."
"I really regret the media reports about Barcelona."
"I was there from the very beginning until the very end."
"I can tell you that Barcelona was excellent in its substance."
"There is a report on migration."
"Please read it."
"There is a common position on combating terrorism."
"There is the substance that the Commission, in our communication, brought forward in April."
"One should look at why various heads of state did not attend."
"For instance, it may have been somewhat difficult for the King of Morocco to go to Spain because of the differences they still have."
"King Abdullah II of Jordan had to change his government."
"President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria was in a hospital in Paris and still is, as far as I know."
"President Mubarak had just had elections in Egypt and was not in the best of conditions to go to Barcelona."
"However, many prime ministers attended and it is they who have to implement policy."
"Twinning and TAIEX, the two excellent instruments that have helped the enlargement countries a great deal, are also there for the neighbourhood countries, and we will use them."
"There were many other questions, but I cannot go into more detail now owing to time constraints."
"However, if those questions are raised again in the Committee on Foreign Affairs then I would be pleased to answer them."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order, the number of which will be familiar to your aides, about supplementary questions following a debate."
"The Commissioner was not able to answer the question as to whether or not the EU/Russia policy and the neighbourhood policy are allied."
"I would refer the Commissioner to paragraphs 16 and 26 of the Tannock Report."
"Perhaps she might give me a written reply."
". Mr President, I am very happy to answer that."
"I just thought that the debate was going on for too long."
"Russia is not in the normal ENP."
"We have a special financial instrument – ENPI – the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument."
"Why?"
"Because Russia is a huge country and feels it deserves a special strategic partnership."
"We have worked with Russia on the four common spaces, and for every summit we go through the agenda and the different questions, such as the one you mentioned on the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia."
"Other questions, such as on gas and energy, will certainly be important points."
"Those are bilateral issues of the countries with Russia."
"We have tried to facilitate those negotiations, but we have heard that for the time being those parties prefer to work on the issue themselves."
"I see at least some sort of progress, but I am cautious because it will take time."
"I did not forget to answer your question, but the debate was very long and there were so many interventions, all of them very valuable."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 January 2006 at 12 noon."
"– Neighbourhood policy needs to be a more open concept, not restricted merely to Mediterranean issues or to the EU’s eastern border."
"We must not forget that we have other neighbours on our Atlantic maritime borders."
"In light of their importance and their particular sensitivity in terms of European security, they also deserve special prominence in this context."
"Adjoining the outermost regions of the EU, adjacent to the European mainland, these insular countries are especially vulnerable to large-scale trafficking. This is dangerous for the countries themselves and in turn for our security and we must accordingly pay careful attention to these countries."
"There are those who say that Cape Verde already has its own framework in the African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) area. This is a blinkered view that does not take account of the reality of the situation."
"We must be able to define policies that interact with other frameworks, such as, , the ACP, in a manner that is fruitful, flexible and imaginative."
"We are duty bound to do this, and, in light of its people’s exemplary record on democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, not to mention their profound historical, social, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU, Cape Verde deserves this."
"I therefore call on Members to vote in favour of Amendments 11, 12, 36 and 38."
"– The next item is the report by Dominique Vlasto, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises (2005/2123(INI)) (A6-0405/2005)."
". Mr President, if I could only put forward one argument in defence of this report, it would be that there are around 25 million small enterprises in Europe, employing nearly 95 million people."
"They are the backbone of the European economy, a major breeding ground for jobs and growth, and we need to make the most of their potential."
"The European Charter for Small Enterprises is a symbol of their importance, and it is the only official document devoted entirely to them."
"This Charter has provoked many attacks from businessmen."
"Unfortunately, five years after it came into being, the results achieved are still very uneven and its implementation remains inadequate even though it has had some success among the professional organisations and 35 countries have signed it."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, these small businesses consider themselves to be the orphans of a Europe that cannot manage to provide them with a system of consultation, dialogue and work."
"Whether in my home town of Marseilles or elsewhere, the heads of small and craft enterprises see Europe as a machine producing costs and restrictions."
"For these executives, the internal market – which is, in fact, undoubtedly a success – is not an opportunity, it is an illusion."
"And if these business leaders do not have confidence in European policies, that is a real problem."
"It is quite clear that the regulatory framework we are creating is not a success if 98 % of businesses in the European Union feel that it does not work for their line of business."
"That is why the Charter needs to be an instrument that will enable us to regain the trust of small enterprises in Europe."
"Its implementation must enable us to assess the progress made by all the European states and institutions in improving the regulatory, financial and political environment in which small businesses operate."
"That is why we are calling for a more critical annual report."
"It is, however, regrettable that this year's annual monitoring report does not really make it possible to assess the progress made."
"We are calling for better implementation of the Charter, so as to make a significant contribution to the European Commission's essential commitment to better regulation."
"That is why we suggest, firstly, strengthening the implementation of the Charter by ensuring that its small and micro-businesses dimension is retained with actions specifically intended for them; greater involvement from the professional organisations; maintaining the dissemination of best practices and exchanges of good practice; and retaining a specific annual report on the Charter."
"We have no objection to a reflection on the implementation of the Charter, but we would ask you not to sacrifice the Charter for Small Enterprises by tying it into the Lisbon Strategy."
"This approach must remain complementary to and distinct from the other policies targeting SMEs and industry."
"This also recognises a reality that we need to take into account: small enterprises have specific needs and abilities that are different from those of businesses with 250 to 10 000 employees."
"This principle, as set out by the Commission, is that we must think about small enterprises."
"This commitment now needs to be translated into reality, because that is not always the case."
"If we look, for example, at the REACH proposal, we do not get the impression that this principle was applied."
"It was the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that introduced the adjustments and measures intended to make REACH applicable to and bearable for small enterprises."
"It is for the benefit of these small enterprises that I have once again stressed in my report the importance of simplifying legislation."
"We would ask you once again to institute a clear and precise method for performing impact assessments, particularly for the smaller SMEs."
"This defence of the Charter and of better regulation is at the heart of this report."
"It includes a number of other proposals from my fellow Members, and I would like to thank them for their positive contribution."
"What we propose is a complete work programme, first of all to get to know small businesses better, but above all to make progress in a number of fields, including taxation, aid for investment, innovation and research and so on."
"Mr President, I am not going to go into the details of the proposals made, but the Commission and the Member States will find in my report a source of inspiration for action."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, I am very much obliged to the rapporteur for her balanced reports and constructive proposals."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say a few quite fundamental words about the Commission’s policy for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"The rapporteur has just spoken of the ‘orphanage’ of SMEs in Europe."
"I myself use the expression ‘shadow existence’, and of course both expressions imply massive criticism: criticism of the fact that, even though there has been constant discussion of SMEs in the past, none of the European institutions has really done any serious work on improving their situation."
"I resolved to change that, and I am pleased to be able to tell you that last year saw a political breakthrough for European SME policy."
"Not only has there been recognition at all levels of the priority given by SMEs to growth and jobs but, at long last, serious work is now being done across the board on taking the necessary steps to enable SMEs to really fulfil their tremendous potential for growth and job creation."
"The achievement of Europe’s objectives – stable, sustainable growth and full employment – will only be possible with the help of SMEs."
"Large enterprises will not help us to achieve these objectives, as their tendency to cut jobs is also set to continue in future."
"For this reason, I do not quite agree with the rapporteur on one point."
"I differ fundamentally from her in that I am firmly convinced that it was not until the Charter policy was integrated into the new growth and jobs strategy that the policy for SMEs became top priority in Europe."
"I simply cannot understand how it is possible to say that large enterprises should have their place in this growth and jobs strategy but the smaller ones should not."
"In Europe, two-thirds of the workforce are employed by SMEs."
"It is not the large enterprises but the smaller ones that are the employers."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are at the heart of this strategy, which can only succeed if SMEs actually continue to be central."
"I really am firmly convinced that the clear improvement in the political environment for SMEs that has been achieved over the past year can be traced back directly to our having accorded this policy its rightful place in the European Union’s growth and employment policy."
"In the interim, the Member States have also reported on their national reform programmes in implementation of the new growth and employment policy."
"I am pleased to be able to tell you that more than half of the Member States have designated the policy for SMEs a priority in these national reform programmes."
"I do think that there is still room for improvement; we shall be reporting to Parliament on this in a few weeks’ time."
"For example, at least on occasion, a lack of detail on the measures taken is still evident, which could lead to an overly optimistic assessment, but this is just the start of the process, of course, and this process will become even more effective, and is, I believe, capable of succeeding."
"At any event, the Charter itself will be retained."
"Furthermore, it serves as a point of reference for the exchange of best practice and mutual learning."
"The main instrument, the annual Charter conferences, will be continued."
"Best practice in a selected number of SME policy areas will be presented at the annual Charter conference in Vienna on 13 and 14 June 2006."
"Since Parliament started work on its report, a few things have changed."
"On 10 November of last year, the Commission adopted its Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment; which would not have been necessary, of course, had I been convinced that the current policy is sufficient."
"The Commission Communication on a modern SME policy for growth and employment now constitutes the coherent framework for the various instruments of enterprise policy, and goes much further than the 10 lines for action in the Charter."
"The Communication emphasises the importance of SMEs in the context of Lisbon and establishes the ‘ principle for all EU policy fields."
"It also specifies the daily challenges faced by SMEs and proposes measures for enhancing their ability to grow and create jobs."
"The communication supports the European partnership for growth and jobs, which recognises the importance of promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Europe and creating a favourable political environment for SMEs."
"There are some special policy fields on which I should like to say just a few brief words."
"The Commission has adopted a communication on home state taxation, which it hopes will be carried through."
"That would help SMEs involved in international business."
"The Commission attaches the utmost importance to improving access to SME financing instruments, which is a fundamental problem."
"I shall do everything I can to ensure that, in the next financing period, too, the available resources are sufficient to enable the continuation of this successful project."
"The Commission is preparing an initiative to further entrepreneurship education in Europe."
"There is simply not enough entrepreneurial spirit in Europe; there are not enough people prepared to become entrepreneurs."
"This is not only a matter of economic conditions, but also of the cultural, social and political environment."
"Endeavours to arouse entrepreneurial spirit and impart the relevant knowledge must start in schools and universities."
"Finally, I should like to point out that we are also currently in the process of drawing up proposals to make it easier for SMEs to pass from one owner to another."
"In the years ahead, we shall see millions of cases where enterprises pass into new ownership, and failure to manage these correctly could put millions of jobs at risk."
"On the whole, we have reached a point at which the right ideas, plans and strategies need to be put into practice across the board."
"This is not primarily the responsibility of the European institutions: our options and means are limited."
"In essence, it is up to the Member States."
"For this reason, I would appeal to the Member States to increase still more their recognition of the opportunities and potential lying precisely in the promotion of SMEs."
". – Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Vlasto, for her integrated report and the Commissioner for the Commission's clear presentation relating to the subject of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, I should also like to welcome the initiative by the Austrian Presidency in immediately defining the European Charter for Small Enterprises, so that specialised initiatives and measures can be promoted to strengthen the competitiveness and employment in the European Union."
"The European Economic and Social Committee highlights certain financial and tax incentives in its opinion which could help small- and medium-sized enterprises to break into the economic area of competitiveness, research and technology and the mobility of workers: not fragmentary and dispersed mobility, mobility within the framework of a clear European social model."
"I should like at this point to refer to the question of relocations of large enterprises, which have a significant impact on turnover and employment in small- and medium-sized enterprises, given that many of them act as sub-contractors."
"I agree with the Austrian Presidency that, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, subsidised investments need to be promoted at regional level."
"Commissioner, small- and medium-sized enterprises live and work in the shadow of multinationals, of large chains, and in the shadow of bureaucracy."
"In order to address this state of affairs, I would point out that important horizontal, national and Community measures need to be taken, which will include:"
"Firstly, simplifying bureaucracy."
"Secondly, promoting a simplified general system of financial support for small- and medium-sized enterprises which will include new banking products."
"Thirdly, simplifying the tax liabilities of small- and medium-sized enterprises, taking account of the fact that the pilot plan for the taxation of small- and medium-sized enterprises in their country of establishment could help in this direction, with the ultimate objective of adopting a common, unified basis for taxation."
"Finally, strengthening incentives for the integration of innovation and research, on the basis of the proposals of the Commission itself on competitiveness and national aid and within the framework of the 7th research programme."
"We need to turn words into action."
". Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues I am delighted to welcome here the new SME Envoy."
"I speak today as a Vice-President of the SME circle here in Parliament, as well as the draftsman of the opinion on the Commission report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I am delighted to record that this opinion was not only passed unanimously in that committee, but that all its suggestions were incorporated into the final report by Mrs Vlasto which was also passed unanimously in the Committee on Industry."
"So I thank Mrs Vlasto for her cooperation and congratulate her on an excellent report."
"One might ask, then, why we are bothering to have a debate, especially at this very late hour, given this complete agreement on all sides of the House."
"I suggest that the answer is very simple: we do not want just a debate about SMEs, we want a debate that will lead to concrete action, and we want concrete action not just by Member States but also by the Commission."
"Commissioner, I welcome the comments you made elsewhere today that 2006 will be a year of delivery for SMEs."
"All of us want to help you deliver."
"We see ourselves as on the same side as you."
"I would just like to mention quickly three specific ideas."
"We want the voice of small businesses to be heard loudly, clearly and officially within the social dialogue, not to be drowned out by the larger social partners, as happens now."
"A concrete proposal has been promised."
"Can you please confirm when it will arrive, in what form it will arrive, and how we can help you to turn it into a reality when it does arrive?"
"Secondly, the Charter has proposed that SMEs should be exempted from certain regulatory obligations."
"Can you please confirm whether the Commission will lead by example in this respect and, if so, when we can expect some concrete proposals from the Commission on this issue too?"
"Finally, given that apparently there will be no more annual Charter reports from the Commission in future, how will the Commission ensure that issues facing SMEs remain increasingly front-of-mind within Member States, given the temptation for it to be weaker, rather than stronger?"
". – Mr President, firstly, I am obliged to Mrs Vlasto, who has demonstrated great commitment in her preparation of this report and has also brought out the key points very well."
"Chancellor Schüssel of the Austrian Presidency, who was here this morning, was himself once the secretary-general of an organisation for small- and medium-sized enterprises, which is why he is so familiar with the problems and knows the importance of doing more in this field."
"I am also very much obliged to Commissioner Verheugen, because the Charter report has, of course, considerably increased the focus on SMEs, and thus further increased the focus on efforts to promote this kind of enterprise."
"I believe that it is also good to regard this preliminary study – that is, the detailed, in-depth study that is being carried out in all the Member States – as a preliminary study on the Lisbon process, so as to give the Lisbon process, too, corresponding relevance."
"In this way, we know what needs to be done in the field of SMEs to show the non-governmental organisations, and ultimately also the Council and the Commission, where the strong and weak points lie."
"I consider it extremely important that the three pillars we have created here – ‘macro-economic’, ‘micro-economic’ and ‘employment’ – show clearly that, in the final analysis, SMEs account for 80% of taxes."
"A social Europe must keep the spotlight on this."
"We must look at where taxes are ultimately coming from and then, in future, reduce this burden on the enterprises and particularly the workers concerned, so that they can earn larger profits and higher salaries."
"At the same time, excise tax should make a corresponding contribution to tax revenue, because imports from low-wage countries represent a particularly great opportunity for us in this regard."
"The final point I should like to make is that I do not understand the reasons for the cuts in the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP), which puts the spotlight on entrepreneurship."
"In this connection, we should work with the Commission in the context of this proposal to restore the full amount that was given to the CIP programme under the original proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Vlasto’s report on the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises – a report that we endorse – reveals the main obstacles to development for small- and medium-sized enterprises, particularly fiscal, financial and bureaucratic obstacles."
"It also calls on the Commission to intervene with targeted Community measures because, as Mrs Vlasto has said, small enterprises still feel abandoned."
"The report recommends simplifying taxation systems; providing incentives for innovative enterprises; reducing the bureaucratic burden, especially during the start-up phase of small businesses, but not only then; providing easier access to credit; and exempting them from paying corporation tax on the European subsidies that they are granted."
"Unfortunately, the Commission report on the implementation of the Charter, which is the basis for this parliamentary report, contains a number of gaps: for instance, the data presented are not homogeneous and it is therefore difficult to compare situations referring to different countries."
"We should have preferred the Commission report to be more structured, more systematic and also more critical, with reference to progress on matters of entrepreneurial spirit and culture, for instance."
"In any case, we call on the Commission to act in concert with the Member States and above all with organisations representing small businesses."
"To that end, I stress the importance of involving such organisations to a greater extent, including through the establishment of standing working parties."
"This is not the time to underline how useful the Charter is but, instead, I feel I must strongly emphasise something that Parliament has called for more than once, which is that the Charter needs to be made legally binding."
"That is the only way we can be sure that the Member States will take it into account when drawing up national policies; otherwise, we run the risk of the Charter becoming a mere list of good intentions."
"It seems that this will be the last annual report on implementation of the Charter, because in future it will be incorporated within the overall report on the Lisbon Strategy."
"I can understand the reason for that – according to Commissioner Verheugen, it is to place SMEs at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy – but I can also see the danger of underrating the contribution made by the Charter, particularly in relation to the new Member States."
"Finally, I should like to add that I find it difficult to comprehend why the Commission says that it considers small enterprises to be the driving force behind the revitalisation of Europe’s economy, when the initiatives aimed at them – as put forward in the Commission document on relaunching the Lisbon process – are pretty limited."
"How can they be key players in this strategy?"
"That is not to mention the significant cuts in funding that the Competitiveness and Innovation framework Programme is almost certain to suffer because of what I regard as the Member States’ miserliness over the Union’s budget."
"It is unthinkable to promote the future of small businesses in that way, let alone the future of Europe."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, SMEs are now being given priority in all speeches – we have heard that from the Council Presidency today."
"That is a good thing, and I should also like to state quite clearly here that this is also thanks to Commissioner Verheugen, who has given this subject long-overdue momentum."
"We are obliged to him for this."
"However, except in many speeches, this subject is not always dealt with appropriately."
"We can see this in our own institution, as Parliament is starting its discussion at an hour not befitting the issue."
"We should pull our own socks up too, therefore, and improve the way we deal with this subject."
"Looking at the figures – which have been cited here – we can see that SMEs are our main point of contact for the Lisbon agenda."
"Employing two-thirds of the workforce, they are the most important employers, but they are also innovators in many fields, being global leaders in niche and part-markets and also accounting for more than 50% of patents."
"That means that, in these fields, Europe has the authority and the competence to provide direction that it so badly needs in global competition."
"The financial resources that we allocate to SMEs contrast sharply with this."
"In this regard it is plain to see that, in the Commission’s original budget allocation, which was a generous estimate, only 0.3% of all resources had fallen to SMEs."
"Some of my fellow Members have raised the subject of the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (CIP)."
"As the rapporteur, I wish to raise an objection, as there have been cuts in this field."
"We all agree that we need to increase these resources to the maximum."
"Nevertheless, on the positive side, I should like to say that the Commissioner has appointed a representative for SMEs and, in Françoise Le Bail, has made a very good choice."
"I should like to congratulate him on this and offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur on her sound report."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is important to discuss the issue of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"More important still is to put into practice measures to provide effective support for micro-, small- and medium-sized businessmen, which is something that has not happened; far from it."
"Neoliberal policies have created enormous difficulties for micro and small enterprises."
"As the report says, it is not enough simply to have a European Charter for Small Enterprises."
"The Charter’s actions for small businesses should be incorporated in, and supplemented by, the general policy for SMEs on the basis of binding measures, not only at Community level but also within Member States."
"It is especially important that small and micro enterprises have recourse to European programmes. Accordingly, conditions must be in place to facilitate the access of such businesses to Community funds, either by amendments to be introduced to the regulations, or by setting up mechanisms of direct, unequivocal support for their associations, in order to help them overcome continuing financial, bureaucratic, tax and other obstacles."
"It is also important to strengthen financial instruments for small and craft enterprises, particularly mutual guarantee systems, and to set up flexible microfinancing systems, aimed at family businesses, those set up by women and young people, helping to cofinance projects and making relevant information available."
"It should not be forgotten that if the EU does not take measures now, it will be confronted in ten years’ time with millions of small and craft enterprises going out of business, with the attendant risk of millions of job losses, which will exacerbate poverty, the desertification of rural areas and social exclusion."
"Accordingly, as the report says – and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on her work – it is crucial that the European institutions and the Member States implement and develop the actions laid down in the European Charter in full."
"This must be binding, and not just a matter of paying lip service to the Charter. Furthermore, it must not lose its content on account of its inclusion in the Lisbon Strategy, as Mr Verheugen suggested just now, a prospect that I find worrying."
". Mr President, this report calls for a reduction in bureaucratic obstacles and the simplification of taxation for small businesses."
"Who could disagree with that?"
"But then the report goes on to say that EU legislation should be implemented equally across Member States and, in the case of non-compliance, rapid infringement procedures should be applied."
"We are immediately transported back into the world of one-size-fits-all EU legislation and penalties, which are guaranteed to strangle enterprise, initiative and business creation."
"My own party pointed out during the British Presidency of 2005 that over 4 000 new regulations and legislative instruments were enacted, despite Mr Blair’s rash promise to reduce overregulation."
"If small- and medium-sized businesses are to thrive in the EU, which is vital for job creation, then the simple answer is to reduce EU regulation, not increase it."
"Otherwise, one day the only way to own a small business in Europe will be to buy a big one and wait."
". Mr President, Mr Verheugen, this evening is the last time that we will be considering the European Charter for Small Enterprises as a separate report."
"Here, I would like to agree with those who have expressed hopes that this will not decrease the significance of the policy of support for small enterprises in the future, when the report is included in the joint report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I believe that it is essential for the European Union not only to maintain but also to extend its role in this policy sphere."
"Small enterprises very often lack a political lobby and institutional support at Member State level."
"The burden of tax and bureaucratic procedures places many small enterprises in a discriminatory situation when compared with other market players."
"Small enterprises, therefore, frequently have to struggle not for special dispensations and the simplification of tax or bureaucratic procedures, but first of all they have to achieve a non-discriminatory environment for their own business activities."
"European Union policy in the sphere of small business support must develop a more effective and aggressive approach, motivating the Member States to take account of the interests of this business group."
"For this reason I believe that we should back the proposal to give the European Charter for Small Enterprises the force of law."
"This, however, is not enough to significantly improve the situation in this sphere."
"The charter must not remain just an instrument for transferring the experience of one country over the border into another, while enterprises remain fenced in inside their own national economies."
"The charter’s impact would significantly increase the European Union’s political will and foster action for further economic integration, with adoption of the Services Directive as the first step."
"The liberalisation of the services sector of the internal market would give this group of businesses unprecedented opportunities and incentives for development, would remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent small- and medium-sized enterprises from crossing national borders."
"We ought not to forget that it is actually small business activity from which springs the spirit of enterprise, which ensures economic vitality, development and stability in a period of change."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on the report she has produced, which I believe to be a very exhaustive, but at the same time very clear, report."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for being here today and for the explanations he has given us."
"Secondly, it is a cliché to say that small- and medium-size enterprises are the backbone of the European economy."
"However, the fact that it is a cliché does not make it any less important."
"Two-thirds of companies in Europe are classified as SMEs."
"Europe has 25 million small- and medium-sized enterprises which, in employment terms, provide no fewer than 95 million jobs."
"The objective, however, is not just for SMEs to struggle on, but rather for them to be able to prosper and grow strong."
"To this end, we need a model in which SMEs do not just develop by means of merger or acquisition, which is the traditional model, but rather through the growth of the small- and medium-sized enterprises themselves."
"I would like to stress some of the aspects taken up in the report presented by Mrs Vlasto."
"I agree with her that incorporating the report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises into the report on implementing the Lisbon process could lead to a certain marginalisation of the SME concept."
"Furthermore, I believe that we must enhance the annual bilateral dialogue with representatives of SMEs and promote the participation of SMEs through the use of instruments suited to their needs, such as incentives to encourage SMEs to enter the world of research and development."
"I would like finally to refer to something that the Commissioner raised in his speech: it is not possible to have strong small- and medium-sized enterprises if entrepreneurial activity is constantly being undermined."
"I therefore believe that it is extremely important that we, once and for all, opt decisively to emphasise the social value of entrepreneurial action."
"I believe that this is fundamental to the future of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, Commissioner, small- and medium-sized enterprises are important sources of employment and it is for this very reason that the European Charter is a project worth supporting."
"At the same time, the Commission promptly needs to mention which Member States have not yet improved the way they do things or implemented the Charter’s lines for action."
"SMEs for us are an immense resource and opportunity."
"We must streamline and simplify legislation the whole time and make it easier to found new companies."
"Any action that promotes a climate of entrepreneurship has the support of our group."
"An important goal must be to harmonise company taxation."
"The problem with the Charter is that it does not contain enough concrete measures which would provide support for innovative companies and their potential for networking."
"More effective use of the internet and business are areas which offer enormous opportunities."
"The development of electronic public services in Member States as support tools for SMEs is also important."
"The Union needs to start implementing the Basel II provisions promptly."
"That too would facilitate matters."
"The Commission and the Council should also re-embark on action with regard to a Community patent, which is problematic but essential."
"The legislation on state aid could be examined, so that companies might receive support in the event that private risk financing shies away."
"Obviously we should support the establishment of small companies based merely on self-employment, but ambitious and inventive companies are the vital boost which we need."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am, of course, delighted at the very broad consensus uniting us around Mrs Vlasto's report this evening, and I am pleased to have heard Chancellor Schüssel and then Mr Barroso telling us this morning how interested they were in SMEs and assuring us that this subject would be brought up during the spring Council."
"I would like, for my part, to draw your attention to two points."
"We have just been talking about SMEs in abstract terms, as an administrative body, needing simplification, more money, a better environmental context, and so on. A small business is, in essence, its leader – I know there are some in this Chamber who have just spoken – and it is now nearly 31 years since I myself set up my first business."
"We therefore need to take these leaders into account if we are going to give them real answers, so that their small businesses can run properly."
"If you talked to all the heads of SMEs in Europe, they would tell you one thing – that there are not enough hours in the day – and, at this time of night, many of them are still hard at work."
"We must provide real answers, Commissioner."
"We must simplify, but in particular we must apply the principle of subsidiarity so that authorities, states and professional organisations can provide real support at local level."
"It is not up to the European Union to do all of that itself, but it must do it."
"My second point relates to our fellow citizens."
"As has already been said, we must increase awareness right from school age."
"I would therefore like to make a proposal."
"Just as there are music and football competitions at European level, why not institute a European 'open day' for small enterprises?"
"Why not organise a European Good Practice Day?"
"Those are just a few ideas on how we can communicate and show our fellow citizens how important our SMEs are."
"– Mr President, there are 25 million small enterprises employing almost 100 million people."
"These small enterprises provide well over half of private jobs in the EU and are of great importance to regional, cultural and social development, including in rural areas."
"They deserve to see their opportunities for innovation and competitive prospects discussed every year."
"As my fellow Members have already pointed out, the importance of these enterprises was underlined today by Wolfgang Schüssel during his presentation of the programme of the Austrian Council Presidency, when he called for us to ‘wake the sleeping giant’."
"I fully agree with him."
"There has also been criticism of the Charter from many quarters, however, on the grounds that it contains too many non-binding appeals."
"I, too, should like to see substantial measures at Community and, as Commissioner Verheugen said, Member State level."
"At any event, the 10 lines for action in the Charter are important orientations for enhancing the exchange of best practice, promoting the setting-up of new enterprises and generally creating a positive environment."
"This starts in school lessons, and we have to set the tone for it from primary level onwards."
"Once again, Finland is a good example of this."
"The Netherlands is exemplary with regard to the simplification of regulations, particularly on account of its standardised impact assessments."
"We agree that work on dismantling the considerable bureaucratic and tax obstacles in the Member States must continue."
"It is important that subsidies be fully exempt from corporation tax."
"A very good report has been drawn up by Mr Bushill-Matthews in our advisory committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I am thinking in particular of the suggestion to draw up a Green Paper on the reduction of these barriers, and of the call for better access to the Structural Funds and to risk capital funds."
"Personally, I consider it important that small enterprises promote their apprentices and other staff more through transnational exchanges within the framework of programmes such as the Leonardo da Vinci apprentice exchange programme."
"This will increase mobility and at the same time create one of the preconditions for small- and micro-enterprises to work together very much better in future."
"Mr President, I am delighted that small enterprises are now at the heart of Europe's activities, firstly in Chancellor Schüssel's very encouraging remarks this morning, making this subject a top priority for the Austrian Presidency."
"They are also at the heart of the debate in your comments, Commissioner, before the SME intergroup this afternoon and here this evening, affirming that the situation for SMEs is of great concern to the Commission and that we need to create better political conditions for SMEs in Europe."
"Finally, they are at the heart of the debate in this evening's discussion."
"In the current difficult economic climate, it is often small and craft enterprises that continue to create wealth and form the main source of employment, with local jobs that maintain social cohesion by nourishing the whole territory of the EU."
"The European Union must be a staunch supporter of these small businesses, by increasing the power of the Charter as a specific assistance instrument and by going beyond good intentions, as called for in Mrs Vlasto's excellent report."
"In order to ensure that these small businesses continue to be created and passed on, we need to reduce the administrative formalities in Europe and in the Member States; make it easier for them to access capital and European programmes, particularly on research; improve the dissemination of information on measures that help them; and encourage innovation and the fight against counterfeit goods."
"To do all of that, however, we need ambitious funding, so let us hope that the good fairies who have been looking into the future of these small enterprises today – this sleeping giant, as Chancellor Schüssel put it – turn their wishes into reality by allocating the necessary funds to the various actions and that their good intentions are backed up by specific financial commitments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, small enterprises constitute one of the main drivers of European competitiveness."
"However, I would like to note that the report is rather formal and does not exactly reflect the actual situation."
"I would like to draw your attention to the problems of small enterprises and business development in the new Member States of the European Union."
"The level of entrepreneurship in many of these countries – like in my home country, Lithuania – is unfortunately four times lower than in the old Member States, and the prospects for the growth of small businesses are not sufficiently favourable."
"This will decrease the overall competitiveness of the European Union."
"The establishment of companies and creation of jobs require conditions attractive for business start-ups as well as favourable funding opportunities."
"Entrepreneurship and initiative of the citizens are important preconditions for harmonious social development."
"This is a problem in the new Member States so far."
"Therefore, these states need an impetus on the part of the European Commission and additional exceptional measures and conditions facilitating the development of small businesses."
"How?"
"First, it is essential to eliminate the taxation of small business investments, thus opening better possibilities for small companies to use capital resources."
"Second, small businesses should be ensured access to the Structural Funds on a national level."
"In my opinion, a certain percentage of the funds should be earmarked for small business."
"Furthermore, it is vital to simplify the bureaucratic procedures and to reduce the tax burden upon innovative companies to the maximum extent, by exempting them from profit tax, especially at the business start-up stage."
"Mr President, the SME Charter is an important and necessary political document of intention, but in itself it is hardly more than this."
"The open coordination method proposed to implement the objectives of the Charter is flexible, which may not only be an advantage, but also a disadvantage."
"Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"We must support SMEs not only with our intentions, but also with our mandatory regulations both at European and Member State level."
"It is very important that the Charter, as well as other, sometimes too distant programmes running in parallel with it, should not only be about SMEs, but also be addressed to SMEs."
"Besides principles, we need pragmatic, easily understandable and actually deliverable information and assistance solutions."
"Otherwise we will never reach the tens of thousands of forced entrepreneurs who cannot afford the time or resources to enquire about them."
"At the same time, we should not forget that SME policy is not a special, separate subject, but one of the horizontal pillars."
"When we know that the vast majority of our businesses are SMEs, we must also realize that our only lasting, structural solution for the implementation of the cohesion policy, the reduction of unemployment, the enhancement of competitiveness and economic growth, or the facilitation of rural development, research development or even innovation is to build on our own SMEs."
"We should not neglect this foundation."
"This is why I am asking that we do not shut the Charter away in a drawer at the end of the debate, but leave it on our desks as a reminder of the long journey we still have ahead of us until we can say that small enterprises are a success in Europe."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 January 2006 at 12 noon."
"– The Charter for Small Enterprises is a great step forward in defence of that sector of the economy, which represents the individuality, the vitality and the richness of the European Union."
"Improved access to European funding, more streamlined administration, training and tax relief are all essential measures to enable SMEs to exist, to produce, to invest and to employ."
"Now that the European Union has recognised the importance of the sector, it needs to pay careful attention to the consistency of its policies: the recent debates on chemical substance registration or software patenting, to mention just a couple, have perhaps led people to doubt whether the EU is actually willing to commit itself totally to protecting SMEs."
"The latest dreadful example comes from the now notorious debate on the textile industry and trade relations with China."
"Promoting and implementing a charter for SMEs will be a wasted effort until the EU, and the Commission in particular, raises its voice at last to firmly demand that the rules of trade – which are already in themselves extremely unfavourable to small businesses – be obeyed, and to demand the best possible conditions from our international partners to enable this industry to continue to flourish."
"Progress in promoting SMEs has been achieved in the new Member States, mainly in: education for entrepreneurship, better regulation and skills shortages."
"Concrete actions to foster SMEs friendly environment are the cornerstone for achieving Union's objectives of growth and employment."
"Bets-practices suggest that the new Member States should focus on setting up systems to monitor skills gaps; developing policies to address bankruptcy and competition laws; adapting SMEs friendly taxation systems; using impact assessments for developing better regulation and fostering innovation and technological capacities."
"It is therefore necessary that the SME dimension is further integrated within the other policies of the Union through increased consultation and better representation of the SMEs at national and Community levels."
"Addressing this report is also the opportunity to welcome the Jaspers and Jeremy initiatives that will certainly play an important role in developing more effective SMEs friendly environment within the Union."
"I also welcome the geographical expansion of the objectives of the Charter to the enlarged EU, the candidate countries, the Western Balkans, Moldova and the Mediterranean partners."
"Finally, I support the rapporteur when calling for a wider consistent overview and for more systematic and critical review of the situation in future reports."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Onesta, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to be made to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure relating to standards of good conduct for Members of the European Parliament (A6-0413/2005)."
". Mr President, you have a copy of our current Rules of Procedure in front of you."
"According to those rules, you should have your ushers throw me out immediately, because I am wearing a T-shirt with a small political slogan printed on the front and back."
"According to our Rules of Procedure, it is completely forbidden to display political opinions visually, regardless of the medium."
"That just goes to show how absurd the current system is, all the more so given that the current Rules of Procedure do not allow us to intervene in cases of violence, invective, defamation or insults, in the Chamber or elsewhere."
"Our current tools in this matter are very weak: it is a case of nothing or an atomic bomb, and you, Mr President, are the atomic bomb."
"You can move that Parliament penalise the offender but, as the offender has practically no rights, you hesitate about doing so and, by hesitating, you are the one who risks being penalised, Mr President."
"That is why neither you nor any of your predecessors have ever used this atomic bomb, and that is all to the good."
"Things therefore needed to change and I would like at this point not only to thank you – I am really very touched by your last-minute arrival to chair this debate – but also to congratulate the four shadow rapporteurs who have helped us to reach a consensus: Mr Méndez de Vigo for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Corbett for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Guardans Cambó for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Mrs Kaufmann for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left."
"This report gives us an opportunity not only to develop more reasonable, more appropriate, more flexible and more proportionate Rules of Procedure, but also – and this is all to the good – to increase the basic individual rights of each Member."
"For the first time, thanks to these new Rules of Procedure, our protection by primary law is now enshrined in the Rules."
"We are also protected by the Statute for Members."
"For the first time, an offender will have the right to be informed individually, and he will have the right to explain himself to you, Mr President."
"The penalty must be justified in writing."
"There will be no more discretionary powers."
"The offender will have the right to an internal appeal, in addition to the right to an external appeal, and that appeal will have the effect of suspending the penalty."
"If our appeals body acts too slowly, the penalty will be deemed null and void."
"Even better, Members will have a new right of visual expression."
"I will finally be able to wear this type of T-shirt without your ushers intervening, Mr President, provided that what I am wearing is not offensive or defamatory and does not disrupt the sitting, which I hope is the case this evening."
"Also for the first time, we will enshrine in the Rules of Procedure the right to vote."
"Currently, if a Member is suspended for a few days, he loses his right to vote."
"That means that we are penalising not only him, but also all of his constituents, who have done nothing wrong."
"We have therefore decided to say that democracy is strong enough to go that far, in order to protect even the worst Members of this Parliament: those who do not respect democracy."
"Democracy will respect every single one of their rights, which I think is very much to Parliament's credit."
"Once again, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for enabling us to reach this consensus."
"There is a safeguard built into the Rules of Procedure themselves, which will in future include the following sentence: 'The application of this Rule shall in no way detract from the liveliness of parliamentary debates nor undermine Members' freedom of speech'."
"I have kept one example to finish with. You may remember that, a year ago, one parliamentary group caused a major disturbance in this Chamber during the vote on the European Constitution."
"You yourself, Mr President, had some difficulty restoring order in the Chamber and enabling it to continue its business."
"You remained extremely calm, but the situation was very difficult and the pictures of that disturbance shown outside did no credit to European democracy."
"It is certainly to be expected that the same group will stage another demonstration during tomorrow's vote on the topic concerned, but it will be quite different in nature. Some of them have told me that they have already taken on board the spirit of the new Rules of Procedure."
"They intend to use some puppets, and display ostriches; it will not be violent or disruptive, and it will certainly not be aggressive."
"The simple fact that they have already taken on board the new Rules of Procedure shows that we are moving in the right direction."
"In conclusion, I think that, thanks to the efforts of all Members, we will be able to have a Parliament that is dignified yet lively, lively yet dignified, and you can count on me, Mr President, being widely known as a political agitator, to ensure that Parliament remains very lively."
"Thank you for your explanation, Mr Onesta, but I will have to have you removed from the Chamber, as that is what is laid down in our current Rules of Procedure, which are still in force."
". – Mr President, I should like to discuss the purpose of these Rules of Procedure and what has changed in them."
"Their purpose is to fully ensure liveliness and spontaneity, whilst enabling Members to be called to order in cases of genuinely malicious, continuous disruption of the smooth conduct of parliamentary business."
"These have been redefined and aspects of the rules that had hitherto been couched in very non-specific terms have been clarified: that is, the difference between the ‘normal’ Chair, the Chairman of a delegation or committee, or a Vice-President chairing this plenary assembly, and the one President – who is of course present in person today."
"The ‘normal’ Chair may issue a reprimand, exclude from the Chamber a Member guilty of continuous disruption, and suspend a sitting, but the really unpleasant penalties may only be imposed by the President."
"At first it sounds surprising that the President alone, without plenary, may impose an effective penalty thus, but this is corrected or balanced out by the introduction of a right of appeal, so that Members who consider that they have been unfairly treated by the President may appeal and any penalty wrongfully imposed can then be rectified."
"A genuinely new aspect is that breaches of the rules governing confidentiality may now also be penalised."
"Another new aspect is that there has been some increase in the possible penalties."
"Up to now, it has been possible to suspend a Member from his or her duties for two to five days, but the new period would be between two and ten days."
"I share Mr Onesta’s opinion that this is a balanced draft, a proposal that permits liveliness and nevertheless ensures the smooth conduct of business."
"Our group will therefore support this proposal."
". Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, almost all parliaments have rules in order to protect themselves against disruptive behaviour that is aimed at preventing them from working."
"It is not that the rules ever need to be used, maybe they will never be necessary, but it is important to have them as a democratic safeguard."
"What our committee is proposing today is a modest set of proposals."
"They would give you, Mr President, powers that are far smaller than the powers of, for instance, the Speaker of the House of Commons; they are strictly circumscribed and are combined with safeguards to reassure those colleagues who feared that we were going to clamp down on any kind of behaviour that was in any way colourful or lively."
"That is not the case."
"But we are right to bring in a coherent and proportionate set of rules to protect ourselves if necessary."
"After all, at the last European election, a Member was elected who seems to have disappeared now, but who, at the time of the election, said his ambition was to come here to disrupt Parliament, to prevent it from working."
"In the end, he did not manage to do that."
"But, who knows, he might, in combination with others, have made a serious effort to stop us from working."
"That is why it is necessary to protect the democratic process, or at least to have the instruments just in case we need them."
"I notice that some members of our press are saying that these rules are aimed at silencing those who oppose the European Union, silencing a minority viewpoint."
"That is not true and anyone who looked at the proposals would know that viewpoint is not plausible."
"We have gone out of our way to say that the pluralism of Parliament – the right to express yourself, the right of freedom of expression and even, within proportion, visual expression – is safeguarded and guaranteed."
"So, this is not to stamp down on any minority."
"Those who are saying it are aiming at gullible journalists or at the Eurosceptic press, hoping to get a story making us look silly or ridiculous."
"Unless they think it targets them, and I can scarcely believe that, those behind this story must either be planning to disrupt our work – and I hope that is not the case – or they are paranoid."
"Given their general attitude to the European Union – that anything coming out of our institutions is necessarily an evil plot – I rather think it is paranoia that is governing their actions in telling the press the story about this very reasonable report."
"My group will support the proposals of Mr Onesta and I hope that this gives our Parliament a proportionate set of rules that we need, just in case we need to safeguard ourselves."
". Mr President, Mr Onesta has tried his best to strike the right balance between indignation about the actions of some MEPs and guarantees for freedom to express dissent."
"On the credit side, penalised members will not lose their right to vote and will be able to appeal."
"I still think that this proposal could be counterproductive."
"It is an invitation to MEPs to make the headlines by proclaiming their own punitive measures and thus to present themselves to the public as martyrs."
"It also prompts frightened Presidents to come down unnecessarily hard on the people they do not consider to be their friends."
"Moreover, every incident will lead to even stricter rules so as to rule out all unanticipated irritations."
"Interruptions in debates and a visible display of different opinions are part and parcel of normal parliamentary practice."
"This House would expose itself to possible ridicule if this were to lead to exclusion from a number of sittings or even to Members being suspended."
"If that were the case, the media would not be reporting as much about the content of the debate and the decision-making as it would about the lack of tolerance."
"Since that is sending the wrong message to the voters, it would be preferable if a regulation of that kind were to confine itself to preventing and penalising physical violence."
". Mr President, since my party, the UK Independence Party, came to this Parliament in 1999 and returned in more force in 2004, we have established the first genuine opposition to the process of European political integration."
"My concern is that the proposed measures may be used to try to stifle the voice of national independence and opposition to the European Union."
"If that is the case, it will not succeed."
"However, I should like to offer some constructive suggestions to improve the proceedings."
"Firstly, the presiding Presidents should ensure that speakers are kept to their allotted time: pro-EU speakers are given much more leeway to overrun than anti-EU speakers."
"Secondly, during the vote some presiding Presidents need to slow down a little."
"In that way we might have time to vote properly."
"At the same time, the Presidents might not make so many glaring mistakes in estimating the vote and there would be less call for electronic checks."
"Mr President, I shall speak out of parliamentary courtesy: firstly, because you are here and I believe we should be grateful for that and, secondly, because it was my group that requested that we hold this debate."
"In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, this debate need not have taken place because the vote in committee was overwhelmingly in favour of the report by Mr Onesta, but my group asked for it, precisely because my group likes transparency."
"I would like to say that I am delighted that we asked for it, despite the time, because I believe that it has been a model debate: the Members who have spoken before me have expressed perfectly what this reform of the Rules of Procedure means."
"Again out of parliamentary courtesy, and in view of the time, I shall say no more and we can all go home."
"– Mr President, I should like to make it absolutely clear that I am not here to take the place of Mr Martin, but that my group has given me two minutes even though I am not a member of the committee responsible."
"I am very grateful, Mr President, that you are present for these questions, and I am also very grateful that you are a President who endeavours to keep in check the good many abuses by some Members in invoking the Rules of Procedure."
"I do not wish to discuss now whether the status of a number of Members is perhaps being enhanced by penalising their questionable conduct in the Rules of Procedure."
"Nor do I wish to discuss whether several members of the Presidency of Parliament perhaps simply have less sovereignty, which even an amendment to the Rules of Procedure cannot confer on them."
"I expressly support the inclusion in this text of breaches of the rules governing confidentiality."
"I do feel somewhat uneasy, however, that the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is responsible for the mandate of Members, could not be consulted on this text."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is responsible for the Rules of Procedure with good reason: the matter is in good hands there."
"Sometimes, however, Members’ rights do conflict with provisions in the Rules of Procedure."
"Naturally, Members’ rights are not restricted to merely the right to vote: we are a parliament and not a ‘votament’."
"It is with good reason that, if Members are absent and cannot present their arguments, courts may declare a vote unlawful."
"If the Legal Affairs Committee had been involved, I would have raised an issue that goes to the heart of the matter."
"Up to now, a Member who had been penalised could request five minutes’ speaking time in Parliament – this was decided by Members – which is also why no right of appeal was necessary."
"That procedure, which would have been a public one, is now to disappear into the parliamentary bodies, to an extent, which I consider a step backwards."
"Nevertheless, I support it, albeit with some misgivings."
"I would ask, however, that, in the event of future discussions that venture beyond merely organisational procedures, where the mandate could even theoretically be affected, the Legal Affairs Committee be included in the consultation process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at noon."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Onesta on his report, which will, if passed, amend our Rules of Procedure to institute stronger and more flexible procedures to discipline Members who disrupt the proceedings of the House or its committees."
"I am not entirely sure of the meaning of the new Rule 147(3)b, which suggests one penalty will be the forfeiture of entitlement to the daily subsistence allowance for a period of between two and ten days."
"Does this mean the Member concerned cannot sign in for the specified number of days – that is, stay at home – or, rather differently, that when he or she does sign in they receive no subsistence allowance?"
"Maybe the rapporteur can clarify his intention here?"
"I welcome Amendment 3 to Rule 9, paragraph 1b (new), laying down as it does a protection of Members' freedom of speech."
"If this is passed and included in our rules I will immediately, if it comes into force next session, test its strength by retabling my written declaration on boycotting Ferrero-Rocher which, prior to this rule, was declared irreceivable by a former President of Parliament."
"Freedom of speech is not limited by the wishes of Europe's multinational corporations."
"Given the behaviour of certain Members and groups in the plenary of Parliament it is unfortunately necessary to introduce new rules to govern Members’ conduct."
"In my opinion the report sets the right balance between the need to ensure freedom of parliamentary expression and vibrant debate on the one hand and dignified conduct of business on the other."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in the Middle East."
". Mr President, it is a great honour to address you today on the Middle East peace process."
"It is particularly timely, since I have just returned from a visit to Gaza, the West Bank and Israel."
"I had three objectives for this trip: first, to lend support to democracy-building in the run-up to the Palestinian elections."
"There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague, Mrs De Keyser; secondly, to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people, and, thirdly, to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects, notably in Gaza."
"I spent a whole day in Gaza."
"The security situation there is very complicated, it was not easy to go in but in the end it was a good day and I hope that the images brought to the Palestinian people show how much we, the European Union, are standing by them."
"It is a critical moment in the Middle East."
"In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, there have been tremendous changes in the political landscape."
"I hope that these elections will bring about two leaderships that are ready and able to inject new vigour into this peace process."
"I made it clear to both Israelis and Palestinians that the Commission will continue to offer its support to all those who seek peace by peaceful means."
"That means in particular that whatever the composition of the new Palestinian Government, there must be full respect for the principles enshrined in the Interim Association Agreement and in the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan that we agreed with the Palestinian Authority."
"These principles include respect for human rights and the rule of law, and thus a clear commitment to the roadmap."
"The Palestinian Authority has given the international community assurances that the elections will take place free from violence and intimidation and according to international standards; we can only hope that this will come true."
"President Abbas has also made it clear that acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government."
"I think it was important that he gave such a clear message."
"Acting Prime Minister Olmert, whom I also saw, assured me that Israel would facilitate the holding of these elections."
"His government took a difficult decision, in the context of an Israeli pre-election campaign, to allow voting in East Jerusalem."
"I welcomed that decision and I hope that this constructive spirit will help resolve any other remaining logistical and practical aspects of the elections."
"Within the security constraints, it will be very important that Israel does all it can to allow free movement for voters and candidates in the Palestinian territories up to and including polling day."
"The European Union is supporting the Palestinian elections with the biggest Election Observation Mission – 240 observers, including 50 of your colleagues."
"I visited the Observation Team led by Mrs de Keyser, and was most impressed by her dedication and professionalism and that of her team."
"I was also impressed to meet the Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Dr Hanna Nasir."
"Thanks to the sustained support of the European Union – with which the Commission has been involved since 2003 – the CEC has established itself as one of the most credible and respected institutions in the Palestinian territories."
"During my visit, I announced another EUR 1.4 million to help with voter registration and polling activities, which brings our support for the election process to EUR 18.5 million, which is a large amount of money to try to make these elections free and fair."
"One of the purposes of my visit to Gaza was to raise the profile of the important work we are doing, providing urgent assistance to make Palestinians’ ordinary lives more bearable."
"We are improving the health system, building schools and repairing roads, making improvements as regards solid waste, sewage waste and electricity grids."
"Much of that will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people and I hope they understand that it comes from the European Union."
"I inaugurated some public works programmes and also announced the launch of four new energy and environment infrastructure projects in Gaza worth EUR 20 million."
"We are working with all possible speed, but the security situation is not making our work any easier."
"Yet revitalising Gaza’s economy is essential."
"What I saw only strengthened my conviction on that, and I will continue to press this point in the Quartet – there will be a Quartet meeting on 30 January in London, after the Afghanistan conference – and with Israel."
"We must continue to improve free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza."
"So, I have relaunched the procurement process for a EUR 25 million cargo terminal at the airport."
"We visited the airport, and we know how important it is to open it up, not only to the region, but also to the world, to help facilitate Palestinian trade once it has been reopened."
"We will only be able to go ahead with the project once there is an agreement between both sides."
"We therefore strongly support Jim Wolfensohn with the whole scope of the project that he has outlined since the opening of the Rafah crossing."
"We will not be able to step up travel in and out of Gaza without properly managed borders."
"I visited the Rafah border crossing and I must say that General Pistolesi and his team at the EU Border Assistance Mission are doing an excellent job."
"I was moved to see that Europeans are helping ordinary Palestinians to move across the border with Egypt for the first time in many years; this maintains the great dignity of the Palestinian people."
"They are very happy. I spoke to two women who expressed the hope that things might slowly get better."
"Therefore, we will provide a further EUR 3 million package of support for the Rafah border crossing."
"We are carrying out customs duties there, so it will provide scanning equipment as well as training for the Palestinians."
"I made it clear to both my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts and interlocutors that the European Union is contributing substantially to creating the conditions for a two-State solution."
"Like everyone involved, we face major challenges, but we are in it for the long haul."
"We want to make a long term commitment. I clearly reiterated that."
"We have been a consistent and reliable partner for both sides."
"But to make progress, both sides must move."
"Israel should take steps to implement the agreement brokered in November by the Quartet Special Envoy Jim Wolfensohn on improving movement and access – the port, the airport, the link between Gaza and the West Bank and movement within the West Bank."
"And the Palestinian Authority must take charge of law and order and public finances."
"It must take serious steps to relaunch its reform programme and respect its commitments under the Interim Association Agreement and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan."
"At this critical juncture, our message is very clear: there is a need for negotiations; all action threatening a two-State solution must cease; and imposing law and order and fighting terrorism are important."
". Mr President, the Palestinian elections on 20 January are an opportunity for the Palestinians to confirm the democratic path on which they set out last January."
"We are grateful for the Commissioner’s commitment, both personally and representing the Commission."
"These elections take place in a highly challenging environment, which we certainly acknowledge."
"But the importance the European Parliament attaches to their successful completion, and indeed to the peace process, can be seen in its having again authorised the largest observation delegation of 30 elected Members, which I am again proud to lead jointly with Mrs Napoletano from the PSE Group."
"Indeed, many Members present here today will be in Palestine next week."
"The current situation in the Middle East represents a failure of diplomacy nearly a century ago."
"The only democracy to date in the region is Israel, born of a genuine desire to create a Jewish homeland."
"T E Lawrence of Arabia – who is a distant cousin of mine – wanted that too, but he also had a different vision for the region."
"A recently discovered map he drew in Versailles shows kingdoms, not British and French dominions."
"Today, however, we welcome the return of Europe in a different guise."
"In her spending commitments for the Palestine Authority, could the Commissioner envisage funding a new chamber for the Palestine Council?"
"As colleagues know, democracy is my watchword."
"At the Egyptian elections, which we witnessed last year, we saw intimidation of voters, including those supporting Dr Ayman Nour, leader of the secular al-Ghad Party."
"The European Union rightly says that his subsequent sentence at a show trial to five years’ hard labour by the same judge who put Saad Ibrahim in jail for three years sent negative signals."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner: what is the negative response from Brussels?"
"The Middle East is a region of fundamental strategic importance and a source of danger."
"The London bombers last July came from my constituency in Yorkshire."
"But the key to stability is democracy."
"I am also proud, as a Vice-President, to represent the European Parliament on the Delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"But I also believe that the European Union needs a dedicated programme of democratic engagement in the region, and I look forward to hearing from the Commissioner what her plans are in that regard."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for the information she has provided us with."
"I should also like to send my best wishes to Prime Minister Sharon, as well as to Mrs Livni, for the important tasks she is taking on within the Israeli Government."
"The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing."
"In Israel, Deputy Prime Minister Olmert seems determined to take forward the process begun by Prime Minister Sharon, in view of the elections on 28 March."
"In Palestine, the imminent elections – the outcome of which is by no means clear – bring with them the important news that Hamas is standing in the national parliamentary elections for the first time."
"We are faced with a dynamic situation, but one that is vulnerable to further setbacks."
"The extremely fragile peace process – one might say that it never got off the ground in the way it was designed to in the Road Map – may be ruined once and for all by the escalating situation in the entire area, from the difficulties in stabilising Iraq to the alarming position taken by the Iranian leadership, the fragile situation in Lebanon, the role of Syria and the turbulent situation within Egypt."
"Returning to the Palestinian elections, I do not wish to sidestep that most thorny of issues – that is to say, the issue of Hamas."
"Regardless of the outcome of the elections, Hamas will play a key role in relation to the institutional representation of the Palestinian people."
"I will refrain from doing or saying anything that might increase the support for, and influence of, Hamas and I will instead try to emphasise the fact that if a movement aspires to the highest echelons of political and institutional representation, then it must be willing to play the democratic game, starting with respect for international law and an end to violence."
"From that point of view, I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct, even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place, particularly in Gaza."
"I should, however, like us to be more appreciative of the pluralism that is emerging in Palestine, which is also symbolised by new, secular electoral lists, bearing witness to the need for democracy, transparency and efforts to combat corruption."
"The state of Israeli-Palestinian relations also has a bearing on the situation within Palestine."
"That is another reason why Israel should stop the settlements in all the territories and refrain from acting in such a way as to jeopardise the chances of resolving the conflict, beginning with East Jerusalem, where a real annexation policy is being pursued."
"The voting agreement in East Jerusalem is therefore – as you said – a positive development, even though we are well aware of its limitations, having observed the Presidential elections."
"Nevertheless, it still has huge symbolic value."
". Mr President, on 25 January Palestinians will take to the polls to elect their parliament for the first time since 1996."
"These elections may be six months later than planned, but that is a drop in the ocean for the generations who have longed to exercise their democratic rights."
"With a EUR 18.5 million contribution to support the electoral process and the deployment of a skilled observation mission, including an experienced delegation from this House, the EU is showing the Palestinians the path to effective democracy."
"It is a critical time for stability in the Middle East."
"It is crucial for the Palestinian Authority to acquire more democratic legitimacy."
"Only with effective, functioning democratic institutions can the Palestinians lay the foundations for their own state, living in peace with Israel."
"Some think legitimacy impossible with a black-listed terrorist organisation competing in the polls, but Hamas has rebranded itself as a change and reform movement and has maintained a state of calm in the run-up to these elections in spite of Tuesday’s killing on the West Bank."
"It has built popular support, perhaps as much as 40%, by providing numerous social services in an atmosphere of pessimism, anger and joblessness."
"Muhammad Abbas’s ruling Fatah faction would also be hard pushed to meet our level of legitimacy with the legacy of cronyism and corruption."
"Only this week the EU suspended EUR 35 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority, and rightly so, because the necessary benchmarks have not been met."
"Change and reform are positive words, but they need to be accompanied by concrete deeds."
"In recent months, Hamas has made gestures towards moderation and its infamous Israel policy was not included in its election manifesto."
"But if Hamas wants to work with the EU it must be ready to push the peace process forward."
"That can only happen if it lays down its arms, drops its charter calling for the destruction of Israel and recognises the Jewish State’s right to exist."
"As Javier Solana has indicated, the taxpayers in the EU will not be in a position to sustain political activity conducted along violent lines."
"This is a test for the leadership skills of Ehud Olmert as he takes the helm after Ariel Sharon’s stroke earlier this month."
"How he manages the challenges to law and order in Gaza, particularly as settlers step up their violent efforts to prevent eviction from the West Bank, will set the tone for the talks we hope will materialise after these elections."
"But the threat of unrest should not stand in the way of democracy and we welcome Israel’s decision to facilitate voting in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have been virtually annexed, split from their families by a separation barrier condemned by the International Court of Justice."
"Moves by Israel now to comply with international law would be a tremendous confidence-building measure and an important step on the road to stability in the Middle East."
"With the threat of nuclear developments in Iran hanging over the region, steps must be taken now to demonstrate that respect for international law is alive and well in the Middle East."
"UN sanctions against Iran will only gain real legitimacy in the region if Israel is made to turn around its defiance of Security Council resolutions, a defiance unmatched by any other nation."
"Otherwise arguments of double standards will only add fuel to the fire."
"Mr President, I believe that, in the Middle East at the moment, there is a combination of, on the one hand, hope and, on the other, of substantial change on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides."
"The hope could be dashed very quickly, however, because events on the ground do not give much cause for optimism."
"In fact, in Jerusalem, right at the heart of the conflict, the situation is very worrying."
"We, here in Parliament, are concerned that the Commission should have decided not to publish a report on the situation in Jerusalem, which was a report agreed to by all of the Union's services working there."
"I believe that the situation in Jerusalem may represent a great obstacle to the creation of a viable and credible Palestinian State and become a for the two parties’ most extremist and violent factions, which want to hinder progress towards peace."
"Furthermore, I believe that the Commission should take measures to hasten progress, which has been incredibly slow, and to put an end to all the tortuous and bureaucratic procedures in order thereby to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians within the context of Mr Wolfensohn’s plans."
"As you will have seen, some progress has been made in Gaza but, in reality, little real progress has been made with any of the projects, whether those relating to the port, trade, the passage of goods or the free movement of people."
"The Palestinian Authority is in a very difficult situation."
"At a time when we are, in some quarters, seeing the idea of a Greater Israel replaced with that of a Greater Jerusalem, the people who truly champion peace and who advocate a State with a single military power rather than illegal militias, which are incompatible with peace on the Palestinian side, have few arguments to put forward unless we make quicker progress towards improving the quality of life of the Palestinians and can in some way slow down the expansion of settlements on the ground."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, recent developments in the area of the Middle East are putting even more pressure on an area already burdened with wars and much more besides."
"The crisis in relations between Iran and the West, the continuing political instability in Iraq, the crisis in relations between Lebanon and Syria, which needs very careful handling and, of course, the situation in the area of Israel and Palestine are intensifying our concern and creating a rather disappointing climate."
"The crisis over recent days in relations between Iran and the West has taken its ugliest turn."
"The possibility of military intervention against Iran would be disastrous and must be prevented, because another war in the area would create a chain reaction for security and peace, and not only for the area of the Middle East."
"The situation in occupied Iraq is still permanently destabilising."
"The recent disclosure by the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, that the USA had made a mistake in its assessment and that Saddam did not have nuclear weapons, shows the real reasons for the military presence of the USA in the area."
"The conclusions are, I think, obvious."
"The parliamentary elections due to take place in Palestine on 25 January, with which I shall be involved, will be carried out under the shadow of the pre-election period in Israel itself, where elections are to be held two months later, and will place Israel in a new, post-Sharon, era."
"Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority is working ceaselessly so that free and democratic elections can be held and the democratic opinion of the Palestinian people can be demonstrated once again."
"The Legislative Council and almost all the political parties in Palestine want Hamas to take part in the elections, so that it too can shoulder some of the responsibility for legislative work."
"This is expected to result in milder policies and, ultimately, disarmament."
"As for the election process in East Jerusalem, it would appear that the matter has been arranged in the same way as agreed by the Palestinians in 1996."
"This too really is something to Israel's credit."
"Nonetheless, I have my doubts as to the extent to which the Israelis will consent to a democratic and fair pre-election strategy being held in East Jerusalem as well, given that, generally speaking, it is hard for elections to be held under occupation."
"I shall mention just one incident which took place just yesterday: the Palestinian People's Party candidate for Jerusalem, Fadwa Khader, was arrested during a pre-election meeting by the Israeli occupying army and is now in jail for no reason."
"Elections to the new Palestinian Legislative Council will constitute the prospects and, once again, the proof that the Palestinians can operate democratically."
"We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union, have already done a great deal, as the Commissioner said, but we need to continue to monitor developments in the area very carefully and, at the same time, to exert pressure in all directions for substantive talks which will lead before the end of 2006 to important progress and, very soon I hope, to a final solution to the problem."
"."
"Mr President, good news from Iraq sounds, politically speaking, almost preposterous, yet, on the basis of recent, first-hand experience, and certainly in view of what I hear said in this House, I want to contradict that perception."
"In mid-November last year, I had the privilege of taking part, as a Member of this House, in a major international conference on democratisation in the Middle East, on which Mr McMillan-Scott has just spoken."
"The event was held in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Northern Iraq, where experts from Europe had the time, in absolute safety, to join with members of the Kurdish Government and Parliament in discussing, very frankly and openly, the prospects and problems associated with the development of democratic states under the rule of law right across that region."
"Iraq is thus fortunately much more than simply the rather depressing arena for incessant and appalling terror attacks."
"It is also in Iraqi Kurdistan that the European Union is being presented with an outstanding opportunity to make a substantial contribution to the urgent task of reconstructing Mesopotamia."
"I would very much like to hear from the Commissioner whether she shares with me this vision, and, if so, precisely what the Commission is already setting in motion in Northern Iraq, or what it is preparing to do there."
"At the same time, I can tell this House that our Kurdish counterparts in Iraq are looking to make contact with our Parliament."
"Will the Middle East become democratic?"
"Let us not leave it at recommendations on paper, but rather give it substance through our own personal and practical political dealings!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Palestinians living in the Arab sector of Jerusalem have been allowed to vote, but I believe that banning Hamas from campaigning is an extremely serious mistake and that Parliament, in my view, ought to formally condemn such a ban."
"It is also important to point out the Union’s commitment to the Palestinian people, even though I believe that we need to broaden this commitment politically at a time when the Union should be calling on Israel not only to improve the conditions for passing through and entering the West Bank and Gaza, but also to do away with that hateful barrier that fragments the Palestinian territory, divides local communities – and, in some cases, family units – and disrupts, if not completely destroys, a great many local Arab economies."
"The European Union must call on Israel to block any new settlements in territories that remain occupied and to stamp out any discrimination against Palestinians who are living in enclaves within Israeli territory."
"That is the commitment I call on Parliament and the Union to undertake."
"Good morning, Mr President."
"I should like to assure the Commissioner that she has our full backing for any measures she takes with regard to Gaza."
"We are delighted that the issue of East Jerusalem was cleared up during the meeting held by the Israeli Government last Sunday."
"We are also delighted at the news that weapons have been banned on the day of the elections in Gaza and the West Bank."
"We are closely following the latest developments in connection with Hamas."
"We are aware that we must apply the same standards and the same criteria to Hamas as to the armed wing of Fatah."
"The Delegation for relations with Israel is prepared to welcome General Pistolesi to Parliament, and to offer him our full backing for his activities."
"We will also be very happy to support the Commissioner in any steps she takes to bring pressure to bear on the Israelis to meet their promise to safeguard the free movement of persons, goods and information and, of course, to lend their full support to the Rafah Agreement."
"We are also making preparations ahead of the forthcoming debate on a definitive solution to the issue of East Jerusalem and its borders."
"Nevertheless, I should like to remind the Commissioner that a delegation of Lebanese parliamentarians, two of whom were members of Hezbollah, visited our Parliament yesterday."
"They strongly urged the EU to help Lebanon, and the thrust of their message was, without a shadow of a doubt, ‘save us from Syria’."
"We all know, however, that the main problem in the Middle East today is neither Palestine nor Syria, but Iran."
"I should therefore briefly like to comment, if I may, on a number of precautionary steps that we might consider taking with regard to Iran."
"For example, we should think about banning Iran from participating in the football World Cup to be held in Germany."
"We should consider suspending technical assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the present resumption of Iran’s nuclear programme."
"I would suggest to the Commissioner that we should think about banning Iran Air planes from landing in Europe, and about ways in which we could restrict the movement of high-ranking Iranian representatives."
"That being said, Commissioner, I should like, if I may, to make a very personal comment, speaking as someone born in the former Czechoslovakia."
"As a graduate in Arabic studies, I have been greatly alarmed in recent months, weeks and days at Russia’s growing ambitions in the Middle East."
"I am not talking merely about Iran, but also about Syria, Yemen and Iraq."
"We now have a unique opportunity to enlist Russia as a partner, and to tell the Russians that if they are capable of reaching an agreement with the Iranians, then they should go ahead and prove it."
"We should take Russia seriously as a partner, and we should tell them that if they can back up their words with action, then they should do so."
"If not, then they should not interfere in the Middle East, since such interference is dangerous."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the absence of peace in the Middle East is having increasingly dangerous consequences: threats to destabilise the Palestinian community and risks connected with Iran’s aggressive behaviour, scarcely tempered by anxieties about Syria."
"I appreciated the relative optimism of your opening words, Commissioner, but I think that things which go without saying are better said and I would like to help strengthen the grounds for optimism."
"The media are taking the view that, in the present situation, the disappearance of Ariel Sharon presages disaster and that the outlook is quite frightening."
"Indeed, Sharon seemed to be the only person capable of seeing through the astonishing process of unilateral partition that he had devised as a preparatory stage to peace."
"I really would like to stress that this is no time to panic."
"Contrary to the impression given by the media, great men do not make history on their own: institutions and situations have their part to play."
"On the Israeli side, there have for a very long time been two political obstacles to any prospects of peace."
"The first is that in the eyes of many Israelis and of Ariel Sharon, all processes of the Oslo, Taba or Geneva kind fail to take adequate account of the imperative of Israeli security."
"The second is that Israel’s largest right-wing group, Likud, has never, ever, in any way agreed to make the slightest concession whatsoever on its vision of Israel’s future, a vision of Biblical Israel, ‘ or ‘Greater Israel’, on the pretext of exchanging land for peace."
"Before he was taken ill, Ariel Sharon had removed both those obstacles."
"He had removed the first one by making visible and beginning to carry out a plan aimed at achieving peace gradually by partition."
"Many of us in this Parliament, Commissioner, do not like that plan. Too much violence, not enough talks, and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain."
"It is the only plan there is, however, and it has won over many Israelis, because it was the first to marry the absolute imperative of security with the prospect of peace."
"The second obstacle was removed because Ariel Sharon had the extraordinary courage to break with Likud."
"Even if Sharon has gone, a large new party has been born representing a section of the Israeli right that is willing to move towards peace because its mind has been put at rest."
"Tomorrow, that party may be the dominant force in the Knesset and join with other forces from the centre and the left."
"The party’s doctrine and that of its leader Ehud Olmert are not focussed on negotiation, but only on withdrawal from the occupied territories."
"We know that."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, the partisan mechanics of the Knesset can only move in the direction of deepening the split with Likud and of rapprochement with the parties of Amir Peretz and Schlomo Ben-Ami: Sharon or no Sharon, the necessary break has been made and the inevitable will follow."
"The Israelis sense this and are showing it in the polls."
"Not only must we not over-dramatise at this time, we must stand firmly behind this process, because even though the Palestinian community is strongly influenced by Hamas it will quite obviously follow. Peace, Commissioner, is today’s promised land and Moses, too, died before he could enter it."
"Mr President, when, in November, the Palestine Delegation met the Catholic bishop, Michel Sabah, he stated clearly that we should not obtain peace in the Middle East during the next 40 years if a just peace were not achieved in Israel/Palestine, involving a proper Palestinian state within bounds corresponding to the pre-’67 borders and not to Sharon’s enclaves."
"Jerusalem, which is also the Palestinians’ city, is part of the solution."
"Jerusalem is absolutely central."
"If Israel annexes the whole of Jerusalem, the key to peace will have been thrown away, and not only in that particular area but also in terms of relations between the Arab countries and the West."
"Bishop Michel Sabah’s words were in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of 7 November 2005."
"Here was a clear statement that Jerusalem should be kept as an open city, and for the Palestinians too, and a request that Orient House be reopened."
"This, however, is where the West’s double standards really come into their own."
"Israel is completely indifferent to the EU’s statements, for the Israelis know that none of the foreign ministers take their own words seriously."
"We even maintain Israel’s major economic privileges, despite the fact that they are expressly conditional on Israel’s observance of human rights, and the Council has just arranged for its own report on Jerusalem not to be published."
"At the same time, the EU is trying to buy its way out of anything to do with the Palestinians, for whom, in conjunction with Israel’s policy of apartheid, the EU and the United States are becoming entirely responsible."
"The fact is that Sharon wanted to call these walled-in enclaves a state, which would mean that Israel no longer had responsibility for the Palestinians under international law."
"Palestine would have no chance of creating a healthy economy on those conditions and would forever be dependent on others."
"Matters will undoubtedly end badly unless miracles now take place in Israel and the people of peace and justice acquire power, not only in Palestine but also in Israel, or unless a miracle almost as remarkable occurs and the EU at long last begins to take its own words and international law seriously and makes use of the resources to which Europeans quietly have access."
"Nothing will happen as long as the Council and the Commissioner do not even mention the settlements and the Wall and do not say a word about a proper state."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union’s role as a promoter of democracy and economic development and as an honest broker between the parties in the Middle East conflict must in my opinion be welcomed unreservedly."
"The fact that the EU is also sending many millions of euros to the Middle East is also justified in this connection – including the EUR 1.5 million you mentioned for the Palestinian elections, Commissioner."
"We also need to ensure, however, that the results of such democratic elections are accepted by all sides, even if the election winners include political forces – such as Hamas – that we perhaps do not like so much."
"If the EU wants to be an honest broker in the Palestine conflict, it must speak out much more strongly in favour of the two-State solution."
"Persuading Israel to offer the Palestinian territories the necessary space for democratic and economic development will be an essential step in this direction."
"Only a genuine improvement in the Palestinians’ living conditions will make them turn away from political radicalism and terror."
"If the EU is to be able to play such a valuable role as mediator in this very problematical geopolitical area, however, it must not become a front-line state or party to the conflict itself."
"That is why I would like to take this opportunity once again to warn against full accession for Turkey to the EU."
"That would put the European Union on the front line with Iran, Iraq, Syria and also, indirectly, with Palestine."
"Mr President, Mr Rocard’s excellent speech reminded me that in my earlier speech I failed to acknowledge his role as chief observer of the Commission delegation last January."
"At present, Mrs De Keyser, from this House, is chairing the Commission’s observer mission in Palestine."
"I should like to acknowledge that duty."
"I apologise in advance for having to leave early: I think I have caught a Strasbourg cold."
"I therefore thank the Commissioner in advance for her reply to my questions."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her work in assisting the efforts for peace in the Middle East and for enhancing the visibility of the European Union in the region."
"Two elections will dominate the developments in the Middle East in the coming months."
"The Palestinian election is significant because it is expected to yield a pluralistic result."
"Hamas will participate in that election and is expected to do well."
"This is the time for the European Union, among others, to convince and encourage everybody on the Palestinian side that there is only one way: the politically and democratically chosen way, which is incompatible with armed struggle or with terrorism."
"Also, the old and new guard of Fatah will find their distinct way of expressing themselves during the legislative elections."
"That is why the elections have to be free and fair: free from any restrictions on behalf of Israel and free from any manipulations from inside."
"The Palestinians must be able to campaign and vote freely in East Jerusalem."
"I hope that the international observers, including our own parliamentary mission, will be able to do their jobs freely, without hindrance and intimidation."
"The Israeli elections are also very interesting because there is now a renewed hope generated by the decision of Ariel Sharon to leave Likud and form a new political movement, joined by others, including Shimon Peres."
"The opinion polls have been indicating that we may now have, at long last, a stable Israeli Government in a truly pluralistic – rather than a multi-fragmented – Knesset."
"From the opinion polls it is obvious that Israeli public opinion is adhering to new ideas, giving hope to a pluralistic, realistic, secure, peaceful future, without the wooden positions of the past."
"Alas, the illness of Mr Sharon is of consternation for all of us, but let us trust Israeli society."
"In the context of the Middle East, we cannot ignore, have to be vigilant and alert to any external interferences from factors such as Iran, Hezbollah and other interconnected factors."
"It is imperative that the assassins of Rafiq Hariri are finally brought to justice."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the election of a democratic Palestinian parliament and the setting up of democratic institutions are the necessary preconditions for the establishment of a viable and sovereign Palestinian state which will live in peace and security next to a secure, peaceful and democratic Israel."
"Progressive, moderate forces in Palestine need to block the way to all the forces feeding the blind violence and clashes, to say no to the forces denying the existence of the state of Israel."
"It is these extreme Palestinian forces that are materially undermining the very prospects of the creation of a Palestinian state."
"All the political organisations have their place in the political system in Palestine."
"However, they have their place without weapons, without paramilitary approaches, without terrorist action."
"There needs to be – and I am calling today for – immediate intervention by the European Union and by you, Commissioner, for the release of the Palestinian parliamentary candidate in Jerusalem, Mrs Fadwa Khader, who was arrested and is now in jail."
"She needs and we call for her to be released immediately."
"I should like to touch on two major issues which relate to peace in Palestine and the Middle East: you referred to one, Commissioner, which is the drastic economic and social situation of the Palestinian people living in Gaza and the occupied West Bank."
"Your contribution is indeed important if this situation is to be rectified."
"However, there cannot be peace with poverty, with despair and with the marginalisation of the Palestinian people."
"This poverty, this marginalisation is the best ally of the extreme paramilitary organisations."
"The second issue relates to the unacceptable tactics which the Israeli authorities continue to apply to the occupied Palestinian territories, especially East Jerusalem."
"The illegal settlement is continuing, as are the de facto annexing of territory, the building of the wall and the compulsory purchase of Palestinian property."
"On 7 November, the Council of Ministers took certain decisions on East Jerusalem."
"On 12 December, the question of East Jerusalem was discussed again."
"I believe that the European Union should take immediate measures to respond to these unacceptable Israeli tactics."
"We should not feed the radicalisation of extreme Palestinian organisations any more and Israel bears a great deal of responsibility here."
"Mr President, this period is an important opportunity for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples."
"I expect the elections next week will result in Hamas being elected and represented."
"Europe must decide how to deal with them."
"We cannot exclude them, and indeed the Israeli Government must be encouraged to accept the will of the Palestinian people in respect of who they select as their representatives, no matter how difficult that may be for them – and I quite understand that it will be difficult."
"We have to engage with Hamas after the elections on a conditional basis to encourage complete abandonment of violent means in pursuit of its political objectives."
"The Israeli Government must come to realise that missiles, demolitions, apartheid walls and assassinations will not guarantee or bring it sustainable peace."
"Political engagement with the enemy is necessary, otherwise there will be no peace."
"Most of all, Israel’s current government must realise that a sustainable peace is not possible without a sustainable Palestinian State."
"A ‘Swiss cheese’ Palestinian State on the West Bank, with the Israelis controlling the cheese and the Palestinians controlling the holes, will not work and will not deliver peace to Israel in the long term."
"What has been absent up to now is a mutual respect for each other’s rights and for each other’s humanity."
"We must work to ensure that those two aspects of a political solution in the Middle East are developed."
". Mr President, may I thank the honourable Members for a very broad and interesting debate."
"The Middle East is a subject on which one could speak for hours, but I shall take up the most important points."
"Firstly, Mr McMillan-Scott raised the issue of funding a chamber for the Palestinian Council."
"We will have to await the outcome of the elections and see what government will be formed – I shall come back to the question of Hamas shortly."
"Then we will have to consult the Palestinians themselves to find out their demands and to see where we can support them."
"It will depend on that common vision whether we can support such a chamber."
"I do not rule it out completely, but it is really up to the Palestinians to ask for that."
"Secondly, you also asked how we could help the democratisation process."
"I think our Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan would be the best basis for such further democratisation, for the rule of law, which is one of the major issues and one on which we insist very strongly."
"For a year now we have had much better relations with the Israelis; on the one hand because Prime Minister Sharon kept his word on the withdrawal from Gaza – which was a step forward – and, on the other hand, because of the action plan, in which the Israelis are highly interested."
"I had a lengthy talk with Prime Minister Olmert on that subject."
"They are very interested in doing something."
"On your third question, I would say that we are very preoccupied about the sentence on Mr Ayman Nour, the leader of the main opposition party in Egypt."
"The Commission was very supportive of a Troika statement issued by the European Union immediately after the sentence."
"We will follow up the case in the Council meeting of Foreign Ministers on 30 January and then in our current negotiations on the action plan with Egypt – negotiations which, it must be said, are not easy."
"To return to Hamas, I know one of the crucial questions is what the government will look like after the elections."
"The polls show a possible share of the vote of between 30 and 40% for Hamas."
"Accordingly, I have very clearly stated that we will work with any government that will seek peace by peaceful means and will also respect the principles incorporated in our two major agreements."
"One is the interim association agreement."
"As I have already said, there is democracy, the rule of law, the basic principles that we all hold up."
"Secondly there is the action plan, in which there is a clear commitment to the roadmap."
"President Abbas himself made it very clear that the acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government."
"I know that the Israeli Government is very clear and adamant about certain things it demands of a future Palestinian Government."
"We will of course work with both parties on these issues, because we know how sensitive and crucial they are in order to make progress on those issues on which we all agree: the free movement of people and goods for the Palestinians, where I have announced the possibility of going forward with the airport; where we are starting the procurement procedures in order to make it possible to get more access for people and goods."
"At the same time, it is also important to see how a government can be formed in Israel."
"I agree with my Cypriot colleague, Mr Kasoulides, that an interesting situation is also arising on the Israeli side."
"With Prime Minister Sharon incapacitated at the moment, acting Prime Minister Olmet has taken over in a pragmatic, pro-European way – that is clearly what he stated – but in a way in which he can hold up the security question, which is the overriding question for every Prime Minister in Israel."
"Hopefully, things will go in the right direction."
"I do not want to interfere in any of these processes; we are still two months ahead of the Israeli elections."
"The important thing is that there is a leadership in the future that is able, capable and willing to go on with that."
"I agree with those who say that, as very clearly stated in the Quartet, we also have to speak out very clearly on the question of settlements, on the separation barrier."
"The Council’s report – it was a Council decision, by the way – has not been publicised, but it has already been covered in the press, so everybody knows what it contains."
"Finally, the important thing for us will be to work very closely with both sides because, as many others have said, the Palestine-Israeli conflict greatly influences the stability of the whole region."
"The situation in Iraq and the upcoming difficult situation with Iran do not help to improve the stability of the region."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every human being has the right to live in peace, to live in a democracy and indeed to life itself."
"Extremist factions must therefore understand that no nation may be wiped off the map."
"This was attempted in the past, even in Europe."
"Fortunately, such attempts proved unsuccessful, although they did lead to unspeakable suffering and to tragedy on an unprecedented scale."
"At this stage in the history of the Middle East, we should be focusing on the elections in Israel and the Palestinian Territories."
"Let us hope that the results of the elections will allow both peoples to move closer to a peaceful solution."
"The European Union should now concentrate on the political context."
"The Neighbourhood Policy, infrastructure, education, and social issues are certainly important, but the key to a permanent solution lies in politics."
"Unless the political situation is resolved there will be no progress along the road to peace in the Middle East."
"The situation in the Middle East remains a cause for concern, and is of direct relevance to us in Europe given the energy dependence of the EU on foreign powers, much as my own Scotland is in the happy situation of being a net exporter of energy."
"The political reforms underway in some Middle East countries are to be welcomed, and the EU could do more to support the growth of democracy in these countries."
"Current tension between the EU and Iran over the resumption of the Iranian nuclear programme can only be resolved long term by dialogue, and if we seek the position of honest broker then we must endeavour not to avoid double standards in our dealings with Iran."
"I would like to inform you that the Conference of the Presidents has just adopted its proposals on the membership of the Equitable Life Assurance Society Committee of Inquiry and of the Temporary Committee on extraordinary rendition."
"These proposals have been sent to all Members by e-mail and are now on Parliament’s website."
"The deadline for tabling amendments is this morning at 10.30 a.m. and the vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the future of the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective (2004/2219(INI)) (A6-0402/2005)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, gender equality has not been at the forefront of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Yet without the active involvement of women, the Lisbon agenda is bound to fail."
"Unfortunately, the gender dimension is conspicuous by its absence from European discourse and, more importantly, political action."
"Most of the documents produced by the European institutions and the Member States come very much from a male perspective."
"It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, ten years after the Beijing Platform for Action, women still suffer every form of discrimination – be it at work, in the family, in politics or in society at large – and that the reconciliation of family and working life has yet to be achieved, even though family life is acknowledged to be the main factor holding women back in the labour market."
"Unemployment stands at 10% for women and 8.3% for men."
"Women earn lower salaries, even though they have more qualifications; 58% of graduates and 41% of holders of higher degrees are women."
"Politics, business and society as a whole have yet to realise that reconciling the different areas of women’s lives is a politically and socially relevant question."
"Maternity must not be viewed as a problem for employers and for the economy."
"Rather than being problematic, in fact, it is actually a service provided to society, which helps to combat low birth rates and the ageing of the population, and to guarantee the sustainability of the social security system."
"It is therefore crucial that women should not be penalised for motherhood."
"The truth, however, is that women do not make progress in their careers, do not receive regular productivity bonuses, do not receive a share of company profits, and have to accept less significant and less professionally rewarding jobs."
"What is more, when a worker of either sex sees that company bosses are more understanding of those who want to leave early to pick up the car than those who want to leave early to pick up the children from school, this says everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the way in which the tasks traditionally assigned to women are undervalued."
"It should also be remembered that society is organised along lines drawn by men."
"It is they who set the timetables without regard for the fact that children need to be picked up from school and that the fridge needs to be stocked to feed the family."
"This is a problem for everyone, not just for women."
"Appropriate policies should be put in place to encourage people to share tasks in the home."
"Fathers should therefore be granted an inalienable right to parental leave following childbirth or the adoption of a child, without losing any employment rights."
"It has been demonstrated that the sharing of family responsibilities between men and women is the first step towards achieving much-needed reconciliation between home life and working life."
"With the same rights to a career as men, women must not be forced to do the same work as men outside the home and three times as much in the home."
"The involvement of women in the political, social and economic spheres is an essential factor in social progress."
"Gender equality is very much a modern, contemporary issue that needs to be part of the EU’s day-to-day political agenda."
"One of the EU’s key objectives should be equal representation in the political decision-making bodies."
"Integrating women into the decision-making process is a modern-day necessity and an absolute prerequisite in strengthening democracy."
"The time has come to abandon the notion that women are capable of working but incapable of making decisions."
"The road is long and full of obstacles but we must make our way along that road without wasting any more time."
"Women cannot sit around for more generations waiting for mentalities to change and for the system to regulate itself."
"They need to be proactive in the fight for the right to be on an equal footing with men, both in the public and private spheres, because nobody voluntarily hands over the power that they have held for centuries."
"One thing is for sure: if you have privileges you do not want to lose them; if you are sitting comfortably in the seat of power you will not get up unless you are required to do so."
"History has shown that men are less inclined to show their traditional chivalry in such circumstances."
"This report seeks to redress some of these problems."
"I therefore ask for Parliament’s support for this report and hope that once it is adopted the Commission and the Member States will take account of the proposals and recommendations contained therein."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contribution of the policy unit, of the secretariat of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and of those Members who tabled amendments."
"Thank you, everyone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and the motion for a resolution on the future of the Lisbon Strategy from the point of view of the gender perspective."
"It is a very useful contribution to our common agenda for growth and employment."
"You are clear and very much to the point in showing what the policy of gender equality can bring to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The persistence of major disparities between women and men really is a matter of grave concern."
"It is essential that we continue our efforts and consolidate the integration of the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, into all policies."
"The need to tackle the disparities between men and women in employment or education and, in particular, the pay gap and its causes must be at the centre of our concerns."
"It is important that we tackle the structural inequalities between men and women so that all can participate equally in economic and social life."
"This will mean implementing Community law better."
"It is important, however, that we tackle all the factors behind these discrepancies, such as the predominance of women in lower paid sectors, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, or, as you clearly point out, the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life."
"The questions of reconciliation between professional and private life are a key aspect of questions of equality."
"They must cover all possible aspects: the care of children and dependants, the organisation of working time, new forms of working, etc."
"You also underline that we all have a duty of good governance, involving in particular proper coordination between different policies, partnership between institutions and with the competent players, and statistical and analytical monitoring of our policies."
"The Commission fully shares these points of view, as evidenced by the annual report on equality between women and men that has been presented at the spring summit since 2004."
"The report identifies all these points as priorities for future action."
"The Commission’s commitment to equality between men and women will also be reflected in the roadmap for male/female equality that the Commission will be presenting shortly."
"It will highlight the governance aspect in particular, the importance of which you yourself have also very usefully emphasised."
"The Commission is also constantly monitoring equality policy in analyses and studies and by developing specific statistics."
"Studies are regularly carried out by experts. These studies are published."
"There was a study on reconciling professional and private life in 2005, for example."
"Finally, the Commission analyses the gender aspect of Member States’ national reform programmes in order to make an important contribution to the ‘employment’ chapter of the annual monitoring report."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on the excellent work she has done in this report."
"It forms part of the work begun with the Lisbon Strategy and, in my view, has highlighted an extraordinarily important factor for men and women in general and for women in particular: the ambitious target of attaining full employment in Europe by 2010."
"This target has been set because it is only by reaching that position that Europe will succeed in ensuring that its people have access to the welfare state, which is part of its history and culture and constitutes one of its greatest achievements."
"That is the first point I wished to highlight."
"The second relates to the target of full employment – 70% of people in work in Europe – taking account of the fact that some countries in northern Europe, like the United States, have already exceeded that threshold: there is no doubt that the presence of women in the job market is not only what women want but also what our entire Community needs."
"Mrs Estrela’s report, which we put forward and which the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality adopted, promotes the contribution of women with a view to fulfilling this objective."
"How?"
"Firstly, by emphasising the statistic that has changed our approach to assessing the data."
"I very much welcome the fact that, for many countries, having to talk of ‘employment rates’ now rather than the somewhat malleable concept of ‘unemployment rates’ signals an important departure, in the same way as having very accurate and precise statistics on all work-related activities and on the role of women in the job market will signal an important departure."
"The employment figures are still worrying."
"Clearly, what has happened in Europe over the past four years has not helped us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives."
"Some factors undoubtedly harm employment levels: the pay gap, which certainly does not make those women who do not need to go to work enthusiastic about doing so; and the need for lifelong training, particularly for older women who, like older men, are among those excluded from the workplace."
"Nevertheless, I believe that this resolution represents an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and that, together with the – as yet non-existent – resources, it will help us to meet the targets that have been set."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the Social-Democratic Group has taken on the task of drawing up Mrs Estrela’s own-initiative report and carrying out the mid-term review, and it has found that the gender dimension is being short-changed in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The motto ‘equal pay for equal work’ has already been mentioned."
"We have had that on paper for years, but it has not been put into practice."
"The reality is an EU average of 15% to something over 30%."
"Things cannot go on like that."
"In business, women are largely absent from executive positions."
"We even have good models outside the European Union – take Norway, for one."
"In Norway, the government has passed a law requiring 40% of supervisory board members in quoted companies to be women."
"Have the courage to take such initiatives, Commissioner, and make this part of the road map."
"The demand for independence must not be left only on paper."
"The social partners must be more active here."
"I am getting sick and tired of always hearing that it is because of women’s qualifications."
"As we have already heard, women are now better educated and there are far more women graduates than male graduates, but we have still not broken through the glass ceiling."
"There must therefore be other reasons why women are not coming through, and I have to say there is a lack of political will here."
"Again and again there has been much talk of good will here in this House and in the Commission."
"So where is the snag?"
"Why is it that women – even in politics – are still not achieving the breakthrough?"
"Here Mrs Estrela’s report is helping to stir us up again and to ensure that the role of men changes."
"Reconciling family and working life and gender mainstreaming are not matters for women alone."
"I am therefore asking you to increase the pressure."
"I am asking the Commission at long last to present the road map and not merely to describe the facts again but to be really courageous and move forward."
"The new Gender Institute will be an important and courageous step."
"It will enable us to demonstrate that Europe is taking equality seriously."
"I am therefore asking you to translate words into action."
"The Lisbon Model and the Lisbon Strategy can only be successful if women are fully integrated."
"Mr President, the fact is that the Lisbon Strategy, reworked in Gothenburg to include the sustainable development strategy, is aimed at achieving economic growth and social cohesion and at reducing poverty in the Union and, to this end, it states that the three complementary pillars on which it should be based are the economic, the social and the environmental."
"All three are equally important, Commissioner."
"Given that social inclusion within the Lisbon Strategy relates specifically to women, I would like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report, because it offers an excellent opportunity to remind the Council and the Commission of the need, where the gender perspective is concerned, to incorporate a transversal dimension into all of the Union’s policies."
"As the report states explicitly, better coordination is needed between the policy of gender mainstreaming, on the one hand, and the Lisbon Strategy on the other, with a view to taking systematic account of the gender perspective in achieving the ambitious Lisbon objectives, particularly in the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines, environmental policy − i.e. the REACH Directive − internal market policy − i.e. the Bolkenstein Directive on services − and, finally, the policies on integrating immigrants."
"Furthermore, there is also an obvious link between the Beijing Action Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy, and the need to take advantage of the productive potential of male and female European workers is therefore crucial to compliance with both agendas."
"Finally, as has also been said, we support the amendment presented by Mrs Gröner and Mrs Estrela calling on the Commission to make the reconciliation of family life and employment one of the priorities of the gender equality road map, which is currently under discussion, and, in cooperation with the Member States, the social partners and other actors, to review the suitability and effectiveness of Directive 96/34/EC."
"That review should focus on how to improve the situation of women and men with a view to reconciling family life and employment for both genders, which would be a key factor in terms of achieving gender equality in all aspects of life."
"Mr President, EU leaders promised to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010, yet more than half way through the ten-year period of the Lisbon Agenda this has not happened."
"In the light of this, the Lisbon Agenda’s pledge to tackle gender equality must also be viewed with a degree of scepticism."
"Mrs Estrela’s report put forward practical measures for ensuring gender equality, including employment opportunities for women, and I thank her for her very good work."
"The creation of employment opportunities is not about providing women with low-paid jobs or with less favourable working conditions."
"Such opportunities must have at their core equality for women on a par with their male counterparts."
"On average there is a pay gap of 15% across the EU, but in a recent survey in my country, Ireland, it emerged that the gender pay gap has grown: it has increased for women in spite of Ireland’s economic growth."
"Irish women are paid 17% less than Irish men for the same work, so it is clear, as Mrs Estrela says, that growth and jobs alone will not bring gender equality."
"President Barroso told Parliament yesterday of his commitment to the roadmap for gender equality, dealing amongst other matters with employment and with reducing the pay gap."
"I commend Mrs Estrela’s report to him and to Commissioner Michel as a good basis for progress in this area."
"The present emphasis on achieving growth at the expense of social inclusion, of working conditions and of environmental protection will not in any way lead us in the direction of greater gender equality."
"That needs to be addressed through positive action and not simply lip service."
". Mr President, when the Heads of State or Government of the Member States met in Lisbon and adopted the Lisbon Strategy, they acted as if they were directors of production companies."
"According to the aforementioned Strategy, the European Union was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, and was to overtake the United States of America."
"One of the long-term aims set was a 70% increase in the employment rate."
"This is to be achieved by raising the retirement age, thus depriving citizens of the restful retirement they are entitled to."
"Another aim set is to use human capital to greater advantage by making workers more productive."
"Europeans themselves are opposed to this, as they wish to have more leisure time and longer holidays."
"Certain Members of the House are very familiar with pressure of this kind."
"It was a feature of the Soviet Communist era, especially of the 1950’s."
"People were worked so hard that they would achieve 200% of the target set only to die of exhaustion before being awarded posthumous medals."
"In the spirit of gender equality, women are now also supposed to go out to work, instead of bringing up their children."
"The Strategy calls for the provision of day-care facilities for at least 90% of children over three years of age, and for at least 30% of children below three."
"Sadly, we are all too familiar with the results of a similar experiment that took place during Socialism’s darkest and most misguided period."
"Society needs to understand that no institution can ever replace a mother when it comes to caring for young children, even up to the age of seven."
"Only a mother can provide the kind of love that is essential for a child to develop properly."
"It would therefore be more appropriate for the Strategy to provide payments and pension rights for mothers bringing up their children."
"This would help reduce unemployment."
"More importantly, it would be the best investment we could make for our future, because children and young people are our future."
"We are opposed to treating individuals simply as units of labour and to the exploitation of women."
"Women should enjoy special protection, as it is they who bear and bring up the next generation."
"Mr President, at the March 2000 Lisbon European Council, the European Union set itself the ambitious target of reaching a 60% employment rate for women by 2010."
"I fully support those ambitions and very much hope they will not be in vain, because many ideas are put forward, plans made and dossiers and reports written on the subject of equality between men and women, but few concrete results are seen."
"Social, pay and professional disparities are always a live issue in France and throughout Europe, too."
"Whether it is the improvement of childcare services – in particular by increasing the number of facilities available – or the promotion of new forms of working such as teleworking to make it easier to reconcile professional, family and private life, all these measures are much more effective in helping to promote equality between men and women than the systematic forced application of the concept of non-discrimination advocated by certain feminist lobbies that are very active in the European Parliament and which they use at every opportunity and always for highly ideological purposes."
"I am pleased to say that my colleague Mrs Estrela’s report is along these lines."
"We will all gain from showing pragmatism and common sense."
"Finally, I think it is also particularly important to take account of the distinctive cultural and ethnic characteristics which often stand in the way of promoting equality between men and women."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated the problems of the participation of women in the productive process and their implications for our progress and social cohesion."
"However, it is the first time that we have had an integrated and global approach to the matter as in Mrs Estrela's report, which highlights the central position of the gender dimension in achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"I thank Mrs Estrela for her initiative and her work and the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality who took part in this endeavour."
"Other speakers have spoken about discrimination and the problems which women face today on the job market as regards their access and deployment and the particular problems which vulnerable groups face in our society, such as female immigrants and elderly women."
"Today we can see that no social model in the European Union has addressed this matter with any noteworthy success."
"However, the various experiences are worth studying and researching in depth, so that they can be used in the policy guidelines of the European Union and in efforts by the Member States."
"That is why I should like to ask the European Commission to address the issue of the different concepts and methods used to calculate participation in the job market."
"We do not all have the same definition of unemployment, seasonal unemployment and long-term unemployment."
"We therefore need to address these concepts in as uniform a manner as possible, so that we can record the actual situation and give the real dimensions and directions to our task, both in the European Union and in the Member States."
"Similarly, the Commission should take account of the significant differences in concepts and policies concerning parental leave, use of rights and so forth. We cannot talk about efforts to achieve the Lisbon objectives when there are so many different concepts and approaches in the Member States."
"I should also like to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the proposal in the Estrela report for a collective and global approach to the question of women."
"Mainstreaming, which is a European Union philosophy, must be incorporated into all policies and evaluations both in the European Union and in the Member States' action plans."
"Finally, I should like to ask you, in the European Commission's evaluations of progress made in achieving the Lisbon objectives and in evaluations of the various funds, to ensure that we always have this mainstreaming dimension. Our committee will be your ally in this endeavour."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Edite Estrela, who has done an excellent piece of work on which I hope you will be able to draw, Commissioner."
"How can we continue to aspire to making the European Union’s economy the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 without eradicating the continuing disparities between men and women?"
"Half way through the Lisbon Strategy, we can unfortunately only note a failure to achieve these objectives."
"The gender dimension cannot remain confined to only a few areas of this strategy."
"It is a horizontal and transverse element that cannot be ignored and cannot be reduced to a mere box-ticking exercise in an impact assessment."
"It means concentrating on the systems and structures that create and maintain inequalities and accentuate differences."
"Three percentage points more women than men are unemployed."
"33% of women work part time involuntarily compared to 6% of men."
"Only 10% of women achieve high-level positions."
"The pay gap ranges from 6 to 30% for the same work, despite equal treatment having been a fundamental principle of Community law since 1957."
"If Europe wants to reach its growth and employment targets, it is time to change the way people think."
"Women’s working hours must remain a choice and not a constraint that makes their position insecure."
"Women’s access to lifelong learning must be optimised."
"There must be a real political will to create measures for the family that will allow men and women to reconcile professional, family and social life: more childcare facilities at affordable prices, and more parental leave for men to allow them to give themselves more to bringing up their children."
"We must make the gender perspective an absolute priority as a matter of urgency and fulfil the promise of a Europe based on the values of democracy, equality and social justice for all – women as well as men."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy must not be confined to economic policy objectives, but it must also contain principles for strengthening social cohesion and sustainable development."
"We must make clear that gender equality also has a central role to play in the Lisbon process."
"We must also make clear that the Member States really must implement the Barcelona guidelines on childcare."
"Reconciling family and professional life must stop being pie in the sky and mere empty words; it must be at the forefront of the Lisbon process."
"We must also make the Member States’ responsibilities clear on this."
"We must also point out, however, that a lot of things need to be put under the microscope, such as social security and pension systems in the Member States, which are biased in favour of the childless and discriminate against families with children."
"We must have the courage to put all that under the microscope at last."
"We must also draw attention to the gender-specific wage gap that still exists in the European Union; it is between 15 and 33%."
"That must be a wake-up call for us to do more for gender equality in the European Union."
"We must make clear, furthermore, that alongside these better childcare objectives we also need to fight against the massive discrimination to which women are still subject despite having a higher educational attainment than men; we see this repeatedly with the wide pay gap in the European Union in particular."
"Greater flexibility in working hours in order to reconcile family and professional life should also be much more central."
"We are aware that demographic trends are an enormous problem in the European Union and that we must do all we can to really encourage people here."
"We must make clear that having children also brings happiness and enriches life, and we must provide incentives for families."
"We cannot stand by while child allowances and the like are basically only alms for families with children, which are quite clearly discriminated against by social security and pension systems."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, reality has borne out our frequent warnings that the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy only prioritised liberalisations and the flexibility of the labour market. Alongside the Stability and Growth Pact, this is having a detrimental impact in the social field, affecting women in particular."
"Stating that urgent measures must be taken to promote jobs, high-quality jobs and the social inclusion of women in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives is simply not enough."
"What is needed is to reverse the policies that are jeopardising equal rights and fomenting discrimination against women, especially in the workplace."
"As such, in addition to increased unemployment among women affected by the restructuring and relocation of multinationals and by industrial sectors affected by the liberalisation of internal trade, such as textiles, clothing, footwear and many others, the new jobs being created are increasingly precarious, badly paid and discriminatory, and fail to respect the rights of female employees."
"Even so, within the scope of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’, there are new proposals for a directive on the table that may exacerbate discrimination against women, worsen the unemployment situation and deepen social exclusion still further."
"These include the proposal for a directive on the organisation of working time and the notorious Bolkestein Directive on the liberalisation of the services sector."
"For this reason, it is impossible to go on claiming to be defending women’s rights while systematically undermining those rights, be it via the broad economic policy guidelines, or via policies and measures aimed at creating an internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that, at the very least, the Community institutions and the Member States take this report on board."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy set out the objective of an employment rate of 60% for women to be achieved by 2010 and a full employment rate for those available for work by 2010."
"This will not be achieved."
"The Lisbon Strategy is yet another way of damaging European economies through state interference and over-regulation."
"This report is typical of the socialistic approach so beloved of this Parliament."
"It recognises the problem, which is that the economies of Europe need to be more competitive and that Europe is rapidly losing its competitive position, but then sets about devising measures that are either irrelevant or will actually make the problem worse."
"The report recommends that Member States take measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged women, especially single parents, are guaranteed a minimum income."
"What could be more calculated to create unemployment than guaranteeing a minimum income for not working?"
"The report states that earnings and working conditions in many Member States, particularly in large commercial chains, are an affront to women’s dignity and are often the cause of miscarriages and disability."
"Absolutely no evidence is produced for this outrageous statement."
"I can assure you that any commercial chain in Britain that caused miscarriages and disability would soon find itself in the law courts."
"The way to ensure maximum employment for those people, both men and women, who want to work, is to get off the backs of businesses and deregulate."
"There should indeed be equal pay for equal work, and to help those parents who wish to stay at home and look after children we should lessen the tax burden on the parents who work, as indeed we should lessen the tax burden on all who wish to work."
"Such policies will never happen in the socialistic EU, which is another reason why Britain should leave the European Union and take the actions required to ensure economic regeneration and prosperity while it still can."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy is an excellent document but, as European Commission president Mr Barroso has told the European Parliament, it lacks realism."
"This is why I would like to welcome this report and to express my thanks to the author, who seeks to address in her text the issues of gender equality."
"Are we still trying to identify the goals of the Lisbon Strategy when the process is already into its second half?"
"To me this seems somewhat late in the day."
"In section I of the report the distinguished MEP refers to the Beijing Platform Fraction."
"It is deplorable that I was the only EU representative to attend, when the women’s rights conference in Beijing subjected the Beijing Platform and its practical implementation to its tenth assessment."
"My concern is that this report will turn out to be one of those that describe accurately the situation and status of women in the EU Member States, whether in terms of employment, social situation or health, but whose substance will not be applied in practice."
"I still entertain the hope that the report will not be put on the shelf, however, and my hope has been strengthened by the Austrian presidency, which includes women’s health among its priorities."
"Here again we encounter another problem, though, as the health care systems of the Member States are, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, subject to the purview and decision-making powers of the Member States."
"Since we know that the health sector in the EU member countries is going through an extremely difficult reform, health protection should be coordinated at an EU level."
"For a woman to be able to fill her position in society, be an equal partner in the workplace and a good mother, she must enjoy good health."
"The protection of female health in an ageing population should be one of the most important goals of the Lisbon Strategy, whether in the form of preventive examinations to detect breast cancer and cervical cancer or research into the causes of premature birth and increasing infertility."
"– Allow me first and foremost to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, and to the shadow rapporteurs and other members of the Committee for Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the work they have done in support of this own-initiative report."
"The report by Mr Wim Kok has convinced us that the Lisbon Strategy requires thorough revision from a gender equality standpoint as well."
"We must not forget the competencies of women and the special nature of their important role, and this applies in a context broader than the economies of the Member States."
"Finding a proper work-life balance requires us to take account of the social mission of women in improving the demographic situation in Europe."
"Under no circumstances should we overlook the formally unrecognised and still unpaid work that women are doing."
"To this end, we should develop the relevant methodology, along with evaluation techniques and statistical reporting."
"I am convinced that the social recognition and financial remuneration of this work will significantly enhance the economic situation and social status of women."
"Let me remind you of one of the conclusions and objectives of the European Council formulated in March 2000 – full employment in Europe, in a new emerging society that is better attuned to the personal choices of women and men."
"It is not enough to ensure that all people are employed."
"Under the communist regimes there was one hundred percent employment and we know what economic standards were like then."
"It is not enough for all citizens to be able to use computers and to apply the available information effectively."
"The primary focus of the Lisbon Strategy is an economic one, but the strategy can succeed only if it contributes to the cultural advancement of Europe as well."
"European cultural standards cannot be divorced from the issues of equal opportunity and gender equality."
"Europe will be credible only if the women, men and children inhabiting it do not have to endure extreme poverty and social exclusion, and only if its citizens can in their everyday lives think critically, comprehend social phenomena and communicate well, that is, humanely, with each other."
"Mr President, in the third millennium, a woman has to have the opportunity to decide whether she wants to work or stay at home."
"If she chooses to work, she has to be judged according to her performance, not according to her sex."
"Women hold the key to achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s overarching goal of creating more growth and jobs in the European Union."
"Increasing the participation of women in the labour market must be a top priority for the EU."
"Higher participation rates for women will help tackle Europe’s demographic challenges, as well as increasing growth and productivity."
"However, these advances must go hand-in-hand with greater gender equality in the labour market."
"Discrimination against women, occupational segregation and pregnancy discrimination exists on a large scale."
"Moreover, the gender pay gap persists across Europe."
"It currently stands at 15% for full-time jobs, but is as high as 40% for part-time jobs."
"The PSE Group believes in targeted actions to help promote the employment of the most vulnerable groups of our societies, namely older women, those belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities."
"The development of a knowledge-based society makes high demands on the educational level of the labour force."
"Girls are outperforming boys at school and more women than men participate in adult education and training."
"We must make better use of this potential and there must be a lifelong approach to ensuring gender equality from education through to career development and adequate pensions for women."
"We need to fight for a gender-equal society which is fit for the 21st century and forms an integral part of our European social model."
"Some progress has been made in recent years, but there is still so much to do."
"The onus for achieving the overarching goals of the Lisbon Strategy ultimately lies with Member States, which must urgently take up their responsibilities to ensure these ambitious goals are made a reality."
"– Mr President, the measures being proposed in the report being debated appear to want to address female unemployment and equality problems, but really result in cutbacks to and the abolition of any positive arrangements and rights achieved by women through the hard struggle of the working-class, grass-roots and women's movement."
"They relate to the application of the Lisbon Strategy."
"They promote part-time employment, employment with flexible hours, shift work and fixed term contracts in the home care, social, health and other sectors, thereby resulting in more intensive exploitation of women, less secure employment and, consequently, increased levels of unemployment and uncertainty."
"Commissioner, it is working women, it is working-class women who are being crushed by the anti-grass roots policy, because wealthy women have no such problems."
"The report also highlights the standard model and philosophy of the family as a production unit which solves the needs of its members."
"In our opinion, it is very, very dangerous."
"The responsibilities of the man are being increased in order to convince working-class families that responsibility for the reproduction of their members lies with them."
"Thus, you are putting the entire burden on the family, the problem of children and of health and of education and, at the same time, you are putting these sectors in the hands of crude traders, of dealers who buy and sell, and leading the working classes into an impasse."
"We consider that the measures lead away from the demand for women to be integrated into the social opus alongside a state policy which will help women and mothers and protect children and the elderly."
"These are proposals which ultimately aim to downgrade and further privatise and commercialise existing social services, with the consent of women and working class families."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Edite Estrela, for this own-initiative report."
"The recommendations in the report challenge the countries to take urgent measures towards attaining the Lisbon agenda goals of advancing employment, employment quality and the social inclusion of women, bearing in mind the major economic potential to be tapped by higher rates of women’s employment."
"If we are to meet the Lisbon objective of 60% employment among women in the Union by the year 2010, we must start implementing the relevant measures in practice."
"The Member States and the Commission should continue to focus on taking effective measures in support of growth, primarily among Europe’s poorest regions, where the lack of jobs forces people, primarily women, to accept jobs with large retail chains in many Member States involving humiliating working conditions, unacceptable hours and extremely low pay."
"I know what I am talking about, as I live in the outlying region of Prešov in Slovakia, where the average unemployment rate is around 23% and the average [monthly] pay is about SKK 12,000, which is approximately EUR 300."
"It is extremely important to establish a business-friendly environment, to promote the business spirit of women and ensure the availability of micro-credit to help women start up their own businesses."
"The position of women in countries with a functioning micro-credit system has changed significantly."
"Additionally, it is necessary to ensure that women enjoy better access to post-university level education and life-long learning, as well as to new technologies and the Information Society so as to enable them to cope with the competition in the labour market."
"To ensure that EU enlargement acts as a catalyst for improving gender equality policy in the new member countries, we must also improve the standards for implementing measures in national legislation that are intended to eliminate gender inequality in employment, remuneration and/or political representation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that women are a key to meeting the Lisbon objectives and, hence, deserve the attention of European institutions and governments of the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur’s report highlights a worrying and, unfortunately, often overlooked fact: the inequality between women and men in research persists and is preventing compliance with the Lisbon objectives."
"In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we had hoped to obtain more resources for research in the new budget."
"More and better research and, therefore, more resources for research together constitute the most crucial weapon in the fight for competition and growth in Europe."
"Unfortunately, the budget negotiations recently struggled through resulted in insufficient priority being given to research."
"That is a great pity."
"The strategies in the Lisbon Agenda are the guarantee of Europe’s future."
"Even though the EU’s research programmes only constitute a small portion of total resources for research in Europe, we must think very carefully when we set our priorities."
"The very fact that European women are still under-represented in the research world, despite women now being better educated than men, signifies that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited."
"That is something that, emphatically, we must do something about."
"Few high-ranking female academics have spouses and children, while their male counterparts, more often than not, do."
"Young female candidates have difficulty obtaining research posts."
"Throughout Europe, most newly qualified candidates are, in actual fact, women but, higher up the career ladder, men are still firmly ensconced."
"Now, in particular, it is important to be aware of the fact that women are more vulnerable than men, for the competition for research funds is tough."
"We must increase the proportion of top women academics and PhD students in order to meet the challenges we face."
"Investing in education, research and innovation is our only opportunity for coping successfully in the knowledge-based economy."
"The unexploited female potential for research is the nuclear power of the future."
"We must become better at encouraging young women to choose a research career, and we must at the same time secure better conditions for both women and men in the research world."
"For example, by far the majority of research posts in Europe are at present temporary and, if we do not remedy that state of affairs soon, public research will end up taking second place behind private research."
"In the longer term, this may mean that most university teachers will be women, reflecting the situation further down the education ladder in the school system, while men find employment in industrial research, which is better paid and more prestigious and in which only 15% of researchers are at present women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot to be done if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and one thing must be clear: we will only get there with women."
"There is still an unreasonably wide pay gap between men and women in many Member States."
"There is still discrimination over promotion."
"The family still has to fit in with the job."
"Jobs ought to be geared to the needs of families, however."
"All areas certainly need to be thought through with an eye to gender mainstreaming, but they must also be thought through with an eye to family mainstreaming."
"New approaches need to be found here."
"We agree and do not like saying all that, but women still need greater support to develop their entrepreneurial spirit."
"Women make a contribution to Europe’s economic efficiency and competitiveness."
"Education and lifelong learning are the keywords."
"The greatest potential of Europe’s citizens is and remains their knowledge and that must continue to be promoted on a basis of equality."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, for going into the many issues thoroughly in her report."
"Mrs Thomsen has referred to the area of ‘women and research’, and I would like to highlight another field, namely domestic employment in the private sphere."
"There is basically no sensible reason at all for treating a job in the household differently from a job in industry or commerce."
"If a husband and wife go out to work and someone is engaged to do the housekeeping, that is a job, not a private pleasure."
"On the other hand, if our families were provided with competent domestic services – both in caring for and raising children and young people and in looking after and nursing the elderly – large areas of social work would be effectively covered and valuable jobs created at the same time."
