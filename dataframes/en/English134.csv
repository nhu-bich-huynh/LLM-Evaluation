"We are going through a difficult economic period, which is bringing with it successive mergers in the aviation sector and which is governed by uncertainties for the airlines and their employees."
"For three consecutive days in April, the international industry lost USD 400 million a day, threatening to blow efforts to restructure the financially weaker airlines in Europe sky high."
"What is certain is that suitable institutional instruments to conduct a risk analysis at European level and to use a specific method to process all the data at the disposal of the Member States and the European authorities were, and still are, lacking."
"The risk of a repetition of the highly damaging confusion which we experienced beneath the ash cloud is real and the measures taken must institutionally safeguard the Union's ability to intervene in a coordinated and premeditated manner in this type of crisis, thereby limiting the incredible inconvenience to millions of passengers and the financial losses to carriers and tourist companies."
"Madam President, as Ireland does not have a land connection to mainland Europe, Irish air passengers have faced extreme difficulties;"
"I would venture to say, more than any other Member State. For example, I myself travelled to Strasbourg this week overland, and had to take a ferry to Wales, a car to Folkestone and a train to Strasbourg."
"I raise this because it is typical of the many journeys undertaken by Irish people in recent weeks."
"The EU Transport Ministers have established three separate flying zones based on the safety risk to aircraft."
"I have to say that, since the introduction of the third zone, over 300 000 hours of airline operations have taken place."
"This is a welcome development and, of course, further measures are still needed."
"I strongly support the efforts to fast-track the introduction of the Single European Sky concept."
"The Declaration of Madrid, adopted in February by the Spanish Presidency, established a roadmap for putting this policy in place."
"I have no doubt that the Commissioner, who is with us this evening, will spearhead this."
"The role of Eurocontrol must also be closely examined."
"It must be given statutory powers as opposed to the coordinating role which it currently holds."
"As early as yesterday, a joint agreement was reached between Ireland and the UK so as to curtail the disruption of air travel: a welcome development."
"(GA) Volcanic ash does not recognise any political or physical borders and this incident reminded us once more of the immense power of nature."
"It is now clear that there is a real need for a common air transport policy in European Union airspace."
"The role of the European Union must be strengthened in the aftermath of this crisis."
"(LT) The consequences of the volcanic ash crisis had a negative impact on the transport system of all of Europe when ash from the erupting volcano forced the cancellation of more than 100 000 flights and disrupted the journeys of 10 million passengers."
"This crisis affected the European Union's Eastern Member States particularly badly, as they remained completely isolated from Western Europe and, unlike other EU Member States, did not have the opportunity to choose alternative modes of transport."
"Yet again, this proves the importance of the development of transport infrastructure, the development of Trans-European Transport Networks and the creation of a system of alternative means of transport, both for transporting goods and passengers."
"Therefore, we must establish a passenger transport system that operates effectively, which is not so dependent on air transport, but is dominated by other alternative types of transport, especially for transport in Central Europe."
"We really must create a transport system that would not only ensure the effective transportation of passengers, but the smooth functioning of the economy."
"I agree with the ideas mentioned on the realisation of additional links and I therefore urge you to support the European rail corridor project for the competitive transportation of freight, which would allow the Baltic States mentioned to be linked to other Western European countries and would allow the creation of added value for the entire Community."
"In addition, following the implementation of this project, the region's residents would have an alternative to air transport."
"(ES) Madam President, I am going to talk about tourism, a fundamental sector for the Canary Islands, which receive around 12 million tourists per year."
"If there is one thing that tourism needs, it is certainty."
"Situations like the one that we have experienced - and which may be repeated - have dramatic consequences for this strategic sector for the Canary Islands."
"The losses have not only been suffered by the airlines, the airports and the tour operators: hotels, car hire companies, restaurants and services in general have suffered huge damage."
"Between 15 and 23 April alone, 313 818 aeroplane seats were cancelled in the Canary Islands, with losses of around EUR 57.3 million as a result of the tourists not coming."
"This is, of course, a significant loss."
"We need immediate measures when the event occurs, such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public, the passengers, properly; but we also need compensation."
"I am not going to criticise what was done or what was not done or say whether the crisis was managed well or not."
"It is only worth being aware that it could happen again and that we need to be prepared for it."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your steadfastness when it comes to passenger safety issues."
"In recent days, we have seen that it is clearly not only in the financial sector that major speculation takes place but that a few of the airlines, too, are prepared to gamble with the safety of passengers, at least in words - though luckily not yet in actions."
"After all, we are not merely talking about the passengers in the air, but also the people on the ground."
"I must ask you to continue working to this end."
"I must also ask you to continue working for passenger information and passenger rights."
"Over recent days, we have seen that not everyone and not every age group has unrestricted access to the Internet."
"Telephone lines were broken, the Internet was not available, and people who are not routine business class fliers like we here in the plenary are, tourists and older age groups, had hardly any information."
"I must ask you to continue working to this end."
"(PT) Madam President, the situation created by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland has demonstrated the significant impact that a certain type of natural phenomena - that are fortunately rare, but demonstrably occur periodically - can have on the economy and society."
"By doing so, it underlined once again the importance of a preventative approach to these phenomena."
"In this case, that means seeking to adopt any measures that reduce the aforementioned impact, not preventing it from happening, as that is clearly impossible."
"However, it is not legitimate to use a pretence at better crisis coordination in response to these phenomena as a pretext for seeking to breathe new life into a broad range of initiatives."
"I am talking about the Single European Sky initiative and the goal of opening European air traffic control up to liberalisation and then privatisation."
"In this regard, if there is one thing that the current volcanic ash crisis has confirmed, it is the importance of keeping air traffic control in the public domain: it is done in the public interest and is, first and foremost, a basic guarantee of public safety."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about disturbances in air traffic and also its economic impact on aviation."
"I would like to stress, once again, that the safety of Europe's citizens is the most important thing."
"Commissioner, many steps have been taken and it is now time to contemplate specific alternatives and to implement them, for example, the expansion of the trans-European high-speed network, which can also help reduce CO2 emissions."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are 2 000 volcanoes around the world, 50 of which are active."
"Thus, it is not just a European problem, but a problem for international aviation."
"We need to clarify in the research where exactly there are risks and where there is also a certain scope of responsibility."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner, together with Eurocontrol, to perhaps entrust the European Research Council with the task of carrying out research in order to properly judge this risk."
"Ultimately, the final responsibility always lies with the aircraft captain and consumers are also called on to consider whether or not this poses a risk for each of them."
"Everyone can remove the risk by simply not flying."
"An objectification of the entire issue must be at the heart of things, however."
"Madam President, the Joxer character created by the great Irish playwright, Sean O'Casey, observed the whole world as 'in a state of chassis'."
"And certainly the evidence is there for all to see."
"If we look downwards, we see oil gushing from an oil well, decimating the environment; if we look upwards, we will see volcanic ash gushing from a volcano decimating the airlines, and if we look outwards, we see recession gushing from the banks decimating the economy."
"Certainly I have suffered, like many more, from the volcanic ash, the first time going home: it took me two days;"
"I had to hitchhike part of the way."
"The second time I could not get out to the last plenary; it took me one and a half days to go to Brussels and one and a half days to come here, but the one thing I have learned is that it is impossible to book a ticket on the Eurostar when you are travelling."
"You need your credit card to book it and you need it to get the ticket, which is impossible when you are in transit."
"I would ask the Commission to use their influence to try and get them to have the same system as that which applies to ferries and airlines."
"(ES) I am not the only one, Madam President, but thank you."
"I just wanted to add that we need to be able to extensively use all the available technology in order to measure the ash."
"In fact, a few days after the closures, in a visit to Astrium in Toulouse, we were told about an extremely detailed information system on the composition of the atmosphere via a satellite network, and we are not clear as to whether this existing systematic information was used, which, moreover, comes from a European enterprise, namely the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company."
"Could the Commissioner tell us whether it was used or whether this is being considered?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much for the many interesting and detailed comments on this ash problem."
"I only had three minutes at the beginning."
"Now I can elaborate at least 10 times more on all these issues, but I will be brief - do not worry - or at least not too long."
"I can only say that it has really been a very exciting and extraordinary period, and it is back again."
"It is clear that volcanoes continue to erupt as this Icelandic volcano is doing."
"This is all part of life for the aviation industry, but it is not only volcanoes but also thunderstorms, snow and such occurrences which all disrupt aviation."
"This is a part of this business, we must be very clear about that."
"Nobody alone can be responsible for this risk - no airlines, no governments, no European Union."
"I must also say that so far, the European Union has no jurisdiction at all in regulating air traffic."
"It has been intergovernmental bodies that have been dealing with this so far, as well as national authorities."
"To exclude, prevent or foresee everything which can happen in aviation is impossible."
"The risks must be shared and clients who decide to use aviation services must be prepared - as we must all be - for some delay if, for example, the runway at Brussels airport is not cleared of snow or some other thing."
"Regarding the criticism that we acted late and regarding who in fact acted: I was there in Eurocontrol; the risk from ash is a real risk, and we cannot hold out for the possibility that we will finally find scientific solutions concerning what size of particle would be considered dangerous for engines, because nobody wants to give this assessment."
"We can determine particle size and we can assess the cloud, but nobody wants to give an assessment and to say that this ash is no longer dangerous for the engines."
"This will be a very complicated thing."
"The decision to close airspace was taken strictly in accordance with the existing rules and with all relevant institutions who were responsible for this."
"To those who ask who is now responsible for the closure of airspace, I would ask them who would be responsible if the airspace had not been closed and something had happened."
"When Eurocontrol sought to find some different approaches to the ash cloud, it was not an easy decision or easy discussion because it was a matter of deciding to take enormous responsibility for the safety of aviation."
"The safety of planes and lives must come first."
"I think it was done reasonably fast under these circumstances because the volcano was, and continues to be, very exceptional and extraordinary."
"Regarding the future, the key issue mentioned by somebody is what about Indonesia, what about the United States?"
"There is a responsibility, which mainly rests with the pilots."
"In Europe today, pilots tend to reject this kind of new responsibility."
"European air traffic is very busy and there must be some kind of combination between greater flexibility and clear data about the possible threats and possible risks."
"I do not know about Indonesia, but in the United States, the system is very simple: it is the pilot who decides how to circumvent the ash and I must say that this works very well."
"But in Europe, we must obviously first create some common approach to the methodology of possible assessment of risk."
"Regarding passengers, I must say that we have always consistently and forcefully stated from the Commission side that passenger rights legislation must be complied with."
"This is a very clear message."
"Again, the enforcement of this legislation is in the hands of Member States but I understand that most airlines and most Member States also have taken this very seriously."
"There are different examples and, of course, in the aftermath, there will be exposure to negative examples as well, but mostly they have been taken seriously, and we are planning a revision of passenger rights."
"We will definitely then assess what to do with the attempts to abuse passenger rights and excessive interpretations of passenger rights."
"In general, the passenger rights legislation has worked very well and the logic must be there."
"Passenger rights stipulate that passengers must be provided with information, with care and with rerouting or reimbursement under these extraordinary circumstances, not compensation."
"This is a different word."
"There is a huge programme under way with the Single Sky initiative in order to streamline air traffic management, and I cannot complain about the cooperation between Member States during this particular period."
"The Transport Council was very cooperative and made many decisions which probably, under other circumstances, would have taken much longer."
"I really cannot say that we had bad cooperation with Member States in preparing and handling this extraordinary Transport Council."
"Regarding finance and financial consequences, its rules are very simple and they are very clearly described in our paper prepared by three Commissioners - Rehn, Almunia and myself."
"This is State aid, and State aid can be given if Member States consider that there are enough reasons to give State aid to an airline which is in trouble, because passenger rights and all these costs must be borne by the airline."
"If the airline is in trouble and if a Member State considers that this is really a very bad situation, then State aid can be given, but, before State aid is given, a very careful assessment must be made not to create distortions and unfair advantages in the market."
"This was the main concern of airlines as well, and a fair approach to everybody is also the Commission's concern; our competition department will definitely look very carefully at all possible State aid cases."
"So far, I do not know if anybody has applied for State aid in this particular area because, as I said at the beginning, airlines have contingency plans."
"Somebody mentioned that they should have insurance."
"I asked them as well about the insurance."
"Insurance is more or less impossible because you cannot describe the product, or you can describe the product but it will be so expensive that it is not affordable."
"They have contingency plans on how to deal with extraordinary circumstances which disrupt the schedules."
"Of course, as an economist, I can see that there is a lot of room for different fantasies, what to calculate under the losses and what is a real number."
"It is a huge work to define the exact consequences of this volcanic ash which can be presented as a claim."
"Regarding alternative transport, we will, of course, push ahead."
"We will have a TEN-T meeting soon where the Commission will push ahead for the development of a network of other modes of transport."
"I asked railways what is possible and what they actually did during this crisis, and they sent a lot of interesting information."
"There were additional trains, but the information about availability, timetables and other things remain, so far, very poor."
"One of our biggest priorities for the near future will be to have better information about all these possibilities."
"Again, if there is a crisis in aviation, then bringing passengers home or taking them to destinations will still mainly be in the hands of airlines."
"It is at the planning stages that it is very important to also consider other modes and indeed other engines."
"This is another interesting story."
"There are lessons to be learned, and we are learning these lessons, and we will push forward with many plans and measures to create more streamlined air traffic management in Europe."
"I must stress that volcanoes do not obey any rules, and we cannot exclude possible extraordinary events."
"There will always be some risk which must be taken into account, and such a risk must be part of planning our activities."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when a volcano erupted in Iceland in the 18th century, the country was veiled in a cloud of ash, and in Europe crops failed for the next three years."
"We do not have reports on the damage to air transport."
"This year's far smaller eruption of Eyjafjallajökull has literally wrought havoc with air transport in the European Union."
"The damage to airline companies and airports - in other words, the direct damage - has had a counterpart in the chaotic care given to travellers stranded in various corners of the world."
"The rights of passengers are certainly an interesting topic for academic debate, but in this case, they were the lowest priority for the staff concerned."
"We have no reports of other forms of transport being used to bring people home."
"The chaotic responses show a lack of coordination, and also hesitation, at a time when quick decisions should be made on re-opening air space."
"Commissioner, will the Commission speed up its work on applying the partial results of the SESAR programme to the practice of managing aviation operations?"
"My other questions would merely repeat the questions of Brian Simpson."
"There are 56 000 citizens of the European Union who are ill and waiting for a transplant, and this includes 2 000 in Poland."
"Every day, 12 people die because of the shortage of organs available for transplantation."
"Organ donation rates range from less than one donor per million individuals in Bulgaria to 34-35 donors per million individuals in Spain."
"In Poland, the figure is 11."
"Most organs are taken from deceased donors on the grounds of prior consent (the opt-in approach) or presumed consent (the opt-out approach)."
"In Poland, cells, tissues and organs can be taken from deceased donors if the person who has died had not registered with the Central Register of Objections."
"The development of transplantation requires an atmosphere of social approval for filling in the declarations of will which make it possible to take organs after the person has died, as well as condemnation of opposition to donation."
"I, personally, am actively involved in work to promote transplantation, and I encourage all fellow Members to do the same."
"In Poland, I have distributed badges and bracelets which encourage support of transplantation medicine."
"With fellow Members from other political groups, I have started the 'Chain of Relatives', a national social campaign to propagate transplantation and voluntary blood donation."
"Promoting the idea of transplantation and coordinating the exchange of experience between Member States can save thousands of lives."
"It is essential to create a common EU database of organs available for donation and transplantation, and a database of all living and deceased donors."
"This would also be a significant tool in the fight against organ trafficking and human trafficking."
"The affair of the Icelandic volcano and its current consequences lead us to reflect that the European Union must not be unprepared for an emergency or unexpected occurrences, but must protect passengers above all else using existing or new management instruments or measures."
"As an example of such measures, could airline companies not have offered to buy train tickets to avoid long queues at train ticket offices, especially for passengers with reduced mobility?"

"Mr President, everyone is aware that we are living in a period of exceptional financial turbulence."
"This has been the case for a few months, and the origin does not go back a few months, but a few years, when the subprime crisis occurred in the United States."
"The origin was, therefore, a financial crisis in the private sector of the financial system, which rapidly became something that was affecting the real economy in the form of a deep depression, which, technically speaking, was a deep recession."
"This involved a decline in production and a significant increase in unemployment, which was particularly serious in those countries in which the property or residential construction sectors had a significant influence."
"There was an immediate reaction from the Member States and the central banks in order to prevent the financial system from collapsing, and there was also a reaction in relation to the real economy."
"This reaction, of course, had consequences for public economies and public finances."
"We are now no longer talking about private finances, but about public finances."
"Firstly, there was a crisis of financial stability in public accounts as a result of very marked deficits."
"There was also a crisis in sovereign bonds."
"This is what has been coming to the surface in recent months, encouraged by the actions of very volatile markets which, at times, have even been clearly speculative."
"These actions have also caused a significant rise in the interest that the markets require from the Member States when they are going to issue bonds."
"Moreover, this clearly affected the whole of the euro area, and therefore became a problem affecting not one, two or three countries, but the stability of the whole of the euro area."
"That is the situation."
"Those are all the events, or the diagnosis of the facts that the European Union has taken into account in order to react and act in response to this, and I feel that the EU has acted correctly throughout this period."
"It may have appeared slow to take decisions."
"It may, at times, have seemed to be exasperatingly slow to take some decisions, but it has achieved the right results, the results of prudent action by the EU and, more importantly, coordinated action by the EU."
"Although it might appear that various measures prevent us from seeing the whole, I believe that the EU has established an appropriate strategy for the circumstances, which has to include some short-term measures and look more towards the medium and long term, as it is about preventing such a crisis from occurring again."
"As we have already said, the short-term measures involve an injection of public money and coordination by the European Union: what is known as the European Economic Recovery Plan, backed by the Commission; a plan that coordinates this immediate action, this shock treatment that the Member States are adopting in order to limit the damage done by this huge crisis, but not make it disappear."
"One manifestation of this short-term action is undoubtedly the aid to Greece, which had already been warned by the Commission months before about a difficult situation in its public accounts."
"The Council is making a series of recommendations to Greece in relation to Article 126(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the Council and the Commission are monitoring developments there."
"Not only are recommendations being given in relation to the liquidity of its public accounts, but also regarding structural reforms in the pensions system and the need to undertake reforms in the health system."
"Then came 23 April, when an action mechanism was adopted regarding Greece."
"Yesterday, this mechanism was manifested for the first time in funds being sent to Greece by EU countries through the system of this agreed mechanism."
"This is therefore the first expression of this short-term action, which is essential when a Member State is in serious difficulties, as is the case with Greece."
"Naturally, also in the short term - and this was expressed very clearly in the oral question put by Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Schulz and others - we need to have a strategy to get us out of the crisis."
"It needs to be a measured, controlled strategy and, of course, it needs to be aimed at avoiding the very serious difficulties in public accounts, but it also needs to maintain the objective of growth."
"However, obviously a short-term strategy is not enough."
"We need to take medium and long-term measures. There are structural problems in the European economy; structural problems that were ultimately responsible for weakening Europe in the face of a highly volatile situation of extreme financial turbulence."
"The European Union is taking and suggesting measures in the medium and long term that it is important to point out."
"This is firstly the case because they are going to respond to the type of crisis that occurred as a result of this serious economic situation affecting the whole of the EU and, in particular, the euro area system."
"In order to be able to respond to the crisis in the financial sector, the European Union has planned a series of measures that are being debated in the next few days in Parliament: a supervision package, which I hope will be adopted as soon as possible."
"I also hope that the Council and Parliament will reach an agreement in this respect."
"As part of this package, or in relation to it, the Economic and Financial Affairs (Ecofin) Council adopted a measure yesterday: the regulation of hedge funds, alternative funds or high-risk funds."
"I refer here to the question by Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit, who place a great deal of emphasis on this aspect."
"The perspective of action in the G20 also needs to be taken into account, also implementing what has been agreed in the G20."
"Likewise, we have said that the European Union has structural weaknesses and that structural reforms are needed."
"The Europe 2020 strategy aims to do this, and it is based on the commitment of the Member States to tackle certain objectives through a series of integrated guidelines."
"These guidelines are also going to be accompanied by national plans, which will be designed in what are known as the reform plans."
"It should also be said that, along with the Europe 2020 strategy, the action that the Commission is adopting in relation to the whole of the production system is also important."
"In its communication on 12 May, it proposed the coordination of economic policies."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is therefore a way of responding to the underlying problem in the productive economic system, preventing these fundamental weaknesses in the system in the future and making the Union's economic system competitive and productive."
"It is also a way of aiming towards the objectives of technological added value, taking into account the social impact and therefore the need for specialisation in the labour market, employability and also combating climate change."
"There is not, however, only a problem with the private financial system, with the productive structure, and essentially with the private sector: there is a problem with public accounts, which is also the focus of another aspect of the EU's medium and long-term measures."
"These are the measures in the Commission's proposal of 12 May, which the Ecofin Council began to debate yesterday and will continue to debate."
"These measures are aimed at maintaining budgetary discipline, guaranteeing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and establishing measures to resolve and prevent crises."
"With this in mind, a task force has been created, which is going to meet for the first time this Friday, 21 May, chaired by President Van Rompuy."
"Its objective is budgetary discipline and it will be using the Commission document on coordinating economic and budgetary policies presented by Commissioner Rehn."
"This relates to all the more long-term measures, in which we also need to include the debate that is beginning in the EU about tax on benefits in the financial sector and a tax that even the G20 is beginning to talk about, which is a tax on financial transactions, which is, in turn, being debated in the EU."
"This is something that Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit emphasise in their question."
"On this subject, it should be said that all the European Union institutions are working towards this."
"It was discussed at the European Council in December of last year."
"The International Monetary Fund was given the task of conducting a study on a tax on international financial transactions."
"It was discussed in the European Council in March, the Commission proposed it on 1 April, and it was also discussed in the Ecofin Council."
"This is, therefore, another measure that will undoubtedly be discussed at the G20, and which is of the utmost importance; these are what I have called the medium- and long-term measures proposed by the EU."
"Yesterday, for example, at the EU-Latin America Summit in Madrid, a reform of the financial system was also proposed."
"In other words, the European Union is raising these issues in all the forums that it attends."
"In short, Mr President, the steps are being taken and the conditions are in place to move towards what has been described as economic governance of the Union."
"The European Council is playing an active role in this, along with the Commission and Parliament as the legislative and controlling body."
"So I think we can say - to conclude, Mr President - that it is true that the crisis has clearly demonstrated the shortcomings of the European monetary union in the absence of economic union, something that is provided for in the treaties but does not exist in reality."
"We have remained in monetary union, but we are not moving on to economic union."
"These measures adopted in the short, medium and long term by the EU are clearly taking the Union along a path towards economic union."
"This crisis has weakened our economies and put the Union to the test, but it has not destroyed it, it has not fragmented it."
"The European Union has responded and, at times, we have felt that it has done so slowly, but it has acted surely."
"At times, it seems that it has been hesitant, but it has been united, and its response has been correct and appropriate to the challenges that we face at the moment."
"I hope that the European Council in June will consolidate this move towards European economic governance, towards a united reaction to this crisis from the EU."
"I therefore also hope that it will adequately prepare the EU's common position for the extremely important G20 meeting in Toronto on the regulation of the financial system and for the important debate on taxing international financial transactions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome this debate on the crisis response of the European Union and on the immediate and longer-term challenges of economic governance we are facing."
"I shall start with the immediate challenges and the crisis response."
"Ten days ago, the European Union took bold and necessary decisions to safeguard financial stability in Europe."
"It was a dual response to the aggravated crisis, which had turned into a systemic challenge to the euro."
"It was a response that I would call a consolidation pact."
"First, we agreed on a European financial stability mechanism that provides a financial backstop for up to EUR 500 billion, which will be supplemented by IMF funding at a ratio of 2:1."
"Secondly, we agreed to accelerate fiscal consolidation in those Member States where it is most urgently needed."
"With these decisions, Europe came up with a credible package that shows our citizens, the markets and the wider world that we will defend the euro - our common currency - whatever it takes."
"We are not doing it for the sake of the mystical market forces but for the sake of sustainable growth and job creation in Europe, by ensuring that the threats to financial stability will not kill the economic recovery that is now in progress - though this is still rather modest and fragile."
"This is our responsibility in relation to our citizens, and we are delivering in very concrete terms."
"Yesterday, coordinating and managing on behalf of the euro area Member States, the Commission delivered EUR 14.5 billion for Greece, which the IMF has complemented with EUR 5.5 billion."
"We said we would be ready to meet the immediate needs of refinancing, and we delivered on time."
"Of course, this is all conditional on a full and complete implementation of the programme designed, together with the Greek Government, by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB and the IMF."
"The European Central Bank has also taken extraordinary measures to tackle the attacks we have recently seen on the euro."
"Beyond that, our Member States have understood the paramount importance of fiscal consolidation to ensure the sustainability of public finances and thus, preconditions for sustainable economic growth."
"Last week, Spain and Portugal presented significant new fiscal consolidation measures which are important and difficult but, at the same time, are necessary steps in order to reduce the ballooning public deficits in 2010 and 2011."
"The Commission will present a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy of the new targets and measures in the course of the next two weeks."
"Let me underline that a faster reduction of the public deficit is indeed an essential component of the financial stability package that was agreed on 10 May by Ecofin."
"It is equally important that both countries adopt structural reforms that will contribute to increased potential growth, especially reforms of the labour markets and pension systems."
"While accelerated fiscal consolidation is an immediate priority throughout Europe, at the same time, we need to coordinate our economic and fiscal policies by applying differentiation among the Member States."
"In other words, the efforts of fiscal consideration need to be differentiated according to fiscal space and economic vulnerability."
"Countries with little or no fiscal space will need to front-load and accelerate measures, while others with better fiscal space should maintain their less restrictive fiscal policy stances for the sake of growth and jobs in Europe."
"Of course, it would be a mistake to stop our efforts here."
"Let us recall that the first 10 years of the euro have been a success story: that is the starting point."
"But the crisis has shown that we need to acknowledge its systemic shortcomings."
"Peer pressure has lacked teeth, good times were not used to reduce public debt, and macro-economic imbalances were ignored."
"This is precisely the reason why last week, on 12 May, the Commission presented an ambitious set of proposals to reinforce economic governance in Europe."
"We want to strengthen preventive budgetary surveillance, address macro-economic imbalances and set up a permanent and robust framework for crisis management."
"I count on Parliament's support for these important proposals."
"They are at the heart of making Europe 2020 a success in the coming years."
"Our proposals are based on two principles."
"First, prevention is always better than correction - not to mention letting a situation escalate into a crisis, as we have seen."
"Second, stronger fiscal surveillance should be accompanied by broader macro-economic surveillance, to go to the roots and origins of sustainable economic development."
"Our proposals are made of three building blocks."
"First, we must reinforce both the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The essential cornerstone of reinforcing economic governance is to coordinate fiscal policy in advance, in order to ensure that national budgets are consistent with the jointly-agreed European policies and obligations, so that they will not put at risk the stability of the euro area as a whole and that of the other Member States."
"Let me be very clear about this: this will not mean scrutinising national budgets, budget line by budget line."
"We have neither the intention nor the resources for that."
"Instead, it will mean analysing and peer-reviewing the broad budgetary guidelines and fiscal balance before the submission of the draft national budgets by governments to Parliament with the legal right, based on the treaty and pact, for the EU to make recommendations and ask for corrective action from the Member States concerned."
"Some have criticised this, saying that this is a breach of parliamentary sovereignty."
"I myself am a former member of a national and the European Parliament, and I am fully aware of the sensitivities of parliamentary fiscal powers."
"However, everyone can see that this is not about breaching democracy or parliamentary sovereignty but ensuring that our Member States respect those very same rules which they have themselves decided on previously: in other words, to practice what you preach."
"We need to introduce a truly European dimension to economic policy making in Europe: it is not enough to look only afterwards at international decisions."
"In the EU, in particular in the euro area, we know only too well that national decisions have an impact beyond national borders, and therefore there will have to be coordination at European level before those national decisions."
"The second building block is to go beyond budgetary surveillance to broaden and deepen surveillance, to address macro-economic imbalances."
"Why is this important?"
"The divergences in competitiveness and the gap between the surplus and deficit countries of the euro area has widened in the past 10 years."
"This has been at the root and origin of why the financial crisis hit the EU so hard, especially some of our Member States."
"We should prevent and tackle emerging problems before they escalate into a crisis."
"Therefore, we propose to define indicators and a scoreboard, agree alert thresholds and give recommendations and early warnings if necessary."
"These indicators could include, for instance, productivity trends, unit labour costs and current account developments."
"It is self-evident that this does not mean that we would want to weaken the export performance of any country; of course not."
"Instead, it aims at rebalancing economic growth in Europe as a whole."
"We need to reinforce export competitiveness where needed and domestic demand where needed and possible."
"That is the way to play as a European team for the benefit of the whole of Europe."
"Thirdly, we need to be very clear to whoever is watching the euro area that we will never be defeated."
"To discourage anyone from even trying our vigour, we need a permanent and robust framework for crisis management for the euro area Member States."
"The temporary mechanism established on 10 May is a bold first step in that direction, but for the medium to long term, the Commission will propose a more permanent mechanism, subject to strict policy conditionality and, of course, drawing on the lessons of recent experience."
"Yes, we need to avoid moral hazards."
"That is why we must make the mechanism so unattractive that no leader or country is voluntarily tempted to resort to it."
"But recent experience has shown that it is better to have a fire brigade ready for a possible bush fire than only start building the fire brigade up when the fire has already turned into a broader forest fire."
"It is better to be safe than sorry."
"To conclude, these Commission proposals pave the way for a quantum leap in economic governance in Europe, but I also want to draw your attention to another immensely important decision - on the same day we proposed these measures - namely, the proposal for Estonia to become a member of the euro area on its own merits."
"Just to give you one figure: while the average debt in Europe is, at the moment, around 75%, in Estonia it is around 7.5% - not 75% but 7.5% - on a sustainable basis."
"This proposal sends an important signal to all that the euro area will withstand pressure with self-confidence, and sustainable economic and fiscal policies will bring fruit for Member States."
"All in all, the Commission's initiatives, once adopted, will lead to a substantial deepening of economic governance in Europe and to a prudent widening of the euro area."
"Indeed, in the EMU, it is high time to fill the 'E' with life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has finally reacted."
"The Heads of State or Government have finally begun to deal with the problems by deciding, 10 days ago, on a support plan for our currency, the euro."
"This is a plan which accurately reflects the scale of European solidarity, thus contradicting all those who doubted it, but which is still inadequate and must be accompanied by measures to reduce our national budget deficits and measures for obtaining agreement among the 27 on the social and fiscal budgets."
"I think everybody is saying this this morning, and we have all been saying the same thing for the past fortnight."
"Well let us do it now!"
"This plan was completed last Wednesday with the Commission's decision, which I welcome, to radically enhance supervision and the implementation of a stability pact."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will not extricate ourselves unless all these measures are implemented."
"We will not extricate ourselves unless we have political courage, because the measures that we should have already taken collectively at EU level and individually at national level will have to be taken now."
"This applies to both right-wing and left-wing governments."
"I am very sorry that the German socialists were lacking this courage when they voted in the Bundestag on the European aid plan."
"We must learn lessons from all this."
"The first lesson: we must know the true state of national public accounts, just as we know the true state of EU public accounts."
"I am asking the Commission to strive to ensure this and to punish, and not just timidly criticise, any State which fails to meet this obligation."
"As you well know, everybody is afraid of the speed trap, everybody is afraid of the penalties, of the number of points on their licences when they are on the road."
"This is how we are made, so there have to be penalties."
"This is the alpha and the omega of any serious policy in this area."
"Second lesson: the 27 must concentrate on their budgetary policies very early on in proceedings."
"The Commission asked for this last week."
"I myself asked for it in this Chamber a few weeks ago."
"I know that it irritates Member States when we ask them to concentrate, but they must get used to being irritated from now on if they continue to treat their public finances as if they were living on a desert island, as if they were not connected to one another by a currency and, hence, by a necessary common discipline."
"Moreover, what is true of national budgets is also true of social and fiscal policy."
"Once again, I understand the anger of some of our compatriots when they are asked to make sacrifices for others who work less and retire earlier."
"This cannot continue either."
"That is the third lesson which I have learnt from this crisis."
"The euro will only be viable if we collectively give ourselves the resources to make it so."
"I would not contradict President Obama's financial adviser, Mr Volcker, who said that the euro is liable to collapse if we do not change our culture and behaviour."
"We must look beyond national considerations and towards European considerations."
"We must move on from short-term policies, designed to prevent our national governments from falling a few points in opinion polls, to medium- and long-term plans, which are also being demanded by our entrepreneurs so that they can invest and recruit."
"My group is asking Europe to wake up."
"It is asking for the Commission to do its job, which is to apply the carrot and the stick technique with Member States."
"Financially reward the ones that clean up their public finances and punish the ones that refuse to do so!"
"The Commission, Mr Rehn, must not be afraid of doing this."
"It would be to the benefit of Europeans and of Member States."
"The main problem amongst our fellow citizens, which is raised at all our meetings at the moment, is whether their savings are still safe."
"I understand these citizens, who have worked all their lives to have a few savings."
"So that is the first assurance we should give them: that their savings are protected."
"That is quite simply what the Commission must do; it was created for that purpose."
"It is only in this context, ladies and gentlemen, that the 2020 strategy will have any meaning."
"It is only if we are once again serious of purpose, if we act collectively with regard to public accounts, that we will be able to win the battle of unemployment, education, training, research and innovation."
"I said this yesterday, and I say it every day: if savings have to be made in all our Member States, then we too, as Members of Parliament and European civil servants, will have to lead by example, or else we will lack credibility."
"That is all that I have to say, and I am still hoping - I have experienced a few very serious and very deep crises - that this crisis can at least serve as a new starting point for Europe and its citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a very serious situation which represents a threat to the European Union."
"We have decades of laissez-faire ideology behind us and these have been decades during which anyone who questioned the alleged superiority of the capitalist economic system was ridiculed."
"This economic system has taken us into the deepest financial, economic and employment crisis and the deepest crisis in the morality and legitimacy of the institutions since the end of the Second World War."
"The system is wrong."
"It is, to a certain extent, immoral, and it is also warped."
"I would like to give you an example, because many of our citizens do not understand the jargon that is used."
"What is the trade in credit default swaps and credit default insurance all about?"
"It means that you can take out an insurance policy which can then be bought and sold like a commodity."
"Let me put this in practical terms."
"I am sure that the lovely farm owned by Mr Daul is covered by a fire insurance policy."
"If I, Martin Schulz, can buy Mr Daul's fire insurance policy and if I receive the insurance payment instead of him when his house burns down, then I simply need someone, for example Mr Cohn-Bendit, who is prepared to set light to the house and I am a made man."
"This is a warped system."
"It should be abolished and these practices should be banned."
"These are exactly the mechanisms that we are discussing and the real-life examples are not funny."
"One concerns the pension fund of the Californian teachers' union which wanted to buy a German airline via a hedge fund."
"The pension fund did not succeed, but it bought something else instead."
"However, the pension fund then went bankrupt."
"This has brought ruin to a whole generation of teachers, who have been paying into the fund for 40 years."
"That is the reality of this economic system, which has now reached its limits and which must be put on a tight leash."
"Now it is the governments' turn."
"This is what you have said, Mr López Garrido and Mr Rehn."
"That is all well and good, but we are the ones who are reacting, we are the ones who have been driven to action and, in my opinion, we are reacting far too late."
"Regulations should have been introduced in many areas at a much earlier stage and we have often called for this to happen in this House."
"Now we are bringing in regulations for hedge funds, but when will the European Rating Agency be established?"
"Is it really normal for an American rating agency, at exactly the point at which the speculation against Greece reached its climax, to set its sights on the next target and lower Portugal's rating?"
"What type of institutions are these which can decide on the fate of entire nations?"
"They must be controlled and regulated."
"However, this should not be happening now."
"It should have taken place years ago and we called for it years ago, but our calls were rejected."
"They were rejected by the same governments which today claim to be managing this crisis."
"(Protests)"
"Mr Langen, I know that you are tabling an amendment this afternoon to ensure that Parliament is not in session during carnival time in Germany."
"That is a good thing."
"It is just that when you are here, it is carnival every day that Parliament is in session."
"I am really sorry."
"We have structural deficits in the EU, which the institutions are responsible for resolving."
"We have allegedly created an economic and monetary union."
"However, the reality is that we have a monetary union, but not an economic union."
"In Europe, we have a patchwork quilt of economic policies."
"A total of 16 sovereign states are failing to coordinate their economic policies, some of which are inconsistent with one another, within a single currency area."
"This represents a huge risk."
"Arnold Schwarzenegger and his beautiful state of California are completely bankrupt, but that does not affect the dollar at all, because the economic policy of California forms part of the single currency area of the United States."
"If 2.8% of the gross domestic product of the euro area is put at risk, as in the case of Greece, a serious crisis will be caused here."
"We must get rid of this deficit, which is why we need economic governance."
"Anyone who is still opposed to this has not heard the warning shots."
"We are in the middle of an extremely serious crisis of legitimacy."
"People are realising that this economic system has failed and they no longer have any confidence in it."
"They have seen that the national and international institutions are being driven by this system and therefore they no longer trust the institutions either."
"During this phase, many people are returning to the refuge of national rhetoric in the face of this globalised, Europeanised challenge."
"This three-way contradiction between the crisis of confidence in our economic system and in our state institutions and the retreat of many state institutions into taking a national approach, rather than looking for solutions in the international structures, is a mixture which puts the EU as a whole at risk."
"Therefore, we need economic governance and we also ultimately need the strength to implement our own regulations."
"Finally, Mr Daul, who is the chair of the group which includes the representatives of Nea Dimokratia, should be a little more restrained in his criticism of other parties."
"Mr President, I do not think that either nationalist or Marxist rhetoric is going to provide us with the solutions we need for this crisis we are going through."
"(Applause)"
"What we are currently experiencing, Mr President, is not, in my opinion, a monetary crisis in the Union, it is not even a crisis of our single currency; rather, it is a crisis of EU governance."
"This is the situation we are in at the moment."
"I would even go as far as to say that it is a crisis borne of the Member States' obsessive belief that they can solve Europe's problems with their intergovernmental approach, when a monetary area, Mr President, must be governed by a single method, by the Community method, on the basis of the European interest, and not by a syndicate of national interests, which is what the European Council and the Council of the European Union, by their very nature, represent."
"For my part, I therefore have three messages to send out this morning in this debate."
"The first message, Mr López Garrido, is addressed to the Council."
"We could perhaps ask the Spanish Presidency to invite the Members of the Council to show a little discretion in relation to the euro crisis, because each time a solution is found to help the euro, one or other Head of State or Government is compelled to come forward to say his piece, and to sabotage, in fact, the solution that has been found."
"I therefore think that the first thing that the Council must be asked to do is to be a little bit more discreet and to let the Commission and the European Central Bank come up with solutions."
"My second message is for the Commission."
"I believe, Mr Rehn, that you took some brave decisions last Wednesday which are a step in the right direction, but that the Commission must go further. For the time being, then, we have a working group."
"This Council working group will meet to put forward solutions around October time or towards the end of the year."
"In my opinion, this is much too late."
"It is up to the Commission, which has the right of initiative, to put together an ambitious overall package over the coming weeks and months."
"That is what must be done."
"We must not wait for a working group of the Council to tell us what must be done; it is up to the Commission to take this initiative."
"It is up to the Commission to draw up a comprehensive package, which it will present to the Council and Parliament, and which will comprise, in my view, four elements."
"Firstly, strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This means, in fact, penalties;"
"I personally am in favour of Mr Rehn's idea, and I hope that everyone else is as well."
"He says that, as part of this package, the Commission should be tasked with screening budgets before they are approved by national parliaments."
"This is not a matter of subsidiarity or of a lack of subsidiarity; it is a matter of loyalty towards the Stability and Growth Pact and the euro."
"We cannot say, on the one hand, that we are members of this Stability and Growth Pact and of the euro area, and, on the other, that our budget has nothing to do with the euro, or that this is a strictly national competence."
"Secondly, I believe that this package must also integrate a convincing 2020 strategy."
"That which is on the Council's table at the moment, Mr López Garrido, is not at all convincing."
"Are you going to reach a conclusion in June?"
"What, though, are you going to conclude in June with regard to the 2020 strategy?"
"Will it be the same thing that you concluded with regard to the Lisbon Strategy, which failed?"
"Will it be the open method of coordination once again?"
"Well, if you are serious, you must now provide the Commission with all the instruments it needs to actually manage this 2020 strategy, this economic strategy which has to extricate us from the crisis."
"The third thing which definitely must be done is to create a European monetary fund to replace the stability mechanism which was created, because that mechanism, as you say yourself, Mr Rehn, is not going to be up to the job."
"Once again, it is an intergovernmental mechanism which was concocted within Ecofin and which requires unanimity."
"Every single loan which is granted has to be approved by all the Member States."
"This is a system which cannot function in the long term, and a European monetary fund, managed by the Commission and, if necessary, by the ECB, is therefore required."
"However, it must not be left to take those decisions which are the responsibility of all Member States in the euro area."
"Finally, we must have a European bond market."
"This is what we are expecting from the Commission, Mr Rehn."
"We want you to be ambitious and courageous enough to put an ambitious package comprising these four points on the negotiating table within both the Council and Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group has once again decided to take a positive approach to the financial stabilisation mechanism which was agreed at the weekend of crisis talks in Brussels almost two weeks ago."
"We are combining our support with a clear commitment to a more united economic and financial policy."
"This is nothing new for my group."
"It has been a tradition for us for many years."
"However, along with this commitment, Mr Rehn and Mr López Garrido, we want to see a serious decision being made not to continue simply combating the symptoms of the crisis, but instead to tackle the overall challenge that it represents."
"As we see it, we have been trying to cure the symptoms since 2008."
"We have been attempting to save the banks since 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt."
"I would like to say once again that we must be honest with the citizens of Europe."
"The euro was not stabilised during the weekend before last."
"Instead, once again, a large number of German and French banks were rescued."
"The share prices demonstrated very clearly what had happened."
"However, we must get out of this cycle of rescuing the banks, which has cost us billions upon billions."
"We no longer know where the money is coming from and we are only daring to take tiny steps towards state regulation of the financial markets, going by the agreement in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin)."
"The central aspect of what we are calling for today is that the state must return to the financial markets and take a very determined approach."
"It must no longer be kept in check by the banks and speculators which everyone is complaining about."
"It is true that the banks are a vital part of the system, but there must be something very rotten in this system if our states can repeatedly be brought to the brink of disaster and the political system allows this to happen."
"I would like to summarise the situation very briefly."
"We must now make clear decisions on certain issues."
"There are indications that some of the EU Member States are moving in the right direction, but we believe that there should be a ban on toxic assets and short selling throughout the EU, that hedge funds should be kept under very tight control, and that we must stop talking about introducing a tax on financial transactions and actually do something about it."
"We need this tax, among other things, in order to refinance what we are doing with public money."
"The participation of banks and speculators must no longer be merely a matter for soapbox speeches."
"We can genuinely guarantee their involvement by introducing the tax."
"A second issue which is of great concern to me is the future of a coordinated budget policy in the European Union, in other words, budgetary discipline."
"I am very familiar with this term in a German context."
"However, I propose that, against the background of crisis management and the vote on the Europe 2020 strategy, we should once again come to an agreement on what we actually want, on how the Member States and how Europe should be presenting themselves to our citizens in five or ten years with regard to the responsibility of the state."
"Should the European strategy be used as a battering ram against the social responsibility of the state?"
"I would very much like to know how you see all of this: nurseries, schools, universities, libraries, care for the elderly, hospitals, museums and theatres."
"A week ago, my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit, said that Greece needed more time to put a reconstruction plan in place."
"I am familiar with the disastrous financial situation of many Member States and I believe that some of them need time to decide what should be done."
"As I have said, using a battering ram against the social security system would definitely be the worst thing that the European Union could do at this point."
"However, that does not prevent us from looking carefully at our budget policy in order to ensure that the different generations receive equal treatment."
"As Greens, we have supported budgets of this kind in Germany time and time again."
"I would like to make one final point."
"If we were to give up on our climate policy and sustainable development now, as some people have indicated, we would really be implementing the devil's plan."
"We must not neglect innovation in industry and business, a climate friendly approach to production and the organisation of public transport."
"We must safeguard jobs by means of innovation, future viability and sustainability, but this does cost money."
"The introduction of new taxes is a taboo subject."
"However, I am convinced that we will only emerge from this crisis if we can break down the taboo of state intervention, the role of the state and the need for intelligent taxes."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, it has sadly become a characteristic of some of those who speak in support of the European Union to believe that the solution to every problem is more integration."
"This approach misses the point."
"What Europe too often lacks is not extra mechanisms to implement agreed policies, but rather the political will to fulfil commitments which have already been made but not executed."
"I therefore earnestly hope that the Europe 2020 initiative, which is certainly necessary to deal with the underlying economic crisis faced by Europe, does not fail on the same basis."
"Concerning the eurozone crisis, however, we are told that, to avoid similar crises in the future, the Union needs powers to call for the prior presentation of draft budgets by sovereign governments and to impose tougher sanctions on Member States - but budget information was already supposed to be available; it was just inaccurate and poorly scrutinised."
"Would the quality of information and the competence of those analysing the data improve just because a more demanding procedure was introduced?"
"Sanctions were previously available; they simply lacked credibility."
"Increasing their scope does not make them any more likely to be imposed."
"Would the new measures be taken any more seriously?"
"Furthermore, issuing debt, which risks increasing the EU budget and directly guaranteeing EU lending, is a major departure that undermines the principles of sound public finance which we are supposed here to be reinforcing."
"In the ECR, we want the euro to be a success for the sake both of those who choose to join and of those in the wider European economy, but this requires Member States to take their responsibilities seriously, to be honest with each other, and to fulfil their agreed commitments."
"By its own admission, the Commission believes its proposals will lead to a substantial deepening of economic and monetary union."
"It is little wonder that, whereas the English version of the text of the March summit referred to 'governance', which is what the Commission has also referred to, the French version referred to 'government'."
"It seems that, for some, a centralised European economic 'government' is indeed the ambition, but this would not address the problems we face: it would be bad for our citizens, for our Member States and, I say, for the European Union itself."
"Mr President, the most recent Council meetings indicate that far-reaching changes are under way."
"We are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of European policy."
"The Treaty of Lisbon praised the role of Parliament and the strengthening of that role."
"We have also spoken out in praise of this."
"Fundamental agreements are now being reached between the governments and inconceivably large amounts of money are being spent."
"Until now, the parliaments have had little say in the matter and we must put a stop to this."
"The method used by those in government has resulted in huge sums being spent to rescue banks which are themselves responsible for getting heavily into debt."
"These governments have saved casino capitalism using taxpayers' money."
"However, they have taken a very hesitant approach to rescuing the states that are in debt."
"Somewhere, they managed to find EUR 750 billion."
"The question is whether the money printing press will save economic development."
"I believe that it is more likely to save the banks' capital."
"However, the European Union must be more than just a free internal market with a single currency."
"Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union, we can forget the monetary union."
"However, I cannot yet see any clear outlines."
"Persisting with the failed Stability and Growth Pact has relatively little to do with the sensible coordination of economic policy."
"What we are lacking is a social union."
"We are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector."
"We are lacking a coordinated tax policy and wage policy and a tax on financial transactions."
"Although we have been talking about this tax for a long time, it remains just talk."
"It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions, not to dismantle it."
"The Greeks and other nations are afraid because they can see the measures that are being taken on the social side."
"It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level."
"Hedge funds must be banned and tax havens abolished."
"We are making very slow progress in combating the crisis in the financial markets."
"In the light of the speed with which the speculators are acting, we are doing far too little."
"During emergencies like those that we are repeatedly being faced with, it is totally wrong to nationalise the billions which are being spent as losses and privatise the profits."
"The banks must not be allowed direct access to taxpayers' money with the support of the state."
"Incidentally, one thing is clear to me, and that is that in the current conditions, we will have to redefine the term 'bank robber'."
"Commissioner, I should like to take this opportunity to thank you personally for your hard and effective work in connection with the economic crisis in Greece."
"I should also like to thank all the parties in Parliament for the support and solidarity they have shown Greece."
"I have three proposals and I should like, most emphatically, to ask for their support."
"As far as the adoption of a permanent instrument for economic governance is concerned, the Bruegel Institute, which is a think tank in the field of economics, proposes the following: the European Central Bank should guarantee European bonds up to 60% of the GDP of each country; these are so-called 'blue bonds'."
"Where bonds exceed the 60% limit, the surplus should be borrowed on market terms; these are so-called 'red bonds'."
"This is a proposal for a permanent instrument for economic governance; we do not need to set up new mechanisms and so forth and it can be adopted very quickly."
"I have two ad hoc proposals for Greece: the International Monetary Fund could extend the repayment period for the loan to Greece from three to five years."
"If the same extension were adopted by our European lenders, it would be much easier and more realistic for Greece to repay its debt and this would be a good message for the markets."
"The second proposal is this: the amount in aid to Greece could be used to repay our bonds."
"It would be rational management of the issue if Europe were to release resources now, to be given to Greece in the future and used by it to develop the Greek economy."
"At the moment, the Greek Government is on the defensive; it is trying to scrape money together so that it can reduce its debt."
"However, we cannot try and stimulate growth at the same time."
"That is why, Commissioner, I think it would be a good idea if a parallel effort to stimulate growth were supported."
"To close, I should like to say that we hope that the Greek crisis will be the only price the European Union has to pay for the hasty establishment of the economic governance which we should have established ten years ago."
"Let us hope that the Greek crisis is the only price we have to pay."
"Mrs Tzavela, I did not interrupt you because you are from Greece, and this issue is very important, but because you spoke for more than one minute."
"Please keep to your time next time."
"Mr President, when you became President of this House last year, you said that you would treat all groups equally."
"I have noticed in this interesting debate that Mr Schulz ran two minutes over - all the groups ran over - but you picked on one group."
"Could you explain why this is?"
"I would like to say, Mrs Sinclaire, that I am watching the time."
"Those speeches did, indeed, run over by some seconds."
"The Member who was speaking a moment ago ran over by the longest, but I allowed this because she represents Greece, and it was also the opinion of someone who lives in Greece, and this matter seemed to me to be important."
"As a rule, I do not allow speakers to exceed the allotted time, but I think we are all agreed that Mrs Tzavela's statement was particularly important for us."
"(ES) Mr President, we had to be on the brink of the economic abyss in order for the Heads of State or Government to understand that the way forward is not more nationalism but more Europe."
"Some measures that have been adopted are aimed in this direction, such as the reduction in vetoing rights in the European Council or the seeds of a European public treasury."
"Finally, albeit late in the day, we have realised that we are all in the same boat and there is no point dealing with individual situations, especially in an improvised way."
"I wonder, however, whether this attitude is a digression, or conversely whether it is the start of real European economic governance, because what we do not need, ladies and gentlemen, is governance."
"What we need is authentic government, if we want to be true to the will of the founding fathers."
"Parliament must therefore promote all the reforms aimed at strengthening Europe and make budgetary and fiscal discipline a reality, while forgetting about nostalgic sovereignty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, strengthening the European Commission and strengthening Parliament is the only right recipe for building Europe, as otherwise, it would disappear like a thief in the night."
"(NL) Mr President, what I have learned is that, if Mr Daul's farmhouse is on fire, you first have to put the fire out."
"Therefore, our group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), fully supports the rescue package on which the Council and the Commission have decided."
"That a decision on a package to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro was unavoidable in a single weekend is a wake-up call to the fact that stricter and more consistent budgetary rules are crucial and must be strengthened."
"Mr President, the Council was unanimous; let us also show that kind of unanimity."
"Unfortunately, however, listening to Mr Schulz, Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I note that such unanimity is not to be found in this House."
"All of us in Parliament want a Europe with sustainable economic growth, sufficient jobs for our citizens and healthy businesses."
"We can achieve this only if we have a stable currency and a stable economy."
"A Stability and Growth Pact that is enforced is crucial for an ambitious EU 2020 strategy."
"For both of the above, success is dependent on sound European governance."
"This is at the heart of the resolution we discussed with the groups in this House last week."
"Commissioner Rehn deserves our support, and I think it irresponsible that our fellow Members from the S&D Group are refusing that support."
"Although irresponsible behaviour by speculators is not the cause, it has fanned the flames of the euro crisis."
"As far as our group is concerned, Commissioner Barnier must work energetically on proposals to curtail irresponsible behaviour on the financial markets."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Wortmann-Kool is wrong in two respects."
"Firstly, we definitely do not want Mr Daul's farm to burn down."
"We do not want any farm to burn down."
"We want to take precautions, that is our objective."
"Secondly, we very much support the measures that Mr Rehn has proposed."
"It is simply that in some cases, they do not go far enough, because the majority of the measures have only been suggested when Mr Daul's farm is already on fire."
"You rightly say that we must prevent the farm from catching fire in the first place and that is the decisive point which I would like to discuss."
"Mr López Garrido said today that it had taken an infuriatingly long time for the decisions to be reached."
"It is also the case that we have spent an infuriatingly long time taking note of the changes that have happened in the European Union over the last ten years."
"Mr Rehn has correctly pointed out that differences between the individual euro countries with regard to competitiveness have increased and not decreased."
"What you do not mention, Mr Rehn, is something that is very important to us, namely, the fact that the gap between the rich and the poor in Europe is widening."
"If that sounds like Marxism to Mr Verhofstadt, to us it is a question of social security and social policy."
"However, that is simply not of interest to some people."
"The question is how you intend to get people to accept the economic measures and the strict budgetary requirements which you rightly propose when people begin to realise that Europe and the euro area are characterised by a growing gap between rich and poor."
"This is unacceptable and this is why there are more protests against the necessary measures than would normally be the case."
"Therefore, we are calling on the Commission and the Council to act."
"We must reduce the differences in competitiveness."
"I believe you are absolutely right when you say that we must succeed in increasing the competitiveness of countries such as Greece and Spain."
"This is not about making the competition conditions worse in Germany, Holland, Austria or other countries, but about improving the competition conditions in the economically weaker countries."
"That is absolutely the right strategy, but your proposal, Mr Rehn, does not include any specific measures for bringing this about."
"You spoke today about the reform of the labour market and the pension system."
"This is the right approach, but it is not enough just to reform the labour market and pensions."
"We must also look at the budget."
"If we do not develop our infrastructure and if we do not use all the means at our disposal in the Europe 2020 strategy, including green technologies and so on, we will not succeed in achieving this objective."
"Therefore, I am asking you to take note of the fact that competitiveness and social security in Europe must be strengthened."
"Mr President, I would like to make a point on the situation in those Member States that are not members of the eurozone but which still share the same preoccupation."
"Political leaders in our countries have been selling the idea that EU membership should be seen as a guarantee against hard economic times, but reality has now proven differently."
"The euro is constantly attacked from all sides despite all the efforts made, and we all know that fresh money is only a quick fix for a much deeper problem."
"This is an exceptionally serious situation and we need exceptional answers."
"Let us face it; there is no escape from deeper economic integration and this therefore implies closer political union."
"Because this imbalance leads to daunting divergences between Member States, and to ensure financial discipline at European level, we need good governance, sanctions and compliance mechanisms."
"We need to find ways to encourage investment, attract capital and boldly cut bureaucratic expenses."
"We need to see intelligent measures taken by governments."
"In Romania, for example, the government is cutting pensions and salaries instead of reducing bureaucratic expenses or money for political clients."
"We have in Romania more employees of secret services than the FBI has but, instead of cutting here, we are cutting doctors and teachers."
"I strongly encourage the Commission to stand by the proposed measures and not to give up under Member States' pressure, because only a few can be seen as examples these days."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we need responsible public spending."
"Yes, we need to balance our budgets."
"This requires responsible management of expenditure, and enough has been said about that for the moment."
"Yes, of course, this requires increased mutual supervision between equals."
"But, no, Members of the Council - and this is, I might add, addressed above all to the gentlemen Members, and not so much to the female Members - it is a sham to let people believe that we are going to meet the current challenges solely by reducing expenditure, as that will most certainly plunge Europe into recession, that will most certainly destroy the social fabric, this social cohesion that is part of the EU's identity."
"Therefore, if we wish to bring public finances back into balance, which is the only option, and also be able to invest - because this is not simply a matter of reducing deficits, but of investing in our future - we will have to find new income streams."
"This means making the financial sector contribute, it means imposing a tax on financial transactions, but also on the banks, and it is not a matter of choosing one or the other."
"It means making those who have profited the most from the situation contribute - I am talking here about the energy sector; it means stopping the handing out of gifts, such as all the tax reforms that have been implemented, to society's richest individuals or to companies that take advantage of tax havens, and really trying to stamp out tax fraud."
"This therefore means breaking another taboo, ladies and gentlemen: not the tax taboo but the taboo of sovereignty, which you, Members of the Council - and, unfortunately, with the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - will defend to the death."
"Better to have tax sovereignty and failure than to really tackle the roots of the problem."
"Finally, with regard to financial supervision, I should like to encourage ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the President-in-Office just asked whether there was an exit strategy from this crisis, and I would say yes, there is: it is called fiscal conservatism."
"The structural problem of ours has been that public overspending went on for too long."
"The public sector was out of control for many years."
"Even in good times, the German Government of Mr Schröder went through the 3% ceiling, and Greece, of course, broke all the records, because the Greek political class is utterly unable to manage money."
"We had the Stability Pact."
"What did Mr Prodi say about the Stability Pact in 2002?"
"You know: you were the head of Mr Liikanen's cabinet."
"He said the Stability Pact was stupid."
"So we had to change it."
"This was the guardian of the treaties."
"We did change it, and we put it on the slippery slope - and we see the results today."
"The EU will be faced with a track of fiscal conservatism for many years to come, and that is going to be very important."
"What we need is innovation, more free markets and more entrepreneurial skills, Mr Schulz."
"Mr President-in-Office (from Spain): do we need taxation?"
"No, it makes things even worse."
"It pushes the EU into stagnation, and you will be Robin Hood in reverse."
"I understand the anger of the people - the people with pensions, the people with savings."
"I understand the German taxpayers."
"They know that they will have to pay, but German taxpayers cannot always pay."
"I find it a bit pretentious of Mr Verhofstadt (if he is still there) to tell Mrs Merkel to shut up talking about the euro."
"This was said by a former government leader who messed up his own country."
"So what is he trying to prove?"
"(FR) Mr President, you will not be able to calm the financial markets without giving up a sacrosanct principle that you defend, which is the completely free movement of capital and so-called free competition, which really means unfair competition."
"Today, a great deal of money is being put on the table, but this is actually designed to reassure the financial markets, whereas to the people you promise only pain."
"You have brought the IMF back into the European fold."
"Why were we not consulted about this decision?"
"Now, in a show of strength, you wish to actually usurp power by seeking to have the national budgets overseen by the Commission itself."
"You talk unceasingly of deficits and debts."
"Why, though, do we never talk about existing revenue options?"
"We have a deficit at the moment because we have consistently lowered taxes on capital and created the conditions for an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth."
"Therefore, the measures to be taken should include amending the statutes and the role of the European Central Bank."
"We need true solidarity ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long will the euro last in its current form?"
"Are we perhaps headed towards its destructuring within a year or two?"
"I do not agree with creating a new supplementary deficit of EUR 750 billion to cover an earlier one or that these measures are sufficient for building the socio-economic future of 500 million Europeans, nor do I agree with the dogma of saving the euro as it is, because it should be done by keeping the euro as low as possible and reducing the interest rate to inject capital into productive investments for our industries, which are gasping for air, rather than into public financing."
"I do not agree with the European Commission expecting to review and audit the accounting of Member States' budgets before the national parliaments: farewell to sovereignty."
"I disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs."
"(DE) Mr President, I am opposed to the Council's unacceptable anti-European approach."
"You are complaining about the crisis and you are now introducing an economic protectorate, while you bear the central responsibility for many of the causes of the crisis."
"You have not allowed regulations to be imposed when they were needed."
"Just one example of this is Eurostat."
"The officials, who have been the subject of so much condemnation and whom I have repeatedly criticised in other areas, highlighted the problems in Greece and also in Spain and Portugal at an early stage."
"The Commission called for Eurostat to be given appropriate powers to conduct investigations."
"Who blocked this move?"
"The Spanish, the British - Mr Martin is not here - the Germans, Mr Daul and his people from France and the Austrians, because you did not want your books to be looked at, because you knew how much they concealed."
"This applies also to Mr Grasser, the former finance minister, who is now appearing all over the place on German television, instead of facing criminal charges in Austria."
"What we really need is, of course, not an emergency government."
"You will not do what the Americans sensibly did in a similar crisis, which is to pass a Glass-Steagall Act, to increase the banks' capital, put a check on the conduit banks and reduce the systemic risks."
"What we need instead is democratic legitimacy, a two-chamber system which will finally put an end to the nonsense of the Council, which is outwardly so pro-European, but internally makes decisions without democratic legitimacy, so that we can bring about true democracy in Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the crisis highlights very clearly the limitations of the treaties, our own weaknesses, the double standards in dealings with the European Union, the deficits, the errors and the lack of seriousness."
"Secondly, it also indicates that anyone who does not do their homework is harming themselves and putting the EU at risk."
"This applies to the Member States, but also to the Commission and to us."
"Thirdly, when the European Union establishes objectives and rules for itself and agrees on procedures and sanctions, the Commission must not be dependent on the agreement of the Member States in order to be able to meet its obligations."
"The deficit and sanction procedure needs to be automated."
"Fourthly, I would like to call on the Council to end the Eurostat blockade."
"It must be possible for Eurostat to carry out investigations in the Member States when it wants to and its employees must be able to speak to the necessary people while being aware that this is the right thing to do."
"We need information, but without advance authorisation."
"Fifthly, you have mentioned hedge funds and we have not yet come to a decision on this subject."
"I am calling on the Council to enter into negotiations with Parliament very quickly so that we can hold the first reading of the hedge fund regulation before the summer."
"Sixthly, on the subject of the transaction tax, we must not just keep calling for it; we must put it into practice."
"The Commission should quickly submit a proposal for the European transaction tax."
"My eighth point is directed at the Council."
"We are committing ourselves to holding an impact assessment of all national legislation which is relevant to the EU."
"My ninth point is that we need to study the effects of all the measures on the real economy and we need more Europe and less intergovernmentalism."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very specific question which will allow us to emerge from the position of powerlessness and confusion that the crisis has left us in, with no one knowing how the crisis arose and how we can find our way out of it."
"Mr Schulz has referred to the highly critical speculative products and credit default insurance and to the damaging practice of short selling, which brought Greece to the brink of disaster and could represent a major problem for Portugal and many other countries."
"Mr López Garrido, you have frequently attended the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in recent months, why was it not possible for the Member States to take concerted action to ban these products?"
"I have been asking this question in the capital of my own country over recent weeks and months and it has taken you months, in fact until yesterday evening, to introduce a ban on the damaging practice of short selling."
"I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures, which are already in place, to protect the people and the economies of Europe."
"I believe it has something to do with the Council's dreadful, discouraging slowness to act, which you have referred to."
"I will make a deal with you."
"We in the European Parliament are presenting concrete proposals."
"In the context of regulating the supervisory bodies and the discussion about hedge funds, we have proposed that we should take appropriate measures on a European level and we will make the same resolution on derivatives, if you, Mr Langen, do what you are always saying."
"We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move."
"We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress."
"Please help to make sure that this happens in the Council."
"However, the decisive point is that the Council must take action on the legislation."
"(FR) Mr President, this is probably the most serious crisis that has ever confronted Europe, which is why urgent action is needed; we have to take decisions, and good decisions at that, and we cannot wait until October."
"The rescue plan was the first decision taken and it was probably taken too late, but better late than never."
"Now, we must urgently follow it up with the establishment, in the long term, of a real European monetary fund, a European bond market and a European rating agency, because as we all know, the single currency will not be able to operate without budgetary, tax, economic and political convergence."
"Moreover, until Europe indicates that it wishes to be governed, the markets and speculators can quite simply take the reins."
"There is a lot of talk about economic governance, but perhaps we should concentrate on the issue of the actual governance of the European Union, which has been lacking recently."
"In my opinion, we should set two targets."
"Yes, of course the debt has to be reduced, but we must reduce it in a realistic and credible way and, at the same time, we must obtain those margins for manoeuvre and implement the reforms needed to prepare for the future."
"We must do both things at the same time."
"That is why it is vital to create synergies between the national budgets of Member States - I would have preferred the Commission to have expressed it in these terms - which is why it is probably vital to reform our tax system and to direct it more towards development and growth and to harmonise it."
"There will no monetary union unless there is budgetary, economic and political convergence."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Rehn, as you know, there are two ways to reduce deficits."
"Expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased."
"All States can cut expenditure at the same time, although separately, without needing any European coordination."
"However, to increase taxes and, more specifically, taxes on capital, companies, profits and banks, they do need European coordination."
"Your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue."
"My question, which is a fairly common one among Members from all groups, is as follows: over the course of the next few weeks, are you going to propose a tax coordination plan to provide Member States with the means of recovering margins for manoeuvre so that they can increase certain taxes, which is something they are unable to do separately?"
"This is the added value which the European Commission can provide at the present time."
"Unfortunately, you do not have any plans in this area."
"Mr Verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative."
"In the current situation, you have a duty to take the initiative in this area."
"(NL) Mr President, it is to be feared that the support package for Greece will not work."
"After all, no country in the world has ever managed to reduce a 14% budget deficit to 3% in three years."
"Greece will be no different."
"There is a great deal of opposition in Greece to the austerity measures, and so it is highly likely that the country will be sucked into a negative growth spiral, with sharply declining consumer spending even though an increase in that spending is actually needed to pay off the loans plus interest."
"Therefore, Athens will sound the alarm again at some point, saying, 'we are not managing to pay it off'."
"There is a good chance that Europe will then write off the loans, with the familiar words, 'we have no choice; we need to prevent worse happening'."
"Mr President, the lesson to be learned from this crisis is: be honest and keep your word."
"The countries of the euro area must put their budgets in order, publish honest figures, comply with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and purge their debts."
"Countries failing to do those things must leave the euro area."
"(EL) Mr President, the biggest unemployment march in the last ten years is due to take place in Greece tomorrow."
"Greek workers are demonstrating against the measures taken by the government, workers who neither work less nor are paid more than their counterparts; you can see the data for yourselves."
"Mr Rehn, it is major hypocrisy to call this tripartite financing mechanism a 'rescue and solidarity' mechanism."
"It is a European punishment mechanism, with the International Monetary Fund playing bad cop."
"For six months, we have been suggesting that you make use of Article 122 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For six months, we have been calling on the European Central Bank to change its policy."
"For six months, we have been calling on you to investigate the unacceptable American credit rating agencies."
"You did not do so."
"You let the speculators run riot, you brought the International Monetary Fund into the euro area and now you are asking for harsh austerity programmes."
"This mechanism must be debated by the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 218 of the Treaty of Lisbon; we need a real debate on solidarity policy."
"Mr President, we can all recall the pompous presentation made by the Spanish Prime Minister earlier this year."
"However, Spain is now following Greece with a deficit of 11% in GDP."
"The EU bureaucracy immediately looks around to find someone to blame, but the fact is that it is this bureaucracy that is responsible for the crisis because it brought countries into the eurozone in the knowledge that their economies were not up to speed - or do we employ 1 000 people in Eurostat just to be a data collector?"
"The hedge funds may be taking advantage of the situation, but they did not cause the crisis."
"The EU now demands cost reductions, but is it realistic to expect the cost of the public sector in Greece to be reduced if 20% of the working population is employed by the state and 50% of SMEs have the state as its only client?"
"Now, a rescue package has been put forward but the reality is that most of the countries supposed to contribute to it do not have money to do so, such as is the case of the UK."
"In any case, the EU always takes the opportunity ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, too rapid centralisation and Europeanisation, possibly also in relation to the introduction of a European currency, are part of the cause of the current problems."
"The fact is that the European currency simply cannot be a hard currency in the long term, because it has brought together very different national economies, some of which are in a weak position, under the same umbrella of monetary policy."
"Now the call is for a common, centrally managed economic policy to accompany the single currency, which amounts almost to European economic governance."
"It is undoubtedly true that weak national economies must be subjected to strict controls on their budgets and their debt management strategy if they want to remain in the euro area."
"However, the sort of centralisation which takes the form of Brussels exerting budgetary authority over all the Member States would, in my opinion, be a massive and improper intervention in the sovereignty of the Member States."
"This would really just mean going from bad to worse."
"The crisis must not be used as an excuse to introduce more EU centralisation, which is something that many people have wanted since before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"If we really want to learn lessons from the current crisis, we may have to find a quite different structure for European monetary policy."
"This may be something like a European hard currency union in a core Europe, in which the national economies that do not meet the convergence criteria would exclude themselves from the euro area."
"We know that austerity programmes will soon be the order of the day throughout Europe."
"One thing is clear: if the Member States and the citizens of Europe have to introduce savings, then the European Union must do the same, perhaps by investigating the overlapping areas of authority and duplication of effort among its forest of agencies and sorting out its budgetary controls."
"We in Parliament will also have to consider whether, by increasing our staffing budget and raising the secretarial allowance, we are sending out the right signal at a time when savings are being introduced across the board."
"(DE) Mr President, on the day that we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Schuman plan, on 9 May 2010, the Council formally laid the Monnet method to rest, with the help of the Commission."
"For example, a legal basis for the financial aid has been chosen which prevents Parliament from becoming involved, namely Article 122(2)."
"The Commission has tolerated all of this."
"I would like to join in Mr Verhofstadt's criticism."
"It is not a crisis in the system or in the euro, but a crisis in government."
"When I see the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council here, I have to ask myself what the Spanish Presidency has actually achieved."
"It has not come up with any ideas or any incentives."
"While we are discussing the most difficult problem faced by Europe, you are organising splendid summits in Madrid - we will not begrudge you that - but it does require us to be here."
"The Commission has accepted everything that has been thrown at it."
"It has allowed itself to be given the run around by the Council and following severe labour pains, it has given birth to a communication which does not contain a single concrete proposal."
"I can only agree with Mr Bullmann in this respect."
"Where are the concrete proposals?"
"Will we once again be given a basis for discussion for the next two or three years?"
"That is simply not enough."
"We want the Commission to have the courage to take the initiative on the Monnet method, on the Community method and on common institutions and proposals."
"Everyone here knows that the cooperation of the Member States on economic and financial issues is long overdue."
"That is the cause of this crisis."
"It is caused by the level of debt in the Member States and the fact that they have lost control of it."
"The diversionary tactics aimed at areas of the financial market represent the wrong approach."
"Mr Schulz has not spoken as if he were suited to more than simply being the leader of his party, but he is right on one point and I would like to tell him so."
"We also regretted the fact that our Greek colleagues in this group did not support this package in the Greek Parliament."
"I think this is irresponsible."
"However, we should also point out that all the states in crisis in Europe, all of those which blocked the new moves, including Great Britain, Hungary, Portugal and Spain, have socialist governments."
"(ES) Mr President, the current session of the European Parliament began a year ago, and there has not been a single plenary sitting in which we have not discussed the crisis."
"It is true that there is nothing more important for us to talk about than a crisis that has destroyed 20 million jobs in Europe."
"It is very important, however, that we define our object correctly, because an equation that is poorly expressed is impossible to solve."
"The crisis is not the 'euro crisis in Greece'."
"It is a crisis that has demonstrated three intolerable asymmetries that must be overcome."
"The first is the asymmetry between the real economy and the financial economy."
"The second is the asymmetry between the monetary union and the lack of a fiscal, budgetary and economic-policy union that is in step with the monetary union."
"The third is the virulence of the crisis and its challenges and, despite this, the exasperating slowness of the response and decision-making mechanisms that are typical of the European Union."
"We are therefore behind in responding to all those millions of unemployed people who are looking to us, and we are raising difficulties that are not arising in other countries that are tackling the crisis with greater decision-making capacity."
"We have seen extraordinary decisions at the same time: the communication from the Commission, the extraordinary decisions of the Council of Ministers last week and, of course, the 2020 strategy."
"However, these extraordinary measures do not come free of charge: they are accompanied by major requirements, restrictions and threats of penalties for countries that are not capable of restricting spending, and which could therefore also compromise growth."
"Yesterday, we were talking here in Parliament about the European Convention on Human Rights and the Action Plan for the Stockholm Programme."
"We had the opportunity to recall that Europe cannot be built solely with an internal market and monetary union."
"Europe is not principally built on those things, but on citizenship."
"It is therefore the time to recall once again that those millions of Europeans are expressing their discontent with the Europe that we are offering them, with the Europe that is expressing more threats and penalties for countries that do not comply than incentives for a model of growth that is capable of restoring employment and social cohesion and assisting in the fight against poverty."
"Without that citizens' Europe, this crisis will be impossible to resolve."
"(FR) Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the Commissioner and the Spanish Presidency for everything that has been achieved recently, albeit late."
"Sailing a ship through a storm is not easy."
"You have broken down more barriers in a fortnight than in all the previous years put together, and I want to encourage you to continue along the same lines."
"I have a message for each of you."
"I should firstly like to say to the Spanish Presidency that in June, you are going to be responsible for the adoption of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Do not put your name to this mockery."
"The Lisbon Strategy has not worked; some of the problems faced by southern Europe are due to a lack of competitiveness."
"As Mr Verhofstadt said, we need another way."
"We also need financial supervision."
"It has just been explained to us that Parliament is going too far."
"I am rapporteur for the European Systemic Risk Board."
"I note that during the course of the most turbulent weekend of the last few weeks, the word 'systemic' was uttered several times."
"Your presidency is responsible for this package."
"Be ambitious!"
"You have our support."
"Do not listen to those in the Council who capitalise on the lack of regulation."
"My second message is addressed to Mr Rehn, whose courage I salute;"
"I fully support the Commission's proposal for national parliaments to work far more upstream with the EU."
"However, this must be approached very carefully or it will provide all the populists and all Europe's critics with a golden opportunity."
"You have our support, but let us try to have a more inclusive approach with the national parliaments, rather than giving the impression that 'Brussels' is dictating everything."
"I note that it is those same national parliaments that claim to be the protectors of democracy that have put Europe in its current situation by voting, year in year out, for deficit budgets."
"Mr President, we are in a situation of our own governments' making; it is not as though rules were not there to prevent these crises happening in the first place."
"If rules such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria had been adhered to, we would not have the level of debt crisis that we currently have in many Member States."
"I find myself in the very strange situation of drawing parallels between the behaviour and financial skills of our Member States' governments and those of our investment banks."
"We sit on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs every week discussing the inappropriate behaviour of our banks, saying they have not obeyed the rules or they have applied them flexibly with financially engineered accounting measures."
"This is exactly what our governments have also been doing."
"We demand responsible corporate governance and yet the level of off-balance-sheet finance vehicles, special-purpose vehicles and undeclared contingent liabilities that our governments are engaged in does not show how to conduct responsible governance."
"In the UK, we have been shocked at the difference between the declared deficit of the outgoing government and what we have actually found once the books have been opened up."
"New leadership in the UK gives us a clear mandate to reassess the true state of finances."
"I really do hope that the rest of Europe can also do the same; restate their finances and find a way forwards."
"(NL) Mr President, we need a coordinated European policy to address the consequences of the crisis; but Europe will have to stop being led by large companies, not forgetting the large financial institutions."
"Governments have twice had to bail out our financial institutions, without these institutions footing even part of the bill themselves."
"In the past two years, the aid to these institutions from the Netherlands alone has led to a EUR 2.5 billion increase in interest expenditure."
"In the same period, the largest Dutch pension fund, ABP, spent EUR 1 billion on Greek government bonds in order to achieve a somewhat higher rate of interest."
"In other words, speculation is continuing as before, and soon we may have to rescue the pension funds too."
"EU 2020 should lay the bill at the right door."
"Rather than by making extreme cutbacks to essential public services, the cost should be covered by the top earners and speculators, by means of partial debt relief for countries such as Greece and of a tax on banks, for example."
"This way, we preserve the European social model."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to say that, in theory, I absolutely support the proposals made by Mr Olli Rehn, whom I am bold enough to consider the political head of Europe and the person who deserves our special respect."
"However, what I want to say and point out is that a raging fever is as dangerous as hypothermia, both in the human body and in the economy."
"We must not jump from the slow adaptation of Maastricht, through which the entire economy of Europe passed for many years, to forced and sudden adaptation which will prolong the recession."
"The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer."
"That is why I should like to point out that the continuing global economic disorder is due mainly to the creation of large unwanted reserves at global level and should be combated by efforts to stimulate growth at European level, so that we can address this crisis rationally."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Verhofstadt complained that nationalist and Marxist rhetoric are not enough to lead us out of the crisis."
"I will make an attempt with Europeanist rhetoric."
"Just a few weeks ago here in this House, many of us pledged our solidarity with Greece."
"Indeed, of what use is Europe if not to support Member States in need?"
"However, of what use are the euro and the Eurogroup if they do not promote a culture of responsibility and stability?"
"What will happen if solidarity becomes synonymous with a European Union that, in violation of the treaties, is reduced to footing the bill for those countries which sacrifice their responsibility for their citizens' future for the fleeting consensus of a season?"
"Commissioner, is it Europeanist rhetoric if we ask the European Commission to be independent and authoritative and not to have regard for governments that cook the books?"
"Is it Europeanist rhetoric if we request new regulations for the financial markets?"
"Is it Europeanist rhetoric if we complain of errors in the construction of the euro, for which there are still no common fiscal and pension policies?"
"We are in the middle of a crisis, it is true, but this crisis was not produced by surplus or too much Europe, but by a shortage or not enough of it."
"Europe must strongly reprimand the States to be responsible, stable and serve the future generations."
"All this is not rhetoric if the initiatives we are talking about are simply created and implemented, and form part of a political strategy that is a step ahead of events so that we are not forced to run behind them."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of the people and not a Europe of the States."
"The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of European policy's inability to govern the market."
"In order to save the euro, political institutions need to be strengthened and intergovernmental logic needs to be left behind to allow for European governance."
"This is not rhetoric because a few minutes ago in Berlin, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, sounded the alarm stating that the euro is in danger."
"Voicing alarm without indicating strong and convincing measures risks further weakening the single currency for investors and the market and making all of Europe weaker."
"Imagine the response of the markets in the coming hours, considering that just minutes ago, the euro collapsed again."
"When we exit the House, Mr President, we may find ourselves poorer and more insecure."
"New European governance alone will allow us to defend the single currency, promote growth, employment and social inclusion."
"We must discard the old approach of coordinating national policies and equip ourselves with strong decision-making instruments."
"New European governance must assure three levels of intervention: a policy for growth, suitable financial instruments and emergency management."
"The EUR 750 billion rescue package was important but we have realised that it is not enough."
"Today, we need a strong political initiative that can guide the market to allow for greater mobility of the resources."
"The monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness."
"We must not be afraid to invest, above all, in Community interest projects such as infrastructure, energy, the environment, knowledge and human capital."
"Mr President, Parliament has a great responsibility: to reinforce the capacity of Member States to leave intergovernmental policy behind and launch European spirit anew through its own independence."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European governments are being driven by the markets."
"At last they are reacting, but they are reacting after the event and not in advance."
"It is scandalous that the governments and the Commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets."
"They should have identified these weaknesses themselves at an early stage."
"When the euro was introduced, we knew that we would not have a single monetary and fiscal policy, as is normally the case in individual states."
"For this reason, we have taken measures to find a substitute for this, but we have not adhered closely to these measures."
"The rules were broken very quickly and right at the start, even by the larger Member States."
"We need another effective set of rules with sanction mechanisms, including a name and shame policy, the loss of voting rights and suspension of payments from the European funds until the fines have been paid."
"Secondly, it has become clear that there are internal tensions within the euro area which are on the verge of putting its strength to the test and which take the form of differences in competitiveness."
"The Commission must take action in this area."
"It must investigate the budgets of the individual Member States to determine whether they represent a risk for the euro area."
"Of course, we know that the right to draw up a budget is a central right of the national parliaments."
"However, that is no reason for failing to develop a common European approach."
"This is urgently needed."
"We need more Europe and not less Europe."
"This may well be our last chance."
"If the Commission and the Council do not negotiate with Parliament, I am afraid that the result will be a major disaster at some point in the future."
"(PL) I agree with Mr Mauro that in the fight against the crises, there has not been enough action from the European Union."
"In recent years, we have concentrated on political integration - we have been taken up with the Treaty of Lisbon and strengthening the competences of political institutions - but we have neglected cooperation on combating the crises."
"I am thinking of a variety of crises which require cooperation and solidarity."
"I am not thinking just of financial crises here."
"As we hold this debate, several countries of the European Union, including my own country of Poland, have been hit by a huge flood."
"People have been killed, and there have been heavy material losses."
"People expect that in such situations, the European Union will come and help them, but there has not been much of this help."
"The European Union is weak because its budget is too small, and it does not have enough money for specific measures."
"Political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening."
"I hope that as a result of this crisis, the tendency to reduce the budget will not increase still further, because then we will be even weaker and more helpless."
"(FR) Mr President, the moment has now arrived in this crisis, which is not only European but also global, when we must have truth and clear-headedness and when responsibility must be taken."
"Global governance is being established."
"What influence will Europeans have?"
"How are we going to influence this global governance if we are incapable of establishing our own European governance?"
"Nobody could have failed to see that, after 50 years of integration, increasing national selfishness was putting us at risk of 50 years of disintegration."
"Nobody could have failed to see that we were trying to create citizenship without the citizens, to conduct politics without the voters, to establish faith in the ideal of a rule of law without complying with it."
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall, we reunified our continent with a belief in our strength but we were too proud to see our weaknesses."
"And what is happening now?"
"The crisis is hitting us full in the face at a time when our European integration is fragile and comprises poorly governed and, in some cases, corrupt States."
"The chain of solidarity in the Union is currently being tested, and we all know that the strength of a chain is that of its weakest link."
"We are right to save the weakest, because the time has come, and it will be our strength that saves them."
"It is not EU regulations that are inadequate but their implementation by Member States and the European Commission, which has not adequately monitored the States, which has been defective."
"It is not less Europe that we need, it is more Europe, but a Europe of truth, clear-headedness and responsibility."
"Of course, we have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which must be reformed."
"Yet the task facing us now is to regain the trust of our citizens, which means ensuring growth and jobs."
"Growth means investment."
"If the public sector does not invest, we cannot expect the private sector to do so."
"In addition to a crucially important industrial policy, I propose, for the 10 years of the EU 2020 strategy, a major EUR 1 000 billion European investment plan aimed at making the EU territory the most competitive in the world in terms of trans-European networks, infrastructure, interconnections, high-speed trains, broadband services, motorways, water, space, research, health, energy, and education, and achieved through a reform of our budgetary support measures, in cooperation with all the public stakeholders and, in particular, the EIB."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, when the economic and monetary union turned 10 years old, the Commission thought that the euro was the Union's greatest success."
"It would now be difficult for us to make that statement without qualifying it, because the crisis has shown that the economic and monetary union is an unfinished project."
"The minimum measures needed to save it were taken in a climate of emergency, but let us not delude ourselves: the pressurised conditions, the direct interests of the main Member States, and the painful and slow nature of the decisions have led to the precarious image that the public and the world have of the euro and the European Union."
"The European Union and the euro are a process of integration, not just inter-country cooperation: they are an unfinished process that must either be reinforced now or run a serious risk of disappearing."
"There are three issues that must be tackled."
"First, it is important to consolidate the instruments that have been created in this climate of emergency: a European monetary fund must be created; progress must be made with Eurobonds; progress must be made with the European supervisory and regulatory architecture, and progress must be made with a European dimension for managing the banking crises."
"Second, it is important to understand that there is no strong currency if the economy is weak: the forecast of 1% growth for the European Union is unsustainable both in terms of its demographic makeup and in terms of fighting unemployment; and the 2020 strategy is nothing more than a collection of good ideas if there are no means for realising it."
"Third, Mr Rehn, fiscal consolidation is important, but it cannot coexist with growing divergence between the Member States that make up the Union: convergence policy must be urgently reviewed."
"(ES) Mr President, I believe that the worst crisis that we could suffer is not only the one that we are currently suffering, but the one that we will suffer if we are not capable of learning the right political lessons regarding what is happening."
"We have been living beyond our means, especially in some countries."
"We have moved away from the real economy and embraced the fictional economy, in our public accounts and, at the same time, in our family and private lives."
"We have not been capable of understanding that, as is the case for any living organism, growing is not the same thing as getting fat."
"Growth requires effort and proportion, while the process of getting fat involves a lack of proportion and balance in comparison with the work that we do and the welfare that we enjoy."
"This crisis does not remain static."
"The picture of the crisis a few months ago was a different one, a completely different one, to the picture that we have today."
"The picture of the crisis in a few months is going to be a different one to the picture that we have today."
"This crisis was economic and financial, and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict."
"This means that while we are in this phase, before the conflict becomes a social one, those of us involved in politics need to be aware that our main crisis is a crisis of confidence."
"It is not only a crisis of the euro."
"Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months."
"There is a crisis of confidence, and that means that what we need to ask ourselves is how we need to change, how our attitude needs to change: our political, institutional and personal attitude."
"In this respect, instead of thinking about other institutions, the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House."
"I dare say that today, having heard many reasons for the crisis - bureaucracy, agencies, governments - there are two issues on which we need to change."
"Firstly, Europe requires a minimum level of cohesion from Parliament: it cannot bleed itself dry in such a profound debate on two concepts of European society."
"Secondly, we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us."
"(EL) First of all, I should like to take ten seconds out of the proceedings to restore the truth."
"Mr Langen, who is not in the House, said that it was unacceptable that Greek members had voted against the three-year stabilisation programme in the Greek Parliament."
"I should like to point out that it would be a good idea for Mr Langen to repeat his recommendations at the next meeting of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), because those members, who happened to be responsible for governing the country until a few months ago, belong to the PPE."
"To return to the more general issue, it is a fact that the current crisis has highlighted chronic sicknesses and weaknesses in terms of the economic coordination of the euro area and in terms of the global system of economic governance and, as a result, huge, uncontrolled power has been amassed in the globalised financial system."
"So, today, we have, first and foremost, a question of democracy to address and Europe, if it wants to respect its values and history, needs to take a leading role here."
"The decision to establish a euro area stability support mechanism is an important step, there can be no doubt about that."
"However, a crisis management mechanism is not enough; we need to tackle the causes at the root, not only at national, but also at European level."
"We are making a mistake and undermining our common future and the future of subsequent generations by putting the sole emphasis on immediate financial recovery and underestimating the impact of growth, employment and the basic structures of the welfare state which have been several decades in the making."
"Commissioner, the proposals to strengthen economic cooperation which you presented on 12 May may help to construct a more cohesive Europe, with fewer macro-economic imbalances, subject to two preconditions: firstly, that they will not be limited to the inflexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact and, secondly, that they will fully incorporate specialised targets for viable growth and employment within the framework of the 2020 strategy."
"(PT) Mr President, several colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have already drawn a very complete picture of the situation."
"I think that what is needed now is mention of the role of the Member States."
"The fact is that the national government of each Member State also has a role here as regards imposing the requirements and conditions for strengthening the single currency, and moving this project of monetary and economic integration forward."
"I would like to say here that our party - the party linked to the PPE Group, which is the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD) - is supporting the government's austerity measures, because we believe that the mistakes that have been made during 15 years of socialist government in Portugal, which are now unfortunately visible for all to see, must be remedied; the PSD will support measures to remedy them."
"Nevertheless, while we are supporting the austerity measures, we would also criticise the Portuguese Government - and this is a good example to others in similar situations - because it is not cutting spending."
"To reduce the deficit, it is essential not just to increase taxes, but also to cut spending and the government must have the courage to take measures to reduce spending, reduce the deficit and pay off some public debt."
"This is true for Portugal and it is also true for other Member States that are in difficult situations."
"We, as MEPs, are also responsible for defending in our countries the measures that are necessary in order for the euro to come out stronger, and for this integrated area and this dream - the dream of the PPE Group and the dream we all share - to become a reality."
"That is why we are critical of governments that do not have the courage to take the necessary measures in their countries."
"(SV) Mr President, in some key points, this more communal economic policy also has an impact on the EU budget."
"We are talking about the funding of the strategic flagship project Europe 2020."
"We are talking about some costs, guarantees and so on for the loan mechanism and control of the financial markets."
"We are talking, not least, about a series of new duties that result from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In the European Parliament, we are highly conscious of the fact that many Member States currently find themselves in an extremely tricky economic situation, often with difficult national budget problems."
"On the other hand, it is clear that, in this situation, the EU can help by taking measures that are important for the economic recovery of the Member States and that will give a new boost to growth and job creation."
"The EU budget should therefore focus on areas where the EU can provide added value - European added value - and where the budgets of Member States and of the EU can complement and support one another."
"That also means, however, that the Member States cannot give the EU significant additional responsibilities without providing the necessary resources."
"I am thinking of research policy, flagship projects and education and infrastructure investments that are required if we are to have a better economic future."
"I therefore think it is incredibly important that the spirit of this increasingly communal economic policy should also be reflected in a constructive attitude in the negotiations on the EU budget for 2011, in the mid-term review of the long-term budget and in the debate on the new financial framework after 2013."
"Otherwise, we will not be able to move forwards and put in place common measures to promote growth and jobs."
"(EL) Mr President, as a Greek member of the European Parliament, I should like to repeat in the House something which I have said in public in Greece from the outset and to express my gratitude for the help which my country has received from the European support mechanism which, in conjunction with harsh but mostly unavoidable measures, has prevented the Greek economy from immediate collapse."
"It would be useful if the mechanism for Greece had been adopted with the speed at which the support mechanism proceeded for other economies, when Europe finally realised the risk which we were all running."
"Today is the first time that I have seen real determination, both in Parliament and in the other European institutions, to look directly and realistically at the real economic impasses in Europe."
"Why are we in this situation?"
"The main reason is that we have spent beyond our means and run up credit."
"We spent when there was no crisis, we spent during the crisis, we are spending now on our way out of the crisis."
"Anyone who wants to learn what happens when you consistently spend more than you have just needs to come to Greece."
"The European Monetary Fund and the other institutions proposed in the resolution under negotiation are moving in the right direction."
"However, if it is to provide real incentives, the Fund needs to take account not only of the absolute size of the debt and deficit, but also of the speed of reduction of the debt and the deficit."
"Our real problem, and I say this to the left wing, is that 4 billion people in the developing world living on EUR 200 a month have discovered capitalism and are claiming global resources and markets from us, the rich, who live on EUR 2 000 a month."
"We in the West do not have a monopoly on the capitalism on which the old European model was built."
"If we do not change, if we do not hurry up with structural changes, competitiveness and innovation, we shall simply live more poorly."
"Mr President, there is little doubt about the seriousness of the current crisis and the 'cost of use' of unprecedented policy methods is very high."
"The task of regulators and policy makers is to undertake actions that make it possible both to restore the equilibrium shattered by market failure and to correct failed government policies."
"This is being done, but it has still to be seen how fast, and through what policy measures, European Union Member States will return to their path of growth."
"More regulation is not a guarantee against the risks of the current crisis."
"As we have chosen the path of more regulation, it should go hand in hand with increased simplicity and reduce the complexity of financial markets."
"What is also clear is that fiscal and monetary policies are not substitutes for structural reforms."
"Structural reforms have to address the underlying weaknesses of the European Union economy: sharply growing debts and deficits, ageing, the highly probable new surge of inflation, risks generated by climate-change policies, low productivity and lack of competitiveness."
"With less public money, more will have to be done; hence, public money, both European and national, will have to be used more efficiently."
"A business friendly regulatory environment, efficient government, non-distortionary taxes, high labour participation rates, especially among women, a good education system, research and innovation - all that constitutes a minimum core package of measures to bring growth, jobs and competitiveness."
"Without doubt, the European winning strategy has to be based on fiscal tightening, but its focus should be on innovation, the only way to boost productivity and growth in a sustainable way."
"The European Commission and the European Parliament should regain their strategic role and go for brave European solutions."
"Both citizens and markets need more Europe."
"Mr President, I take it as a given that sovereign states must be held to account for commitments made and be required to meet agreed objectives, so I start from there."
"But it is also time to look around and see what other actions are contributing to the recent turmoil."
"In the 1930s, the gold standard and protectionism contributed to a deepening of the recession."
"By contrast, within the European Union, we have had solidarity and the institutional capacity, via the European Central Bank and the Commission, to learn from past mistakes."
"The work of the institutions has been impressive, given that there are 27 EU Member States, including 16 euro members."
"Furthermore, our institutions have cooperated with the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Japanese Central Bank and others."
"Despite this, the markets - the so-called markets - have, in effect, moved to take a negative view of almost every step taken."
"Now I am all for free markets; protectionism does not work."
"But are our markets free?"
"The markets were well-massaged and influenced towards getting us into the crisis in the first place."
"Is there not by now a reasonable suspicion that powerful interests have a capacity to take on sovereign states and win, and that some - for whatever objectives - are using this power to advance their own agenda, using the markets for their own ends?"
"A political agenda could include concerns that the euro could, in future, replace the dollar as the pricing currency for oil, for example; a business and economic interest agenda could include simply amassing greater power and wealth by destroying sovereign rights, including shared sovereign rights, within the European Union."
"It is time for political leaders to reflect on just what is happening."
"I repeat: Member States must be disciplined, including the Member State I come from."
"Of course that must happen."
"But we are putting all the emphasis on Member States and very little on what is behind some market activity."
"I would like to hear from the Presidency of the Council and from the Commissioner."
"What is being done to police this?"
"When we did not police these people in the past, look where they led us."
"So do not have just one prong on your fork: it is time to have two prongs."
"(HU) The Europe 2020 strategy is a very important strategy, especially now, at a time of growing financial and economic crisis."
"This crisis has spotlighted such fundamental questions and negative processes that if we do not integrate these into our strategy, this may jeopardise the success of our economic policy."
"We must not allow the prestige of the euro to be damaged, but must do all we can for the sustainability of monetary union."
"I represent the last country to join the euro area."
"Slovakia's citizens consider the introduction of the euro a success story and therefore it is contributing as well to the protection of the euro with every means available."
"We must raise awareness that the monetary crisis may have serious political consequences."
"These may include increased euroscepticism and uncertainty among those countries that are preparing to enter the euro area."
"We need to help and encourage those countries that have not yet introduced the single currency."
"In devising the EU 2020 strategy, policies that guarantee sustainable development must be given a major role."
"Although work on energy diversification solutions in Central Europe is in progress, there must also be increased use of alternative energy sources in order to reduce climate change."
"We must also make people aware that the capacity of current alternative energy sources is finite."
"From the perspective of our long-term energy security, nuclear energy is the solution that can guarantee a sufficient amount of energy with the lowest levels of carbon dioxide emissions and, therefore, we must place great emphasis on the related question of the safe storage and production of fuel."
"Providing impetus for further research into modern energy technologies, such as the innovation involving fusion-based reactors, is also indispensable."
"Many important questions arise that we wish to incorporate into our strategy, and we are faced with the major task of improving the coordination and integration of various areas."
"It is only by doing this that we can ensure that, in addition to a monetary union, the all important economic union will also be achieved."
"(RO) I very warmly welcome the measures put forward by the Commission and Council."
"If these measures had been adopted some time ago, we could have avoided a large number of the effects of the crisis we are going through."
"A lack of economic governance led to decisions being taken under pressure and without any consultation with the European Parliament."
"In addition, there are no mechanisms in place for monitoring the measures adopted."
"Last year, large sums of money were injected into banks."
"This was a necessary measure, but saving the banks has not helped mitigate the crisis later on."
"The crisis has continued."
"The Growth and Stability Pact has not been adhered to."
"Unacceptable deficits have been run up."
"States have taken different measures in similar situations."
"Some have decided to tell their citizens the truth and adopt austerity measures."
"The lack of common rules is having different effects on Europe's citizens, even though all Member States have helped trigger the crisis."
"We cannot consume more than we produce, nor can we spend more than we can collect."
"We need financial stability."
"This is why the proposals for creating a new financial stability mechanism or European monetary fund are an absolute necessity."
"However, these measures need to be backed up by a coherent economic recovery strategy and by control and sanction mechanisms."
"This will allow us to say that we are going to establish real, effective economic governance for the benefit of all Member States."
"Mr President, I will abide by your rule."
"I welcome the Spanish Presidency's comments about productive systems and a focus on competitiveness."
"I think we need a little bit more of that conversation in this Parliament, in Council and in the Commission."
"In relation to your comments about the slow response, we need to look at that because there is the problem of a lethargy in the European system in terms of response."
"Member States could have reacted more swiftly when the banking crisis hit."
"We are capable of doing it but we seem not to have done it in this particular instance."
"Finally, the Commission is looking for four pillars of a new strategy."
"I think the Commission needs to examine its own role in this crisis."
"I believe that the monitoring of the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact were on the basis of a 'soft' power approach which did not work."
"Had we all, as others have said, abided by the rules, we would not have this problem."
"Giving you more power will only work if you actually use the power you already have."
"(RO) During the current economic crisis, the Europe 2020 strategy seems to be posing a real challenge."
"On the other hand, it provides an opportunity as well."
"It can give an important fillip in terms of supporting the economic and social reforms required long term."
"Solidarity and adaptability must be the principles on which it is founded."
"I believe that the allocations for the Cohesion Funds must be kept as they play a fundamental role in reducing the disparities in economic development between the EU's regions."
"On the other hand, it goes without saying that the objectives adopted at European Union level cannot automatically become national objectives."
"They must be adapted according to the possibilities of each country."
"The Romanian Government has set up a high-level working group which will set national objectives."
"At the same time, it will help coordinate the drafting of the National Reform Plan."
"(EL) The behaviour of the markets and of the banks is like a pack of wolves, as the Swedish Finance Minister called them, a pack of wolves ready to tear the economically weak countries apart."
"The first victim was Greece, followed by Spain and Portugal."
"In the case of Greece, we saw speculators hit it mercilessly, on the one hand, and Community solidarity which was very late coming and which came on very harsh terms, forcing the Greek people to make very unpleasant sacrifices and embark on justified strikes, on the other."
"It would appear that the protagonists of the international economic crisis are now the states, not the banks."
"We need to learn from this adversity."
"The European Union needs more Community solidarity, better supervision of the financial system, stronger national compliance with the Stability Pact, more coordinated financial policy and measures to prevent competitive imbalances."
"The people of Europe want a more humane Europe, with fewer inequalities between the Member States."
"The time has come for a more realistic and people friendly programme for the European Union of 2020 which listens to the challenges of the times."
"(SV) Mr President, Europe needs more cooperation and more solidarity - not protectionism and nationalism."
"We know that - history has taught us."
"I find it hard to understand the fear that the finance ministers evidently feel when faced with this proposal for prior examination of the Member States' budgets."
"In recent months, even hardened finance ministers were, and should have been, afraid."
"A vein of national self-assertion can certainly be detected here."
"By all means scrutinise other countries, but not mine."
"Scrutinise Greece, Spain and Portugal, but not my country."
"Noli me tangere - touch me not!"
"Our mutual dependence requires openness and trust."
"The Swedish and Finnish governments both have experience from the 1990s of serious crises, and they should both whole-heartedly support Commissioner Rehn's proposals."
"(SK) A responsible budget policy in all countries of the European Union is only the first step towards solving the current situation."
"The next step, which is surely more difficult to implement, should be to strive for a measured change to our workforce structure."
"A large proportion of EU citizens, that is to say, are employed in non-productive sectors, especially public administration, and the productive sphere is not capable of supporting such a large number of bureaucrats, who only complicate life by dreaming up ever more regulations and restrictions."
"Take a look at Asia, Commissioner."
"They do not have such a high percentage of educated people there or as many universities as we do."
"However, they do have a small public administration and an uncomplicated entrepreneurial environment, allowing them to develop the natural competitiveness which many people possess."
"An uncomplicated, transparent entrepreneurial environment, less administration and more room for the independent, entrepreneurial and creative activities of our citizens: that is the best way out of the current problems."
"Mr President, the economic crisis is not a temporary illness from which EU Members will soon recover to full economic health."
"There are systemic flaws in the approach to economic policy of the EU and its Member States."
"The goal of a single currency, eventually for 27 plus countries, is based on the false assumption that one currency can be appropriate for many very different economies."
"The value of a currency must reflect the state of health of the economy it serves."
"However, there are other distinct problems."
"The embrace of globalisation by the EU and its individual Member States is a recipe for disaster."
"We cannot allow goods and workers from low-wage countries to flood into Europe."
"We cannot compete with their goods without reducing our wage rates to their levels."
"Legal minimum wage levels will not prevent our workers being undercut covertly by migrant workers, the outsourcing of the work of our peoples or by moving our manufacturing to the Third World."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his kind words and confidence in the efforts of Estonia joining the eurozone, and I can assure you that, with the present financial burden at 7.5% of GDP, Estonia will not contribute to the increase of the average EU debt level."
"I trust also that eurozone colleagues will be able to accept Estonia as a positive example; that would send an encouraging signal also to Latvia and Lithuania convincing their people that it makes sense to make efforts and that all the applicants will be treated according to their merits."
"Joining the eurozone at this moment is not just a privilege."
"It means taking solidarity commitments and making our contribution to the Consolidation Pact from the beginning, but I am convinced that this is a right decision; we shall see the EU not only as an opportunity to receive but, first and foremost, as a chance to contribute to advance our common cause."
"(PL) Today's debate on economic governance in the European Union is a fundamental discussion, because it concerns the matter of continuing to strengthen European integration."
"In view of their advanced economic links, Member States should all feel an equal responsibility for a European stabilisation mechanism and for the entire economic situation in Europe."
"I do not think any of us should be in any doubt that accurate monitoring of public liabilities and expenses (the President interrupted the speaker), coordination of the process of creating budgets and plans for reform in Member States at an early stage and a mechanism for aid in times of crisis are measures which are heading in the right direction."
"Conscientious implementation of the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact should be a priority."
"This is a key to ensuring budgetary and macro-economic stability in the European Union."
"While a set of punishments and the principle of naming and shaming are essential for disciplining Member States in introducing the principles of the pact and essential reforms, I am reserved about financial penalties."
"For these penalties, used in the case of Member States which are already in a difficult financial situation, could have the opposite effect, an adverse effect on the economies of these countries ..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"Therefore, I would ask that we plan the future of Europe responsibly."
"(FI) Mr President, when there is a crisis the psychological reaction is either to curl up in a ball, blame others, look for enemies or try to find solutions."
"Europe is now witnessing this threeway approach: on the one hand, nationalism and protectionism are on the rise in many countries; on the other, new solutions are being sought, as is the case with the Commission."
"We have to appreciate them dearly."
"The stronger the political system is in the European Union and at national level, the better we can tame market forces."
"Otherwise, it will go badly."
"I think there is one thing we could stop doing, and that is ridiculing Greece."
"The Greek nation, Prime Minister and politicians now deserve our respect, since they are taking some very difficult decisions."
"As Mr Schmidt said, Finland and Sweden were Greece in the early 1990s."
"We had to take decisions that were just as hard, but we succeeded."
"I am sorry to interrupt you."
"You will notice in the Chamber that, although she was saying very nice things about Greece, I did interrupt her at exactly one minute, so I am trying to be as objective as I can be here."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current debate on a functioning system of European economic governance, the long-term perspective is being neglected, in my opinion."
"Now is the right time to incorporate the short-term stabilisation measures into a long-term strategy."
"We need a vision of a market economy."
"The fundamental principle of the social market economy is already laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must now bring it to life."
"The social market economy was the successful model behind Germany's economic miracle."
"Walter Eugen, the guiding light of the economic miracle, remarked as early as 1950 that the economic activity of the state should focus on designing the regulatory systems for the economy and not on managing the economic processes."
"Therefore, I am calling for a regulatory approach, in other words, measures taken by the state to influence the basic conditions of economic activity by means of general legislation."
"It is not the state which creates jobs, but it must create a regulatory framework for job creation and this is what we need to focus on."
"Competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity."
"(DE) Mr President, in the Europe 2020 strategy, we must tackle the roots of the current crisis."
"Would it be sensible to introduce a monetary union along American lines without the necessary central controls on financial policy?"
"The answer is 'no'."
"The euro must not be allowed to turn the EU into a huge redistribution mechanism based on mandatory solidarity."
"If we are to have a monetary union, it must be a hard monetary union."
"In addition, the free financial markets must not be regarded as being separate from the real economy in future."
"Therefore, we need clear rules in the Europe 2020 strategy to deal with speculators and hedge funds."
"The route proposed by Austria and yesterday by Germany, towards a financial transaction tax, which involves the taxation of profits made by the banks and the financial sector, is definitely the right approach."
"Let us set an example to taxpayers and remind the financial sector of its obligations at last."
"We also need to be braver in applying the rules to the Member States."
"Any state which deliberately falsifies its figures must quite simply be ejected from the euro area."
"Countries which commit fraud must leave."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy presents us with a specific challenge."
"Overall, we must focus on the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"We should make sure that by 2020, small and medium-sized companies have an average minimum capital quota of 20%."
"We need strong SMEs in Europe, because they employ two thirds of the workforce, produce 50% of the gross national product and pay 80% of the taxes."
"The Commission has simply forgotten to include objectives to strengthen small and medium-sized companies in this programme."
"Mr Rehn, I am calling on you specifically to take action on behalf of SMEs and to draw up objectives to strengthen the position of these companies and their employees."
"(SL) Today's has been one of the better debates we have had on the financial and economic crisis, especially on how it has played out in Greece, and most of the contributions have essentially centred on the issue of how we should govern the European Union in the future."
"However, I would also agree with what those speakers who seek to apportion blame for this situation have pointed out."
"In my view, that is the right way forward and it is important that we take that route."
"We need to ask questions about the responsibility of some European institutions, and not just the collective responsibility of the institutions but who exactly is responsible for what."
"Might I therefore suggest that we call to task Mr Almunia, the ex-Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example, as he was quite critical towards some countries during his term of office and then the Greek issue came up."
"I call on him to clarify his role in this story and, if he fails to do so, he should resign."
"Mr President, firstly, the last few weeks have seen us put measures in place to deal with a financial crisis that has already occurred - a financial crisis caused by a lack of regulation, a lack of supervision and a lack of governance."
"Today's measures see us trying to anticipate these situations so that they will not occur in the future, and they are to be welcomed."
"We all perform better when there is somebody looking over our shoulder."
"That applies to governments as well as to individuals."
"So I appreciate what has been done here today and I think that, from today on, we should also move on to dealing with the financial terrorists of the rating agencies and the speculators who are playing havoc with people's lives and trying to bring down sovereign governments."
"By taking that twin approach - dealing with governance at political level and dealing with the financial terrorists - we might be able to look forward to a better future."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Rehn, Mr López Garrido, we are talking today about common European economic governance."
"I believe it is time for us to realise that the market does not have an independent value and that the citizens of Europe do not have to serve the market, but instead, that the market is there to serve the people, the 500 million Europeans."
"I am convinced that we need consolidation and growth, but both terms are always connected with another aspect, in other words, socially responsible consolidation on the one hand and sustainable growth on the other."
"We need confidence to achieve this and the people of Europe need perspectives."
"However, we will only be able to offer them these perspectives if we can promise them that they will live in a Europe where they can share in the prosperity or put measures in place to ensure that this is the case."
"In the Europe of the future, growth should not only benefit the few."
"(FR) Mr President, first of all, it is true that the sudden emergence and the depth of the Greek crisis have created a great deal of fear amongst our fellow citizens, fear which I think is legitimate."
"Once again, this does not mean, as a Member has just said, that we should point the finger at Greece."
"However, it is important, it is urgent - as we have been saying for some time now - to learn the necessary lessons so that we can build a more political Europe and move towards economic governance."
"Economic governance should now be proposed as a matter of urgency."
"I understand that the Commission is proposing to scrutinise the national budgets in advance."
"Personally, I do not think we should switch horses."
"What is fundamentally and urgently needed is European economic governance and not prior scrutiny of the national budgets by the Commission."
"I think that this proposal would not only reveal constitutional inconsistencies but also create delays and complexity, which is definitely not what Europe needs at the moment."
"What is urgently needed is European economic governance and not prior scrutiny of the national budgets."
"(RO) We all know that the Europe 2020 strategy was launched with the aim of helping the European Union emerge from the current economic crisis and prepare its economy for the new decade."
"However, it is a serious matter that the Europe 2020 strategy does not even provide clear guidance on revising one of the most important common policies, namely, the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"What makes this even more serious is that the reference to agriculture as a vital political instrument for achieving the EU 2020 strategy objectives was only made at the last minute."
"This is why we are not even surprised that there is too little mention of agricultural policies in this document."
"In this regard, the EU 2020 strategy includes some ideas about the future CAP."
"However, it fails to assign it a key strategic role as part of a wider, global approach, taking into account the huge challenges posed by the prospects of a twofold increase in the global demand for food and of climate change."
"(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have detailed analyses of the causes of the crisis in the euro area and the economic collapse in Greece, or of the dangers which are facing other countries."
"Is the global financial crisis, which turned into the economic crisis, the cause of this situation, or are we dealing, here, with our own mistakes, neglect and lack of action?"
"Let us say clearly and honestly that there was no coordination of financial policy in our Union."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was not adhered to, and financial discipline was not maintained."
"National budgets were often detached from reality: high costs, low incomes and lack of responsibility in governing the state."
"I would like to ask: where was the European Central Bank?"
"Where was the Commission?"
"Let us say honestly that the problem lies in the fact that the Member States do not allow monitoring, evaluation and analysis of their budgets by EU institutions."
"In recent years, we have concentrated mainly on the Treaty of Lisbon, and we have devoted less attention to economic union, and especially monetary union."
"Mr President, we can really say that the European Union is facing a situation that is similar to others in its painful history that have been resolved favourably."
"Europe is at a crossroads, just as it was after the Second World War, which resulted in the birth of what was not then known as the European Union."
"It is what happened when the Berlin wall fell, when Europe was reunified, when there was, incidentally, a crisis in the European monetary system."
"The response was to move forward and adopt a new treaty."
"That is what we have done at the start of this century with the Treaty of Lisbon, and that is the only way out of a difficult situation such as the one that we are in."
"The other alternatives, of course, are clearly populism or protectionism, and they are not an option."
"The clear choice is to move towards a Europe that resolves its shortcomings, which were demonstrated when this extremely serious crisis arose, the like of which those of us here in this House have never known."
"Therefore, the way to respond to the situation of deregulated markets; a lack of competitiveness in the production system, which is having serious effects, with a social impact in terms of unemployment; the deficit problem, with 20 countries out of the 27 having begun excessive debt proceedings; and to an obvious lack of economic governance in the European Union, is not with less Europe but with more Europe."
"That is the way to respond to this situation right now."
"It should be said that there has been a reaction, that the European Union has reacted, and I refer to the previous speeches made by Commissioner Rehn and by me, in which we set out how the European Union has reacted."
"At the moment, however, times are moving even faster, and I think that we need to be quicker in our response, which must help to resolve the fundamental problems that still exist in the European Union and have been put to the test as a result of this crisis."
"I therefore want to propose that the European Union institutions and, of course, Parliament, cooperate on what I believe are the five aspects on which we need to move more quickly."
"We need to speed up, round off or complete the task that was planned and begun in the correct way."
"The first aspect is solidarity."
"We need to deepen solidarity in the euro area, which is why the aid to Greece was so right and why the decision was so right to create this EUR 750 million fund - for a three-year period, so it is not yet completely permanent - to prevent possible difficult situations with public accounts or imbalances in public accounts."
"I think that this is a fundamental element, and that it was right for the Council to propose it and adopt it on 9 May."
"Alongside this there has been the action of the European Central Bank, which is intervening even now, buying debt from the Member States through the channels permitted by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Secondly, just today, Parliament has been examining a financial supervision package."
"We have, to some extent, had a foretaste of this with the adoption of the regulation of hedge funds in the Economic and Financial Affairs (Ecofin) Council yesterday."
"Therefore we can do it, of course we can do it."
"This regulation has been produced, but we need to conclude the negotiations between the Council and Parliament on the whole financial supervision package as soon as possible."
"This package also, incidentally, regulates the rating agencies, because - in relation to one of the suggestions or questions put forward by Members - the rating agencies are going to be subject to supervision by the European authority."
"Thirdly, we need to commit to competitiveness."
"It is therefore very important for the 2020 strategy to be adopted and launched in the European Council in June, and that it quantifies the targets, including on poverty and social inclusion, which have not yet been quantified."
"It should be a strategy that establishes its own governance, and that governance should be much more demanding than the practically inexistent governance of the Treaty of Lisbon, as Mr Verhofstadt was saying earlier."
"It should also use positive incentives to ensure that the targets are reached, such as using European funds or the Structural Funds."
"The fourth important element is the package on the coordination of economic policies presented by Commissioner Rehn on 12 May, which was examined yesterday in the Ecofin Council."
"It is absolutely essential that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon when it states in Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) that the Member States are obliged - not that it is better or desirable, they are obliged - to coordinate their economic policies and employment policies, and may also coordinate their social policies."
"Along these lines, we think that the implementation of Article 136 of the TFEU, established by this Commission proposal, is very important, and we also need to speed up putting it into practice."
"Finally, I also believe that we must speed up the debate or the decision, which I think must be raised at the G20, on a tax on international financial transactions."
"I would ask Parliament to support these very significant and very important points, which would be a step forwards towards what is being described as the economic governance or government of the Union, so that a decision can be made on it as soon as possible."
"We cannot wait much longer for this."
"I believe that unity in the EU has never been as essential as it is now, and I am not just talking about unity between the EU Member States, but also between the institutions."
"Parliament is a European institution, the Commission is a European institution and the Council is also a European institution."
"The institutions need to work together at this time so that the move towards government of the Union and resolving the fundamental problems that have emerged can be consolidated."
"Let this be an expression of our commitment to beginning a new political phase in the EU that is beneficial to citizens, who are expecting us to do so."
"Do not expect anything else; expect us to do precisely that."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you to the Members for a very serious and substantive debate reflecting the serious situation we are now facing in Europe."
"Let me first say that I highly appreciate the broad support given by the European Parliament for reinforcing economic governance."
"I also listened very carefully to Minister López Garrido and I thank the Spanish Presidency for their support and for the excellent cooperation on this issue as well as on other issues."
"I strongly agree with those of you who have called for an economic union to complement the monetary one."
"This is the way forward, and this is the critical lesson we must learn from the crisis."
"We have to work on three strengths."
"First of all, we need vigilance for the immediate resolution of the crisis in Greece and elsewhere in Europe."
"We have avoided another Lehman Brothers happening on European soil, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet, and therefore we must continue with vigilance and determination to safeguard financial stability in Europe and thus protect the still-fragile economic recovery of our continent."
"Secondly, we need to speed up, intensify and complete the regulatory reform of financial markets, bank levies, short selling and credit agencies."
"It is much better to act at a European level and to do it as soon as possible."
"We need to create a framework to correct the systemic errors of the financial markets and on this, I very much agree with Mrs Jaakonsaari and Mr Swoboda."
"The market can be a good servant but it is a bad master and, as Mr Theurer said, we need to work for the basic idea of a social market economy in order to create a credible legal framework for financial markets through completing the regulatory reform."
"Thirdly, we need to move on to decisions concerning reinforcing economic governance in Europe; we need to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact through preventive fiscal surveillance; we must put in place workable sanctions and they must be rules-based, as Mr Kallas said, and we need to get audit powers for Eurostat ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Colleagues, this is the round-up of a very important debate."
"I kindly ask you to try to keep your conversations to a minimum in this Chamber and respect the Commissioner's final remarks."
"The Commissioner has the floor."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am quite used to this but I would appreciate it if there were some interest in the House in what I am going to say."
"Immediate crisis resolution, complete financial market reform and reinforcing economic governance: these are the three main tasks that we have to work on as soon as possible now."
"I agree with Mr Marinescu, who referred to the Commission's communication, and it is indeed more than anyone would have thought even half a year ago."
"Please read those 10 pages of the communication on reinforcing economic governance in Europe."
"Ten pages sounds short, but it is full of concrete initiatives."
"This is heavy stuff, which is what we need in Europe."
"I will come up with concrete proposals, legislative proposals, shortly."
"We have taken the initiative and we shall move on."
"Mr Verhofstadt said that we should not wait for the task force."
"Well, we contribute actively and constructively to the work of the task force presided over by President Herman Van Rompuy but, yes, we shall use our right of initiative and we shall soon put forward concrete legislative proposals on reinforcing economic governance."
"That is the essence of the Community method and that is what you have also been calling for today, and rightly so."
"We do not have the luxury of time."
"Instead, we must act without delay."
"It is now absolutely essential to move on with these initiatives."
"I therefore want to conclude by saying that we need an alliance of institutions to pursue these objectives."
"The European Union has always produced the best results by an alliance of the Parliament and the Commission, so I count on your support in this regard."
"It is also important that we bring the national parliaments on board by taking an inclusive approach, as Mrs Goulard has suggested."
"But, most importantly, please recall that the European Parliament can help all of us in the European Union to act more quickly and with determination."
"So please convince your constituencies and help us convince the Member States, and not only the Spanish Presidency, which is very convinced."
"I trust you can, and will, make your voices heard, and I count on you taking a very strong and determined position in the Europe 2020 resolution in the course of this session week of the Parliament."
"Dear friends, we need nothing more than full steam ahead to reinforce economic governance in Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"If there is any lesson worth learning from the current economic crisis, it must be solidarity."
"The fact that we are living in a globalised world where states' economies are interdependent is nothing new."
"However, countries have failed to abandon their isolationist logic where solutions to economic challenges are applied at national level, without any consideration of their impact on a wider scale."
"The Lisbon Strategy failed due to a lack of political commitment on the part of Member States to take the lead in meeting its objectives."
"In order to ensure that the EU 2020 strategy succeeds where the Lisbon Strategy failed, national reform programmes need to be monitored more effectively at European level."
"Social inclusion must also be the main aim of good economic governance and state providers must learn to put people first before financial profit."
"Little more than a decade after the creation of the euro, the warnings that we made at the time are being borne out."
"The integration of economies at very different stages of development, with nominal convergence criteria, and individual monetary and exchange rate policies - all done to meet the needs of the great powers - has made the divergence crisis in the EU worse, leading to a situation whereby the peripheral economies are being called into question."
"Faced with the crisis that they created, speculative financial capital's decision-making centres - as well as their institutional extensions in the EU's institutions and in governments - have just launched a new and different attack on the people and workers of Europe."
"The lords of the EU have decided to usurp the budgetary powers of the Member States and they have done this not in the name of solidarity, which is a concept that is increasingly alien to them, but in the name of the stability that the great powers demand for the euro; this is an intolerable affront to democracy and the sovereignty of the peoples."
"This affront is accompanied by measures that are pure social terrorism, to which the national governments have meekly submitted."
"The response to the so-called 'European economic government' and to the increasingly antidemocratic nature of the integration process under way is being given by struggling workers all over Europe."
"The necessary change will grow out of this struggle and its drive towards progress."
"It is regrettable that the European Council and Commission have come here to state that they are taking measures to resolve financial and productive problems in a framework of budgetary discipline, and that they are presenting the creation of the task force as the ace in the hole for long-term measures."
"Despite acknowledging the delays to the hesitant measures that they have taken, what the representatives of the Spanish Presidency of the EU and the Commission have reaffirmed here was that they are going to continue down the same path of capitalist integration and go further with it; they are running around like headless chickens."
"They prefer to ignore that the so-called 'temporary stabilisation measure' and related fund will be nothing more than means of easing the pain of the financial crisis, used to conceal the fact that only a break with current policies and a change of course can bring social progress."
"To this end, it is vital to prioritise production, quality public services, the creation of jobs with rights, salaries, living pensions, social inclusion, and the fair division and distribution of income."
"However, all this requires true economic and social cohesion, with a clear strengthening of the Union budget, solidarity, more public policies and monitoring of the essential sectors of the economy by the state."
"The way out of the economic crisis is a bumpy one and, in addition, the fiscal problems in Greece and other Member States have rocked the euro area."
"These problems have raised the question as to whether Europe is capable of competing with the economic strength of the United States or China."
"With its EU 2020 strategy, the European Union must, therefore, give an effective response to the economic and financial crisis and ensure that the economic capacity of this bloc of 500 million people remains competitive, in other words, that the EU27 do not fall behind their economic and political rivals."
"The complexity of today's challenges requires an integrated set of political instruments."
"The EU must give primary importance to research and innovation in tackling challenges such as climate change and finding solutions to increasing global competition."
"Since, in the period after the crisis, providing stimulus to growth and to job creation through research and innovation has become more important than ever, I suggest that this be set as the prime objective of the EU 2020 strategy."
"We are justified in our concern, however, that the current budget does not adequately cover the monetary needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I ask the European Commission to propose a new budget model that is bold and ambitious but also practicable, in order to guarantee the success of the EU 2020 strategy."
"It is excellent that the Europe 2020 strategy should take account of young people."
"It does not, however, go far enough."
"The content is limited and pessimistic."
"There are not enough concrete objectives and more of them are needed."
"The figures for youth unemployment are alarming."
"It is more than double than what it is in other unemployment categories."
"Almost half of young people are unemployed in Latvia and Spain."
"The longer people remain unemployed, the greater the risk, not just of poverty, but of exclusion."
"Young people with just a little work experience are in a worse off position in the labour market, especially when it comes to staff cuts."
"Predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of workers."
"We cannot take it for granted, however, that the young people who are unemployed now will be able to meet this future need for workers."
"It is not necessarily such a straightforward procedure to integrate long-term unemployed young people back into society."
"We need concrete measures."
"The young need jobs, not promises."
"It is very important that we take responsibility for the future, and that children and young people remain at the core of all our plans."
"Launching the EU 2020 strategy intended to harmonise the Member States' economic and employment policies in accordance with common principles is perhaps the most important task facing us."
"I welcome the fact that, in addition to the aspects concerning a sustainable social market economy, environmental protection and innovation, the strategy also places great emphasis on the fight against poverty and exclusion, in other words, on strengthening social cohesion, a prerequisite for the abovementioned aims and one of the basic pillars of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency's programme."
"I consider it an important step forward that the European Commission has, in the second half of its integrated guidelines on the strategy, set out ambitious, quantitative targets in this regard."
"Two of these targets are that 75% of the working-age population should be employed and that the number of people living below the national poverty line should be reduced by 25%."
"For the purposes of monitoring and verifying progress in meeting these targets and an assessment of the struggle against social exclusion, it is worth considering the 'Laeken indicators' adopted by the 2001 European Council at Laeken, along with their components that have, in the meantime, been expanded and defined in greater detail."
"The Laeken indicators provide a detailed, reliable image of the position occupied by various social groups in certain segments of public life."
"They have been used successfully in the past few years by numerous EU institutions, including Eurostat."
"The main objective of the Europe 2020 strategy we are discussing should be to ensure economic growth in the European Union and to increase employment."
"The measures we take should aim to increase economic activity and, in this way, to achieve sustained economic growth in the long term."
"The indicators proposed by the Commission should be supplemented with an indicator of infrastructure saturation in the areas of teleinformatics, transport, energy, environment and social matters."
"A well-developed infrastructure is the basis for the efficient functioning of the internal market which, consequently, leads to a growth in internal demand and economic activity."
"In addition, a well-developed infrastructure is necessary to reduce differences in development between regions, leading to higher competitiveness and stronger economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Furthermore, I would like to refer to the employment indicator, which should be treated as a priority."
"The steps we take should concentrate not only on structural reforms, but also on better preparation and use of the EU's workforce and intellectual capital."
"I suppose none of us is in any doubt that, along with implementation of the EU 2020 strategy, we will need stronger leadership and greater political responsibility from Member States, and also the European Commission, in the area of undertaking structural reforms."
"In this context, it would be helpful to make a thorough evaluation of the EU 2020 strategy around five years after its introduction, in other words, at the end of the mandate of the current European Commission."
"This would allow political responsibility to be strengthened and actions to be correlated with results."
"in writing. - The implementation of the EU 2020 strategy should emphasise economic cohesion, meaning that it is still crucial to reduce economic disparities between EU regions which lag behind and those which are more prosperous."
"I believe that the EU's attention should be still largely paid to the principle of solidarity and instruments for levelling out the income disparities."
"The focus should be kept on the EU regions which have suffered the most from the economic and financial crisis, and the specific situation of each of these regions should be assessed and appropriate reaction to the corresponding challenges should be taken."
"In the Europe 2020 strategy, the agricultural sector is regarded like any other sector in our modern economy, and I welcome that."
"I am a strong supporter of a Common Agricultural Policy which secures a level playing field for all Member States."
"Fair competition in the internal market is a key to the competitiveness of European agriculture in the global marketplace."
"There has to be a synergy between the 2020 strategy and reform of the CAP post-2013 - both have to focus on promoting intelligent green growth."
"The Polish Minister for Culture and National Heritage, Bogdan Zdrojewski, has pointed out that one aspect which should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy is culture."
"I must admit that the Minister's argument is convincing."
"For what he wants to do is to 'stress the need to make full use of the potential of culture and the creative industries - Europe's intellectual and social capital'."
"The creative industries can be treated as something which will allow Europe to build a competitive advantage."
"The Europe 2020 strategy was discussed at an informal meeting of Ministers for Culture in March this year."
"As a result of that discussion, the Spanish Presidency called on 'the Council to recognise and use the creative potential of Europe through culture and its related industries in the 2020 strategy' and on 'Member States and the Commission to work in their respective fields to achieve the objectives ... through representative initiatives related to innovation, competitiveness, the digital agenda and social inclusion.'"
"I hope these appeals will be heard and put into practice."
"The large-scale economic crisis of the last few years has contributed to the failure of the objectives set by the EU at the start of this century."
"This is the reason why it is important for us to identify the shortcomings of the Lisbon Agenda and focus on the positive results that have been achieved, as well as avoid the mistakes made in the past."
"I believe that it is important for us now to be able to learn the lesson from the Lisbon Strategy's failure and also to have the ability to take action to mitigate the impact of this in future."
"I think that we have the great advantage of knowing the reasons for failure and of successfully avoiding them as part of the new EU 2020 strategy."
"I would particularly like to focus at this point on strengthening multi-level governance."
"We must involve local and regional authorities, as well as civil society, in the governance process since, according to EU statistics, local and regional authorities enjoy the highest level of trust among ordinary citizens."
"At the same time, reinforcing the regional aspect is included on the list of the EU 2020 strategy's priorities."
"In this respect, I feel that the role of the future Cohesion policy is to identify and utilise specific local potential."
"The report spells out exactly the important contribution made by the Structural and Cohesion Funds to Europe's economic life and in achieving the objectives which have been presented to us as part of the EU 2020 Agenda."
"Some ideas are worth highlighting: the key role played by cities in achieving these objectives and the role of research and education."
"At the same time, I would like to express my dismay that the report is not more comprehensive, by including the role played by the rural development funds."
"By revitalising rural economic life, modernising agriculture in Europe, helping to set up young farmers and spreading best practice, the rural development funds themselves make an important and welcome contribution to general economic advancement across the European Union."
"Mr President, when outlining the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission certainly managed to express many of the things we would wish for, yet they seem to have forgotten the present reality."
"Several Member States, including Estonia, have made large cutbacks in the interests of balancing the national budget."
"While fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for the euro area, Estonia has been able to stabilise its own budget."
"At the same time, the consequences of the irresponsible budgetary policy which has operated hitherto in several Member States will obviously remain to haunt the European Union for some years to come."
"Taking into account the current complicated economic situation, it remains unclear how the Commission's strategy and the large projects incorporated in it intend to deal with this."
"We could learn from our mistakes so that, unlike with the failed Lisbon Strategy, we would have a clear understanding of how we will achieve the objectives set, what kinds of financial resources we will be able to use, and whether our resources will enable us to achieve any of the objectives."
"We do not need grand words at the European Union level; every Member State, too, must strive to balance its budget and achieve economic growth."
"While noting the structural changes taking place in the world economy, mainly the tightening of competition, and also the demographic changes in Europe, we must, instead of lofty but empty-worded ideas, focus on radically reforming the entire economic and social system of the European Union."
"There is no other way to escape today from a welfare society which, although still comfortable, is quickly becoming uncompetitive and is therefore deteriorating."
"We necessarily face some unpopular decisions, but by making these decisions today, we will adapt much more quickly to the new reality."
"The economic crisis we are seeing is made up of a continuum of three crises that are linked to one another."
"These are the financial crisis, the crisis in the real economy that followed it, and the crisis in the public economies that now comes from them."
"These crises reveal the problems of European and global control and supervision: the economic crisis is largely a matter of a crisis in the system that once prevailed and in policy."
"Both the world of finance and economic activity no longer know their limits."
"It is not possible to manage activity that goes beyond its limits merely by resorting to national tools: we need regional and global rules."
"As Mr Monti's report, which appeared last week, states, a single ad hoc solution to each crisis is no longer enough for Europe."
"We need predictive and longterm solutions and tools to help us manage future crises better than we do now."
"Crucial here are the willingness and ability of the Member States to cooperate, and that still leaves a lot to be desired."
"The Council deserves praise for its decisive action in its solution to the crisis that has threatened the whole of the Union, but not for its very prompt action: real action on the part of the Member States only followed because it had to."
"The dawdling probably caused the situation to escalate."
"One of the most obvious forms of action in the future is the need to reform the EU's budget and ensure that national budgets are more closely in line with common objectives."
"Financial controls and regulation are already being made more effective, but we still need more measures to ensure that all financial products are brought within the scope of effective and viable regulation."
"Achieving a minimum 25% reduction in the EU poverty level by 2020 is a target closely linked to the growth of employment among the population, which is a priority of the social inclusion policy."
"This is the reason why an ambitious long-term strategy is required to combat poverty, with large-scale poverty reduction targets, whose 'key points' must include an increase in the employment rate and in good quality jobs, including for women, young people, the elderly and poor workers."
"This strategy must include measures aimed at achieving a work-life balance and greater involvement in an open labour market, which also means lifting access restrictions for Romanian and Bulgarian workers."
"Another objective for reducing poverty is to establish a minimum income of at least 60% of national median equalised income, a minimum salary of at least 60% of the average salary in the relevant sectors at national level, along with a coordinated housing strategy in Europe."
"All these measures must be accompanied by a clear timetable which is easy to implement and monitor."
"One of the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is to raise the employment rate among people aged 20-64 to 75%."
"Another is to fight poverty, which is intended to improve the situation of 20 million people."
"These effects are much to be desired and very ambitious."
"Our objective is a modernised labour market with a highly specialised, precisely oriented and very efficient workforce."
"However, I think this will be difficult to achieve."
"At present, 15% of young people do not complete a full secondary education."
"Over 30% complete tertiary education but, in spite of this, do not find work because the qualifications they have gained do not meet the needs of the market."
"The lifelong learning programme does not take account of the particular situation of people who do not possess a university education."
"If, however, we are talking about the phenomenon of poverty, the same social groups are most at risk from it: the unemployed, the poorly educated and the elderly."
"Such high unemployment is undoubtedly an effect of the crisis, which has caused, among other things, a drop in industrial production to the level of 20 years ago."
"I support the Commission in its consistent efforts towards making the EU economy competitive in relation to the United States and Japan, but I suggest a more realistic approach in the exceptionally difficult financial situation."
"The economic and financial crisis has made it necessary in many Member States to introduce cost-saving measures and to reform existing structures."
"It has, once again, proven to be the case that a crisis can speed up the introduction of major changes and reforms."
"The European Union must also consider in which direction it needs to move in order to meet the new challenges and enhance competitiveness, and whether it will be able to harmonise the interests of Member States more successfully and thereby strengthen internal cohesion."
"I think that increased scrutiny of the particular situation in the new Member States during the process of implementing reforms is of crucial importance, not only for the success of the Europe 2020 strategy, but for the future of the Union itself."
"I ask the Council to pay closer attention to this matter, especially with regard to structural changes in the areas of the common agricultural policy and the Cohesion policy."
"Various aspects of the Lisbon Strategy in which there was little success can be identified."
"Few of the established objectives were achieved, owing to various factors: amongst others, the lack of political will and of instruments - not least financial ones."
"Local and regional authorities have also been pointing out that they were not involved enough, in either defining or implementing the strategy, and that European and national objectives did not match up well."
"All this tarred the Lisbon Strategy's programme with a credibility deficit, which is also a result of the fact that, while it was defined in great detail, the way in which it was executed was not responsible enough."
"At a time of economic uncertainty, fragile public finances and high unemployment, the new 2020 strategy must be seen as an opportunity for reflection on the direction that the public wants for the European Union."
"Nevertheless, it will be difficult to all be headed in the same direction while the Member States and their regions - particularly the outermost regions - remain as unequal as they currently are."
"Perhaps it is also time for us to develop new types of economic, financial and even budgetary links, particularly in the euro area."
"I am convinced that such links can make a decisive contribution to achieving the goals that are currently being set, particularly those relating to territorial cohesion."
"In March, the European Commission presented a new economic development plan for Europe."
"After the Lisbon Strategy, Europe 2020 is the next attempt at reviving the European economy."
"However, this time the challenge is more difficult, because the plan has to be put into effect in a situation of economic crisis."
"Smart growth, sustainable growth and inclusive growth are the priorities proposed in the new strategy, and they define where the EU wants to be by 2020."
"However, before we begin to act upon these priorities, we must draw some lessons from the economic collapse, which has spread permanently across the world."
"The economies of Europe are strongly linked."
"None of the Member States is able to mount effective resistance to global threats on its own."
"When we act together, we are stronger, and therefore, to emerge successfully from the crisis and put the principles of Europe 2020 into effect, we need close coordination of the economic policies of all the countries of the European Union."
"Not doing this may lead to another lost decade, a lasting halt to growth and mass unemployment."
"The new strategy is based on very ambitious ideas."
"In relation to this, we must make every effort so that this attempt to develop another economic strategy for Europe does not turn out to be just wishful thinking and does not end up like the Lisbon Strategy, which was supposed to transform the European Union into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, but which was a spectacular failure. Thank you."
"Calendar of part-sessions"
"Before going ahead with the vote, I must inform you that, at its meeting on 12 May last, the Conference of Presidents decided, in accordance with Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure, to hold an extraordinary session on Wednesday, 23 June from 15.00 to 17.00."
"At that session, the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, will have an opportunity to inform the Parliament about the conclusions of the European Council meeting to be held on 17 June, pursuant to Article 15 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order to enquire whether it is going to become a precedent that we are to find, on our desks in this House, items of information relating to motions to sign."
"Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the case, surely it is to be deplored that we get junk put on our places over which we have no control whatsoever."
"Can you please stop it?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Atkins, we take good note of your remark or protest or whatever it is."
"(DE) Mr President, on the subject of the same point of order, it is not enough for the President to take note of this."
"I am calling for this to be stopped."
"The Presidency has taken note to act accordingly."
"However, taking note is the first step. After taking note, one acts accordingly."
"Welcome"
"I am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the National Assembly of Kuwait is present in the House in the public gallery."
"We would like to extend a warm welcome to the Kuwaiti Delegation."
"(Applause)"
"The Delegation is led by Mr Ali Al-Debaqbasi and has come to Strasbourg to meet with Members of our House."
"Relations between the European Union and the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which this year is chaired by Kuwait, are very important for our Parliament."
"We are convinced that a fruitful dialogue between the European Parliament and the Parliaments of the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council will serve to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council and thus encourage a swift and successful conclusion to the free trade agreement negotiations."
"We therefore wish Mr Al-Debaqbasi and his colleagues a fruitful stay with us."

"This time, we have the opportunity to do this six months earlier, although it should be said very clearly that Parliament finally has to convince the Council, firstly, to submit documents earlier, and secondly, to submit full documentation which really does cover the reporting period in question."
"We have been given, for example, documents from the year before."
"I think this situation - one of a certain crisis in relations between Parliament and the Council - points to the need for the European Parliament to put greater pressure on the Council concerning greater transparency over budgetary expenditure."
"In view of the Treaty of Lisbon in particular, which increases the role of the European Parliament, this is simply indispensable."

"Parliament's calendar of part-sessions - 2011 (vote)"
"- On Amendment 4:"
"Mr President, on a point of order, can you confirm that voting for Amendment 4 will succeed in reducing the number of times that we visit Strasbourg but, at the same time, will comply with our treaty obligation to hold 12 sessions?"
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see from the voting list that you, Mr President, intend to declare Amendment 2 inadmissible."
"I would like to ask you to reconsider this."
"It is correct that Article 229 of the treaty requires a session of the European Parliament to take place on the second Tuesday in March."
"However, this does not conflict with the amendment tabled by my group."
"My group's amendment aims to move the Strasbourg week from week 10 to week 11."
"That does not prevent you from holding a plenary session on the second Tuesday in March."
"We want the Strasbourg week to be week 11, but this does not mean that our amendment is inadmissible."
"I would like to ask you to reconsider this."
"You have read my mind, Mr Lehne, because I was going to proceed exactly as you had anticipated."
"- On Amendment 4:"
"(FR) I shall be very brief, Mr President."
"I think that, despite its ambiguous wording, Amendment 4 should have been declared inadmissible because it contradicts the treaties and, even more so, the interpretation of these treaties that has been given very clearly in a judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, which provides that the current number of part-sessions in Strasbourg must be maintained."
"I understand that some Members may disagree with this but, nevertheless, the treaties make this absolutely clear, and the judgment by the Luxembourg Court is equally clear as the law stands at the moment."
"I must inform you before voting that the Presidency believes that Amendment 2 is in breach of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, declares Amendment 2 to be inadmissible."
"Article 229 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the European Parliament, and I quote: 'shall meet without requiring to be convened, on the second Tuesday in March'."
"The Conference of Presidents has approved a calendar proposal for 2011 that includes a part-session period from 7 to 10 March, thus complying with Article 229 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Amendment 2 proposes that this part-session period be postponed to the following week."
"If Parliament were to approve this amendment, we would be in breach of Article 229."
"Accordingly, it is declared to be inadmissible."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 3:"
"(DE) Mr President, I am sorry, but it is not as simple as that."
"You have quoted Article 229 completely correctly, but it is not in conflict with our amendment."
"Article 229 refers to a specific day, which is the second Tuesday in March."
"Our amendment refers to the Strasbourg week as a whole, which consists of four days."
"Therefore, it must be admissible to move this plenary week in Strasbourg from week 10 to week 11."
"That does not prevent anyone from holding a plenary session in Brussels on the second Tuesday in March."
"As you say yourself, those are the terms of the treaty."
"Mr Lehne, this amendment raises a question that could very well be open to different interpretations."
"The Rules of Procedure stipulate that in these cases, the Presidency has the last word as regards the applicable interpretation."
"For the reasons I have explained, the Presidency has decided to declare Amendment 2 to be inadmissible as a result of being in breach of Article 229 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"It goes without saying that any other interpretation merits respect."
"However, as the Presidency has to decide, it has so decided."
"Before the vote:"
"(IT) Mr President, please excuse me for taking this opportunity to state that intervention is needed to provide direct flight connections without complications between Strasbourg and the European capitals for those who are currently forced to take three or four flights to reach Strasbourg."
"I request that you take appropriate action."
"(Applause)"
"9."
"Food additives other than colours and sweeteners (bovine and/or porcine thrombin) ("
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, we do not need to take a detour with regard to this vote."
"We can decide directly."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has recommended that plenary bans the sticking together of separate pieces of meat and therefore does not allow thrombin to be used as an additive."
"A steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham."
"I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want."
"Therefore, please vote in favour of our amendment not to include thrombin as an additive in our food regulation."
"Mr President, thrombin is an additive that can be used to stick meat because the fact is that there are no technological or food safety problems related to its use. Indeed, it is already used in some countries."
"The proposed amendment to the annex states that meat processed with thrombin can be sold pre-packed and labelled; thus, the consumer will not be deceived, which is the basic principle of the resolution."
"Whatever the case, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the European Commission can commit to products that contain thrombin not being able to be considered as imitations as a result of a suitable label, especially within the framework of the present study of the proposed Regulation on the food information provided to the consumer."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, when considering the authorisation of the food additive thrombin, the Commission's collaboration with all Member States considered carefully all four requirements set out in the Regulation on food additives. These are: the safety aspect; whether there is a reasonable technological need; information aspects; and advantages and benefits to consumers."
"As regards safety and hygiene, EFSA evaluated the product and concluded that this additive raised no safety concerns."
"As for hygiene, I cannot share the view that, in this case, the risk of contamination is higher than other products, for example minced meat."
"Secondly, the reasonable technological need for this product has been established."
"The enzyme preparation functions as a stabiliser in the final meat product."
"This technological function is explicitly described in the Food Additives Regulation, which was adopted by Parliament."
"Thirdly, information aspects and, in particular, the major concerns expressed in the report that the product would mislead the consumer."
"Because we are fully aware of the possible risk of this, our proposal includes the following strict requirements - which, incidentally, go further than what is usually required for food additives."
"Firstly, the product can only be sold pre-packed to the final consumer."
"Secondly, the product must carry additional labelling and the term 'combined meat parts' must be mentioned in the proximity of the sales name."
"The consumer, therefore, will be well informed about the nature of the product."
"Thirdly, the name of the enzyme and its animal origin must be mentioned in the list of ingredients."
"I must emphasise that these labelling requirements are more stringent than the requirements that apply to products to which other ingredients, such as blood proteins and authorised additives, have been added for the same purpose but for which no additional labelling is required."
"If more stringent labelling requirements are indicated, they will be considered."
"The enzyme preparation in question is already used in several Member States as a processing aid without any labelling requirements."
"Our proposal clarifies the situation and would oblige Member States to apply the required labelling rules."
"As a consequence, the consumer would be better informed."
"Furthermore, consumers, especially those who need more support, will benefit from the availability of cheaper meat products as better use is made of valuable meat pieces occurring during the processing of meat."
"This additive is, in my opinion, an example of a food-sector development which will benefit consumers."
"I see no reason for its suppression and hope very much that you will appreciate the entirely valid reasons I have set out as to why it should be approved."
"I have made a commitment to Parliament;"
"I will not tell people what to eat."
"But I will tell them what they are eating."
"My position is in line with this commitment."

"Explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, I have a high opinion of you and your chairmanship, but today I must make a protest."
"You have given the floor to many Members, including twice to Mr Lehne and to Mr Gollnisch and Mr Fox."
"I also raised a point of order concerning the calendar and it is an important point."
"I would like to ask you to check whether Amendment 4 was unlawful."
"I know that we rejected the amendment, but this is a question of principle."
"The treaty does not refer to 12 plenary sessions per year, but to 12 monthly plenary sessions per year."
"The amendment tabled by Mr Fox attempted to combine the August and the September plenary sessions in one week."
"This is not about a September I and September II plenary session, but about an August and a September plenary session."
"I would really like to clarify that this is unlawful."
"The fact is, Mr Posselt, that this issue has already been voted on and we cannot therefore reopen it."
"Nonetheless, you can rest assured that all the amendments to the calendar have been carefully considered by the Presidency."
"Mr President, the Commissioner informed us just before the vote about the thrombin issue."
"I wonder if you could ask him to provide the statistical data to justify his statement that it is economically beneficial to consumers to replace cheap meat parts and put them in beef-like products, rather than using them today in sausages and other products."
"I would like him to show the statistical evidence that it is economically better for consumers, because they have so far not proven that."
"The Commissioner also made a comparison with minced meat but we know that the hygiene standards for minced meat are not the same as for prepared meat products, so I would question if both statements by the Commissioner are correct."
"If he misinformed Parliament, just before the vote, that would be a serious error."
"I would like you to write a letter to the Commissioner to justify those statements."
"We are not dealing with that item now, Mr Schlyter."
"We are dealing with explanations of vote."
"We are dealing with explanations of vote concerning the amending budget."
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(CS) I voted against the report of Vladimír Maňka setting out the EU budget for this year."
"At a time of economic crisis, when it is essential to reduce public expenditure, I do not agree with the European Parliament going in completely the opposite direction and sharply increasing its expenditure."
"I do not agree with the European Parliament taking on an additional 150 staff, nor do I agree that Members of the European Parliament should receive additional new funding for their assistants, over and above what we already receive."
"MEPs are to receive EUR 1 500 more per month this year under the Maňka report, on top of the additional EUR 1 500 per month under the Helga Trüpel report, which was passed yesterday."
"This will cost taxpayers an additional EUR 13.4 million per year."
"MEPs are already the subject of public criticism over the large sums of public money they receive."
"A further increase will meet with justified public anger throughout Europe, and I have therefore not supported this proposal."
"(PL) In contradistinction to the previous speaker, I endorsed the amending budget."
"It is not an amendment which only concerns accounting."
"This amendment makes very good sense."
"How is this? Well, it comes from our new function as Parliament, as a body which has been given legislative powers."
"The voters expect from us, MEPs, that we will be able to revise proposals submitted by the Commission, and that we will be able to revise proposals submitted by the Council."
"Let us remember that each Commissioner has a team of hundreds of people working with them."
"We have just one or two people to support us."
"So it is not a saving which we are ostensibly talking about, here."
"It is simply a response to a new function, a new role."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maňka, for his superb report."
"(BG) Mr President, I wish to say that I supported the reports on the organ transplantation action plan, as well as the report on organ quality and safety."
"However, I wish to say that there are great differences between Member States in this respect."
"I therefore hope that this action plan and the report on quality and safety will help Member States to standardise their criteria and that they will be used as a benchmark for the future."
"I am mentioning this because my country, Bulgaria, has 35 times fewer donors than Spain."
"The problems in this area are linked to the whole chain of actions: from providing information to citizens to the actual transplant itself and post-transplant treatment."
"We do not have a network of donor facilities."
"There is insufficient equipment available, and we do not have a reliable donor database."
"Bulgaria is not a member of Eurotransplant and post-transplant treatment cannot be provided either."
"We do not have dispensaries built for hospitals which carry out transplants."
"This is why I hope that this report and the decisions made by Parliament will provide some impetus and that this directive will be implemented as soon as possible."
"(ET) Mr President, I also voted in favour of this report, because it establishes uniform and binding requirements on quality and standards for human organs used in transplants in all the Member States, and thus guarantees the protection of donors and recipients while, at the same time, enhancing cooperation between the Member States."
"With this report, we have given the opportunity of a better quality of life to those people - more than 56 000 European Union residents - who are currently waiting for an organ transplant."
"(LT) I also voted for this important document on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation."
"It really would be excellent to establish and organise a community-wide organ transplantation system that would be transparent and clean and which would ensure quality and safety at EU level."
"That is one of the most important objectives."
"56 000 citizens are waiting for donors and this shortage of organs intended for transplantation also causes other problems, criminal activity and criminal problems."
"Therefore, I believe that this document will contribute to the creation of a suitable system that will ensure safe and reliable organ transplantation methods."
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report and I would like to congratulate Mr Mikolášik on the excellent work he has done."
"I believe that today is an important day, because we have ensured that donors and recipients of organs will have consistent standards and greater safety."
"I hope that this will also help to simplify the cooperation between countries and, therefore, I am very pleased that we have voted in favour of this report with a large majority."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this report and the new European rules for organ donation."
"If you die in another European Union country, why should your organ not be used to save life?"
"If you need a rare match from another European country, surely these rules are sensible to implement."
"Although it has not been part of the debate, I would also like to put on record my personal support for an opt-out rather than an opt-in system for organ donation."
"Eighty per cent of European citizens say they support organ donation, yet only twelve per cent hold organ donation cards."
"We have to close the gap."
"Last year, 25 people in my East of England regional constituency died because they were on the organ donor waiting list but no donor could be found in time."
"At Addenbrooke's and Papworth hospitals in my constituency, we have European and worldwide expertise in lung and heart transplants."
"Let our surgeons do their work."
"Let our patients be treated."
"This is the gift of life."
"(DE) Mr President, I can only agree with the previous speaker."
"I am also very grateful that this report was adopted today with a large majority."
"When we hear that 56 000 Europeans are currently waiting for a matching organ in order to be able to have a reasonable or a high quality of life, or even simply to survive, it is clear that we urgently need to harmonise and improve the standards and to make it possible for recipients to access organs from throughout Europe."
"(PL) I, too, was in favour of adopting this document, because it is certainly a step in the right direction."
"However, while I agree with these principles, and that we are going to be concerned about the quality of donors and organs, I want to say clearly that this is only the first step in the right direction."
"If we want to bring about a fundamental increase in organ donations, the Union needs a significantly broader campaign, and measures of a prophylactic and informative nature."
"If this is not followed by promoting donation, it seems to me we will simply stop half-way."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to compliment you for the manner in which you handled this difficult topic here today, for explaining with courtesy the presidency's interpretation and for sticking to your guns."
"If you hadn't done so, it would probably be the case that we would be still here."
"I'm not saying I agree with you, but I am not qualified enough to give an opinion so I took your opinion as gospel."
"Secondly, I think the point made by Mr Salatto is valid, that we do need to have quicker and more accessible routes in and out of Strasbourg for the benefit of Members and others."
"Also I would like to compliment the quaestors, including my own compatriot, Jim Higgins, and others who are working hard to get Frankfurt-Hahn designated the same as Frankfurt airport and Strasbourg, from the point of view of transportation."
"Finally, I would like to say, regarding the accommodation charges here in Strasbourg, it would be helpful if they were the same for the weeks that we are sitting in Parliament as the weeks when we are not sitting."
"All this would make Strasbourg more attractive because it is a beautiful city."
"I understand why we are here, and once we are here, we are very happy."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the transplantation of human organs."
"Many people die every day because they suffer from organ failure and because organs are unavailable."
"The EU can help patients waiting for organs across Europe and, as a consequence, save lives."
"What we need is a well-coordinated system of organ donation and transplantation."
"I would like to stress once again a very important point, which is a political point: namely, the principle of voluntary and paid donation for human body parts."
"Reports from the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe say that in several countries in the world, people are given a great deal of money to donate an organ."
"There are even reports that people are deliberately killed to get their organs: for example, practitioners of Falun Gong in China."
"We are also aware of cases in some countries where the medical risk for the donor is high and the transplantation is often done under very bad medical conditions."
"So, finally, I would like to thank those who initiated the resolution we adopted today, and especially our rapporteur, Mr Mikolášik."
"(SV) Mr President, I and the other Swedish Conservatives have voted against the proposal to ban thrombin."
"The Commission proposal calls for clear labelling of meat that has been stuck together in this way and states that it should not be permitted in restaurants and large-scale catering establishments as it is difficult, in places like this, to provide customers with clear information."
"We must defuse the debate about meat glues."
"Thrombin is naturally present in all meat."
"To avoid thrombin, it would be necessary to stop eating meat completely."
"The Commission's experts state that thrombin is not hazardous to health, and this opinion is scientifically based."
"The important thing is that food is safe and that consumers are not deceived."
"Packaging must include accurate information about thrombin and the labelling must be clear."
"Why should we ban thrombin?"
"To do so would be to open Pandora's box."
"Is it really the job of politicians to manage our food?"
"Where will it end?"
"There are no grounds here for limiting consumers' freedom and their right to freedom of choice."
"When it comes to scaremongering politics about food that is not dangerous or unhealthy, I say 'that is enough!'"
"Do not resort to a ban - tighten up the rules on labelling instead."
"(DE) Mr President, adopting the resolution banning thrombin in foodstuffs today simply means giving in to public opinion."
"It is pure populism."
"We are not fulfilling our responsibilities if we do not follow the scientific evidence."
"What is the evidence?"
"What is thrombin?"
"Thrombin is a natural enzyme."
"It forms part of the blood and therefore of meat."
"All of us have a lot of thrombin in our bodies."
"If we ban it as a food additive, can we continue to exist or do we have to gradually dispose of ourselves as hazardous waste?"
"Of course, we must prevent consumers from being misled by products which look like and are designed to look like other products."
"We can do this by using labelling in line with the new Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs. We will be voting on the first reading of this regulation in June."
"We have a number of rules that prevent misleading advertising and we also have additional labelling for special products."
"The Commission has proposed exactly the same solution for labelling products in which thrombin is used as a glue."
"I would like to point out that there is a large number of similar enzymes which are not banned and are still used."
"(DE) Mr President, consumer protection is a very, very important matter for me and therefore I am against consumers being misled or deceived in any way."
"This is why I am fighting for better labelling of food imitations in the Regulation on the labelling of foodstuffs, for example."
"I am calling on the Council to follow this approach, which is also supported by the Commission."
"Today, we had to vote on glued meat."
"Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality product."
"In my opinion, this should not be happening, in particular, when consumers are not aware of what is going on."
"The decision today was not an easy one for me."
"The Commission has proposed comprehensive labelling rules, but consumers may still be misled, because it is difficult to prove that a product contains thrombin."
"This means that it may be used but not indicated on the label."
"Therefore, I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case."
"I have now voted in favour of the resolution and of a ban on thrombin."
"(HU) Over the past eight years, the post-communist dictatorship in Hungary has systematically trodden underfoot the rights of Hungarians."
"Among other things, it has unlawfully disbanded or had disbanded nearly every single street demonstration."
"With the help of nearly 100 excellent lawyers and solicitors from the National Legal Defence Service, the majority of cases have already succeeded in obtaining legal redress before the Hungarian courts, but there have been cases, such as the now famous Bukta case, which had to be taken to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"The European Union is now scheming to dismantle, under the guise of accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the smoothly functioning 'Strasbourg' system."
"I call upon every single Hungarian and European human rights organisation to scrutinise this process and protest against things such as the Atondo report that has been adopted today, which, as I say, undermines and dismantles the European human rights protection system."
"It is Hungary's historic responsibility to see that under the Hungarian Presidency, we do not speed up but rather prevent this dangerous process."
"(LT) This topic is actually quite sensitive and has been the cause of much debate in the European Parliament and, of course, in society at large."
"I still think that banning some products or additives is not a solution and perhaps we have to agree with the argument that it is the consumer who has the right to choose, having full information, what he wants to buy and what he wants to consume."
"On the other hand, controlling the process would be rather difficult."
"In this day and age, the age of public awareness, with a lot of accessible information, we have yet to formulate wordings, unambiguous of course, that are acceptable to society, so that when people buy one product or another, they can obtain appropriate information and can understand what the product's ingredients are."
"Therefore, I feel there need to be more consultations with society, its education and perhaps additional consultations with scientists."
"(DE) Mr President, the citizens of Europe are right."
"They like honest foods and they like honest politicians."
"I respect public opinion of this kind."
"We cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismiss it as populism."
"That is not the case."
"We must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us."
"If our constituents and our citizens are of the opinion that real meat must be real meat and that it must not be made of pieces of meat glued together, then we must make sure that it is not possible for meat to be processed in this way."
"This is why I have voted against allowing thrombin to be used as a food glue."
"(DE) Mr President, I have also voted in favour of the resolution banning the use of thrombin as a food additive, because the Commissioner's arguments did not convince me."
"We do not want glued meat in Europe."
"Even if thrombin is an enzyme which is not harmful to health, by using it to glue together scraps of meat to make one large compressed piece of meat, the risk of bacterial infections must be significantly increased."
"On the other hand, the decision made today was clearly for the benefit of the consumers of Europe and in opposition to the purely financial interests of the industry."
"Consumers who want a steak must be given a steak and not a piece of meat that has been glued together."
"This means that we must call on the Commission not to authorise the use of thrombin."
"(DE) Mr President, the current debate about so-called glued ham shows that some manufacturers do not deal honestly with consumers."
"I would like all food to be labelled in such a way that it is not possible to mislead consumers."
"If this enzyme is used, consumers must be able to identify its presence."
"This is the basis for effective and fair consumer protection."
"Our job is to ensure that mature consumers have sufficient information to make decisions in their own interests."
"One final remark about glued ham."
"The discussion with consumers about whether or not they want it has not yet taken place."
"However, it is important that consumers at least know what they are actually eating."
"(ET) I welcome the action plan, and I therefore voted in favour of it."
"This is a step in the right direction, and in order to solve this problem, we must all work together."
"Measures at European Union level will help us to enhance the efforts of the Member States to ensure the quality and safety of organ donation and transplants, to deal better with problems resulting from the lack of organs and, at the same time, to make the system of transplants more effective."
"The action plan which has been approved will give the Member States the opportunity to use the ten priority measures set out by us as a basis for putting their national action plans together in a better way."
"We are obliged, within the scope of our competency, to give help towards high-level health protection across the entire European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, acceding to the European Convention undoubtedly represents progress in the process of political integration of the European Union, whose system of protection for fundamental rights is supplemented and strengthened by the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its primary law."
"We consider it enormously important and politically significant that Parliament has been granted the right to appoint and send a certain number of representatives to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe during the election of judges to the European Court of Human Rights."
"Let us remember that promoting the respect of human rights is one of the fundamental values of the European Union enshrined in a founding treaty."
"I would also like to underscore how important the Convention and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights are in outlining a new legal and regulatory framework that lays down guiding principles in the areas of civil liberties, justice and internal affairs, above all, in light of the new forms of integration and harmonisation implemented with the enactment of the Treaty of Lisbon and the adoption of the Stockholm Programme."
"It will also provide an additional legal instrument which makes it possible to present a claim before the European Court of Human Rights against an action or a failure to act by a European institution or a Member State in the context of the implementation of European law."
"Lastly, it is significant that Article 1 of the European Convention will extend protection not only to citizens of the European Union and other persons within its territory, but also to persons who fall within its jurisdiction, even if they are outside the territory."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the European Union acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights because, as clearly summed up by the Atondo report, it represents progress in the process of European integration."
"This means a step towards political union and a strong sign of the coherence between the Union and countries of the Council of Europe and its policy on human rights which will strengthen the credibility of Europe in non-European countries."
"Lastly, it represents a clear desire to harmonise the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms at a legislative and court level."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union is an international entity with its own legal personality for the first time."
"I hope that signing the convention is only one of the first steps towards the affirmation of the European Union as a single body at the level of major international negotiations."
"(FR) Mr President, I am somewhat more reserved on this issue than the Members who have just spoken."
"Indeed, on the face of it, the idea of European law being subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is quite attractive."
"It was rather alarming that national laws could be, as it were, censured by that Court."
"However, the way in which national jurisdictions implement these laws means that European law falls outside their scope, all the more so as this European law, in my country, France, for example, takes precedence, under Article 55 of our constitution, over French domestic law."
"One might wonder, however, if this procedure will not result in a certain kind of overlap."
"Indeed, on the one hand, European law is rarely directly applicable within Member States; it first has to be transposed into domestic legislation by means of secondary legislation."
"On the other hand, the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg has shown itself to be keen to protect fundamental rights."
"It has also assimilated this legislation as arising from the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The fear is that we could end up with rather protracted proceedings, particularly if, as some people are demanding, a preliminary question procedure is instituted."
"This is why we would have preferred a distinction to have been made between compliance with the rules and participation in the appeals procedure."
"(FR) Mr President, at a time when such tragic events are occurring in Thailand, we cannot fail to appreciate the need for major crimes committed against civilian populations to be referred to the courts."
"However, past experience is less encouraging than was indicated yesterday by several Members during the debate."
"At the first International Criminal Court, those who, without any military objective in mind, decided to use napalm to burn the civilian populations in the city of Dresden; those who decided to use atomic radiation to burn the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and those who decided to kill the imprisoned Polish officers by shooting them in the back of the neck were the judges, when they really should have been included among the accused."
"The track record of the former International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the Milosevic and Šešelj cases, is not very satisfactory either."
"With regard to the creation of a trust fund, if Member States are required to make a contribution, does this mean that Europe will compensate the victims of genocides that take place outside its territory?"
"There are hundreds of thousands, indeed millions of people who fall into that category."
"I fear that we are getting mixed up in something rather complicated."
"The idea of ultimately pursuing the defeated parties, in spite of the assurances that they are sometimes given, in order to reach a peace agreement would be to risk indefinitely prolonging conflicts; this is the basis for our reservations about this report."
"(LT) I voted for the resolution on the Review Conference on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that will begin at the end of this month in Kampala, Uganda."
"In 1998, 138 countries agreed to set up the International Criminal Court and adopted the Rome Statute on the basis of which this court has now been operating for 7 years, since 2003."
"The time has come to review the Rome Statute, in particular, the so-called 'temporary provisions' on which we were unable to agree in 2002."
"All EU Member States have ratified the Rome Statute."
"However, some of our partners, like the United States, Russia and China, have not joined the International Criminal Court in its work."
"With its resolution today, the European Parliament again calls on these countries to ratify the Rome Statute and cooperate with the International Criminal Court."
"In the 21st century, people responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes should expect not only moral condemnation from the international community but legal sanctions."
"These crimes cannot be committed with impunity."
"Written explanations of vote"
"As well as speeding up decision-making mechanisms, the Treaty of Lisbon is contributing to the fight against the democratic deficit, strengthening the roles of national parliaments and the European Parliament, and stressing the exercise of European citizenship."
"The introduction of the legislative petition, or the 'right to citizens' initiative', as it has been named, is of particular importance."
"This new device allows a group of not less than one million citizens of a significant number of Member States to request a legislative initiative from the Commission on the areas in which the Union has jurisdiction."
"The Treaty of Lisbon also makes clear the importance of consultations and dialogue with other institutions and bodies, with civil society, and with social partners, amongst others."
"I believe that Europe must be the citizens' Europe, and this can only happen if we make it more democratic and transparent."
"In this context, I agree that the opinions of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be sought."
"It must seem that I am repeating what I expressed yesterday in relation to Mr Tavares' report."
"However, the refugee problem is a European problem and it cannot be left to the national governments to manage, also in light of the geographic and economic differences."
"Therefore, I am in favour of creating a fund at a European level."
"The creation of such a fund must serve two purposes: it must support the refugees who arrive in our countries, frequently on our coasts, searching for help, as well as support the states which receive the greatest numbers of these desperate individuals due to their geographic location."
"In fact, the problem is, and must be, a European problem, and it cannot be left to the management of certain states."
"I hope that the fund is only the beginning of a path which approaches this entire issue from a more European perspective and in a spirit of solidarity."
"The proposal for a directive on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products is part, along with the two proposals on the energy performance of buildings and the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency, of the Energy Efficiency Package tabled by the Commission in November 2008."
"We voted for it because we achieved, through the agreement signed between Parliament, the Council and Commission, the introduction of an improved labelling system."
"Labels will contain more energy consumption information for domestic appliances and energy-related products."
"In future, this labelling will also be applied to energy consuming products intended for industrial and commercial use, which was not possible until now."
"Last but not least, any kind of future advertising promoting the price or energy efficiency of categories of products will also have to indicate their energy class."
"Providing accurate, relevant and comparable information on the energy consumption of energy-related products will allow consumers in future to make correct, effective choices, thereby reducing both their energy consumption and household expenditure."
"in writing. - The Maltese Government is against the Recommendation for second reading relating to labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products."
"The reason given is that the nationalist government disagrees with an explanation statement in the report, in particular, with the following phrase: 'Construction products with significant impact on the consumption of energy shall also be included in the priority list.'"
"It is inconceivable that the government does not agree to this recommendation on this basis."
"It could have agreed with the recommendation and made it clear that it had a reservation in relation to construction products which have a significant impact on the consumption of energy."
"It is useless for the government to appear to be in favour of energy efficiency when the potential savings could be achieved through the labelling of some of these products given that buildings account for 40% of total energy consumption in the European Union."
"I supported this important report."
"The Energy Labelling Directive has a crucial role to play in the achievement of the EU energy efficiency target of 20% by 2020."
"In that context, it holds a key role regarding the fight against climate change, the transition of the EU to an efficient, sustainable and competitive economy, and the strengthening of Europe's energy security."
"Our aim is to pave the way towards a win-win situation, both for the market and consumers, by guaranteeing every consumer access to proper information and full awareness about the impact of his or her choices."
"In that framework, the agreement reached on the Energy Labelling Directive brings important added value."
"I welcome the position fought for by the European Parliament to maintain the model of an A-G scale which, according to a survey, is the most convenient and easiest for consumers to understand."
"There is an obligation to include reference to the energy label in all advertisements of energy-related products, where price- or energy-related information is disclosed."
"I am pleased that the new legislation on the energy efficiency of products has finally been approved, following a lengthy tug of war between the European Parliament and the Council, and that I had the honour of being the shadow rapporteur for it on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"The benefit is an expansion of Class A, allowing distinctions to be drawn among the constantly increasing group of energy-saving appliances while, at the same time, motivating producers to make appliances that are as energy-saving as possible."
"It is also important that there has been no expansion in the number of classes indicating the energy consumption of individual products, as this preserves the clarity of the whole concept."
"The fact that there are seven levels in total enables consumers to make effective decisions when selecting goods on the market, thereby helping to reduce energy costs through their behaviour."
"As far as new features are concerned, involving the obligation to indicate the energy classes of products in advertising materials, I consider it a success that this obligation has been restricted to advertisements providing information on price or information connected with energy consumption."
"Fortunately, the view prevailed that the regulation of advertising is acceptable only in case of need, and only to the extent necessary."
"I voted for this recommendation because it effectively contributes to helping European consumers choose products that use less energy or which indirectly lead to less energy being used."
"By adopting this recommendation, the European Parliament is playing a part in moving closer to the realisation of the EU's objective of a 20% improvement in its energy efficiency by 2020."
"It is a balanced text that ensures a situation that is beneficial to the market and consumers."
"This initiative, like the one that we voted on yesterday regarding the energy efficiency of buildings, is part of a legislative package on energy efficiency that was presented by the Commission in November 2008 and has been the subject of ample debate in Parliament, the Commission and the Council; agreement is now, at last, being reached on the final text."
"As well as having positive consequences for the environment, for the European objective of reducing emissions and for the creation of an economy that is sustainable in energy terms, this initiative also has the benefit of making consumers central to the decision."
"With the correct markings and labels, consumers will know exactly what they are getting, and will be able to make their choice on the basis of criteria such as energy efficiency and the lowest environmental cost."
"The directive on energy labelling guarantees that consumers will receive adequate information thanks to the compulsory inclusion of the energy label on advertising."
"In the context of European efforts at achieving energy efficiency and the reduction of energy consumption levels, along with combating climate change, it is vital to mobilise the public for this cause."
"This can only be achieved if consumers are given clear and effective information about energy consumption on products that have been bought or are for sale."
"In this way, all members of the European public will become involved in combating climate change."
"It is absolutely crucial to ensure that consumers are able to consciously make more environmentally friendly choices."
"As this directive now ensures, levels of energy consumption caused by products are assessed against universal criteria and parameters, which allow them to be compared in a way that can be trusted."
"This will also lead to an increase in confidence in technical assessment and the information content on labels."
"This directive therefore has an important role in consolidating the 2020 strategy and, in particular, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020."
"Following this vote, products that consume energy - whether for domestic, commercial or industrial purposes - must start displaying the new energy efficiency label, in order to better inform consumers."
"There is provision in the directive adopted today by the European Parliament for new types of energy efficiency classification to be added, and it is also applicable to products that consume energy in an indirect way, for example, windows."
"Some of the details are debatable, for example, that the format of the label will be based on the a classification between A and G - like that already used for refrigerators - with the possible addition of the classifications A+, A++ and A+++: in principle, the total number of classes must be limited to seven."
"Nevertheless, the directive seems to have the right objective."
"All advertising for products related to energy or their respective prices must include a reference to the energy efficiency classification."
"The information provided must guide consumers towards choosing products that use less energy or indirectly lead to less energy being used."
"Therefore, in future, any advertising of the price or energy efficiency of refrigerators, washing machines or cookers must indicate the product's energy class."
"Much is said about the rights of consumers to know about the food, domestic equipment or home fittings which they buy."
"We want to know where they come from and how they were made, and the nutritional values of food."
"At a time of climate change, we all want to protect the environment and prevent abnormal weather, and this is why, when choosing food and everyday products, we are guided by ecological principles."
"It is important, therefore, that consumers are aware of how much energy is used by their equipment, and so I think they have the right for that information to be on the labels."
"Putting this information on product labels also shows the high quality of the product."
"It can then be a tool to protect the European market from cheap imitations of equipment from outside the European Union."
"I voted for this report."
"It acknowledges that the market is incapable of ensuring rational energy use."
"This is a definite concession that echoes our arguments, which I welcome."
"I also welcome the stated desire for top-down harmonisation of energy saving labelling."
"However, it is regrettable that total ecological footprint labelling for products is not proposed anywhere, when we really should implement it as quickly as possible."
"The EU is continuing to look determinedly for the best ways of ensuring excellence in energy efficiency, so as to succeed in improving its efficiency by 20% by 2020."
"This new labelling is very pertinent to consumers because it allows them access to better information so that they can make fully informed choices and recognise their impact in matters concerning energy efficiency."
"This means raising consumers' awareness of the energy-related consequences of their choice whenever they look to buy any consumer item which has a bearing on energy efficiency."
"The approval of this directive is especially important in increasing this awareness."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"If the energy consumption label is introduced, then provided that it can be easily understood, it will soon become clear whether or not it will really be accepted by consumers."
"Public awareness has changed in this area and consumers are paying greater attention to energy efficiency classes, in particular, in the case of electrical appliances."
"Of course, the public procurement process should set a good example in this respect."
"However, the Member States must not be told that they can only buy products with the highest performance levels which belong to the highest energy efficiency class."
"Particularly at a time when everyone will have to make savings, the purchase price will increasingly be the deciding factor."
"The choices available in the public procurement process are not specified clearly enough, which is why I have abstained."
"I voted for the resolution on the labelling of products using electricity and the provision of basic information for consumers."
"We talk about citizens' rights very often in Parliament - about the right to choose, the right to obtain accurate and correct information."
"In my opinion, that is particularly important in all areas of life."
"In this case, the question is related to the electricity used and its efficiency."
"People actually want to save energy, and mostly do this for two reasons, economic and environmental."
"Today, with advances in technology, when residents have the opportunity to choose electrical appliances according to their energy efficiency, the labelling that we agreed on will also help consumers make a conscious choice and contribute to energy saving (hence, citizens would choose more economical devices) and the preservation of the environment."
"I have no doubt that when Europeans see the amount of energy consumed, they will take advantage of the opportunity to choose more efficient and environmentally friendly products and equipment."
"Once more, I welcome the position of the European Parliament on this issue and I hope that such decisions will become a real stimulus and opportunity to realise our commitments to reduce energy consumption by 2020."
"The recast of the Energy Labelling Directive has the objective of extending the scope of labelling information to include all products that impact on energy consumption, and not just household appliances."
"The directive is part of the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan and it also envisages initiatives for incentives and public tenders."
"It will establish the fulcrum of an integrated and sustainable policy from an environmental standpoint."
"One of the most controversial points concerns which type of scale to use in order to avoid causing consumer confusion: it was decided to maintain the A-G closed scale layout after the European Parliament adopted a resolution in this regard."
"Energy efficiency ratings will also be displayed on all advertising containing information on energy consumption or which relates to product prices."
"For the reasons I have explained, I agree with the stance taken by Mrs Podimata and I support the report."
"The Energy Labelling Directive has a crucial role to play in the achievement of the EU energy efficiency target of 20% by 2020."
"It provides an important added value for both the market and consumers."
"In essence, the mandatory mention of the energy label in advertisements will put an end to misinformation of end users, giving them all the information they need to make fully informed choices."
"At the same time, due to Parliament's strong insistence, the introduction of an open scale layout was avoided, and maintaining the model of an A-G scale, which has a well proven value for consumers so far, was guaranteed."
"Moreover, the addition of a general review clause allows for a thorough re-examination in the light of technical evolution and consumer understanding of the label no later than 2014."
"This is one more safeguard that the consumer friendly scale as decided so far will remain unchanged at least until the review takes place."
"I therefore repeat with conviction that I fully support the directive."
"I voted for this report since, by including all energy-related products, the amendment to the Energy Labelling Directive will help achieve a EUR 4 million reduction in the transposition costs for each implementation measure updated and produced from scratch (if regulations/decisions are going to be used instead of directives)."
"It will also produce additional reductions amounting to approximately 78 Mt of CO2 emissions."
"In future, energy efficiency labelling will also be applied to energy consuming products intended for industrial and commercial use, such as cold storage rooms, retail display cabinets, industrial cooking appliances, vending machines (selling sandwiches, snacks, coffee, etc.), industrial motors, energy-related products, including construction products which do not consume energy but 'have a significant direct or indirect impact' on energy saving, such as windows and door frames."
"One important factor in ensuring the proper application of this directive is guaranteeing every citizen access to correct information and making consumers aware of the impact of the choices they make."
"Providing accurate, relevant and comparable information on the specific energy consumption of energy-related products will help end users make a decision based on energy-saving potential in order to reduce energy bills in the long term."
"I have voted in favour of the Podimata report because I believe that Parliament and especially the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) have managed to make extremely important advances with respect to a crucial directive in order to achieve the energy efficiency goal that we have set ourselves."
"Not only have we managed to maintain the A-G scale, which is known and accepted by European consumers, but we have also ensured that it is now obligatory to refer to the energy label of the domestic appliance as long as information on the price appears in its promotional or advertising material."
"Another noteworthy aspect introduced by Parliament is the obligation on the Commission to draw up a priority list of products related to energy, including some building products that are liable to be subject to measures in the future."
"Lastly, given the leadership role that must be taken by the public sector, I feel it is essential for administrations to acquire products that belong to the highest energy efficiency class in public tenders."
"Mr Maňka's report proposes several amendments to the European Parliament's 2010 budget."
"I voted for this report and, in particular, for its provisions that follow on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009."
"These include the EUR 1 500 per month increase in Members' assistance expenses."
"This increase is designed to enable Members to meet their new responsibilities arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, which considerably extends the scope of Parliament, thereby increasing its influence on EU decision making."
"Parliament needs to increase its expertise in legislative issues in order to match the Commission and the Member States."
"We represent European citizens and we need appropriate resources if we wish to defend their interests."
"I therefore supported this report."
"I believe that those committees that will have a heavier workload as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon need to be reinforced."
"This justifies an increase in the number of staff for Parliament's and the groups' secretariats in these committees."
"However, I do not share the view that we MEPs need more staff."
"I would have liked to have seen Parliament's resources being enhanced first and foremost by means of redistribution and measures to improve efficiency, so that the total budget is not increased."
"In my capacity as group leader for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Budgets, I also took this line in the negotiations with Parliament's Presidency."
"In the end, we reached a compromise to the effect that the proposal will now be partly funded through savings of EUR 4.4 million."
"I still believe that further savings should have been included in the proposal but, as I played an active role in the negotiations, I have chosen to support the compromise achieved."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will probably cause a significant rise in Parliament's workload."
"In particular, this will lead to more extensive use of the ordinary legislative procedure, which will affect around 95% of legislation passed."
"Additional budgetary and human resources will allow Parliament to fulfil its new role as colegislator on an equal footing with the Council."
"in writing. - I supported the Maňka Report on the European Parliament amending budget while conscious of the sensitivity of increasing budgets at a time when citizens are being asked to take pay cuts and jobs are being lost."
"The work in the European Parliament has undoubtedly increased because of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I intend to use the additional assistance allowance to provide opportunities to young students who are applying in large numbers to my office for work."
"This will provide them with remuneration for their work and valuable work experience, which I hope will assist them in their future careers."
"However, I believe that the Parliament needs to review our entire working methods and staffing with a view to improving our effectiveness and efficiency."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new responsibilities."
"This situation means additional administrative work, with the result that Members need qualified staff to act as advisors."
"This new situation leads to two problems: increased costs arising from the need for more assistants, and additional space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions."
"This situation leads to increased costs."
"That is difficult to explain during this time of crisis, but if Parliament's work is to be excellent, it needs to have the necessary financial and human resources."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I voted in favour."
"Though it may seem like demagogy or another caste privilege, in this case it is not."
"The budget amendments are important and essential for the proper management of the life and activity of Parliament."
"In our role as Members of the European Parliament, following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are called upon to undertake an important and conspicuous task."
"For that reason, we need collaborators and experts who are able to support us in our jobs on a daily basis."
"To do that, resources are needed."
"On behalf of myself and, I hope, my fellow Members, these resources will translate into even more effective, efficient and focused work."
"in writing. - I have signed and voted in favour of the Amendment rejecting the tranche, together with 16 other MEPs from my group."
"The reason is that I think it is of utmost importance to show that there is a substantial group of MEPs that do not agree with the increase of the assistance allowance in these times of economic crisis."
"At the final vote, however, I voted in favour of the Maňka report, amending Parliament's budget for 2010."
"I voted against the report on the supplementary budget for 2010."
"To increase MEPs' secretarial allowance by EUR 1 500 per month in order to deal with the increased workloads resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon is not tenable."
"For one thing, you cannot employ highly-trained experts for EUR 1 500 per month."
"Secondly, there is no room for new staff in Parliament's working premises."
"Thirdly, a proportion of the budget funds have been taken out of the reserve specifically for building investments."
"Fourthly, for the 2011 budget, Category 5, the rapporteur, Mrs Trüppel, stated that secretarial allowances cannot be guaranteed in future until a proper evaluation of their benefits has been carried out."
"I regard this increase as an unjustified supplement for the already high secretarial allowances, and this at a time when the unemployed, single women, pensioners and other socially vulnerable groups are forced to make sacrifices to rescue the floundering euro project."
"In the name of transparency - which the citizens require - and thoroughness, I do not believe that the Council is free of its obligation to be publicly accountable for the funds made available to them."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteur's decision to postpone the decision on discharging the Council's accounts until the requested additional information has been submitted."
"I am in favour of postponing the decision on releasing the implementation of the EU general budget for the year 2008 in the interests of transparency and rigour, not only in terms of implementing the budget, but also the complete supervision of the use of all the EU's financial resources."
"This will afford the Council the opportunity to obtain all the explanations and information that are needed to secure a decision endorsed by Parliament."
"This is absolutely vital to the credibility of the European institutions and public confidence in those in power."
"Moreover, basic respect for the policies and guidelines set out by the democratic bodies and those legally empowered to do so is at issue here."
"The procedure of discharging the budget is important and the legislative and supervisory activities of Parliament hinge upon it."
"There is no need for me to reiterate the supervisory power that Parliament has acquired over the years, thanks not least to the budget procedure, on the basis of which it has managed to turn the mandatory reporting of European institutions into a serious and important matter."
"Moreover, it is also fundamental in light of our citizens' expectations."
"In a moment of crisis such as the current one, European citizens are called upon to make extraordinary sacrifices and we must carry out careful and accurate supervision of bureaucratic or actual management expenses."
"For the reasons I have stated, I commend the rapporteur and express my agreement."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of this report because I agree with the fact that we need to postpone the discharge decision until October."
"I voted against granting discharge in respect of the Council's budget for 2008 because the Council's financial documentation was received in Parliament too late."
"The European Parliament's supervision of the Council's finances is far from being transparent."
"The last few years have seen a steady, rapid rise in the need for organ transplants within the European Union."
"Although the organ shortage remains the biggest challenge facing us at the moment, there are far more difficulties related to the different transplant systems which are used in Member States."
"Back in 2008, the European Parliament called on the European Commission, via the resolution adopted in April, to draft a directive setting out the legal framework for guaranteeing the quality and safety of organ donations within the European Union."
"The Commission subsequently tabled a proposal for a directive, which was debated in the European Parliament, featuring the following three objectives: guaranteeing quality and safety for patients across the EU, providing protection for donors and facilitating cooperation between Member States."
"We voted in favour of the compromise reached between Parliament, the Council and Commission as we need common quality and safety standards at EU level for the procurement, transport and use of human organs."
"This is a measure which would facilitate organ exchanges, thereby benefiting the thousands of patients in Europe who require this kind of treatment every year."
"I support this report on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation."
"With the growing demand for transplantations in the European Union and the imbalance between patients waiting for a transplantation and the number of organs donated, we must aim to avoid the commercialisation of donation and end the illegal trade in organs."
"Therefore, we must apply strict legislation on living donors, ensure the transparency of organ waiting lists, lay down strict confidentiality rules in order to protect the personal data of donors and those waiting for organs and define the responsibility of doctors."
"Once common quality and safety standards have been adopted, opportunities would be created for cross border exchanges of organs and this may increase the number of transplantations performed."
"Over the last five decades, the transplanting of organs has become an effective practice at global level, which has contributed to improving the quality of life and increasing the life expectancies of sufferers."
"This directive establishes rules that seek to guarantee high standards of quality and safety for organs of human origin to be transplanted into human bodies in order to ensure a high level of protection of human health."
"The directive introduces quality national programmes in which standards and practices for transplantation processes in the Member States are defined."
"It also sets out in more detail the procurement process and issues connected with the information system."
"The traceability and protection of donors and recipients also deserve special attention."
"I voted for this report because of its three main objectives: guaranteeing quality and safety for patients at Union level, ensuring the protection of donors, and facilitating cooperation between Member States."
"Nevertheless, I would stress that organ transplantation programmes must comply with the principle of voluntary and free donation that is already enshrined in previous legislation on substances of human origin, and that they may not be sold in any way."
"in writing. - UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU's attempts to invade and regulate this network."
"On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory."
"In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also."
"Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report."
"I voted for the draft directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation."
"The directive covers every stage in the chain, from donation to transplantation, and provides for cooperation between Member States."
"An effective transplantation system is not solely based on donors' support; it also depends on the correct use of information and on the quality of the network by which this information is shared."
"I therefore supported the idea of creating a European database recording information on the organs available, and a pan-European certification system guaranteeing that the human organs and tissues available have been obtained legally."
"Indeed, in order to ensure equal access to available organs, organs must only be donated on a voluntary basis, without any payments being made."
"However, the principle of not paying for organs will not prevent live donors from being compensated, provided that such compensation is strictly limited to covering the costs and loss of income resulting from the donation."
"Such a transparent, safe and efficient donation system is the only way to combat organ trafficking."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive for the following reasons: 1."
"Given the increase in the demand for organs for transplant and the limited supply, which often forces patients to look for solutions to their problem beyond national borders, the adoption at Community level of a common framework of quality and safety standards and the creation of a network of cooperation and mutual information is absolutely necessary in order to improve protection for public health and services to patients."
"2. National provisions governing the procedure for providing consent to organ donation, the selection of which remains within the jurisdiction of the Member States, are not affected in any way."
"On the contrary, the proposal for a directive supplements the current legal framework of each Member State of the EU with specific quality and safety standards throughout the transplantation procedure and, at the same time, safeguards the absence of any form of speculation and maintains the anonymity and security of both the donor's and the recipient's personal data."
"3. Cases of organ smuggling are minimised and the confidence of potential donors is strengthened, with the ultimate aim of increasing the number of donors."
"4. Sanctions are imposed by the Member States in the event of infringement of legislation relating to the identity of donors or recipients."
"I voted for the report on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation because it contributes to reducing operation waiting lists for European sufferers."
"It is unacceptable that, on average, 12 people awaiting a transplant die every day."
"This directive will make it easier to donate and transplant organs, and to exchange them between EU Member States, benefiting thousands of ill Europeans."
"The scarcity of organs for transplantation has been feeding a terrible market which affects, above all, developing countries, but which has also hit deprived people in Eastern Europe."
"I share the concern about the difficulty of combating this brutal trade and the terrible consequences for those who are deprived, forcibly or not, of their organs: savage drops in quality of life, chronic illnesses and, in many cases, death."
"The adoption of common rules puts the European Union on a level footing in terms of requirements and responsibilities, in stark contrast with the sombre situation that I have described."
"Patients and donors will have the conditions, the monitoring and the protection that those involved in the trafficking networks lack, and the Member States will start to be able to cooperate effectively."
"I agree with the rapporteur that donation must be altruistic, voluntary and free, and that the donor must only be compensated for any expenses or inconvenience incurred by the donation."
"I believe that my colleague, Mr Mikolášik, has proposed some good alterations that improve the basic text; they must be a result of his medical training and of his following this subject since the last parliamentary session."
"I warmly welcome this proposal and its three principal objectives: guaranteeing quality and security for patients at Union level, ensuring the protection of donors and facilitating cooperation between Member States."
"In general in the EU, there is a broad social consensus on the donation of organs for transplantation."
"However, due to differences of culture and tradition, and also in the system of organisation, there are different approaches to this issue within the Member States."
"I would stress that although the directive is aimed at maintaining or attempting to achieve harmonisation between quality and security measures, it should not create an extra administrative burden for Member States."
"Rather, it should have a sufficient margin of flexibility for it not to jeopardise good practice already in force."
"The proposal for a directive establishes common, binding standards of quality and safety for organs of human origin to be transplanted with the aim of guaranteeing a high level of protection for health throughout the EU."
"I endorse the Commission's view that, in principle, organ transplantation programmes must comply with the principle of voluntary and free donation."
"Organ donation must always be free and protected from any potential commercialisation."
"Organ transplants are an important means of rehabilitation for patients suffering a multitude of illnesses that cause fatal problems with certain organs."
"The number of transplants in the European Union has increased, saving and prolonging many lives."
"However, there are still long waiting lists for transplants."
"Our vote in favour expresses our agreement with the improvements that the report is attempting to introduce to the current situation."
"As well as affecting quality and safety, and the establishment of procedures necessary for procurement and transport, these improvements relate to the protection of donors and recipients, with due consideration being given to ethical principles and the principle of non-remuneration."
"The report also tackles the worrying issue of human organ trafficking in a way that seems appropriate to us."
"This aim of this directive is clear enough: we need more organs for patients and greater cooperation between Member States on this matter and on combating organ trafficking."
"Hence, one of the foundations of this new legislation provides for the designation of a new authority in every Member State to be responsible for compliance with the standards of quality and security of organs."
"These authorities will be responsible for ensuring the quality and the safety of the organs 'throughout the entire chain, from donation to transplant, as well as in evaluating the quality and safety during the recovery and subsequent monitoring of the respective patient'."
"The new directive also requires that the health professionals involved in all stages of the chain, from the donation to the transplantation or removal of the organ, are properly qualified."
"Specific training programmes should thus be developed for these professionals."
"For all these reasons, we voted for this proposal."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Organ transplants can save lives, but only when a healthy organ from a matching donor is transplanted."
"Unfortunately, errors have occurred repeatedly in the past and this makes it even more important to impose quality and safety standards in this area."
"It is also worth discussing the fact that Muslims are often happy to accept organ donations, but are not generally prepared to donate organs because of their religion."
"I hope that the report will contribute to improving quality and safety standards, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"I would like to express my vote in favour of Mr Mikolášik's report."
"The growing need for available transplant organs in a context of cross-border exchange and of significant differences among the transplant systems adopted by the various Member States requires cooperation and common regulations regarding the quality and safety of the organs to be strengthened."
"The proposal for a directive aims to reach those objectives by focusing on increasing the number of transplants and raising the quality standards in donation, procurement, control, preservation, transportation and transplant processes."
"Furthermore, by underlining the principle of voluntary donation as against the trade or trafficking of organs, it aims to guarantee the rights of donors and patients."
"Though recognising the need to harmonise quality and safety measures, the rapporteur stresses that the directive must not create an additional administrative burden for Member States and must leave enough flexibility without jeopardising current good practices."
"Transplantation is one of the medical specialities to have made the greatest advances over recent decades, having achieved considerable success and been crucial in saving human lives."
"Paradoxically, it is the success of transplantation that, alongside other factors, has led to a growing number of candidates for organ transplants, resulting in long waiting lists."
"It has also led to the human drama associated with the death of approximately 12 patients per day in the EU because they have not been able to receive the organ that they need in order to survive."
"One of the ways of minimising this problem is exchange between EU Member States, ensuring greater compatibility between donor and recipient in a shorter space of time, and with a higher level of organ acceptance."
"This exchange, however, requires quality and safety standards across the board, as set out in the present directive by Parliament and the Council."
"The Mikolášik report on safety and quality standards for organs intended for transplantation thus makes an important contribution towards minimising organ shortage and towards basic protection of the health of the recipient and the living donor."
"Therefore, we are pleased to welcome it."
"Organ transplants are, without a doubt, one of the most positive aspects of progress in the health field but, at the same time, they open up a whole series of problems in terms of donors' and patients' rights which must be dealt with from the ethical, social, legal and economic points of view."
"It is a question of setting a positive process in motion to address the major imbalance between the need and the numbers of organs available, without compromising the principle of free, voluntary donation in order to prevent all forms of commercialisation and illegal trafficking and whilst guaranteeing the quality and safety of organs for transplantation with measures that ensure both confidentiality and traceability."
"The adoption of common quality standards is definitely a step forward that should be welcomed as part of a framework in which the World Health Organisation may make a further contribution."
"However, in setting up a European database, it is important that we take care not to introduce an unnecessarily rigid framework or create additional red tape that would hamper the current perfectly proper and efficient process."
"in writing. - I have supported the report lead by our colleague Mikolášik on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation as one very urgent measure to improve the life expectation of more than 60 000 people in Europe waiting for a transplant."
"I hope this will make the possibility of getting an organ easier and safer."
"I voted in favour of the report, even though there is a need, concurrently with the desired effort to unify safety and quality requirements for human organs designated for transplant, to focus, in particular, on increasing donor numbers in the various Member States, taking account of the different national traditions of health systems."
"It is therefore necessary to assess this area rigorously from the perspective of the subsidiarity principle."
"in writing. - I was pleased to support this report in its vote through Parliament."
"Within the South-East of England, many families are victims of the harsh reality of a poor supply of organs necessary for transplantation."
"This report assists in creating an EU cross-border standard which could provide for an improved supply into and across the EU so that such families of individuals needing organs can be more easily met with the hope of relieving their conditions."
"I endorsed the report on standards of safety in organ donation because the report includes the principle of non-commercialisation."
"The European Parliament has adopted the calendar of plenary sessions for 2011."
"It is regrettable that EUR 200 million per annum of the taxpayer's money continues to be spent on holding 12 sessions in Strasbourg every year."
"The hypocrisy is reaching the point of not even complying with the provisions of the treaties, as compliance would involve one session per month; in other words, including August."
"The city of Strasbourg's legitimate aspirations could be satisfied with the permanent establishment here of one or two European Union agencies."
"As for the 'circus', it should obviously stop!"
"Furthermore, it makes no sense at all for the European Parliament to meet 48 days of the year in a city that does not have direct air links with virtually any of the Member States' capitals."
"Moreover, those that do exist have commercial timetables, which are totally incompatible with parliamentary activity."
"It is easy to see that the Heads of State or Government who make these decisions travel by private aeroplane and do not lose dozens or hundreds of hours per year getting to Strasbourg."
"I have voted against the proposal made by some Members to divide a session into two parts, but still to hold it during one week."
"Apart from the fact that this does not make much sense, the additional travel to and from the session would give rise to unnecessary costs and waste valuable working time."
"in writing. - I enthusiastically supported the amendment proposing to reduce the two September part-sessions to one."
"I am a big supporter of the idea of reducing the two EP seats to one, based in Brussels."
"Thus, I support any initiative willing to get rid of the Strasbourg seat."
"Issues relating to the diet and health of citizens are extremely sensitive and must be considered carefully and objectively."
"This is very much the case with the debate on the authorisation of food additives such as thrombin."
"Thrombin is a product obtained from animal (cow or pig) plasma and blood, the cicatrising characteristics of which are used by the agri-foodstuffs industry to reconstitute meat from a collection of pieces."
"This additive fulfils the four criteria in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 permitting authorisation: food additives must be safe when used (confirmed by the EFSA in its opinion of 2005); there must be a technological need for their use (very useful as a stabiliser); their use must not mislead the consumer (use limited to pre-packaged and, hence, labelled, products); they must be of benefit to the consumer (end product is stabilised)."
"In addition, the overwhelming majority of Member States are calling for thrombin to be authorised."
"Therefore, since this additive does not pose any risk to health and has a genuine role to play in food preparation, there was no reason to oppose its authorisation."
"I voted for this resolution which aims to limit the use in food products of food additives that are dangerous to health, in order to protect the health of consumers."
"Legislation currently in force in the European Union provides that food additives may be used if they benefit the consumer."
"As the benefit of thrombin ('meat glue') for consumers has not been proven and the process of binding together many separate pieces of meat significantly increases the risk of it being infected by bacteria, I did not support the proposal to allow this food additive to be used in bovine and pork products."
"In addition, we must strive to prevent such products processed with 'meat glue' from finding their way into public establishments serving food."
"I voted for a resolution calling for thrombin not to be used in meat."
"Thrombin is used as a 'glue' in reconstituted meat."
"It poses a health risk because the process of bonding together various scraps of meat significantly increases the surface area of the foodstuff, which might have been contaminated by bacteria."
"In addition, reconstituted meat could mislead consumers seeking to buy meat."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution because it does not allow the use of foods containing additives and enzymes, such as thrombin, which are dangerous and compromise the quality of food and consumer safety."
"The guarantees given by the Commission are not only unconvincing and inadequate but they also increase my concerns."
"Furthermore, the Commission, and the Commissioner himself, have not demonstrated the necessary awareness, as their recent decision on licensing modified potato crops also demonstrated."
"The motion for a resolution expresses some reservations regarding the use of an enzyme preparation based on thrombin with fibrinogen as a food additive for reconstituting food, which seem pertinent to us."
"The Commission's proposals do not fully deal with these reservations."
"Doubts persist about the possibility of using unpacked reconstituted products, compromising the information necessary for the consumer, as well as about the effectiveness of banning the use of these products in restaurants and other public establishments that serve food."
"The Commission itself recognises that using this food additive could mislead the consumer as to the state of the final food."
"The proposed solution to the above problem of labelling could not be enough, on its own, to deal with this problem."
"Doubts also persist about the process of binding foods (for example, cold bonding without the addition of salt and without any subsequent heating process) and the safety of the final product."
"We therefore deem this resolution worthy of our support."
"I very much regret the adoption of this resolution relating to the banning of porcine and bovine thrombin."
"The text has no valid scientific basis."
"Indeed, this food additive, which is derived from animal plasma and blood and used in pre-packed products to bind together separate pieces of meat, meets all the health and safety criteria laid down by the European Food Safety Authority."
"It is authorised in France and used in black pudding, for example."
"It is therefore important that we take our decisions on the basis of data provided by the scientific community, not by the media."
"Let us not lapse into an emotional debate!"
"What is more, the labelling requirements for products containing this additive are said to have been tightened up."
"The word 'thrombin' and the phrase 'reconstituted meat' have seemingly been clearly shown."
"It has therefore never been a question of misleading consumers who have, by all accounts, been better informed."
"Food safety and the health of European citizens are at stake."
"This issue has been raised within Parliament with the case of thrombin, which is a food additive used to 'glue' pieces of meat together, and whose final appearance could easily mislead the consumer."
"The agri-foodstuff industries were already pleased to see how widespread the use of this substance had become, and for good reason, because it enabled them to get rid of their meat waste and sell poor quality pieces cheaply."
"Although the European Food Safety Authority has concluded that thrombin is harmless, I am still very sceptical about these results."
"It is time to show the Commission that food safety and health are major concerns for the European Parliament."
"I therefore welcome this vote rejecting this enzyme."
"We cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin."
"Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 regulates the conditions for food additives throughout the EU and we are now looking to include new substances in it."
"The key thing here is the safety of substances."
"In order to meet consumer demand for food which looks attractive, the food industry has created substances which are added just for the sake of better appearance."
"One such substance is thrombin, which is obtained from edible parts of animals and which is not harmful to health."
"Its role is to combine individual pieces of meat together into a single meat product."
"Although not in itself a health hazard, parading individual pieces of glued together meat as a single piece of ham does constitute consumer fraud."
"Although such products cannot therefore be banned on health grounds, they must be labelled very clearly and unambiguously by indicating not just the name of the product but also its effect and a clear designation of the processed product."
"A piece of meat glued together with thrombin should never be allowed to go on sale as ham."
"Instead, it must be clearly labelled as 'combined meat parts treated with thrombin'. I will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement."
"in writing. - Today, Parliament voted to block the authorisation of thrombin for use as a food additive."
"We do not yet know the implications of this decision, which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme."
"The Commission outlined with clarity that EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has said there are no safety issues involved."
"The Commission proposal would allow for the product to only be used in pre-packaged, clearly labelled combined meat products with the name of the enzyme, thrombin - a blood-derived product - in the list of ingredients."
"Thrombin is currently in use."
"After today, it will not be permitted."
"Is it wise for this Parliament to start telling people what to eat, rather than providing them with information of what they are eating?"
"There is a difference."
"The proposal which suggests that thrombin from cattle and/or swine should be included on the list of food additives approved in the EU does not give us any guarantee that this substance has a clear benefit for consumers, and ultimately this may mislead consumers."
"In addition, the whole process of linking different pieces of meat greatly increases the surface that can be infected by pathogenic bacteria."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"When we consider, in particular, the increasing levels of allergy and food intolerance and the fact that knowledge is constantly being developed in this area, it is imperative that we regulate additives."
"Precisely because of past scandals, it is very important that we prevent any possibility of the consumer being misled."
"More research into the safety and tolerability of some additives, such as aspartame, would be desirable, but that was not the subject of this resolution."
"I voted in favour of it, nonetheless."
"I voted against the resolution, given that thrombin is an additive which cannot be regarded as a cause for concern in terms of food safety."
"Meat which includes thrombin among its ingredients could be sold only with a label stating 'combined meat parts', while all the ingredients could be specified on a label, in compliance with legal provisions."
"This would allow citizens to make an enlightened choice, which means that we cannot mislead anyone."
"The use of thrombin could enable many citizens to purchase food products at much more affordable prices."
"I oppose the use of thrombin to glue together different pieces of meat which are mostly of poor quality."
"Consumers are generally unaware of what is happening and are being deceived."
"On the other hand, the process does not result in any demonstrable benefits for consumers."
"Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report, which aims to restrict these practices."
"I voted for this resolution, because I agree that the use of food additives must be moderate - it is only justifiable when it gives consumers an added benefit."
"However, I do not think that thrombin 'meat glue' complies with this requirement."
"If the use of 'meat glue' became very widespread, it would be difficult for consumers to differentiate between real meat and pieces of meat that have been glued together."
"As mentioned in the report, that increases the risk of meat infection."
"Thrombins would only be of benefit to producers, who would be able to bring to market pieces of meat that would otherwise be of no use to anyone."
"In all other industries, the European Union is trying to combat fabrications and forgeries."
"I do not think that the food industry should be an exception."
"Consumer protection is one of the European Parliament's key tasks and European consumers are often unaware of the nature of the products they are about to buy and the additives they contain."
"Clear, accurate labelling is obviously important."
"However, in our capacity as legislators, we need to ban certain harmful products."
"Whilst the draft Commission directive would not permit the use of thrombin as a food additive in meat products served in restaurants or other public establishments serving food, there is, however, a clear risk that meat containing thrombin would find its way into meat products served in restaurants or other public establishments serving food, given the higher prices that can be obtained for pieces of meat served as a single meat product."
"The labelling conditions contained in the draft Commission directive would fail to guard against the creation of a false or misleading impression to consumers as to the existence of a single-meat product, and therefore there is a risk that consumers would be misled and prevented from making an informed choice in relation to the consumption of meat products containing thrombin."
"I therefore agree with the opinion expressed in the resolution."
"I am very pleased with today's vote banning thrombin."
"This is a victory for consumers."
"The problem with thrombin is not the risk it poses, although there are indeed health issues involved, but its misleading nature."
"If not forewarned, it is impossible to distinguish with the naked eye between a piece of meat and another piece of meat that has been bound together with thrombin."
"This is highly deceptive."
"Using thrombin amounts to placing on the market a sort of prefabricated, artificial meat."
"I cannot quite see how this benefits consumers."
"Yet thrombin is used in some Member States without consumers being informed."
"The attempts to deceive consumers and to try to hide the truth must stop."
"That is not the way for manufacturers to restore consumer confidence."
"in writing. - I fully support this resolution and the efforts to prevent the authorisation of thrombin or 'meat glue'."
"It is misleading for consumers because they assume they are buying a single piece of meat, but in fact, they are buying many pieces which have been artificially stuck together."
"Industry has argued that use of this substance enables them to create cheap meat for people who cannot afford more expensive products, but the fact is that it enables industry to sell smaller pieces of meat for more money, not less."
"And there is a health issue here too - many small pieces of meat glued together have a much larger surface area than a single, larger piece, which significantly increases the area on which pathogenic bacteria can thrive."
"Misleading the consumer is contrary to EU law, and there are potentially serious health implications of using this substance in this way."
"This is why I voted in favour of this resolution."
"I welcome the adoption, by a 'very close margin' (370 votes, when we needed 369), of this resolution, which protects consumers from the use of thrombin as a 'meat glue', as a food additive used to glue pieces of meat together to form a single meat-based product."
"Its use is clearly potentially misleading for consumers, in terms of the quality of the product they are buying."
"Therefore, it was my duty and that of my fellow MEPs to strongly oppose the Commission's desire to allow the agri-food industry to use a new food additive of which the sole purpose is ultimately to generate further profits, with a concomitant disregard for the protection of the rights of consumers, one of which is to receive accurate information about the food which they choose to consume."
"In 2008, the European Commission presented an Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015), with the aim of strengthening cooperation between Member States in the area of organ donation through the exchange of good practice."
"The actions stipulated in this plan complement the European legal framework set out in the Commission's proposal for a directive on organ donation and transplantation."
"Although there are significant differences between Member States in terms of practices and results at the moment, the exchange of information and good practices will help countries where there is a low availability of organs to improve the level of availability."
"The other actions stipulated in the plan are aimed at improving the quality and safety of organ transplantation, creating a register for evaluating post-transplant results and setting up an organ exchange system for particular cases, such as children or adults with special requirements."
"I voted, along with my other fellow MEPs, to support such a plan which will facilitate cooperation between Member States as well as combat illegal organ trafficking."
"Organ transplantation has proved to be indispensable in treating certain illnesses and provides the possibility of saving lives, offers a better quality of life for patients, and has the best cost/benefit ratio when compared with other replacement therapies."
"Nonetheless, there are several issues of concern as regards this therapy, not least the risk of transmission of diseases, the limited availability of organs, and organ trafficking."
"There is currently no database covering the whole of the European Union which contains information about organs intended for donation and transplantation or on living or deceased donors, nor a pan-European certification system which provides proof that human organs and tissues have been legally obtained."
"I voted for this report, because I welcomed the Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015), which was adopted by the Commission in December 2008, and which sets out a cooperative approach between Member States in the form of a set of priority actions based on the identification and development of common objectives and the evaluation of donation and transplantation activities through agreed indicators that might help to identify benchmarks and best practices."
"Every day, 12 people die in Europe because they have not received a transplant in time, and 60 000 people are currently waiting for a transplant."
"However, no organ exchange network has yet been set up at the EU 27 level."
"Although a directive will soon see the light of day, I voted with the other Members for a resolution which sets out the direction to be taken by Parliament on this issue."
"There are three particularly sensitive issues: cross-border exchange of available organs; information for citizens; and the identification of potential donors."
"The resolution suggests, for example, that citizens ought to be able to use the Internet to declare themselves 'willing donors'."
"An organ transplant is the last chance of life for thousands of people every day."
"In Romania, 13 people on the transplant waiting list die every day due to the lack of donors."
"Romania is faced with a tragic situation at a time when there is one donor per million inhabitants."
"The Romanian Parliament has tried to introduce the concept of presumed consent, but public debate has blocked this step being taken every time."
"The measures taken by the Commission and European Parliament only serve to bring some order and make recommendations in a system which is important in terms of saving as many lives as possible."
"Funding the medical system does not come cheap."
"Removing organs and carrying out the transplant, along with post-transplant care, are expensive medical procedures, but every Member State must make efforts to encourage this type of medical procedure."
"In fact, Spain provides a good model because it has successfully achieved the highest number of donors in the European Union."
"There is no need to reinvent the wheel as long as we have, right in our midst, a successful model."
"In these circumstances, measures such as promotion through this directive, cooperation between Member States and organ exchange, all tightly regulated by quality and safety standards, give us encouragement."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"Approximately 60 000 patients are on a waiting list for a transplant in the Member States of the EU."
"Every day, 12 of them die."
"The availability of organs differs considerably from one Member State to another: from 33.8 dead donors in Spain to 1 dead donor in Romania per one million people."
"The divide between the supply and demand of organs is exploited by criminal gangs, who have turned it into a profitable business."
"The Commission's action plan on organ donation and transplantation has added value, because the proposed strengthening of cooperation between the Member States will increase the availability of organs, improve the efficacy and accessibility of transplant systems, improve the quality and safety of organs, and promote exchanges of best practices."
"I voted in favour of the Perello report because it proposes a package of priority actions which maximise the percentage of donations by donors, introduce the concept of transplant coordinators in all hospitals in which organs may be donated, target public awareness, improved knowledge and skills on the part of health professionals and patient support groups and the introduction of registers to facilitate the evaluation of post-transplantation results."
"The number of organ donations and transplantations is increasing every year in Europe, thus enabling thousands of lives to be saved."
"However, a large number of obstacles still need to be removed because there are still not enough organs to meet demand."
"Every day, 12 patients die in the EU due to a lack of compatible donors."
"Organ donation varies considerably from one Member State to another; there are, for example, 34.6 donations per million inhabitants in Spain, compared with 0.5 in Romania."
"What is more, organs are rarely exchanged between Member States."
"Parliament's vote is the first step towards a European network to meet the requirement for swift, flexible and safe transplantations on the model of Eurotransplant (Austria, Benelux, Croatia, Germany, Netherlands and Slovenia) and Scandiatransplant (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland)."
"The EU is also going to extend the use of the donor card which, although supported by 81% of Europe's citizens, is held by only 12% of them."
"The Member States must ensure that no payment is made for donations and must guarantee their traceability and confidentiality, in particular, to combat transnational trafficking of organs."
"The discrepancy in the percentage of organ donors in the various countries of Europe seems to suggest that the systems in some Member States are more effective than in others."
"These systems must, therefore, be studied and, potentially, adopted by those that are shown to be less successful."
"In an area that is closely tied to the health and lives of the public, in addition to adopting best practices, it is clearly becoming necessary to optimise resources and make collective use of the European scale of organ availability."
"It makes no sense for someone to die because there is no organ available in their country, when it may exist and be available elsewhere."
"I support the idea that anyone who encourages or promotes so-called 'transplant tourism' must be punished, as must recourse to organ trafficking networks."
"Punishments must be particularly severe for health professionals or insurance companies."
"I would stress the need for effective monitoring both of recipients, and of altruistic and voluntary donors, to whom the public cannot fail to owe a debt of gratitude."
"Currently, there are 56 000 patients in the EU waiting for a suitable organ donor, and every day, 12 people die waiting for a solid organ transplant."
"Organ transplantation represents the only therapeutic alternative for patients in the final stage of liver, heart and lung failure."
"There is, however, a considerable discrepancy between the number of patients waiting for a transplant and the number of patients who actually receive one."
"This discrepancy is the result of a shortage of organs for transplantation in comparison to need."
"The inclusion of more patients on waiting lists coupled with the minimal increase in the number of patients receiving transplants is reflected in the longer waiting time."
"This time is expensive and can have a negative impact on patient survival rate and the rate of success for implants."
"The Commission's proposal to draw up a European plan of action on donation and transplantation for the 2009-2015 period sets out an approach for cooperation between the Member States, formed around a set of priority actions, and is based on the identification and development of common objectives, the establishment of consensual, quantitative and qualitative reference indicators and parameters, regular reporting and identifying best practice."
"The transplantation of organs can deliver many years of full and healthy life for people who would otherwise frequently need intensive care, or would simply not survive."
"The number of transplants in the European Union has increased, saving and prolonging many lives."
"However, there are still long waiting lists for transplants."
"There are currently 56 000 patients waiting for a suitable organ donor in the European Union, and it is estimated that every day, 12 people die while waiting for a solid organ transplant."
"The number of deceased organ donors, on its own, is not enough and the number of live donors fails to satisfy requirements."
"Furthermore, there are wide variations between Member States in deceased organ donation rates and, at present, there is neither a database covering the whole of the European Union which contains information about organs intended for donation and transplantation or on living or deceased donors, nor a certification system which provides proof that human organs and tissues have been legally obtained."
"It is in this context that the report under discussion suggests steps that we consider important for strengthening cooperation between the Member States in this area, from which all of them could benefit."
"in writing. - A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients."
"It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors, and that this drives some vile criminal activities."
"To seek to address these problems by creating an EU-wide database is, however, a mistake."
"It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU, with all its different languages and IT systems, when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds."
"Health services across Europe are unable even to fund basics, and face savage cuts as ordinary citizens pay for the bust of globalism."
"This being so, far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels, than by diverting funds to pay for well-intentioned bureaucratic meddling."
"Additionally, there are tight time constraints on organ viability."
"Thus, an EU-wide network would be of use to very few patients."
"Proposals to set one up are another pretty-sounding excuse for the further advance of an agenda that has nothing to do with patients' welfare and everything to do with federalist dogma."
"Several thousand people die each year in Europe because they have been unable to receive a transplantation in time."
"The need to implement EU-wide measures to facilitate intra-Community exchanges of human organs for transplantation, through improved quality and safety standards in this area, was therefore becoming an increasingly urgent issue."
"This is why I voted for this directive, which aims to protect live donors and the individuals who benefit from their donations, and safeguards basic ethical principles, such as anonymity, volunteering and the inalienable character of the human body, which must not be a source of profit."
"The idea of establishing a network of competent authorities in the Member States also seems to me to be particularly positive, as does the idea of online registration in national or European registers."
"Of course, every possible precaution must be taken to ensure that these measures work properly."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Action plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation for 2009-2015."
"The technical progress achieved in the area of organ transplantation is a huge source of hope for all those individuals for whom transplantation remains the only possible treatment."
"The main challenge today is the shortage of organ donors, which is evident from the long waiting lists for transplantation."
"To meet this challenge, it is essential that measures are adopted to identify potential donors, and a great deal of progress can be made to boost the numbers of organs donated in Europe."
"As the rapporteur emphasises, the appointment of a key organ donation person in hospitals is probably the key factor in improving arrangements in this area."
"Increased cooperation between Member States will ensure better exchange of information and good practice aimed at increasing the numbers of donors."
"For example, enabling citizens to add their names to a donor register when they apply for a passport or a driving licence is one initiative which should be considered by Member States and which I, and most of my fellow Members, regard as positive."
"We approved this new directive for various reasons, but especially because we believe that this is a plan that will be crucial in saving many lives within the EU."
"Twelve patients die every day and 60 000 are waiting for a compatible donor for organ transplants within the EU."
"Transplantation has increased continuously over the last two decades and it is the only available treatment for cases of terminal deficiency in organs such as the liver, lungs and heart."
"Mortality rates among people waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant are between 15% and 30%, so patients who need an organ transplant will have to wait less time for that operation, thanks to this new directive."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The three key objectives in the area of organ donation and transplantation are ensuring quality and safety for patients at EU level, ensuring protection of donors and facilitating cooperation between Member States."
"A European approach to the issue is important, considering, among other things, the mobility of patients within the European Union."
"Generally, in the European Union there is a broad societal consensus on organ donation for the purpose of transplantation."
"However, due to different cultural, traditional or organisational system backgrounds, there are differences between Member States in approach to this issue."
"Some countries have a high rate of donations, whilst the donation culture still needs to be developed in others."
"Sharing of best practices, models and expertise across the European Union could prove very useful in increasing organ donation rates."
"Cooperation should be fostered in order to identify successful elements of different transplantation systems and promote these on the European level, thus leading to the improvements in provision of high quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"The present report establishes a set of actions that are aimed at promoting cooperation between the Member States in the field of transplantation in order to contribute to the increase in transplants, the reduction of waiting lists and a consequent reduction in the number of patients who die while waiting for an organ."
"At the same time, the action plan also establishes common quality and safety standards for the Member States, which not only contribute to the protection of patients but also facilitate cooperation between countries."
"The creation of national and EU records of the processes involved in transplantation (avoiding discrimination, monitoring the results, etc.) also stands out."
"This will lead to greater and more thorough awareness of the current situation in Europe, as well as reducing opportunities for organ trafficking."
"The report supports the action plan and underlines the necessity and urgency for the courses of action that it points out, taking a firm stance against all forms of trading in organs that currently take place in different parts of the world."
"I believe that this report is an important addition to the Commission's output and a valuable contribution to an acute human cause within the context of health care provided to the European public."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Perello Rodriguez of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats for Europe on the report on which we have just voted."
"The action plan should mean that the 60 000 people who are currently hoping to receive an organ will see their life expectancy considerably increased."
"It is also important to highlight the leading position held by the Spanish health system as regards this issue."
"This has been acknowledged by all the rapporteurs and groups."
"I voted in favour of the report, although I think there is primarily a need to focus, in particular, on boosting donor numbers in the various Member States, taking account of the different national traditions of health systems."
"It is therefore necessary to assess this area rigorously from the perspective of the subsidiarity principle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the statistics speak for themselves."
"According to this report, there are currently 56 000 patients in the European Union waiting for a suitable organ donor."
"Every day, 12 people die waiting for an organ transplant."
"Sadly, many people are simply dying because of the great shortage of organ donors and insufficient cross-border coordination."
"This sensitive issue is linked to various legal and cultural aspects."
"However, matters are complicated still further by the EU Member States' different national policies and fundamentally different organ donation rates."
"It would be possible to ease some of these shortages through an EU database and certification system, which would provide information about the availability of organs and would guarantee their quality and legality."
"It is also important to mobilise and inform society."
"Many EU citizens are not fundamentally against donation, but are afraid of adding their names to the register."
"Therefore, donation should be as accessible as possible - promotion may often be effective."
"For example, I welcome forms which would give citizens the opportunity to add their name directly to the organ donor register when they apply for a driving licence."
"The shortage of organs for transplantation is also a powerful stimulus for the trade in organs and people."
"The EU should establish better donation and transplantation coordination because, as we can see, the poorest regions of Europe are becoming fertile ground for the illegal trade in organs."
"The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the EU must accede to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and I welcome this."
"To render this accession effective, the unanimous agreement of the Members of the Council and approval by the European Parliament are required."
"For my part, I fully support this accession, which will supplement the European system for the protection of fundamental rights."
"The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the EU must accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"This accession is not merely symbolic; it enables the protection of the fundamental rights of EU citizens to be improved."
"It will also have the effect of making the decisions taken and the actions implemented under the Common Foreign and Security Policy subject to the European Convention, even though they are outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"The Treaty of Lisbon lays down the legal basis for EU accession to the ECHR - the most important instrument for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe, the core of Europe."
"EU accession to the Convention will further strengthen the EU's system for the protection of fundamental rights."
"I agree with this proposal, since it is an historic opportunity making it possible to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms for EU citizens and Member States on the same basis."
"The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will be given jurisdiction to examine whether the legislation of EU institutions, bodies and agencies, including rulings of the European Court of Justice, are in compliance with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is very important that people will have a new opportunity to defend their rights."
"Once they have exhausted all national remedies, they will be able to bring actions to the European Court of Human Rights on violations by the EU of fundamental human rights, encouraging the development of a more harmonious case-law system in the area of human rights."
"The uniform and full application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights at EU level is equally essential to ensure the Union's credibility."
"As accession to the convention will have a huge legal influence on the creation of a harmonious system for the protection of human rights, I call on the Commission and the Member States to consider the opportunity to develop guidelines with clear explanations of all the implications of accession, the impact on human rights and the envisaged procedure for submitting complaints."
"Human rights and fundamental freedoms are the body of values and principles that mark us out as human and the basis of our coexistence; they are universal, indivisible and interdependent."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon represents an important step in human rights terms, not just because it makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding, but also because by giving the European Union legal personality, it enables the EU to accede to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR)."
"This accession is of the greatest significance at both political and legal levels in the creation of a true area of human rights."
"As regards action on the part of the Union, to which substantial powers have been transferred by the Member States, this makes it possible to guarantee protection for the public similar to that already enjoyed as regards the Member States."
"European institutions are obliged to comply with it, not least during the process of drawing up and adopting draft legislation."
"On the other hand, legislative and case-law harmonisation between the EU and the ECHR in the field of human rights must contribute to creating an integral system in which the European human rights courts (the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights) must operate in synchrony, with a relationship that is not a hierarchical connection but rather one of specialisation."
"in writing. - I support this report on the EU's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), as provided by the Lisbon Treaty."
"Now, the Union's institutions will fall within the scope of this fundamental rights protection system."
"EU accession to the ECHR improves the Union's standing when calling on third countries to abide by its human rights standards and extends to people in the EU the same level of protection against Union action that they enjoy with regard to Member State action."
"Despite the fact that the EU will not join the Council of Europe (CoE), accession to the convention should entail the right to nominate candidates for the post of judge, and allow for European Parliament representation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the CoE when this body elects judges to the European Court of Human Rights."
"Further to this progress, the Commission should be mandated to negotiate accession to the protocols supplementing the ECHR which concern rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The next logical step, also in harmony with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is the accession of the EU institutions to the European Social Charter."
"The protection of fundamental human rights must remain a national competence because interpretations vary from one country to another and from one culture to another."
"This is particularly the case with the concepts of discrimination, secularism and the very definition of human life (from conception to its natural end)."
"The Court of Justice of the European Union - an institution of which the decisions are becoming increasingly political - will endeavour to dismantle a little more the national constitutional systems and the foundations of European civilisation."
"Apart from being useless and a waste of resources, the EU's accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will lead to confusion and unresolvable legal conflicts with the Strasbourg Court."
"For reasons of logic, I oppose this new consequence of the legal personality of the EU, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted for this report because I believe that the accession of the European Union to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) is a strong message that enhances the credibility of the Union in the eyes of third countries which it regularly calls upon to respect the ECHR."
"The European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a result of the process that began in Maastricht, in the sense that it gave the European Community legal personality and culminated in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, initially with a reduced scope and later on extended by being integrated into the treaty, constituted an important stage in this process."
"The European Union is now participating more intimately in a continent-wide human rights area."
"I welcome this development."
"I hope that solutions can be found to the various legal, technical and institutional issues that are arising at the moment, and that these solutions will be based on the principle of subsidiarity, on voluntary cooperation between the Member States, and on respect for their sovereignty and national legal systems, and on the rule of law."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which contributes to the EU's commitment to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR)."
"This commitment is a step forward in the process of European integration and another step towards political unity."
"Moreover, since the EU system for the protection of fundamental human rights is consolidated and strengthened by incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into its primary law, the EU's adhesion to the ECHR will constitute a strong message in terms of coherence between the EU and the countries that belong to the Council of Europe and its pan-European regime in matters relating to human rights."
"This adhesion will further increase the EU's credibility in the eyes of the third countries which it regularly urges to respect the ECHR as part of their bilateral relations."
"With regard to the activities of the EU, this adhesion also guarantees the public protection similar to that which they already enjoy in their relations with all Member States."
"I voted for this report in order to give the green light to the negotiations on the accession of the EU, as a legal personality in its own right, to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"This accession will actually provide citizens with a new means of recourse: they will now be able to refer a case to the European Court of Human Rights if their fundamental rights are infringed by an EU Institution or a Member State on account of an action or failure to act on their part."
"We must also insist that the EU accedes to the additional protocols of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to the revised EU Social Charter, because the EU must also make progress on these fronts."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union makes it compulsory for the European Union to accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"I support this measure as it will enhance the EU's credibility in the eyes of its citizens by guaranteeing respect for rights."
"Accession to the convention will provide citizens with protection against the actions of the EU and its institutions, just like the protection they enjoy at the moment against the actions of Member States."
"At the same time, we will also achieve closer cooperation between the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights and national courts."
"The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights with regard to the separation of Church and State are in line with the secular tradition of the French Republic."
"The rulings supporting the ban on a female teacher wearing the veil in the classroom and opposing crucifixes in schools testify to this."
"However, the Court of Justice of the European Union proposes restricting civil liberties only if the values enshrined in the EU's fundamental texts require it."
"The fact is, those texts never once mention the compulsory separation of Church and State or the secular nature of institutions."
"The European Union is therefore incapable of guaranteeing the freedom of conscience of Europeans."
"One of the foundations of the European Union at its inception was respect for human rights - a value which remains permanently at the centre of the EU's interests."
"EU law bears witness to this, but so do constitutional provisions of each of the Member States."
"Accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) is a significant step towards stronger protection of the fundamental rights of the individual."
"This decision makes the EU part of the international system of protection of rights, thanks to which it has strengthened its credibility in the eyes of third countries, and also of its own citizens."
"The convention, while not altering the institutional construction of the EU, does, however, add another court, the European Court of Human Rights, which will keep watch over the way in which the Union fulfils its obligations in relation to the provisions of the ECHR."
"In view of the fact that the report on the institutional aspects of accession by the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms presents provisions which are in accordance with the above remarks, I decided to vote for its adoption."
"The importance of the EU acceding to the ECHR is linked both with its symbolic and political credibility and with the fact that the EU and its institutions will be under stricter obligation to uphold individuals' fundamental rights."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon provides the legal basis for starting negotiations regarding the EU's accession to the ECHR."
"I support the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"However, one vital preliminary matter is the observance of certain guarantees that the agreement on the European Union's accession to the ECHR should contain, especially with regard to preserving the specific characteristics of the Union and EU law."
"Accession must not interfere with the Union's competences, nor with the obligation of Member States not to submit disputes that fall within the scope of EU law to external dispute resolution systems."
"It is therefore important to safeguard the prerogatives of the Court of Justice wherever the Strasbourg Court is called upon to rule on the compatibility of a Union act with fundamental rights before the Court of Justice has had the opportunity to do so."
"I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which will be beneficial for Europe's citizens as it will provide us with a new court that is not part of the European Union, and will ensure that the rights of European citizens are always upheld by the European Union and the Member States."
"In keeping with the principles of democracy, the European Union and the Member States must always have the right to defend themselves."
"Therefore, I believe it is vital that each country that accedes to the convention should have a judge who will explain the background to each case, just as I feel it is important that the European Parliament should have an informal body in order to coordinate information sharing between the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"It is also important, moreover, that Parliament should be consulted and involved in the negotiating process."
"I voted for the resolution because I take the view that the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) would be a good step forward in creating legal certainty and consistency."
"In recent decades, the European Court of Human Rights has adopted a raft of decisions which make the defence of the fundamental rights of European citizens concrete."
"Acceding to the convention as the European Union would also contribute to the Union's credibility in the eyes of third countries."
"I am delighted with the adoption of the report drawn up by my fellow Member, Mr Jáuregui, on the signing up of the EU to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"I am concerned that some Europhobe Members persist in denying the need for this measure, whereas I believe that signing up to this convention implies a greater guarantee of protection for human rights, also within the EU."
"The EU's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was already advocated in the Treaty on European Union; the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon made it obligatory."
"Accession will strengthen protection of human rights in Europe and submit the Union's legal system to external legal control."
"This will ensure harmony of case-law between the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Court of Human Rights, and will grant the European public protection from the action of European institutions, under terms similar to those that already exist with regard to the Member States."
"It should be noted that accession does not grant the EU membership of the Council of Europe, or call into question the autonomy of Union law, since the CJEU remains the only authority adjudicating on issues relating to the validity and interpretation of Union law."
"I would also stress the importance given to the possibility that the Union should be able to submit candidates and choose a judge to represent it, and the need that is mentioned for Parliament to be kept duly informed about accession negotiations and for a mechanism for exchanging information between the parliamentary assemblies of both institutions to be established in the future."
"I support the report, most of all because it extends the system of protection of human rights in the European Union and gives it greater credibility in the eyes of its citizens."
"When it is not possible to appeal at national or EU level, when a petitioner is refused permission to institute proceedings, or when an action cannot be brought against an EU institution - these are situations in which the added value will be apparent."
"Therefore, let us continue the fight to strengthen the system of protection of human rights in the EU."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you are aware, respect for human rights is a fundamental value of the European Union which is anchored in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"There is no doubt that, if everything is done properly, EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) could be an historic opportunity to strengthen the human rights situation in the EU and all of Europe."
"This could be our chance to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of EU citizens."
"EU accession to the ECHR would give Europe an excellent opportunity to act as a moral lighthouse, to be an example."
"This event would not only enhance the EU's credibility, in terms of relations with non-EU Member States, but would also improve public opinion about EU structures."
"However, this would only happen if we use all our joint efforts to eliminate double standards in our political programme and legal system."
"Unfortunately, as shown by events in recent years, accusations often have a purely political overtone."
"Courts both in my country and in the rest of Europe are still very often susceptible to political manipulation."
"Unless that changes, very promising events like EU accession to the ECHR will simply be a waste of time."
"Therefore I support wholeheartedly accession to the ECHR, provided this really will defend fundamental human rights and freedoms and, most importantly, within the EU itself."
"in writing. - I am supportive of the ECHR while recognising that judicial interpretations of certain provisions of the convention have created obstacles to the deportation of terrorist suspects."
"This needs to change."
"Notwithstanding any statements of respect for the position of Member States in relation to ECHR, EU accession to the convention will complicate and possibly hinder the freedom of Member States to derogate from or individually interpret aspects of the ECHR."
"Politically, I fundamentally object to the driving motive of EU accession to ECHR as 'a move forward in the process of European integration [involving] one further step towards political union'."
"This misconceived aspiration is further underlined in the statement that EU accession constitutes 'an accession of a non-State Party to a legal instrument created for States'."
"For all these reasons, I voted against the resolution."
"The organisation of the International Criminal Court conference in Uganda is an important sign of this international institution's acceptance across the continent of Africa, especially as the Court's initial investigations, after it was established in 2002, were launched here."
"No one can deny the importance of such an international court which investigates serious cases involving breaches of human rights, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"Consequently, it is important that an ever-increasing number of states acknowledge the authority of the International Criminal Court and that the signatories of the Rome Statute ratify the agreement as a matter of urgency."
"The notion of setting up an international court for investigating crimes against humanity emerged as far back as 1919, during the Paris Peace conference."
"It has taken 83 years to reach an international agreement and set up the ICC."
"At the moment, states which have ratified the ICC's Rome Statute must also regulate the Court's right to investigate crimes of aggression."
"Furthermore, signatory states must harmonise their national legislation with the provisions of the Rome Statute, in keeping with the commitment they have made."
"The European Union has been a firm advocate of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and all its Member States are sharing in its accession to this important court."
"I hope that the State Parties are able to live up to their responsibilities and that the result of the Kampala conference is an ICC that is better able to face up to the challenges of our times, that receives adequate cooperation from national legal systems, and that is granted sufficient means to effectively exercise its authority; the grave seriousness of the crimes on which its activities will focus, for the most part, demand it."
"The EU is a staunch supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which promotes universality and upholds the integrity of the Rome Statute with a view to protecting and consolidating the independence, legitimacy and effectiveness of the international judicial process."
"The proof of this is that the EU is systematically promoting the inclusion of a clause relating to the ICC in negotiating mandates and agreements with third countries."
"The EU has already provided over EUR 40 million over ten years under the European Instrument for Human Rights and Democracy for projects aimed at supporting the ICC and international criminal justice."
"The Review Conference on the Rome Statute of the ICC in Kampala, Uganda, represents a unique opportunity for the State Parties, the non-State Parties, civil society and other interested parties alike to strongly reiterate their commitment to justice and responsibility."
"There are 111 State Parties to the ICC, with some regions under-represented, such as the Middle East, North Africa and Asia."
"I hope that the Member States will participate in this conference by providing representation at the highest level and publicly reaffirming their commitment to the ICC."
"I note with satisfaction that the resolution proposed by Parliament on the review of the Rome Statute requires the crime of aggression to be officially included as a war crime and that no jurisdictional filter will be necessary to determine whether such a crime has been committed."
"Yet how can this new legislation be implemented if the main states that have committed crimes of aggression since the coming into force of the Rome Statute in 2002 (the United States and Israel) are not required to ratify it?"
"How can it be rendered effective if these states are not urged to cease pressurising the states that are party to the International Criminal Court into guaranteeing the immunity of their nationals?"
"It is also regrettable that a Parliament which professes to be in the vanguard of the fight against climate change is not proposing to include ecological crimes as crimes against humanity, as was proposed at the Cochabamba Summit."
"The most serious crimes against humanity must be punished."
"The International Criminal Court could be a useful tool in this area."
"It is just a question of actually giving it the resources."
"As this is not happening, I am abstaining."
"I feel bound to express my agreement with the motion for a resolution on the Review Conference on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala, Uganda."
"Europe itself sprang from the need to put an end to the expressions of racial hatred that reached a peak in the atrocities of the Second World War."
"The European Union has always been consistent in seeking to strengthen cooperation between states in order to prove and prosecute crimes against humanity."
"It is right that eight years after the entry into force of the Rome Statute, states should reaffirm their strong commitment to building on peace, stability and the rule of law."
"In particular, states should commit to policies aimed at collaborating with the International Criminal Court and protecting the victims of violence."
"In many cases in practice, victims encounter major difficulties in accessing information about the court and fail in their attempts to have their rights protected."
"in writing. - I enthusiastically voted in favour of the resolution and I am especially glad that the oral amendment by my colleague had been adopted, i.e. to include 'indigenous people' in the list of groups that need special attention."
"in writing. - I welcome the motion for a resolution on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kampala, Uganda, as it contains very crucial and important points and requests regarding the ratification and the implementation of the ICC."
"Therefore, I voted in favour."
"But I want to express my deep concerns about certain phrases in the resolution, which refer positively to the 'Stockholm Programme', the 'EIDHR' and to the European Union as a 'Global Player'."
"In this matter, the 'Stockholm Programme' and the 'EIDHR' might have had a positive impact, but in many other areas, these two programmes/instruments are not used in a democratic and transparent manner."
"The European Union has indeed been acting as a 'Global Player' but, in my view, not at all in a positive way towards a more fair and solidary world order."

"Implementation of the synergies of research and innovation earmarked funds in Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 concerning the European Fund of Regional Development and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development - Delivering a single market to consumers and citizens - Long-term sustainability of public finances for a recovering economy - Contribution of the Cohesion policy to the achievement of Lisbon and the EU 2020 objectives (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr van Nistelrooij, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the implementation of the synergies of research and innovation earmarked Funds in Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 concerning the European Fund of Regional Development and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development in cities and regions as well as in the Member States and the Union,"
"the report by Mr Grech, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on delivering a single market to consumers and citizens,"
"the report by Mr Hoang Ngoc, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the long-term sustainability of public finances for a recovering economy [COM(2009/0545 - 2010/2038 (INI))], and"
"the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the contribution of the Cohesion policy to the achievement of Lisbon and the EU 2020 objectives."
"This is indeed a very coherent package."
"Following this morning's debate on the support package and on tighter, sounder financial and economic governance, we are now discussing a number of underlying dossiers that are important as regards the commitment required in connection with the EU 2020 strategy."
"Parliament wishes to expressly steer these proposals by the Commission and, particularly, the Council; it is unacceptable for the Council to take decisions in June without us having expressly reached agreement on a number of underlying matters."
"We are talking about the direction, and also about implementation in the near future."
"Take, for example, the flagship projects that will also require our joint support before long."
"It is really important, therefore, that we invest enough time in this now."
"Well, then, both the Cortés Lastra report and my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output, or results, for Europe."
"The beauty of it is that we can do better; indeed we must do better."
"Our activities are rather fragmented in various fields - if we look at developments in the world, competition and the kind of things we want to tackle."
"To summarise: things must be made smarter, greener, more sustainable and more inclusive."
"The reports tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also concern governance and ensuring sufficient financial resources, including for education."
"In short, it is my hope that, this afternoon, we shall lay clear foundations for this resolution."
"I do not know whether a vote will be held tomorrow, whether a consensus will be achieved on governance."
"In any case, however, I anticipate that Parliament will be able to adopt a final position on the EU 2020 strategy in June."
"Returning to my report: it is an implementation report."
"We have taken a proper look at how things work in the fields of research and development, regional policy and small and medium-sized enterprises, and I wish to thank my fellow Members, including those from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy - the committee with joint responsibility in accordance with Article 50 - for helping us achieve a good result."
"What have we laid down?"
"1."
"In Europe, we have first-class research."
"Yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research."
"Knowledge is free; it travels around the world, and cannot be kept to oneself."
"Although we are very good at investing in research, we are lagging behind in the utilisation of this research, in bringing innovation to the market and, subsequently, keeping high-quality production in this part of the world."
"2."
"My report notes that we are currently spending one quarter of regional funds on research infrastructure and innovation."
"That is a substantial change, a prioritisation that has been working in the current period thanks to Commission initiatives."
"Earmarking is among the instruments that have been effective and have also definitely influenced the agenda in the regions, towns and cities."
"It leads to a better profile in the knowledge-based economy into which we are evolving, and to greater specialisation."
"3."
"In my report, together with my fellow Members, I have made a series of proposals for improvements throughout the research/innovation/production chain with a view to greater effectiveness."
"We must also realise the importance of the territorial dimension laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We need to focus on a number of areas in order to achieve a large-scale effect; we need the courage to specialise production in a region - incidentally, the principle of specialisation is an old one in the European Union - provided that good links exist for transmitting that knowledge (broadband or traditional infrastructure)."
"If the Union invests money, there should also be cooperation between the ..."

"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on which we are voting this week is of particular symbolic importance at a time when the markets are unable to assess the risks associated with the economic situation in the euro area."
"Having demanded severe budget adjustment policies, they now doubt the capacity of Member Sates to kick-start their growth and, hence, to obtain the tax revenue necessary to pay the interest on their debt."
"Unfortunately, no risk assessment can be carried out in the deeply uncertain context in which the global economy now finds itself."
"Such an assessment is all the more important in the European Union, where the production capacity utilisation rate is at an all-time low."
"Instead of investing, companies are mothballing machines because, despite the initial signs of recovery at the end of 2009, demand is lacking."
"Growth would even end up going into reverse if restrictive measures were to nip the recovery in the bud."
"The first aim of our report was precisely to determine the optimum time for launching policies for emerging from the crisis."
"We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored."
"We therefore suggested ratifying the principle of anti-cyclical budgetary policies, which were successfully established during the first phase of the crisis in 2008 and 2009, and which are in line with the spirit of the reform of the 2005 Stability Pact."
"These policies entail using automatic stabilisers, in other words, in earmarking surpluses from the primary budget for debt repayment at the top of the cycle, and in allowing Member States to borrow the resources necessary for stimulus packages at the bottom of the cycle."
"We are currently at the bottom of the cycle."
"Interest rates are definitely under pressure and are threatening the sustainability of the debt."
"This being the case, the European Central Bank was right to announce that it would buy back some debt to enable Member States to diversify their sources of finance."
"Nevertheless, in addition to the fact that this concept of sustainability has never been defined in the economic literature, can the risk premiums demanded by the markets be deemed justifiable?"
"No, if we consider that risk in the mortgage derivatives market, just as in the public-debt market, is impossible to assess."
"This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"This is why, in our report, we proposed that particular attention be paid to the structural deficit indicator rather than the focus being on the current account deficit, the scale of which is due to the deterioration in the actual budget deficit."
"This is the result of the crisis, which has weakened growth and concomitant tax revenue."
"This revenue has also been adversely affected by the lowering of taxes, which did not have the expected impact on supply."
"Our report seeks to offer three recommendations combined with some operational indicators."
"The first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated."
"The second is to monitor the structural deficits, which are still close to equilibrium, despite the deterioration in actual budget deficits, in order to send a reassuring signal to the markets as to the state of public finances."
"The third is to assess the efficiency of tax expenditure and, in particular, of certain tax reductions which are related to the fall in tax revenue."
"Unfortunately, for the liberals and the conservatives in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, common sense counts for little; the impact of the crisis counts for little; and the fact that the massive debt is also due to the bank bail-out plans counts for little."
"Only their blind faith in the efficiency of the financial markets counts; only dogmatic compliance with a manifestly out-of-date Stability Pact counts."
"They do not see any need to create the tools required for economic governance, which is essential in order to strengthen the Union."
"It is a case of putting Europe on a starvation diet and doggedly trying to meet the criteria in the pact without any guarantee of success and at the risk of destroying the recovery, and too bad for social cohesion."
"That is the position that they have defended in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Since that vote, the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further."
"The European Central Bank and the Commission have finally come up with monetary and budgetary instruments which should enable us to improve economic governance in the euro area."
"However, the markets have fallen once again, unsettled as they are by the austerity plans."
"The Ecofin Council had to start all over again on Monday."
"Against this background, the amendments which we are tabling are, all in all, very moderate; and we are tabling some new ones too."
"They argue for flexible implementation of the Stability Pact, so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided."
"They advocate a public credit rating agency to shield Member States from the diktat of the markets."
"These are the signals that Parliament must send out."
"Mr Karas, the time for ideological knee-jerk reactions has passed, as has the time for short-term national electoral moves."
"Europe needs policies which are motivated by a real desire to strengthen the Union."
"If you and your group are not up to this task, if you are no longer capable of representing the general interest, you can be sure that our citizens will be able to draw their own conclusions, for the future of the euro area is now at stake."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and their assistants, the Secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for their contributions, as well as the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the trade unions and the European regional networks and associations for their cooperation."
"I had meetings with several regional associations and institutions while preparing this report, especially the Committee of the Regions, the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, the Assembly of European Regions, the European Regions Research and Innovation Network, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and its Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities."
"I would like to thank all of them for their availability and interesting contributions."
"Having changed the title, which now includes the reference to the Europe 2020 strategy, the main aim of the report is to defend Cohesion policy as a strong, well-financed policy, and one that is present in all European Union regions, as well as its key role in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The report was approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Regional Development: 40 votes in favour, 1 abstention and 1 vote against."
"The first part of the report makes a brief analysis of the contribution of the Cohesion policy to the Lisbon Strategy and points to the limitations of the involvement of regional and local authorities, of the social, economic and civil society actors in the Lisbon Strategy, which made its adoption, communication and effectiveness difficult."
"The report also calls for the need for assessments, not only of the actual expenditure, but of the real impact as well."
"The second part deals with recommendations for the future Europe 2020 strategy and highlights the importance of the regions, multi-level governance and the principle of partnership, basic pillars of the Cohesion policy that must be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy as a prior and necessary condition for its successful implementation."
"Moreover, it is essential that the participation of the social and economic actors, as well as those of civil society in general, be strengthened in order to avoid the strategy becoming disconnected from and discredited by its key stakeholders."
"This part underlines the key role of education, training, research and innovation, the importance of facilitating the establishment of the so-called knowledge triangle, and the need to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which quite often play a pioneering role in innovation."
"However, at the same time, we should not overlook the specific needs of the regions and social groups with the most difficulties."
"Thus, a certain flexibility should be allowed for."
"Specifically, in order to foster the leverage effect of investment in research and development, in education and in training, we defend the need to increase the synergies between the National Strategic Reference Frameworks and the National Reform Programmes, as well as greater coordination and coherence between the different European, national and regional policies linked to strategy objectives."
"The European Investment Bank plays, and must continue to play, an important role by means of the financial engineering, cooperation and support instruments in supporting the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, in order to facilitate its task, and that of all the beneficiaries, advances need to be made towards greater simplification."
"In conclusion, the report defends a solid and well-financed Cohesion policy for the future, one that is present in all European regions and which has a key role to play in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Mr President, in essence, my report is concerned with the protection of the Single Market from a micro perspective, to regard the market as a single project and to take the 2012 framework, the 2020 strategy and the recent financial crisis into consideration."
"Strategies and courses of action that are intended to breathe new life into the European Single Market and the European Market ought to be based on a pragmatic, extensive and comprehensive agreement which is inclusive of all Member States and which focuses primarily on the priorities that the Member States are truly willing to take on."
"Europe needs to develop 2020 strategies enabling the market to be the leading agent in economic regeneration while, at the same time, generating acceptance by the citizens by protecting their interests, by the consumers by defending their rights, and by small and medium enterprises by providing them with the right incentives."
"My report proposes a series of strategic legislative and non-legislative initiatives, geared towards the rehabilitation of the European Single Market."
"These initiatives reach their pinnacle in the creation of the Single Market Act, which combines immediate action (2012) together with the long term vision of the 2020 strategy."
"I have also put forward specific non-legislative proposals on the drawing up of the citizens' charter which lays down their rights and what they are entitled to."
"It is also encouraging that I received positive reactions from Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Dalli regarding my proposal on the top 20 frustrations as expressed by European citizens, on the creation of a collective remedy mechanism and on a communication strategy specifically targeted at every day problems experienced by our citizens."
"We need to adopt a truly new political line of thought that is based upon consumer protection and the social dimension, which will serve to draw up the laws and tasks to be undertaken by the European Union."
"Only in this way can we achieve a truly social market economy as is stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Unfortunately, in the past years, the Single Market has not managed to convince our citizens that it represents their interests and aspirations."
"What is even more alarming is that our citizens and consumers are experiencing an increasing sense of uncertainty and lack of faith in the Market."
"We need to come to terms with the fact that the traditional definition of the Single Market as something solely tied to the economic dimension needs to be revamped."
"We need to come up with a new common line which is holistic and which fully integrates the sentiments of our citizens, consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This can be done by offering them a leading part in the re-launch of the European Single Market."
"Every effort that is wasted by trying to explain away the Single Market in a dogmatic fashion will be underestimating the challenges, inconsistencies, interests, differing beliefs and perplexities that we must face up to."
"The Single Market integration process is not an irreversible one."
"Its current situation needs to be challenged."
"The European Single Market is in danger of becoming extremely weak and therefore irrelevant due to the protectionist attitudes that the crisis brought along with it."
"The Single Market is not an end in itself but an instrument that has to contribute in a significant manner to a better quality of life for all European citizens so that, as Evelyne Gebhardt said, 'the Single Market works for the citizens and not against them.'"
"So as to guarantee a viable and strong Single Market, we need to reconcile what Mario Monti referred to in his analytical and stimulating report as the tensions between market integration and social objectives."
"In the final analysis, the predominant system is one that succeeds in striking a balance between a vibrant and competitive economy that incentivises innovation and job creation and which provides consumer protection as well as social and environmental safeguards required by our citizens."
"All this needs to be achieved within a spirit of compromise and solidarity."
"Finally Mr President, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for their contributions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I do nonetheless wonder for a moment about our programming and our ability to organise our debates."
"I am very happy to share this debate with all these European Parliament initiatives, but I do feel as though I am in a melting pot which I am not sure offers an exact definition of the European Parliament's vision for the EU 2020 strategy."
"Perhaps I am being too demanding, though."
"On the other hand, I hope that you share my concern, Mr President, because, on behalf of this House, you raised an extremely important question with President Van Rompuy, on 10 May, which relates to the following."
"With regard to the adoption of the employment guidelines, this year - dare I say it, as an exceptional measure - as part of a special partnership between the Commission and the European Parliament, and in a spirit of good cooperation with the Council, bearing in mind the somewhat revised timetable - the employment guidelines are normally published at the end of the previous year; this year, they were published in April and, even though they commit us to a long cycle for the years to come, we will have to deliberate them before the spring European Council - you kindly supported, on behalf of us all, the request we sent to President Van Rompuy calling for the European Council to grant the European Parliament the right to exercise its powers under the Treaty of Lisbon itself."
"Clearly, neither the Commission nor the Council has any intention of considering this request and they therefore consciously intend to violate the treaty."
"I think that the authorities in this House will have to shoulder their responsibilities and learn lessons from this."
"As regards the challenge of these employment guidelines, which will be a factor in the implementation of the 2020 strategy, we must draw the attention of the authorities to their importance at a time when 17% of Europeans are living below the poverty line - I would point out that these figures are taken from 2007, that is to say, from even before the start of the crisis - and when 23 million of our fellow citizens are going to end up unemployed."
"There is currently great concern within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs about two issues."
"Firstly, about the poverty reduction target, which I think was the initiative of Commissioner Andor; this target was included in the 2020 strategy, and we welcome that."
"We do not understand how this issue can be the subject of discussions, hesitations and the calling into question of the Union's competences within the Council, when the treaty clearly indicates that this is an area in which the EU also has responsibilities."
"Then, the other issue relates to the relationship and consistency between the various policies, because the Commission clearly tells us that it has fundamentally changed things in this 2020 strategy, since it has reduced the number of targets."
"I believe that fundamental change must be about much more than simply reducing the number of targets."
"However, what we are convinced about is that the 2020 strategy must take account of the reality of the situation in the EU."
"The reality is that those who are currently suffering the most as a result of the crisis, those who will be hardest hit, are the ones who actually create the EU's wealth."
"The fact is, we are seeing debates starting up here and there which are liable to go against Europeans' very interests, because they would lead to a reduction in investment just when it is needed the most, in other words, in our long-term capital: education, training and health."
"This is why, faced with this challenge, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the authorities to be aware of how public investment might be reduced in these fields, at the very time when weak growth and reduced private investment cannot take up the slack and, therefore, ensure the recovery of public finances in the short term."
"This is a crucially important timetabling issue, and we cannot but regret that the Ministers for Economic and Monetary Affairs were able to argue for a withdrawal of non-conventional employment support and unemployment reduction measures, when the Ministers for Social Affairs had not been consulted in what we know is a tragic employment and social affairs situation in our European Union."
"author. - Mr President, the EU 2020 strategy proposes action to enhance the performance of education systems, reinforce the attractiveness of Europe's higher education, open up more mobility and training programmes for young people, modernise labour markets, boost labour mobility and develop skills and competences to increase labour market participation."
"This has been endorsed by the Spring Council, which stated that key objectives requiring action at EU level included better conditions for research and development, improved education levels, a reduction in early school leavers and increased participation of youth, older workers and low-skilled workers in the labour market."
"However, the global economic crisis has led to budget cuts in the education sector in Member States across the European Union."
"For instance, Latvia is suffering a deep economic crisis and it has faced severe budget cuts in the country's 34 higher education institutions with a threatened 50% cutback to the higher-education budget."
"Irish universities face a 6% cut, and Britain is not exempt from this because in England, the Higher Education Funding Council reckons there may be a cut of up to EUR 500 million from higher education."
"This is not all doom and gloom."
"Some Member States, such as France, have been doing well, but the problem is that there is a divergent level of funding across Member States."
"In order for the EU 2020 strategy to work, we need a strong, coordinated approach."
"I am therefore asking for the Commission to explain, firstly, how it intends to ensure that Member States make good on their commitments to the educational goals in the 2020 strategy by ensuring that this area receives sufficient support and funding and is not forgotten amid the rush to balance the books in the light of the economic crisis and, secondly, how it intends to secure extra budgetary means for these important EU-level strategies and programmes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, and of President Barroso, I should like to make a few comments about the 2020 strategy and echo the very interesting reports from Mr Grech and Mr Hoang Ngoc; next, my colleagues and friends, Commissioners Hahn and Andor, will speak in turn - in this debate in which we are participating - on the other oral questions which affect other sectors: cohesion, employment, the social dimension, research and development."
"On behalf of all three of us, please allow me to thank all the rapporteurs and Parliament for this initiative, which is being taken at an extremely serious and challenging time for all of us, at a time of economic crisis, with the recent difficulties of the euro, which clearly highlight the interdependency of all our Member States and the need to coordinate our countries' economic policies."
"This is the time to respond and to act and, as far as possible, together, in this context of uncertainty and crisis."
"The decisions taken over the last few days are - we think - very important."
"I will not go back over the long debate which was held this morning with my colleague, Commissioner Rehn."
"It is obvious that we have to put in place instruments for improved coordination of our economic policies, and we think that this Europe 2020 strategy may be the first instrument of a new, strengthened and coordinated economic policy."
"In its proposal concerning this strategy, the Commission had already emphasised, at the beginning of March, the need to stabilise our public finances."
"The euro crisis which we have just been through proves to us just how relevant this position still is."
"Like my colleague, Commissioner Rehn, I have taken note of the proposals in Mr Hoang Ngoc's report on these issues."
"Moving on, there is, ladies and gentlemen, a second preliminary requirement for the success of 2020, which is putting our economy, our economies on a sound or improved footing."
"I am, of course, thinking about the need to supervise and regulate the financial market, so that it serves the real economy and not the other way around."
"I promise you that the Commission will keep to its roadmap in these areas."
"Within the next year, we will have put all the necessary legislative proposals on the table, so that we can formalise the commitments we made together at the G20 on four major issues: transparency, responsibility, supervision and crisis prevention."
"With regard to several of these issues, which have already been considered in the legislative debate, I truly hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to rapidly overcome their differences with regard to the texts under discussion."
"I am thinking about the 'financial supervision' package and the hedge funds document."
"We must restore confidence."
"We must also utilise every single resource to free up the growth potential of our economy."
"This work clearly comprises many aspects."
"The debate, this afternoon's debate in fact, demonstrates this: the relaunch of the internal market, regional policy for all the regions, including the most distant ones, such as the outermost regions, cohesion, economic governance, the viability of public finances, employment, education and research."
"When we talk about Europe 2020, what are we talking about?"
"I think that this 2020 strategy must enable us to have a better perspective on the economic policies of our Member States, in order to avoid certain imbalances or even certain instances of competition in the future."
"These imbalances have been very obvious in the current crisis but, at the same time as urgently addressing this crisis, we must work on the economy in the medium and long terms."
"This is why, on the basis of the Commission proposals, the European Council adopted five common objectives: an employment rate of 75%, 3% of GDP invested in research and development, as well as a restriction on leaving school too early, increasing the number of people with a university diploma to 40%, and the 20-20-20 targets in the field of energy and climate change."
"Finally, there is also the promotion of social inclusion by combating poverty."
"Quantified indicators for education and social inclusion will have to be set at the June European Council."
"Work on these two objectives is in progress in various forums of the Council."
"It is very important to clearly understand that the 2020 strategy is not merely a vision."
"It is, above all, a concrete programme of reforms to be implemented, and that is why we are proposing seven flagship initiatives as part of this strategy."
"In addition to these flagship initiatives, European instruments, in particular the single market, financial levers and foreign policy instruments will also be mobilised to eliminate certain obstacles."
"I should also like to commend the Monti report presented a few days ago, and I wish to pay homage to the intelligent work of Mr Grech, who is giving a humanist and more concrete dimension to the internal market, as I myself should like to do."
"There are also certain requirements where implementation is concerned."
"Therefore, more efficient governance mechanisms have been proposed, which require the involvement of the Member States, as well as the Commission, at every level of the monitoring process."
"Europe 2020 also means adopting reforms to be implemented within the Member States themselves."
"The latter will have to submit national reform programmes between now and the end of the year in a coordinated fashion, with a stability and convergence programme, while also showing respect for the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr Hoang Ngoc, I should like, if I may, to point out that this pact has been supported for about 10 years now by both left- and right-wing governments."
"Finally, the Commission is calling on the European Parliament to do what it does so well and play a still greater role in this new strategy."
"During a crisis, we wish to send out clear messages to the Member States."
"This is the purpose of the integrated guidelines proposed by the Commission."
"These will only be adopted once you have tabled your opinions."
"However, bearing in mind the urgency of the situation, we must implement this strategy."
"We must aim for a political agreement at the European Council meeting in June."
"Let us be clear, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: in the rest of the world, socio-economic strategies are already being implemented for the medium term."
"Europe cannot be left behind."
"To conclude, the European Parliament is playing its role, and we thank it for doing so, for mobilising the citizens, in particular, via the national parliaments;"
"I was very impressed by the initiative taken by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and its Chair, Malcolm Harbour, on the Services Directive, which brought together national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"There are other examples, and this is a very important undertaking."
"To conclude, I should like to confirm that the Commission will do as you wish and play its role in a purposeful manner so as to implement this strategy and to build, with you, this new, higher quality, more sustainable and fairer growth, which the citizens expect."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (BG) Mr President, Commissioners, if we were discussing the Europe 2020 strategy without the economic crisis having occurred, everything would be fine."
"The problem is that in the current crisis and after what has happened, the Europe 2020 strategy is not ambitious and dynamic enough."
"The problem which all the questions asked in recent weeks have been about is whether there is a sufficient degree of coordination, as was the case even up to now in European policies, for the European Union to make progress."
"From what we see, this coordination is good at a time of growth, but during a crisis it is not up to requirements."
"Alternatively, many more functions need to be transferred, not only coordination, but also decision making at European level so that Europe can set itself much more ambitious tasks and play a much more leading role in this coordination."
"This is the fundamental question to be answered."
"If we fail to do so, we will not be able to set out the 2020 programme properly either."
"I think that in the coming weeks, we ought to focus mainly on this issue."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see Mr Hahn, Commissioner for Regional Policy, and Mr Barnier, Commissioner for the Internal Market, sitting side by side because it is essential that we do not play off regional policy against the internal market."
"Instead, we should ensure that the one complements the other and that both of them are strong so that we can achieve the objectives of Europe 2020."
"Europe 2020 must begin here and now and should not be just a catalogue of objectives."
"Europe 2020 is a project for growth and employment and we need concrete projects, we need the instruments, we need the procedure, we need mechanisms for sanctions, so that this can be successfully implemented."
"I am convinced that we will only be able to implement Europe 2020 if we are ready, if Europe is ready to think of the EU in terms of the United States of Europe!"
"To think in those terms and with each of us making a contribution to the whole."
"Europe 2020 means the willingness to bring about a political union."
"That presupposes reinforcing and expanding the monetary union, reinforcing and expanding the internal market, unfettering it and calling on people to use the opportunity that is Europe, to use Europe and break through borders."
"We have to create an economic union which is part of a political union, as well as a social union."
"None of these things are ready and there is a great deal that has not even been addressed."
"Europe 2020 is a community Union, not a nationalist or obstructive Europe."
"We therefore need a financial review, an EU impact assessment, implementation of the Small Business Act and, obviously, very specific European projects for growth and employment and the expansion of the freedoms of education, science, research and innovation in Europe."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Karas if the United States of Europe to which he referred in his speech is going to take place with the consent of the peoples of Europe or without the consent of the peoples of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, each one of us who represents the citizens of Europe and is constantly in contact with them has one objective: working with the citizens of Europe in order to further develop Europe and make it more competitive and to achieve growth and employment for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"Unless we take action together to become stronger and if each person looks after their own interests, this Community will not be reinforced, but weakened, in these times of increasing globalisation."
"The citizens are our most important allies in achieving our joint objectives."
"Mr President, the Europe that we are taking decisions about today is also the one that decides how Europe will look in 2020."
"The decisions that we are refusing to take today will lead to new crises."
"The decisions that we take today must be long-term decisions."
"It is a serious problem that so many of the decisions continue to be short-sighted and governed by a right-wing philosophy where economies in crisis are put on a starvation diet."
"It is also a serious problem that we are discussing Greek pensions instead of the behaviour of the big bankers and of the players in the property and financial markets."
"We need to correct this situation or else the Europe that we will see in 2020 will perhaps be in a worse crisis than the one we are in at present."
"I call on the Commission to make a serious effort to bring about a change of course so that we abandon our blind faith in market solutions, we regulate the markets and we make major investments in those things that are for the good of everyone."
"This may mean the transport system, it may mean energy supplies, it may mean other important solutions where the Member States cannot stand alone but where the EU and the Commission must act."
"I also hope that the Commission is ready to table proposals that show that we take the transition to a sustainable society seriously."
"We will, in other words, restructure our industry so that it is competitive and can create new jobs."
"We cannot do this by convincing ourselves that we can keep following the same old tracks."
"This also requires investment, but it may make an impact on the current figure of 28 million registered unemployed."
"I also call on the Commission to show the workers of the EU the respect that will be required in this economic crisis in order to bring them with us to build a stronger and better society."
"For us to be able to master this crisis, we need trade union rights and we need Europe's workers to be made into stakeholders."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I used to say that we had a triple crisis in Europe with financial markets, jobs and climate."
"But now, sadly, we have a quadruple crisis if we add the state budget crisis."
"It has made it painfully clear that the European Union is in dire need of vision. European integration has, until now, focused on creating new projects without making sure that they work properly."
"I believe that the time has now come for us to deal with our problems and instead work hard to deepen the existing institutions."
"The mistakes that have been made can be corrected and the Union can still work for - and with - its citizens."
"Europe needs a forward-looking Union."
"For me, the direction is clear: I want a Europe which is open, inclusive and green."
"The flagship proposals in the Commission's Europe 2020 strategy are important tools to create that Europe, provided that we can make them come true."
"And here I have some question marks."
"Firstly, the overarching goal of the strategy is to create a more dynamic and competitive economy."
"In some countries, the participation of women in the labour market is as low as 40%, and this is shameful."
"A gender-equal labour market is a precondition for boosting jobs and for tackling the demographic challenges."
"I hope that the Council and Commission really take seriously the fact that the Council's conclusions have included gender equality for a couple of months."
"An inclusive society needs more jobs."
"Unemployment is the main reason why poverty exists."
"Youth unemployment in Spain, at 44%, is devastating."
"We have endless opportunities to create green jobs, but our policies must be aimed in the same direction."
"An energy-efficient Europe is also a driving force of innovation, and the energy equivalent of fast trains, supergrids and high-tech smart grids is needed to improve Europe's competitiveness."
"I must commend the Liberal Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, on being the first to really outline a clear flagship proposal on the digital agenda, and I am looking forward to having the same kind of in-depth material on the rest of the flagship platforms before June, so that we can also cooperate in the decision making."
"But, Mr Commissioner, we have the EU strategy pointing in one direction, and your budget proposal is, to be truthful, pointing in another direction."
"As well as regional funds, social funds and the agricultural fund, we have to streamline and have coherence in our common tools."
"We need transparency, and we need the same kind of statistics and we need sticks and carrots for Member States, not only to sign up to promises, but also to keep them."
"This is important for the European citizens and for us in Parliament."
"We need to strengthen the Growth and Stability Pact, and we fully support the package of Commissioner Olli Rehn."
"To re-establish trust, as you mentioned, Commissioner, we need the indicators on the rest of the flagship proposals."
"That would re-establish our trust in you as a Commission, and maybe, if we can cooperate on decision making, citizens' trust in us."
"Mr President, Mr Barnier, in your speech you mentioned Mr Monti's report, which was submitted to you a few days ago."
"There is a very interesting aspect in Mr Monti's report, and that is the emphasis it places on the pressing need for us to move on to the next stage of fiscal cooperation."
"It clearly explains that the Stability and Growth Pact criteria do need to be applied, but that if they are applied solely to expenditure, through cuts in expenditure, this will almost certainly lead to a recession."
"It is therefore crucial to use both pillars and, in particular, the fiscal pillar, to enable the Member States to collect a number of additional receipts from the economic activities and economic operators whose tax burden has been repeatedly reduced over the last few years: the profits from companies, capital, and financial transactions."
"To do this, we absolutely must have European coordination."
"This is the conclusion reached in Mr Monti's report, which was submitted two days ago."
"However, there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the EU 2020 strategy presented by the Commission."
"There is no mention whatsoever of this issue in Mr Rehn's communication published a few days ago."
"This is one of the major pillars, one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time."
"Do this, and this will establish the link - Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues."
"We are well aware that, if we abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact - which, incidentally, is vital - but do so only by cutting expenditure, then we are on course for social regression and economic recession."
"Therefore, my question is very clear: Mr Barnier, as a representative of the Commission, what are you going to place on the table over the coming weeks?"
"How are you going to convince your colleagues - assuming that you are already convinced yourself - of the need for an action plan, for a fiscal coordination plan so that Member States are able once more to raise new revenues on the basis of a number of agreements?"
"What are your proposals?"
"You are not entitled to stay silent."
"The Commission has a right to initiate legislation, but, today, on these issues, that right has become a duty."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, on behalf of my Group, I particularly wanted to welcome all the reports, but especially the report from Mr Grech, for which I was the shadow rapporteur in the committee."
"I want to refer to some points on that in a moment but I just want to support what Mrs Berès said about the wide-ranging nature of the debate this afternoon."
"But, on the other hand, it is rather an unfocused debate."
"There are some really important contributions from many colleagues but, frankly, and I say this to the Commission and Commissioner Barnier, this also reflects the nature of the EU 2020 document."
"It has lots of great ideas but it is very unfocused and it is also very underdeveloped at this stage."
"He talked about the seven flagship initiatives."
"Well, we do not know the details of those yet."
"So the first point I make is, please, can we ensure that the Council does not adopt in detail this proposal at its next meeting in June, because it is not ready to be adopted?"
"We need to spend more time on it together to work through the details."
"My second point is that I think we need to make the relaunch of the single market an eighth flagship initiative."
"That will not be overcomplicating things because it ought to be the number one initiative."
"Colleagues, you heard from Mr Grech that the potential is there to create jobs, to encourage more innovation and to move towards a more sustainable economy but we need to get the support of citizens and consumers for this proposal."
"It was like the question addressed to Mr Karas just now by the Earl of Dartmouth."
"Citizens need to buy into that process, but it is there for them to do."
"They will get the benefits."
"We have this instrument of huge potential and, particularly with public budgets still amounting to 16% of the European economy, why are we not using our public procurement budgets to drive innovation, to buy those new technologies, to encourage SMEs to take those up?"
"It is the biggest single underdeveloped policy that we have."
"We heard from Mr Barnier and Mr Grech today, and we made a contribution with Mr Monti's report."
"We have the instruments, but we need to carry them out."
"Mr President, we are in the middle of the most fundamental crisis the European Union has witnessed in its history and yet almost all decisions on the strategic direction are taken at government level."
"The European Parliament has been allowed to sit on the sidelines but no more than that."
"Time and again, the entire debate today has circled around specific issues concerning the Europe 2020 strategy for employment and growth, which gives the false impression that we are talking about the future of Europe and the course of its further development."
"We might be able to ask oral questions about the political relevance of the EU 2020 strategy in the context of the current economic and financial crisis, but we are not allowed to bring our demands to bear on this strategy and change it, make up for shortfalls or, perhaps, even change the priorities."
"Instead of being involved in this strategic cross-roads, what we have experienced on almost every single point that we have debated here in this House in recent months is getting caught up in the power play between the institutions in spite of, or perhaps even because of, the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This has mainly been to the detriment of the European Parliament."
"Both the EU 2020 strategy and, for example, the integrated employment guidelines, which the Chair of the Employment Committee has spoken about, regard Parliament as a body that is merely to be informed or consulted."
"Also, all the individual reports tabled here today far from present an overall view of the demands or the positions of the European Parliament regarding the European strategy."
"We want to introduce a whole raft of specific changes."
"In the last parliamentary term, the European Parliament put specific demands to the Council and Member States concerning the fight against poverty, the introduction of minimum income benefits and an EU-wide poverty-proof minimum wage."
"None of that has been incorporated into the strategy."
"On the contrary: there is even the risk that objectives, such as the fight against poverty and the reduction of poverty by 25%, may even disappear from the current strategy text because they do not accord with the skill and the interests of the Member States or the governments."
"Even the EU's employment record over the past ten years has clearly shown that atypical and precarious jobs, in particular, have risen to 60%."
"However, the huge rise in atypical jobs should lead us to set up a model in the strategy and in the guidelines which is directed at secure and poverty-proof jobs."
"Now, that is a fundamental demand which we are dealing with here."
"However, as long as the European Union, the institutions and their specific policies do not send out signals to those who are marginalised, who live in poverty or who have no work, or to young people who have no future prospects, we will not be able to win these groups over to the idea that a common European Union is a future-proof project."
"That is a democratic deficit which the current EU 2020 strategy does nothing to address and we should be fighting it together with our citizens."
"The problems experienced by Greece and the euro area make for a serious situation, which calls for a structural approach."
"The proposed EU 2020 strategy aiming to contribute to economic growth and employment seeks to provide this."
"The strategy rightly covers healthy public finances."
"However, the initiative will be useful only if two conditions are met."
"Firstly, the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened so that this kind of situation does not recur."
"It is not just a matter of structures and rules, then, but of mentality."
"The crucial point is that Member States meet their budgetary commitments, as I pointed out during a conference in Athens last week."
"It is to be welcomed that Member States are to call each other to account more intensively in a Council context regarding the structural reforms needed to put their public finances back in order."
"As far as I am concerned, strengthening of economic coordination ought to cover this."
"The second condition I wish to draw attention to is the undesirability of the European Union turning its attention to the policy fields of social affairs, employment and social cohesion."
"Objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at European level; and rightly so."
"We saw in the case of the Lisbon Strategy that such an approach does not work."
"Here, too, it is true that it is in restraint that the master is revealed; the European master."
"(NL) Today, we are discussing Europe's economy from a long-term perspective, and how to achieve sustainable economic growth."
"When Europe discusses this, I do not sleep as easily, as Europe has not proposed a great deal up to now."
"I would remind the House of the Lisbon Strategy, in which Europe agreed to become the most competitive economy in the world."
"That proved to be a complete failure, of course."
"All that this European Union has done is to increase bureaucracy, create unnecessary rules - particularly in my country, the Netherlands - and bring tax increases, mass immigration, crime and a lack of security."
"Moreover, let us now take a look at the list of countries wanting to join the EU, with whom we sit round the table every day: Albania, Bosnia, Turkey - all poor countries, Muslim countries, and corrupt and criminal to boot - and Iceland - a bankrupt state."
"In addition, every day in this Chamber we hear members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and even the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, say that we need a green economy, that we must provide billions of euro in subsidies for wind turbines and green electricity, even though our industry is becoming increasingly less competitive in relation to China, the United States and India."
"Are you surprised that our economy is stagnating?"
"There is only one recipe for an economically strong Europe, and that is less bureaucracy and fewer officials in Brussels, and also less bureaucracy in the Member States; tax cuts instead of tax increases; and putting a stop to mass immigration."
"Greece clearly must be expelled from the euro area."
"Let us hold up a mirror to ourselves for once and look at the MEPs here: what have you done in recent years to hold Greece to its commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"I already know your answer: absolutely nothing."
"You have all been asleep here while countries such as Greece, which have received billions from Europe each year, have squandered that money and let the government grow out of hand."
"If Europe does not succeed in this, I predict that my country, the Netherlands - and also Germany - will leave the euro area."
"Mr President, the financial support package that was presented almost two weeks ago was a necessity, but not a solution to the problems that Europe is facing."
"Now there is a need for action, for decisions and for restored confidence in public finances."
"I would say that we need to discuss the 2020 strategy, but we need even more a 2010 strategy, describing the action that needs to be taken now in order to restore growth, reduce deficits and create optimism."
"But there will be none of the growth which is needed without restored confidence in public finances."
"On this point, the Socialists are failing."
"They are defending the same policies that led to the deficits and the crisis of Greece, Spain and Portugal and other countries."
"The rapporteur, Mr Hoang Ngoc, is saying that we should prolong those policies and that we should wait before reducing the deficits."
"Mrs Ulvskog from Sweden proposes increased spending."
"The Socialists have become a threat to prosperity, recovery and the new jobs that Europe needs."
"I can assure you that, where Socialists fail, we in the EPP will stand up for the action needing to be taken - reduced deficits, restored confidence and the reforms for growth and new jobs."
"That is what Europe will need, and we will stand there and take the tough decisions and take the responsibilities where others fail."
"(ES) Mr President, I have to take a few seconds to ask that the speaker before me go to Greece and ask there who is responsible for the problems workers are experiencing at present."
"They are not waiting on the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"No, Sir."
"They are hoping for a real political change, such as that which can be brought about by the 2020 strategy."
"If our analysis is faulty, our solutions will likewise be faulty."
"The analysis we need to make is that Europe is suffering greatly from greed, from a lack of regulation, from a lack of economic governance, from an insufficiently educated and cohesive population, from a lack of social justice, from low economic growth, from low employment growth and from having enormous groups of poorly skilled people outside the job market."
"Mr President, the effort over the next ten years must be aimed at increasing the amount of people that work and ensuring that people are much better prepared, in educational terms, to win the productivity battle."
"Europe will not gain in competitiveness without winning the productivity battle."
"We will not gain a place in the world by lowering salaries, by destroying social standards, but rather by increasing our level of knowledge, by raising the level of solidarity and social cohesion in our society."
"These are our strong points."
"We must turn Europe into a genuinely united continent, with a clear project, clear objectives, with an economic governance that not only enables us to respond to the emergencies of today, but also to the challenges of tomorrow."
"These are our hopes."
"These are the hopes that have been forged by a sizeable majority of the Members on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, leaving aside the siren calls of those who want to return the 'every man for himself' idea, thus destroying solidarity with all."
"That is, Mr President, what we hope: that the 2020 strategy will get through to all European citizens, who are asking us for more jobs, more high-quality employment and for economic governance and tax consolidation."
"Tax consolidation is fine, but there must also be social and economic consolidation, otherwise we will not achieve anything."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, the financial markets need to be packaged in a new regulatory framework so that in future, we can avoid the excesses that have led to the crisis."
"However, if we highlight the underlying causes of the indebtedness of governments, then it becomes clear that, here in Parliament, we talk too much about public debt and too little about how we can achieve prosperity and growth."
"What determines our growth?"
"Our growth and prosperity depend on people in the European Union developing products and generating new ideas that can also be sold on the global market."
"It is therefore right that one chapter in the EU 2020 strategy is Innovation Union."
"We need to focus on inventions and on how we can reinforce research and development."
"With that, it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy."
"A great deal more could be done in those areas."
"Together with the Liberals and the German Free Democratic Party (FDP), I would argue that we focus on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We should see to it that we, as the EU, spend our funding so that SMEs really get access to that funding and so that there is a technology transfer between universities and colleges and SMEs."
"We should encourage people to take their destinies into their own hands through personal responsibility and self-initiative."
"Governments cannot create jobs; they need to be created in the economy itself."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that you have recognised that the transition to a green economic development must begin now, because climate change will put the EU's economic successes at risk."
"However, what is missing in the Europe 2020 strategy is a link between environmental change in the economy and a green employment strategy."
"There are studies which have shown that 8 million new jobs can be created through the energy transition alone."
"In the Europe 2020 strategy, we therefore need an initiative for green jobs."
"This initiative must be reflected in specific measures and integrated guidelines."
"Therefore, we need stable legal and political frameworks, so that investors really do invest in green jobs."
"That equally includes establishing links between research and development and the economy, the promotion of innovation clusters and also the opportunity to promote such clusters in disadvantaged regions."
"That is what the van Nistelrooij report states and I endorse it."
"Although I do not endorse those who would seek to impose demands on regions from above as regards the earmarking programme, the impetus stemming from this report and from the proposals made are nevertheless heading in the right direction and will contribute to the creation of green jobs."
"However, in the employment strategy, we must focus equally on shaping the course of transformation towards a green economy, on carrying the workers with us and preparing them for the transition."
"I address those words to Commissioner Andor."
"Fundamentally, the structure of the employment policy guidelines presented is right and balanced."
"Of particular importance is the fact that education has been emphasised as an independent area of focus."
"This area offers great opportunities for breaking the cycle of poverty."
"It forms a cornerstone for a green employment strategy and is thereby key to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, we also to need to improve the guidelines."
"The employment guidelines have a key role to play and that is to enable us to really exploit the potential of green jobs."
"(PL) Very different conclusions can be drawn from Europe's slow economic growth and the collapse caused by the crisis."
"One can certainly agree with those in this House who are calling for a reduction of the concession, administrative and information burdens which are generated not only by the Member States, but also by the European Union and by this Parliament."
"However, there is the risk of applying a treatment which is much worse than the disease."
"One such measure which would be harmful for European growth would be increasing the role of the European Union in the area of tax cooperation and coordination, and the tax harmonisation which would follow."
"Tax competition, like every kind of competition, is good for the citizens and the markets."
"It creates the chance for a better result, and is an important factor in our competitiveness at global level."
"Therefore, common freedoms and a common market, and not extending Union competences, should be the central principle of the Union's economic policy."
"(PT) Mr President, we would like to say in this debate that it is time to stop playing word games and talk about the real problems that the majority of women and men are experiencing in our countries; about suffering; about the more than 85 million people living in poverty in a European Union which is one of the richest parts of the world and in which scandalous profits continue to be made without any measures being taken to check them."
"We want to talk about the lack of job security and poor pay faced by workers; about the young people and women who cannot find work; about the 23 million unemployed."
"We want to talk about the elderly people who are being denied a decent retirement and the children whose futures are being mortgaged."
"Let us be clear: what is being proposed in the Europe 2020 strategy is the same path as was there at the start of the crisis."
"The European Commission did not want to analyse the causes of the current situation or make anything of the consequences of the cornerstones of the policies that it followed in applying the Lisbon Strategy: the liberalisation of economic sectors, including financial services, and the labour flexibility that it called flexicurity."
"What they are now aiming for is to open the way for greater concentration of wealth using various directives that will facilitate the privatisation of strategic sectors of the economy, and attacks on public services that interest economic groups in areas of health, social security, and education; anything that could turn a profit."
"They prefer to hide the fact that only a break from these policies will allow a change of course and that only this can bring social progress."
"Nevertheless, we insist on this break and say that it is time to drop the Stability Pact and replace it with a programme of social development and progress."
"This programme must prioritise production, quality public services, the creation of jobs with rights, salaries, decent pensions and retirement conditions, social inclusion, and fair wealth division and distribution."
"These priorities will require true economic and social cohesion, with the clear reinforcement of the Union budget, solidarity, public policies, and the control of the essential sectors of the economy by the state."
"We are certain that the workers and the people will continue to fight for this, for example, in Greece tomorrow or on 29 May in Portugal; we here salute their struggle."
"Mr President, doubtless the 2020 strategy says lots of interesting things, but, under enlargement, by 2020, five new countries will have joined the EU and more likely eight."
"Already in the EU of 2010, 12 countries are net contributors to the EU."
"The other 15 Member States are subsidised."
"None of the new countries are likely to be contributors."
"In 2020, therefore, there are likely to be no less than 23 countries being subsidised."
"By 2020, therefore, the EU will have become, in practice, a transfer union, which transfers money from 12 contributing countries to 23 subsidised countries."
"Unfortunately and unfairly, the UK taxpayer is caught up in this."
"The comparatively impoverished UK is the second largest contributor to the EU budget."
"At the last provincial elections in Germany, the voters of North Rhine-Westphalia said 'no' to their coalition and were also saying 'no' to the transfer union."
"Voters in other contributing countries will also say 'no' in the next 10 years."
"By 2020, the gap will be unbridgeable."
"It is not in the UK's national interest for there to be economic chaos across the channel but, unless enlargement stops forthwith, economic chaos is what there will be."
"The 2020 strategy, therefore, misses the point."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I respectfully wish to ask whether you do not think that there is something incredibly bizarre in what is going on here."
"For an extremely important debate on the financial and economic crisis that is the cause of tragedy among many millions of Europeans, only some 40 people are present."
"We urge European economic operators and citizens to save energy while, for the past three days, but this is also true at every plenary sitting, we can see, if the cameras show it, the waste of energy in lighting a chamber the size of a stadium where no more than 40 people are present except at voting time."
"In the 27 interpreters' booths, there are 27x3, which makes 81 highly qualified simultaneous interpreters, translating for us."
"For 40 MEPs, that makes two interpreters per person."
"Do we not think that it is time to look in the mirror and stop urging pensioners, fire-fighters, nurses and teachers to keep tightening their belts?"
"(PL) In times of crisis, when the integrity of the European Union is under threat, we should, in supporting economic growth, pay particular attention to the cohesion of the Union."
"We still do not know if the crisis will act to deepen the differences between different regions of Europe."
"Historical differences in the level of development of regions may grow, and we may also witness the appearance of new differentiating factors."
"In this situation, what is particularly needed are mechanisms which reduce differences between regions, and continuation of strong regional policy is the way to achieve this objective."
"It would be unwise, in this situation, to give up this policy and reduce significantly the financing available to local and regional authorities, for this would pose a serious threat to the stimulation of economic growth, but would also be a threat to European unity as such."
"Both the Europe 2020 strategy and Cohesion policy aim to achieve the same goal."
"They have a crucial effect on economic revival and huge significance for European solidarity policy."
"However, what is needed is better coordination between them."
"Creating new and separate thematic funds to respond to new challenges would be a waste of time and money, and would also delay realisation of the 2020 strategy and condemn it to the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must ensure the financing of key infrastructure projects and reject the renationalisation of regional policy."
"At the moment, we often hear of strong pressure from governments of certain Member States and also from the European Commission to cut or reduce expenditure on regional policy."
"However, the message of the European Parliament in the report, of which I was shadow rapporteur, is clear."
"We need stronger, not weaker, Cohesion policy."
"We need true European solidarity."
"(EN) Mr President, Mr Grech, I would like to congratulate you on the truly excellent report which you have tabled before us here and which provides us with a basis from which to move forward."
"Thank you also for using a phrase which I myself use all the time, namely that the economy is there for the people and not the other way around."
"That is precisely what the policy of the European Union should be based on."
"In your report, you also quite rightly point out that an adequate assessment of the social, consumer-related, environmental and economic impacts of the internal market, and the decisions we make in the internal market, are of particular importance."
"That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens."
"It is a very important approach to point out the actual humanist and holistic elements of our policy, even when it comes to the internal market."
"In your report, you also state one thing which is particularly important for us Social Democrats, and that is that social policy should be considered as a core of internal market policy and that protecting services of a general economic interest is of particular importance."
"In addition, you call for the development of a strategy for improved communication of the social advantages of the internal market."
"If we consider just these few points, we realise that we could achieve a great deal if only the European Commission gave us its backing."
"I also very much hope that the Commission will genuinely take the opportunity presented by the Grech report to put the progress of EU citizens centre stage."
"I make that plea very strongly and, as we know, Mr Barnier has already agreed to do so."
"If we approach the internal market from that angle, the policy of the European Union will meet with greater acceptance and we will be able to look towards a better future."
"(FR) Mr President, in this debate on the 2020 strategy, I should also like to take advantage of Mr Grech's very interesting report to tell you that I am convinced that consumers must not be left out of this future strategy."
"When I look at the Commission's text on the 2020 strategy, I note that virtually no mention is made of consumers."
"In the current crisis, you must remember that, while investment is, of course, the key variable, consumption in our various countries represents between 60 and 70% of our GDP."
"I would therefore like us to move further in this direction in the 2020 strategy."
"I would love to see Europe pioneer a different type of consumption, one that is based on the knowledge triangle, on sustainable development, a Europe that is capable of developing production conditions and products which are of interest to consumers, which are created with them, a Europe which is focused on quality and no longer on quantity for quantity's sake."
"I would love to see a kind of enhanced competition which does not encourage 'discounting for discounting's sake' but which serves to ensure greater consumer satisfaction."
"Commissioner, my question is therefore very simple."
"Are you going to suggest to President Barroso and within the College of Commissioners that a group be formed to work in this field, so that consumers are no longer considered as adjustment variables, as passive individuals, but rather as active participants who are on your side, on our side, so that we can build this future society that we so desperately need?"
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to take some time to talk about the social and employment aspects of EU 2020 and the Commission's efforts in this connection."
"I am sure it is no secret that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked to have seen a much more ambitious 2020 plan than is currently on the table, with a genuine desire to define how Europe is to support itself in future and with a desire to set high social and employment targets."
"However, right now we have a situation in which the Member States had no intention of developing the plan that the Commission put forward. Instead they are moving backwards."
"Firstly, with regard to combating poverty: many Member States have questioned whether the EU actually has the competence to combat poverty and to set specific poverty targets."
"To this, I would simply say that there is a legal basis for this in numerous places in the new Treaty of Lisbon, for example, in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union and Articles 9 and 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"It is therefore simply a matter of getting started."
"Secondly, other Member States, including my own, Denmark, have criticised the definition of poverty."
"Of course we need to come up with a good definition."
"However, these arguments cannot hide the fact that this is about one thing: whether we actually want to combat poverty in Europe."
"That is what the real debate is about."
"Do we want to reduce the number of poor people in Europe, which currently stands at 84 million?"
"Do we want to reduce the number of poor workers, of which there are nearly 17 million?"
"Do we not only want everyone to have jobs, but to also have good and proper jobs?"
"Do we want young people to have access to the labour market?"
"Yes, of course we do, and that is precisely why we need specific objectives with regard to social matters and in the area of employment."
"Europe is currently in the midst of an economic crisis, but we must not allow it to give us a mental block and make us afraid to set ambitious targets in these areas."
"If we do not have the courage to do this now, it will undermine the economic situation in Europe, as well as our social cohesion."
"Therefore, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to you that it is the political will that will be crucial."
"I hope that Parliament and the Commission will take the lead and urge those Member States that are hesitating to instead commit to a social Europe in 2020."
"I hope that, as Commissioners, you are prepared to do this."
"(CS) We have spent the entire day discussing a desirable strategic focus for the European Union."
"In my opinion, however, we should first have put the question of desirable future development to our citizens and to those it concerns most closely, in other words, mayors and local councillors."
"In this regard, it is a great disappointment to me that the role of local authorities is not sufficiently reflected in the EU 2020 strategy."
"The strategy correctly mentions the need for greater links to regional and local partners, but it is not clear how the principle of partnership should be applied in practice."
"Moreover, the consultation process is voluntary, so it is not in any way binding on the decision making of the Member States."
"I can confirm this with one concrete example."
"When the Federation of Municipalities of the Czech Republic raised comments on the position of our government towards the EU 2020 strategy, not only were these comments not incorporated, but the Federation did not even receive a proper response on how the comments were handled."
"If we want to avoid repeating the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, we must not continue to ignore the voice of local authorities, who form part of public administration in all of the Member States and whose role is key to the fulfilment of any European policy."
"On the contrary, mandatory consultation with the actors 'below' would contribute vital findings on the correct, efficient and effective implementation of adopted measures."
"I would therefore like to call on the Commission to monitor thoroughly the method of linking local authorities in to the whole process."
"(EL) Mr President, the current Lisbon Strategy has simply been renamed Europe 2020 strategy."
"In essence, the Commission's proposals as a whole do not overturn the current objectives, and not only were these objectives not attained, but progress over the last ten years has shown that the standard of living of the citizens of the European Union has slipped."
"Despite this, the proposals tabled by the Commission do not include sufficiently social criteria."
"We therefore ask: what measure does the Commission propose in order to prevent unaccountability of the market, redundancies at will and the extension of insecurity to labour?"
"Does the involvement of the International Monetary Fund not mean more onerous terms for the Member States and people?"
"In our opinion, if the Stability Pact is not replaced by a pact to achieve social objectives, the noose around the people's neck will tighten still more and greater sacrifices will be needed."
"(FI) Mr President, when I was studying at the University of Helsinki in the 1980s, the Soviet Union was still going strong."
"When there were problems there, they called for more socialism."
"Now I am the middleaged father of a family here in the European Union, and when there are problems here, we call for greater integration."
"This philosophy is astonishingly similar and the outcome, too, will be the same: it will not work."
"Let us build on a foundation of nation states."
"For that, we have to bake our bread before we distribute it, as we say in Finland."
"Let us create jobs and the right conditions."
"That will be the source of our strength."
"That is how we will make progress."
"We have a shortage of employers - not a shortage of employees, but of employers, who can provide people with work."
"Small enterprises are crucial."
"We should postpone the debate on the owner drivers' working time directive until the next partsession."
"That is a typical example of a situation where we should be speaking up for independent entrepreneurs, who create jobs, who do good and who employ people."
"There is a danger now, however, that we will lose jobs on account of administrative decisions."
"I really love Europe, even if I do not love the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, in the year of the World Cup, the ladies and gentlemen of the Council could learn a lesson from football and that is that it is not possible to have a good game of football if you have got a referee overseeing each player."
"However, conducting a game without rules, without a referee and without penalising fouls, now that would end in chaos."
"That is precisely the state of affairs right now!"
"It is high time that the Europe 2020 strategy put a stop to hedge fund speculators."
"Those who have made a nice living from speculation and exorbitant interest rates for years should now make a contribution."
"Not small savers, but companies with their high speculative profits should be asked to foot the bill."
"Nor should the Cohesion policy ignore the euro crisis."
"Apart from the current rescue package, Greece has benefited disproportionately in the past from agricultural and regional funding."
"Without the necessary structural changes, this money has clearly seeped away and, despite years of funding, the country has been brought to the brink of ruin."
"I do not see why we should leave the money tap on in such a situation."
"Why do we not listen to Commissioner Rehn who has made the rather reasonable proposal that we cut funding?"
"Finally, we cannot allow the EU to degenerate into a union of transfers."
"A centrally planned economy, which is what some of you would like to see, has not proved its worth yet, even if it comes from Brussels."
"What is needed then?"
"A self-responsible budgetary policy, and if it does not work, courageous and effective sanction mechanisms."
"All of that should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken, in particular, to stabilise the euro area and to avoid the undermining of our single currency."
"The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted."
"However, when it comes to implementing the adopted measures, it should be ensured that Parliament is involved, within the scope of its powers, and can exert its democratic control in appropriate conditions."
"Indeed, we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence, and can regain confidence, in the political institutions."
"Without such confidence, no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible."
"Faced with the financial crisis, Europe has not been inactive."
"We do not say this often enough."
"In 2009, we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies, the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission."
"Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities."
"Last Monday, the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority."
"Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council."
"This agreement must be obtained rapidly, so that our institutions retain their credibility."
"Our fellow citizens often ask us: 'What is Europe doing?'"
"We must meet their expectations."
"In this regard, I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your determination, and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out, in accordance with the undertakings made at your hearing."
"Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support."
"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place."
"This is not a question of bullying the finance sector, but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated, and of making transactions more secure and transparent."
"(HU) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, two great tasks face Europe today: designing a new strategy, which we are currently debating and which I feel is taking shape nicely."
"However, Europe is at a turning point if it does not find a new modus operandi."
"The events of the past weeks with regard to the Greek crisis - and here I would disagree with Mr Gauzès, since unfortunately, the European Union and the Member States, and especially Mrs Merkel, have been late in responding to this situation - mean that Europe is at a turning point."
"This is an extraordinarily dangerous turning point, one that will determine whether we will move in the direction of renationalisation, national withdrawal and egoism, or in the direction of communitarianism."
"If we do not move towards communitarianism, the programme outlined by Mr Barnier will not be implemented and is worthless."
"It is very important that we do not forget, when setting out new objectives, about our previous policy, the Cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy or, if I look at Commissioner Andor, about renewing the European social model."
"We are at a turning point, fellow Members."
"The past few weeks have proven this to be the case: the previous model does not work and the current model does not work properly."
"I am in favour of the Commission monitoring national budgets before they are submitted to the Member States' parliaments."
"(SV) Mr President, my contribution concerns Mr Hoang Ngoc's report on sustainable finances within the public sector."
"It has been a very interesting report to work on. The situation was - and the rapporteur's speech made this clear, too - that, from an ideological point of view, we had quite differing views on this question."
"In this connection, it is important to remember what has happened in Europe in recent weeks, where we have an economic crisis, the like of which we have seldom seen before."
"The crisis is largely due to a failure on the part of Member States to look after their own finances and to keep their own house in order."
"It was therefore perhaps a little surprising that we had such major ideological differences about whether it was actually judicious to borrow and spend as much money as many countries have done in recent years."
"As I say, there were quite major differences on these issues, something that we have also seen in the Chamber."
"Fortunately, a very broad majority in the committee was also of the opinion that there was a need for tougher measures to remedy the situation we find ourselves in."
"The Commission has brought forward very good proposals in recent weeks."
"A start has finally now been made on taking decisions that will actually lead to us getting order back into Europe's economy."
"That is exactly what we need."
"That is why the discussions in the committee were exciting, to say the least."
"It is important to remember that we are not only dealing with our current borrowing, but also with future challenges such as Europe's demographics, its ageing population and so on. This was an important report, and I think we made positive amendments to it."
"I am convinced that the decision this House reaches will be a sound one."
"(NL) The present discussion on this crisis has mainly covered budgetary discipline; and rightly so, as it is important."
"It is not the whole story, though."
"Let us also keep this crisis in the right perspective, which is that we are actually still talking about a banking crisis."
"For many years, the banks made money out of thin air using opaque structures and, in 2008, this bubble burst."
"Countries then transformed that private debt into public debt, and this is the problem Greece is having to contend with now: an unbearable level of public debt."
"In the light of this, when we discuss a 2020 strategy, we must also look at the role of the banks."
"The Commission has a total lack of ambition in this regard."
"Hardly a word has been said about the banks."
"What this crisis has shown is that a clear distinction must be made between savings banks and investment banks."
"Where is the Commission's ambition when it comes to plans for tackling this?"
"That was my first point."
"However, we must also look at the economy of the future."
"The economy of the future will make efficient use of its natural resources."
"Here, too, the Commission has too little ambition."
"Either its objectives are too vague or its targets too low; for example, a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is woefully inadequate to promote green innovation."
"How are companies to get the message that they should invest in green technology?"
"We feel the Commission's plans should cover this, too."
"Finally, with regard to our own budget, this, too, must be in line with our own strategy."
"This means that the Structural Funds must ultimately be used to promote new green technology."
"At the moment, we are mainly subsidising more greenhouse gas emissions."
"Where is the money for innovation, and where are the appropriations for sustainable agriculture in the agricultural budget?"
"We need the Commission to be specific and ambitious rather than producing vague plans; these are not the way to solve this crisis."
"Mr President, the central component of EU 2020 should not be stabilisation funds and bailouts."
"It should be a new strategy that all of our countries should want to follow to re-launch and re-energise the internal market of the EU."
"We need to be looking at how to change our economies so that they are fit for those challenges."
"The only way forward is to look at new industries via research, development and innovation."
"The EU should be encouraging a new economic dynamism in the European research area, creating networks for excellence, research clusters for integrated projects based on innovation in new products and services, looking at new processes and technologies and new business concepts."
"We should be looking at existing successful projects and using EU links to find best practice."
"In my own constituency, I visited Glyndŵr University, which has fostered direct links with hi-tech firms in North Wales, achieving a 90% graduate placement, even last year."
"It has not just improved the job prospects of the young people who attend, but it has revitalised an entire region of North Wales."
"Instead of looking at the billion-dollar projects and silver-bullet solutions, we need to get back to the nuts and bolts of what makes a successful economy."
"South Wales has five significant pharmaceutical development companies with world-class technology."
"With a little EU assistance, this hi-tech company cluster could be elevated to being a world-class centre, lifting an entire economy that currently qualifies for cohesion funds into a brighter future."
"We need solutions to work effectively for our citizens."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will not admit it, but the reality is blatantly obvious: the idea or, at least, the myth of a liberal Europe has run out of steam."
"How can anyone continue to believe in a deepening of its federal dimension when it is getting ready to fleece the most indebted countries to help out the financial markets?"
"Yet liberal Europe's project and activities have also run out of steam, and spectacularly so."
"With the successive crises, the last of which was the deepest of all, public debt has exploded."
"Worse still, however, the credibility of the euro area has gone up in smoke."
"The situation calls for real solidarity."
"However, the Treaty of Maastricht rules out any solidarity between countries in the euro area."
"This is the ultimate European paradox."
"The end of the line for Europe is also apparent in the negotiations at the WTO and in the story regularly sold to us claiming that the EU will protect us from globalisation."
"Far from being our shield and protection, EU directives have frequently stolen a march on the WTO."
"In fact, we are now hugely vulnerable as a result of the EU, and we are now paying the price with the deindustrialisation process and the various forms of relocation."
"For the sake of the peoples, EU policy must be urgently refocused."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 308 billion is the total amount of the funds earmarked for implementing Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013."
"To date, Europe has spent, and judging by the results, wasted, some of these priority funds established by Lisbon."
"For EU 2020 to be a success and for the mountains of cash that remain to be spent to be used to stimulate economic growth and support competition, two types of intervention are needed: simplification and review."
"Simplification will be a key to disentangling access to these resources from paralysing red tape: regions, citizens and businesses want to be able to act more freely to unlock their potential."
"As for review, this is urgently needed in order to change the criteria defining how the funds are allocated, by rethinking the general spirit underlying Cohesion policy."
"Now as never before, our Cohesion policy needs to be able to prove its strength as a multilevel governance tool, by giving a genuine voice to the problems that affect our territory and, in Brussels, formulating its long-awaited response regarding the future of our social and economic model."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the duty of anybody that, like the European Union, is responsible for handling these kinds of sums, to impose stringent supervision of the projects that are supported and to vigorously combat waste."
"This is the only way in which the EU 2020 strategy will succeed in not being a bad copy of a bad original."
"(PT) Mr President, we are facing accelerating global change that has devastating consequences for our economic, political and social systems and, therefore, for all our citizens."
"We are currently witnessing an unprecedented weakening of the capacity of states to respond."
"The European Union must, therefore, identify common causes and allies, and act in a clear and united way on the world stage."
"Extraordinary situations require clear joint action."
"If we do not take the necessary strong measures and collective responsibility, Europe will be consigned to marginalisation and impoverishment."
"Only a strong Europe that respects collective rules will be able to give an adequate response to the new era."
"Weakened and indebted states do not have the capacity to protect their citizens."
"We therefore need to be able to win back the public trust, win the battles on stability, budgetary rigour, job creation, the stability of the monetary union, globalisation, strategic choices."
"We must do this or risk compromising our future."
"The future is won by committing to social cohesion, ensuring peace, constructing a new model based on the values of liberty, social justice and responsibility."
"So, the 2020 strategy and the integrated Europe 2020 guidelines constitute essential elements of a new cycle of growth and employment in Europe."
"In order to correctly implement this and carry it out, clear quantifiable objectives must be set out for employment, education and poverty reduction."
"It is also essential that everything be done to facilitate the Member States' transposition of their national objectives if the strategy is to be successful and correctly implemented."
"(DE) Mr President, the current Cohesion policy started life with the title of the Lisbon Strategy."
"However, I firmly believe that the Cohesion policy can, and will, make an enormous contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, not just because we command a considerable budget in comparison with other European policies but, above all, because the Cohesion policy allows us to have sustainable development in our regions and ensures good monitoring of the restructuring processes and challenges in our regions."
"However, there is one core issue here that I would like to clarify once again, and that goes for our group as well: our Cohesion policy can only work if economic development is considered to be equally as important as social development and providing training for workers."
"In principle, we need to take joint responsibility for the funds that are available to us."
"It is a bit like hardware and software - one cannot work without the other."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Cortés Lastra for his efforts in drafting his report."
"This report emphasises yet again the important contribution made by the Cohesion policy in achieving the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"We must therefore ensure that the Cohesion policy's regional focus is recognised as part of this strategy."
"We are all aware that the strategy's effective implementation will depend hugely on the way it is devised."
"As a result, I believe that local and regional authorities must be involved even in the drafting phase in order to guarantee that really effective results will be achieved later on."
"At the same time, better governance at a number of levels guarantees the effective implementation of the Cohesion policy at national, regional and local level."
"As beneficiaries of these policies, I believe that Member States must maintain the key role which they have in the decision-making process regarding the Cohesion policy within the Council."
"Finally, I wish to welcome the acknowledgement given to the role of the Structural Funds in achieving the strategy's objectives."
"However, I want to draw your attention to the fact, once again, that we must avoid the pitfall of using these funds in future as a means for punishing Member States."
"I believe that such a measure would run completely contrary to the Cohesion policy's real objectives."
"(FR) Mr President, the key word in this 2020 strategy is growth."
"It does not matter whether we choose to call it intelligent, sustainable or inclusive, we are now in the grip of a crisis in Europe that will not come to an end tomorrow."
"The quantified targets for this 2020 strategy - increasing the employment rate, reducing the poverty rate, and so on - are just pious hopes, because they use the same model as the Lisbon Strategy, which failed."
"Europe is faced with a crisis which requires a much more visionary and political project, one with new ideas, which are completely lacking in this 2020 strategy."
"I should like to highlight one such idea."
"Should we not, at long last, set a target for enhancing Europe's cultural diversity, a founding value of the EU, which could provide the raw material, unequalled on any other continent, for the economic development of our Europe, through the use of intangible assets, such as the economy of culture, and of tangible assets, such as our regional specialities?"
"What is more, a strategic vision is being developed that is almost entirely focused on the Member States."
"Yet these States, with their borders, traditional ways of thinking and centralised administrations, continue to preserve Europe in aspic."
"A greater regional dimension is required in the EU's future strategy."
"Macro-regional strategies which reorganise land use policies around the continent's life-sustaining natural basins, which are also its cultural and historic centres - the Baltic Sea, the Western Mediterranean, the Danube, the Alps, the Atlantic Arc, and so on - must also be encouraged."
"This approach is gradually being adopted, for example, in the Baltic Sea, but it has not been taken up in the 2020 strategy, and therefore could very well be nipped in the bud when the funds for its implementation need to be released."
"The 2020 strategy being presented to us is therefore, in our view, characterised by a highly conventional and technocratic approach; it lacks political vision."
"(PL) The EU 2020 strategy is a document intended to establish the direction of the Union's development over the next decade."
"However, if this document is not to share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy, it has to be more realistic and closer to the ambitions of Member States."
"With this in mind, we should appreciate the amendments adopted by Parliament to the Commission's proposal which, in particular, concern strengthening the common market, reducing protectionism, continuing Cohesion policy and supporting agriculture."
"However, and this still needs to be stressed, there is a need to conduct climate policy more fairly, in other words, in a way which does not, by its excessive burdens, mean the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will always be the poor relatives of the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the central concept of European Union strategy is innovation, but we should remember to continue Cohesion policy and support for agriculture, because it is this which makes it possible for the poorer regions to bridge the gap in development."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, an industrial policy that focuses exclusively on companies operating internationally and using advanced technologies is not the best route to success."
"We must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector, including both small-scale manufacturers and retailers."
"Innovation policy should be aimed at them also."
"In particular, this strategy should guarantee conditions that place small and medium-sized enterprises on an equal footing with their competitors outside the EU by adopting safeguard clauses and strong, effective measures to combat the extremely serious problem of counterfeiting, including through effective trade defence instruments."
"It is important that governance of the Europe 2020 strategy should not rest in the hands of the Commission alone, but should be carried out at different levels, including the national and macro-regional levels."
"We need to start formulating a policy and strategy that focus on the local level and the reality of manufacturing on the ground, and I would like to stress here the need for attention to be paid to the manufacturing situation in Padania."
"In other words, we are asking for more attention to be paid to the actual manufacturing situation on the ground, focusing, in particular, on the SME structure, as I said, which is the backbone of manufacturing in every country in Europe and is therefore where the real hope for the future of manufacturing and development of the European Union lies."
"(DA) Mr President, well, our aim was to become 'the most competitive and knowledge-based economy in the world', but that did not happen."
"The challenges facing Europe over the next few years are enormous."
"The problems that we are currently seeing in Greece, and will perhaps also see in a number of other countries before too long, are the result of two things: the lack of competitiveness in Europe and the fact that Europeans have been living beyond our means, in other words, we have spent more money than we have earned and we have spent more money than is supported by our productivity."
"Many economists like to make economics more complicated than it is, but the explanation is quite simple: the markets have simply lost their belief that Europe's debt-ridden countries can compete and live up to their own responsibilities - that is the reason for all this."
"Europe's major problem, as I said, is a lack of competitiveness, and this is the problem that the 2020 strategy is intended to tackle. We must increase our competitiveness in relation to other countries and the Member States must put their economies in order while, at the same time, investing in the future."
"Indeed, it may be necessary to make cuts in what we call welfare services in order to use the money for education and research."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe's economy."
"We therefore need to take them seriously in this strategy."
"They lack capital and they are finding it difficult to borrow money."
"We need to do something about this. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are excluded from public invitations to tender, both in the Member States and, in particular, when it comes to EU tenders, where large undertakings are given priority."
"Finally, I would like to say that administrative burdens are also something that we have to struggle with all the time."
"The administrative rules that we lay down are, of course, a greater burden for small enterprises, which have very few employees."
"Finally, we must help small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the export markets."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are all running a serious risk of focusing purely on the crisis."
"After the action that has been taken in setting up the fund to defend the euro in order to help those countries in difficulties and to stop speculation, discussions in this House have focused heavily on the subjects of renewal and stability, neglecting everything else."
"These are subjects for the Member States."
"We have focused our attention so narrowly that the issues of the finance and banking system and the related problems of oversight and regulation have been put to one side and almost forgotten."
"However, I firmly believe that a sense of perspective is needed in our formulation of policy."
"It is not by accident that the pact was called the 'Stability and Growth Pact'."
"An even more accurate title would have been the 'Stability for Growth Pact'."
"We need to start talking about growth and development again."
"This is the best way to stop speculation and to give genuine investors confidence instead."
"Without proposals relating to growth - I am thinking about the fiscal uniformity that Mr Monti has been talking about; investment resources; making eurobonds available and cohesion instruments, as cohesion is a very important factor for competitiveness - it will be hard to create this positive climate, particularly at the moment."
"(SV) Mr President, recent times have shown us the importance of healthy government finances."
"It is therefore curious, to say the least, for the rapporteur, Mr Hoang Ngoc, to want to tone down - and even remove - strict requirements for the Stability and Growth Pact to be followed."
"The truth is, on the contrary, that it is essential for the EU now to focus on getting its run-away debt under control."
"Otherwise, the future could be even more terrifying."
"I was a member of the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag, during the 1990s and I was on the Finances Committee when our public finances collapsed."
"I am not particularly proud of this, but it is true: for a period, we had interest rates of 500%!"
"They were heading towards 2 000%, which meant we were well on the way to banana republic status, but even the 500% rates were not enough - our currency crashed and George Soros won."
"Hard times lay ahead for the Swedish people, but, Mr Hoang Ngoc, we learnt one thing, and that was to keep our finances in order."
"The same applies to Europe - good order provides stability and growth."
"(EL) Europe still faces a multi-dimensional crisis today, which is hitting employment and low incomes particularly hard."
"When the European Union started, poverty only existed where there was no work."
"Today, 9.6% of Europeans are unemployed and 8% of workers are living on incomes below the poverty line."
"What are the prospects for 2020?"
"This combination of unemployment and poverty is exacerbated by the pressure created by the ease with which redundancies can be made."
"At European level, there is no protection against redundancy and national legislation is being watered down, as in Greece."
"All this is happening in the Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"We therefore need a minimum framework of disincentives for redundancy."
"Proposals have been made."
"The starting point is to recognise mass redundancies by companies which report a profit in the same country as an abusive practice."
"The logical consequence is for them to be excluded from European subsidies and to be subject to higher taxes and fines and to have to refund financing."
"The question is: is the corporate responsibility of companies included in their obligation to function as part of society or do they consider it acceptable to behave as competitors of the workers?"
"Mr President, I welcome many of the aims of the EU 2020 strategy: the focus on growth led by innovative businesses, on sustainable growth and on achieving high employment."
"However, to achieve this, the EU must not just talk the talk: we need to walk the walk."
"For example, when undertaking the essential reforms of financial services, we must remember that innovative businesses and those employers need access to capital in global markets."
"Our Member States also need to access those global capital markets and, whilst all eyes are focused on the European Stabilisation Fund, and whether it has achieved any current reduction in the immediate volatility, fundamentally, long-term confidence will only be achieved if, as well as this ambitious growth, our deficits are brought under control and public finances themselves are seen to be sustainable."
"Mr President, I believe that today's debate has shown and proved that Parliament can and should make a significant contribution to the development of the strategy."
"Because of my remit, I would like to thank Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Cortés Lastra, in particular, for their reports."
"I thank also all those who have been intensively involved in this work because they will have a major say in the shaping of regional policy and because both reports have shown how important it is to consider all regions in Europe and that regional policy can and must be a policy for all regions, and that in future, it should be."
"Both reports ultimately stress the positive impact of this measure."
"I would like to thank Mr Cortés Lastra, in particular, for this significant contribution and for pointing out what the Lisbon Strategy ultimately did deliver, despite all the criticism."
"It was, after all, not just the idea, but the subsequent implementation of the concept of earmarking that has made a significant impact here, especially in the fields of innovation and research."
"Mrs Schroeder might consider this a bitter pill, but obviously you need to set a target."
"However, the regions that have local structures and individual project developers have had, and will have in future, the possibility of carrying out individual projects and achieving objectives under one general umbrella."
"Of course, we need points of emphasis and we need to set priorities, and that is the idea behind earmarking."
"However, we can achieve a great deal by using a bottom-up and a top-down approach at the same time."
"In addition, the strategic report I recently presented on the reports of the 27 Member States concerning the state of implementation hitherto of the current programming period shows how sustainable and sensible earmarking actually has been, because EUR 63 billion of the EUR 93 billion allocated so far has been spent on Lisbon objectives, that is, for research, innovation, investment in training and, finally, on transport and infrastructure, in the broadest sense of those terms, as well."
"Regional policy - and this was shown very clearly by the van Nistelrooij report - is a driving force behind innovation which is able to move things forward and to make and keep European society more globally competitive."
"It has been demonstrated that out of the more than 450 operational programmes, only 246 are focusing on research and innovation."
"This quite clearly shows that points of emphasis, such as research and development, are necessary and that that must remain the case."
"For this reason, it was obvious in the current programming period that we should allocate just EUR 86 billion for this area, which is three times more than in the 2000-2006 period."
"However, we need to ensure better coordination of course, especially in the areas of research and innovation."
"There is no conflict between excellence, on the one hand, and a broad geographic spread, on the other."
"It must be our objective to promote brain circulation, not brain drain from some or many regions into a few."
"On the contrary, we need to ensure circulation of knowledge and of the people involved, particularly when it comes to research, innovation and development."
"One of the major objectives should be, especially if we consider the next programming period, making a transition from a merely performance-based approach, which is to say, proper financial management, to a stronger result-targeted approach and perspective."
"That must be one of EU 2020's major steps forward in comparison with Lisbon, one which really enables us to break down European objectives into national, regional and, ultimately, local objectives and thereby make the strategies tangible, visible and comprehensible."
"One final comment: my understanding of regional policy is that it is investment policy, and by that I mean investment in all regions."
"Finally, all regions can benefit from successful investments made in individual regions because, we have to keep remembering that two thirds of the European exports of each individual Member State are destined for the European Union, to the 26 other countries."
"That means that if these countries are doing well, the 27th Member State will do well too."
"That must be one of our objectives."
"If today we also talk about how to tackle the crisis, then restructuring the budget cannot be our only concern, because growth constitutes a very important factor as well."
"That alone will provide our successful exit from the crisis in the long term and regional policy can make a significant contribution to that."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, there are five plus two questions put forward concerning economic governance and Europe 2020."
"I will do my best to answer in five minutes, and in order to do that, I will use English as opposed to my native language."
"Honourable Members, the first question is on how the Commission intends to strengthen the monitoring of the broad economic policy guidelines and how the Commission intends to ensure an active role of the national parliaments and the European Parliament in the multilateral surveillance process."
"In reply to this first question, I would like to refer to the Commission communication on Europe 2020, in which the Commission proposes that the European Parliament should play an important role, not only in its capacity as a colegislator, but also as a driving force for mobilising citizens and the national parliaments."
"The Commission also emphasises the importance of establishing a permanent dialogue between various levels of government, including national, regional and local authorities and national parliaments, as well as social partners and representatives of civil society."
"The second question concerns the Stability and Growth Pact and the additional instruments the Commission may foresee to complement this pact."
"Here, I would like to refer to our communication on reinforcing economic policy coordination, which we adopted last week."
"In this communication the Commission set out proposals on reinforcing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and deeper fiscal policy coordination."
"Specifically, the Commission intends to make budgetary surveillance and policy coordination more forward-looking."
"In the euro area in particular, a more far-reaching approach to the assessment of budgetary policies seems justified, including a more pervasive review of the weaknesses of national budgetary plans ahead of their adoption."
"Furthermore, in order to provide the right incentives for Member States to tackle fiscal imbalances, the functioning of the excessive deficit procedure could be improved by speeding up the individual procedures, in particular, with regard to Member States in repeated breach of the pact."
"The Commission also proposes to reinforce the macro-economic prevention framework for euro area Member States by establishing a permanent crisis resolution framework."
"Under the proposed mechanism, the EU would be able to issue debt to finance emergency loans to a euro area member in distress."
"The third question concerns the differences between two Commission papers: on the one hand, the communication on public finances in the EMU 2006 of June 2006 and, on the other hand, the 2008 EMU 10 report."
"The policy recommendations that we made in 2006 focused on the changes brought about by the reform of the Pact in 2005."
"The 2008 EMU 10 report is consistent with what was written at the time, for instance, on the relevance of long-term sustainability, on the need to set incentives in good times and on the positive role of national fiscal frameworks."
"At the same time, the lessons of more than 10 years of EMU and the recent impact of the crisis call for an updated but still consistent assessment."
"Last week's communication on reinforcing economic policy coordination focuses on making the pact more rigorous with regard to both its preventive and corrective arm."
"It also makes detailed proposals against the background of the new opportunities provided by the Lisbon Treaty."
"We propose reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact framework, both in its preventive and corrective dimensions; broadening the surveillance of macro-economic imbalances and competitiveness trends within the euro area; introducing a 'European semester' to strengthen ex ante integrated economic policy coordination; and, finally, working towards a robust and permanent crisis resolution mechanism for euro area Member States in fiscal distress."
"The fourth question refers to the task force established by the European Council in March 2010 in order to improve economic governance in the Union."
"The Commission will cooperate constructively in the interest of the Union and in full respect of its right of initiative."
"Last week's communication already constitutes a significant contribution to the task force."
"The European Parliament, in this context, is obviously a very important stakeholder in the EU economic governance reform."
"Through its work and reports in the relevant committees - economic crisis committees in particular - Parliament is already providing valuable contributions to the deliberations of the task force."
"The fifth and final question is about the trust that needs to be rebuilt in European banks and financial markets and in the European project in general."
"I will just sum this up very quickly, because it is a broad subject."
"I think there are three important issues to be underlined here: first, the importance of financial regulation to create a much safer financial system; second, to make the fiscal stability rules very clear, transparent and understandable for all; and, third, to restore the growth potential of Europe."
"That is why Europe 2020 plays an important role in this context as well."
"So these elements, in my view, are equally important in restoring trust in the European project."
"This leads me to the two questions on the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In line with the conclusions of the Spring European Council, in particular, as regards the headline targets for the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission has started working with the Member States on setting national targets to underpin the headline targets."
"To facilitate this work, the Employment Committee Indicators Group has produced two alternative technical approaches that show what each Member State would need to do to ensure the EU meets the 75% target in terms of employment levels."
"During the last week of April and the first week of May, the Commission and the Presidency held a round of bilateral discussions to exchange initial ideas on potential national targets for the strategy."
"These discussions were very fruitful and allowed us to gain a first idea of where Member States stand and to understand the very peculiar economic circumstances that are a feature of each Member State."
"The bilateral meetings showed that most Member States strongly supported the headline targets and were ready to set ambitious national targets to meet the headline targets set by the Spring Council."
"Basing itself on the overall outcome of these meetings, the Commission will compile the results, which will then serve as an input for the various Council configurations in May and June."
"If there are discrepancies between the EU target and the sum of the national targets, we intend to continue the discussion with the Member States to see how national or EU-level action could bring the EU closer to the targets."
"The European Council has said that it will review the headline target in June on the basis of further work."
"There is particular interest in an explanation on the poverty target, if you will allow me."
"The Spring Council asked the Commission to help the Member States to identify suitable indicators underpinning the EU headline target for social inclusion, in particular, through poverty reduction."
"After hearing the concerns of the various Member States, the Commission has presented a possible compromise proposal."
"The proposal is based on three main EU poverty indicators, namely: at risk of poverty; material deprivation; and the number of jobless households."
"Together, they reflect the multifaceted nature of poverty and the range of situations in the Member States."
"While a number of delegations have expressed support for the Commission proposal within the Social Protection Committee, some insist on including a labour market dimension in the EU target set."
"The Commission is actively exploring the possible solutions."
"On governance, I wish to reassure you that we set great store by your role in the new strategy and by your input."
"President Barroso has made it clear that involving Parliament more closely in Europe 2020 is one of his main concerns for his second term."
"We are doing our best to make sure that Parliament has enough time to come to an opinion this year."
"I am personally fully committed to helping you in the process in every possible way."
"We need to have all the main EU institutions on board if the political ownership needed is to be there and the strategy is to succeed."
"Concerning education and training, which is the subject of the second question on Europe 2020, I would just like to say the following."
"As early as the crisis recovery plan of November 2008, the Commission called on Member States to retain investment in education and training, and we will maintain this focus."
"In general, Member States have responded positively to the call to target the recovery measures at smart investment in resources of future growth."
"Many governments have neither reduced student support nor scaled back enrolment."
"On the contrary, many recovery packages have included measures to support wider participation in education, particularly in higher education."
"In spite of the crisis, education budgets announced for 2010 have remained constant or increased in many Member States."
"However, we do see signs of planned decreases in the education budgets of other countries."
"We should bear in mind that some governments had already planned - and in some cases executed - general cuts in public budgets before the onset of the crisis."
"Many such cuts would affect education."
"Other Member States are exploring ways to diversify the sources of funding."
"The Commission will continue to watch this issue carefully."
"In some countries, financial constraints will only appear now."
"We will monitor general state budgets as well as the efficiency of investment."
"At European level and within the existing multiannual financial framework, the Commission intends to prioritise action supporting the Europe 2020 objectives."
"Boosting economic recovery, investing in Europe's youth and building tomorrow's infrastructure are the priorities of the 2011 draft budget that the Commission recently adopted."
"Support for the 'Youth on the Move' flagship initiative means strengthening the 'lifelong learning' and 'youth in action' programmes as well as the 'Marie Curie' and 'Erasmus for Entrepreneurs' actions."
"Let us not forget that we also intervene in this area through the Structural Funds."
"The European Social Fund, with a budget of EUR 76 billion over the 2007-2013 period, helps young people move from education to the world of work."
"It also helps people to return to education to renew and expand their skills."
"Around one third of the beneficiaries of the European Social Fund are young people."
"The Fund also allocates EUR 8.3 billion, which represents roughly 11% of its overall budget, to the reform of Member States' education and training systems."
"All of this demonstrates that the Europe 2020 strategy reinforces the concept of the knowledge-based economy and that education and training are at the heart of this."
"We will make sure that we have the resources to reach our targets."
"(MT) It is worrying that the economic crisis is going to give rise to long-term repercussions."
"As the population age increases, so will the Member States' challenge in guaranteeing sustainability in the area of social welfare."
"While I can understand that public spending needs to be diversified in order for Europe to fulfil its 2020 vision, I also believe that this spending needs to form part of national fiscal policy."
"The drop in birth rates and an ever-increasing ageing population call for a change in policy if we are to guarantee fiscal sustainability."
"In addition, the rise in pension demands and medical assistance must be kept in mind."
"With regard to demographic change patterns, the European Union needs a motivational strategy for senior citizens in order to keep them in employment for a longer period of time."
"It is essential that we consider such strategies in light of the specific requirements among the various Member States."
"We cannot employ a one-size-fits-all policy."
"Each case merits individual attention."
"Consequently, it is fundamental that there are more employed persons on the labour market, and that we increase opportunities for high level employment."
"This will not only reduce the dependency on social services but will also ensure a higher number of contributors to these schemes."
"On the subject of jobs and training, it is essential that the European Union focuses on active and inclusive employment, that is to say, exploiting the full potential of all those who can work, especially women, to promote the integration of those most alienated by the world of work and to supply them with all the necessary tools to help them succeed."
"Mr Commissioner, after having been in our respective posts for some weeks now, it is time to roll up our sleeves and get to work so that these objectives are reached, which will increase employment within the European Union."
"(DA) Mr President, every day, thousands of jobs are lost in Europe, and the Europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the EU's answer to future challenges in this regard and to how we can maintain and strengthen our competitiveness so that we can create growth and more jobs."
"We need to choose the route we are going to take: whether we will compete on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions or whether we will compete on the basis of knowledge and skills, quality green jobs and decent conditions in the labour market."
"In this regard, it is a little worrying to see the Commission's unbalanced focus on flexibility in the flexicurity model."
"That will not achieve anything."
"People need to be safe and secure in order to be flexible."
"There needs to be some form of support that people can live on if they lose their jobs."
"Further training needs to be provided so that people can move around the labour market to the best job opportunities."
"Investments are needed in the Member States, but they must be investments that pay off in the long term."
"The Commission must do more to address social dumping."
"Anyone moving from one country to another for a job should work under the conditions applicable in their new country."
"The Commission must ensure that everyone is covered by the rules on migrant workers - by the rules applying at EU level - and the rules of the internal market must not take precedence over the rules governing workers' rights."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that the debate this afternoon reflects Parliament's willingness, indeed insistence, on being fully engaged in this process."
"Given my limited time, I would just like to make three brief points."
"I support Commissioner Rehn's statement - and indeed Commissioner Andor's statement today - in regard to the scrutiny of Member State's budgets."
"At one point, it looked like the eurozone and the EU might not make it to 2020 as an entity."
"So to ensure that not only do we survive but thrive, it is crucial that Member States deliver on commitments and promises already made."
"Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted has always been a useless exercise."
"Secondly, for the past 18 months, Member States and the EU have focused almost exclusively on the stabilisation of financial institutions."
"In fact, we have been consumed by it."
"While this is important, very many citizens have lost trust and are now feeling abandoned."
"They are looking for support from Member States and they are looking to the EU to put in place a framework that is conducive to job creation, to entrepreneurship and to the support of SMEs, but crucially, that framework must link growth in the economy with the creation of decent jobs and an improvement in the well-being of all citizens, especially those below the poverty line."
"Finally, there is a major crisis in youth unemployment."
"A Commission document issued yesterday confirmed that youth unemployment in the EU stands at 20%, which is twice that forecast for overall unemployment."
"This crisis is every bit as real and as immediate as the economic crisis and, while I heard the Commissioner's comments on youth initiatives and I welcome them, there must be real coordination between, and strong influence on, Member States to translate those initiatives into concrete jobs."
"(PL) The 2020 strategy contains ambitious objectives with which it is difficult to argue, but the objectives are defined as if the European Union were already wealthy, free from worries and thinking only about building a successful future."
"Meanwhile, we know there are many things to worry about and, above all, there are many differences between the level of development of the rich and poor countries and regions of Europe."
"I note with astonishment that among the priorities of the strategy, there is no place for the development of agriculture, while we know, after all, that by 2050, the world has to increase its production of food by 70%, because there are more and more people in the world, and less and less land is being used for agricultural production."
"It is difficult to understand why the development of agriculture is not being treated as a priority in the strategy."
"Agriculture means food security, agriculture means ecological security, and these things are so important for us and for future generations."
"I cannot imagine a responsible development strategy for the European Union which does not include concern for the development of European agriculture."
"(EL) Mr President, before speaking about the 2020 strategy, an answer is needed, I believe, to certain points made earlier by one or two members about the position of the Greek centre-right party on the support mechanism for the Greek economy."
"We need to clarify certain points."
"Our party has never opposed the European support mechanism for Greece."
"Our party simply had a perception of the measures that should have been applied."
"The measures which are now being applied will certainly cause a deep recession and stagflation and the government decided on these measures itself, without any prior information or agreement with the other political parties in Greece and Greek society."
"The majority in government refused any prior agreement which might have resulted in broad and necessary political and social assent."
"I repeat, the New Democracy party did not oppose the European support mechanism of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund."
"We respect our partners' every last euro and we thank them for their support."
"That is why we responsibly supported a different, more effective policy mix."
"We support the need for strict financial discipline and a growth policy, so that Greece can break out of the vicious circle of deep recession and galloping inflation, with disastrous consequences for Greek society and the economy and, ultimately, a negative impact on Europe."
"As regards our debate on the economic crisis and the 2020 strategy, I believe that the time has come for specific acts and tangible results."
"Enough talk."
"That is the point of my speech."
"Keep it simple."
"The euro is an historic success of European integration and we should defend and rescue it."
"That is why we need strong financial and economic governance because, without this 2020 strategy, it is at risk of failure and of following the precedent set by the Lisbon Strategy."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Mr Koumoutsakos, you do have some cheek!"
"I have just heard you talk about the Greek Government and how it did not bother to consult you, the various parties or civil society before implementing the measures."
"Although, I must say that the current Greek Government is not in any way responsible for the situation."
"It is a victim of speculators, who I will be criticising in a few moments, when I speak."
"Yet it is also my duty to highlight the responsibility of the previous government, which massaged the figures over many years, and the fact that your party was in power for at least two parliamentary terms."
"I therefore think that responsibility rests more with Greece and that political responsibility rests with your party."
"Do you have a reply to this question, Mr Koumoutsakos?"
"(EL) Sir, your speech is the result of poor information."
"The previous Greek Government took over an economy deeply in debt, very deeply in debt, an economy on rotten foundations, and these problems, chronic problems, deeply rooted over 30 years, were highlighted and dramatised by the huge international economic crisis."
"Of course, mistakes were made by the previous government, but much bigger mistakes have been made, either due to weakness or due to a lack of courage, by the present government, which was at least five months late taking the measures needed to contain the situation, and thus the deficit crisis, which exists in every country, as you know full well, became a borrowing crisis."
"That is how we arrived at today's drastic situation."
"This is the answer which I am giving you with a view to our engaging in self-criticism; but this is where the ancient saying 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone' applies."
"(MT) Mr President, never more than today has the importance of long-term sustainability of public finances been pushed to the forefront in such a dramatic manner."
"It is easy and natural to say 'we warned you not to let your deficits and debts spiral out of control' and we have every reason to."
"However, now that many Member States of the European Union, including those in the euro area, have come to this unsustainable situation, we cannot simply reverse the situation and try to do so in as short a time as possible while ignoring the serious economic environment we find ourselves in."
"This is not an appeal to postpone our actions in the field of public finances."
"I am not implying anything of the sort."
"However, to demand the implementation of austerity programmes unscrupulously within European Union countries would mean condemning the entire European region to a long period of slow economic growth, if not worse."
"We cannot afford to curb demand, even in countries which boast surpluses, both on an internal and external level, and which have the means to spend more and not less."
"We must help the weaker European Union countries to stimulate their economies through exports and therefore help to stimulate job growth prospects."
"Let us not be dogmatic."
"This situation requires that we act intelligently."
"It also necessitates an element of flexibility in many sectors, not least in economic policy."
"Mr President, we have quite rightly heard a lot about economic recovery in the Commission's proposal for the EU 2020 strategy but not enough, in my opinion, about poverty, and that is why I was delighted that you mentioned poverty reduction in your speech."
"We have to remember that the most vulnerable in society suffer in any economic recession more than anyone else, and that is why we have to put in place mechanisms to protect them."
"For instance, I would like to see a target of a 25% reduction of EU citizens living in poverty, as well as ensuring that those who are currently excluded from the labour market can gain access to good-quality work, and that, at the same time, we have targets to eradicate undeclared work."
"We must also make sure that Member States invest in social security and social protection systems as well as guaranteeing access to rights, resources and universal services."
"I would also like to see an EU-wide target to end street homelessness by 2015 by Member States, and to develop integrated homelessness strategies."
"In all these areas, not only should Parliament be consulted more - and I was pleased that you did mention that - but NGOs working in the field as well."
"As far as the open method of coordination is concerned in the social field, it needs to be strengthened."
"We all know it has not worked as well as it could have done, but I believe it can work well in the future if the right mechanisms are put into place - but only if those mechanisms are put into place."
"(PL) The strategy is being adopted at the worst possible moment, when industrial production in Europe has fallen to the level of the 1990s and the gross domestic product of the European Union fell last year by 4%."
"However, it is not the timing which is worst here."
"The worst thing is that as many as four of the five priorities which have been presented to us as the main draught horses of European development are hard to treat as European measures, specifically employment, research and development, education and combating poverty."
"Basically, there is nothing supranational about these issues."
"They are matters for which individual countries are responsible."
"It can be said that only climate policy is an area in which we can take a certain amount of action at European level."
"The others, quite frankly, are matters for individual Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, the 2020 strategy ought to incorporate opinions on the economic crisis and propose a new form of governance rather than try to mend the current failing system."
"First of all, let us get rid of some false ideas, particularly those concerning Greece."
"This is not a Greek crisis."
"Greece and its population are the victims today of a predatory economic and financial system, a system which has seen the G20 countries fork out, all in all, several thousands of billions of dollars in a few days in order to save the banks, but which leaves Greece in agony for several months."
"International summits are now ignored; what will be, will be."
"Finally, finance was going to be regulated and Europe had its endless discussions, but the vultures have not gone away."
"So now what is everybody saying?"
"That the market must be reassured."
"Who is the market, though?"
"Speculators, whom we must appease as if they were demigods and to whom we must make offerings so that we can beg them for mercy."
"How much longer do people have to endure this cynical approach?"
"How much longer do we have to live under the illusion of a market which gives financiers more than they deserve but which impoverishes the people?"
"We cannot allow the terrorism of financial markets to bring whole countries to their knees."
"A counterfeiter runs a huge risk because he is attacking an element of a State's sovereignty: its currency."
"However, when a trader speculates on a country's debt, he does not risk a thing."
"When will the white-collar criminals of high finance be properly punished?"
"Speculators who greedily feed off the public should be outlawed; the casino banks that gamble with the lives and futures of citizens should be abolished; and the EU should be required to properly supervise financial markets, rather than attack public services."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to finish, I think that they have been playing this joke on us long enough."
"We can hold an extraordinary summit every Friday and release billions, but if we do not tackle the roots of the wrongdoing, one of these Fridays, we will end up announcing that the EU is bankrupt."
"(BG) Mr President, the European Cohesion policy has demonstrated its vital role over the years and has become a key policy for the Community."
"It provides European citizens with a visible, quantifiable indicator of solidarity."
"Its role is also recognised through its inclusion among the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"All of this earns its rightful place in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In the draft strategy, this policy was not given its necessary place."
"This is why I highly rate the report on including the Cohesion policy among the objectives to be achieved by the Treaty of Lisbon and the 2020 strategy, which provides invaluable guidelines."
"We also need a strong Cohesion policy at the moment when the economic crisis is reducing the number of jobs and weakening our competitiveness and in the future too, so that we can confirm the European Union as being a strong global player."
"Reliable benchmarks are needed for indicating the effectiveness and efficiency of the resources invested in this policy."
"As it states in the report, an assessment is required of the impact of the Cohesion policy's expenditure on regional development, based on specific indicators."
"In order to determine evaluation indicators, the Commission should consider and propose a clear definition of the concept of 'territorial cohesion' because this is precisely what appears in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Objective, precise evaluation criteria can only be established after considering the definition of the actual concept."
"This will provide a concrete basis for the policy, as well as for institutions and citizens."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteurs for their outstanding work and to thank the Commissioners for their significant, valuable reflections."
"A few years ago, a good friend and mentor told me that throughout life, you will always come up against situations where you are either part of the problem or part of the solution."
"In my view, the EU 2020 strategy is, at the moment, still much more a part of the problem than of the solution."
"I believe that it is our shared responsibility to make this strategy much more a part of the solution."
"Allow me to stop for a moment and ask you kindly to consider that the strategy's very name is problematic."
"In the vast majority of the European Union's languages, the name EU 2020 strategy has no meaning whatsoever."
"It is hard to imagine that a community of more than 500 million citizens could identify with a strategy, based on a notion providing a recipe for resolving the problems in their personal lives whose name is so intangible and distant from the realities of their personal lives."
"This name may be very meaningful when discussed by marketing specialists."
"However, we are not talking about marketing specialists here, but about ordinary Europeans."
"There is another wise Hungarian saying: he who grabs a lot takes little."
"The best thing would perhaps be for it to deal with the most important question."
"In this regard, let me point out that, in my view, what we need to do is to strengthen regional development. Strengthening regional development involves investment, growth and job creation, and I think that the most serious problem facing people today is that they need jobs and more jobs."
"These are the points I wish to offer for your consideration."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the European Union 2020 strategy effectively marks the end of the previous Lisbon Strategy phase and it will have to tackle the negative structural effects that the financial, economic and social crisis has produced and is continuing to produce."
"I believe that if the 2020 strategy is to be effective, it must focus on two key aspects, the first being a system for evaluating progress which factors in the use of the carrot and stick mechanism; the second being a vigorous policy of investing in infrastructure, in addition, of course, to tools for regulating the financial system and policies aimed at restoring social dialogue and cohesion."
"Infrastructures are the cornerstone of the relaunch of innovation policy in industry, SMEs, manufacturing consortiums or research institutes and in the relationship between these and universities and local institutions."
"The van Nistelrooij report should therefore be warmly welcomed since, in addition to providing an in-depth picture of the work that has been done to date in the Member States, it starts to deal with the question of criteria for harmonisation of financial instruments and operational plans aimed at innovation."
"The harmonisation of rules, procedures and administrative practices for the management of EU projects and the simplification and streamlining of procedures are the solutions that the stakeholders on the ground and citizens have been asking us for for a long time."
"I believe that on this point, Europe can and must do much to promote growth, development and employment."
"Mr President, as we seek to solve the financial and economic crisis, I would like to point out an essential deficit: that of knowledge."
"I regret to say that Europe is becoming a more stupid continent every day, even though knowledge is our most fruitful and rich resource."
"Investing in it bears no risk."
"The young generation of Europeans pays the price of the crisis, however, as youth unemployment grows and education and innovation budgets are frozen or cut."
"We have to cut budgets, but let us do so with a 21st century attitude, because where is half of the EU budget going now?"
"To agriculture!"
"It should go to the young generation, and their development."
"Not just a traditional education but one that focuses on e-skills and entrepreneurship for example."
"We know that the higher one's education is, the lower the chances of losing a job."
"Yet Member States are not meeting the necessary commitment in fostering an ambitious knowledge economy."
"Europe thus punishes the next generation of Europeans by not allowing them to develop their talents and ambitions to their full capacity, and it allows China, India and the United States to become more attractive places for talent, research, creativity and innovation."
"Short-term measures will have a high long-term cost."
"Entrepreneurship, excellence and a sustainable future of the European economy can only be fostered if we are willing to invest in knowledge, because whoever thinks knowledge is expensive does not know what stupidity costs."
"Today, Commissioner Kroes presented her vision for Europe's digital agenda, one of the EU 2020 flagship programmes."
"It is an ambitious yet concrete strategy which seeks to make Europe's digital market stronger in a global economy as well as connecting many Europeans to an open Internet."
"I believe we need to take more smart decisions now and make sure the current crisis does not become a mortgage to the youth and the young generation charging an interest that they can never pay back."
"Does the Commission support a coordinated approach, moving away from the intergovernmental procedure in decision making and giving a stronger role to the Commission and Parliament to ensure that Member States fulfil their commitments?"
"(DE) Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy did not have any sustainable success."
"Why not?"
"Member States, social partners and large parts of civil society were too little involved and so they had no sense of shared responsibility."
"The EU 2020 strategy can be different."
"It could be a success, Commissioner, if it also deals with those who are excluded, who are losing out and who often do not have a lobby."
"In the EU, not even two thirds of those who are capable of work are in work."
"Only just under a half of all older workers have a job."
"Eighty million Europeans are insufficiently qualified and have increasingly fewer opportunities in the labour market."
"This is a situation we cannot accept."
"However, a genuine future strategy needs a social orientation."
"Qualitative growth in the economy and employment on the one hand must be reconciled with social equality and with sustainability."
"Commissioner Andor, we are both working on that."
"What does this mean in concrete terms?"
"The social security systems of Member States must be adapted to democratic change."
"Through exchange of best practice throughout Europe, we could make our contribution to that and we could learn from and with each other."
"The European Social Fund - one of your hobby horses - must be adapted to the new challenges, so that we can be even more efficient on the ground."
"The European Globalisation Fund is so constructed that those at risk of unemployment are able to find their feet."
"Our society must be integrative and integrate young people, for example, through appropriate education and training, so that they can develop professionally and personally."
"Despite all the necessary consolidation of national budgets - which is exactly what we are going through and debated this morning - there is one thing we must not seek to save money on: investment in our citizens - in economic, sustainable and social terms."
"The EU 2020 strategy will rise and fall with these three pillars."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Mann, I hope you are in regular contact with your Chancellor, if you see things in the same way that I do."
"The EU 2020 strategy is a real opportunity to make Europe more social and we need that opportunity at this very moment when many hostile words are directed at Europe and when it has distanced itself from the people."
"We absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation."
"When it comes to growth and employment, we should stop putting people's interests behind those of business."
"Indeed, that must be the key objective of the EU 2020 strategy because Europe needs social progress."
"I already pointed that out last Monday at the committee debate on employment policy guidelines: we must not lose sight of the goal of full employment, but we cannot have full employment at all costs because we need good jobs."
"We always say we need jobs, but what matters to me is that these jobs are good, that there is social security, that people do not have to receive subsidies and that they can actually make a living from these jobs."
"The ever more precarious nature of working life, the increasing income inequality and also growing poverty - which many speakers have talked about today - must finally be brought to an end with the EU 2020 strategy."
"We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas."
"Finally, people expect more specific answers, very specific answers, in fact, and not an umpteenth strategy!"
"(PL) The economic crisis which has hit our continent has focused our attention - and rightly so - on rescuing the economies of Member States and building a common European mechanism to give protection against economic collapse."
"It is understandable that, today, the attention of Europeans is focused on increasing the speed of development and on job creation, but we cannot, when building a strategy for the European Union, restrict ourselves for many years just to economic debate."
"The European Union must not behave as if it were only an efficient businessman who is building the economic success of his firm."
"The Europe 2020 strategy should contain significant reference to the role of culture in achieving the social and economic objectives which have been set."
"After all, these priorities are going to influence distribution of the future budget, so we should maintain the possibility of financing such areas as development of cultural infrastructure and protection of cultural heritage as part of the European Regional Development Fund."
"In the European Union's 2020 strategy, we should emphasise the significant influence of culture on social and economic development in the Union, for after all, it is intellectual capital and the creative industries which have brought Europe renown."
"It is this sector in which we can build competitiveness in relation to other parts of the world."
"Creativity requires stimulation and development from the earliest years of life."
"Only then will we be able to count on its turning to a significant degree into innovation, including in fields of modern technology, in the European Union."
"Culture must not be neglected in European policy."
"We must not dismiss all proposals to increase its role in European Union policy simply by saying that it is a competence of the Member States."
"Europe, today, is proud of projects such as the European Capital of Culture, but this is a project which was created by European cities, and it is these cities which bear the main burden of this spectacular programme."
"I expect, therefore, greater determination from the European Commission to ensure that the final version of the 2020 strategy includes culture."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years since the introduction of the Lisbon Strategy and on the eve of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the middle of a full economic, social and employment crisis, we know that we cannot come out of this crisis, nor lay the foundations for new and sustainable growth and a new social cohesion, as you have said, unless we strengthen the mechanisms and instruments that the European Union has at its disposal to sustain investment in the knowledge triangle: education, training and research."
"Just now, Commissioner, you confirmed that as regards this objective, some European governments are performing well, others a little less so."
"In order not to fall within the limits revealed by the Lisbon Strategy, I believe that in this area, the Commission has to strengthen the open method of coordination with Member States, provide incentives and penalties in the European Social Fund and monitor the results."
"I do not consider it to be consistent for governments, as the Italian Government has done, to cut EUR 8 billion in three years from education and the universities, without reinvesting the savings in these areas, especially as we have a 19% early school leaving rate and 25% youth unemployment."
"In conclusion, do you not consider it opportune to strengthen the legal powers in Directive 2005/36/EC to facilitate the mutual recognition of professional qualifications among Member States?"
"According to Professor Monti's report, currently, less than 3% of European workers in fact work in another Member State, and one of the reasons seems to be precisely this difficult issue of mutual recognition of qualifications."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have an observation to make on what happened in the last decade, 2000-2010, as far as Lisbon is concerned."
"It is true that many of us, given also what happened until 2008-2009, viewed the results obtained with less than complete satisfaction."
"Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the case that that decade gave rise to hopes and aspirations, and that much was done to achieve the objectives that had been set, particularly in the area of employment."
"Today, we find ourselves at the beginning of a new, more problematic, more difficult decade, and as regards the proposals that have been presented to us so far, I partly agree with them, although when reading them thoroughly, I still see too many shortcomings."
"I would dwell at length on what are the guiding principles of this proposal, but I shall limit myself to considering growth and employment."
"More jobs, more economic growth: this is the target that we must set ourselves, taking into account that we do so in a situation of excessive levels of public debt, of low structural growth, and of high rates of unemployment."
"Hence, the targets that we set ourselves are too ambitious and, at times, too inflexible."
"So, perhaps with a little less ambition and a little more flexibility, the growth and employment targets will be achievable."
"Mr President, while Commissioner Reding confirmed, and President Barroso reconfirmed in his letter today, that the Women's Charter commits the Commission to promoting and ensuring gender equality and women's rights in all policy fields, I am disappointed that this has not been put into practice for the EU 2020 strategy."
"Should we not be more ambitious than we were for the Lisbon Strategy?"
"Ignoring 52% of the available skills, knowledge and workforce of Europe for any sector or any level would be a serious loss."
"If Europe wants to exploit all its potential and get out of the crisis, we need to ensure that the women's employment rate is raised to at least 70% - to be shown through specific gender statistics."
"We also need specific targets so that we can measure the commitment of each Member State to gender equality, and make improvements thereto."
"How?"
"We need to decrease the gender pay gap by 10% in each Member State."
"We need to revalue the predominantly female health sector by increasing wages and improving conditions, as well as the availability of the services, as it is an increasingly important sector for our ageing society."
"We need to increase the numbers of women in decision-making bodies such as managerial and executive board positions based on a Norwegian 40% quota model."
"We need to increase the possibilities available for women in research and development and innovation, and train them in new green jobs."
"Member States cannot neglect to expand, improve and implement the Barcelona targets in all Member States."
"We need the true commitment of the European Union and all Member States by involving all people when working towards a smart, green progressive society."
"I am convinced that our Commissioner, Mr Andor, is going to do it."
"(PL) Discussion about the Europe 2020 strategy must take account of the experience of the previous strategy."
"We all know the failures of that strategy were caused, firstly, by basing the strategy on the responsibility of individual Member States in the open method of coordination, and the successes came, among other things, from 'Lisbonisation' or the inclusion of certain of the Lisbon objectives in Cohesion policy."
"In relation to this, we have to ask how to approach the new strategy."
"It now seems absolutely crucial, firstly, to show clearly that we are dealing with 'treaty' policies, which are not policies prepared for the purposes of a strategy, but operate over a longer time scale, such as Cohesion policy."
"This means we need to use individual policies to put the strategy into effect, but the strategy, as previous experience shows, will only be successful if individual policies are integrated with each other."
"All measures which separate individual policies, split up funds and divide roles will end in the same failure as the last strategy."
"Therefore, we need to combine, integrate and produce actions associated with synergy."
"(FI) Mr President, the indebtedness of national economies and an ageing population together constitute a real time bomb for Europe."
"We know that, for example, the incidence of agerelated illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, will double over the next ten years."
"That will mean a huge burden on national economies."
"We should not, however, make a mystery out of debt."
"As I recall, Ceaucşescu's Romania was a country without debt, as is North Korea."
"There is also 'smart productive debt' - intelligent debt if that debt is invested in people."
"In this respect, the elimination of poverty, for example, is a very lucrative investment for society, as is reducing youth unemployment."
"What I am quite rightly afraid of at present, while the Member States start to reduce their deficits, is where the cuts are to be made."
"Will they be in education, the employment of older people, the employment of the disabled, or what?"
"That will not be smart or intelligent."
"That is why this EU 2020 strategy is a very important document, and I am one of those who say more Europe and not less Europe."
"More Europe means something like root canal treatment: Member States will be obliged to accomplish the targets that are set out in this EU 2020 strategy."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy - to be honest, I do not feel like discussing the Europe 2020 strategy at all."
"Ten years ago, we adopted a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy."
"When you now look back at this past decade, the results are limited, if I may put it in those modest terms."
"I think that we should currently be focusing on what really matters to people at home in our Member States, rather than making the same mistake again."
"They are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency."
"Will there be inflation?"
"What lessons do we need to learn from the developments over the last two years, from the financial and economic crisis, and now from the currency crisis?"
"Are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis?"
"I would emphatically call on the Commission, first and foremost, to take steps to ensure rapid financial market regulation and progress in Europe in order to prevent, as has been the case in recent years, money being sent around the globe five times in the same day and many people making a profit on this while losses are being nationalised."
"I would ask the Commission to demand that Member States exercise strict budgetary discipline and implement appropriate rules."
"I would also ask for the earliest possible tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is where we should be focusing our efforts."
"I urge the Commission to take requisite measures, but not as before, off its own bat or by discussing them thoroughly with Member States."
"Instead, it should finally take Parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 Members States."
"(EL) I agree with the previous speaker; the Stability Pact needs to be applied."
"However, a number of other things need to be applied before the Stability Pact."
"The decision makers in the European Union need to have quick reflexes, to act when needed, because if Mrs Merkel had decided in time and if the European Union had taken the measures it needed to take, we would have saved a lot of money for the citizens of Europe."
"In order for the European Union to be strong economically and to count globally, it needs its citizens."
"The citizens must be healthy and educated and must have work."
"The European Union needs to bear this in mind when planning for 2020, when planning for the single market."
"The single market must be centred on the citizen and must be a single market with a human face."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"I have a dog at home."
"Recently, my dog took a sausage from the table and ate it."
"The question is - who is to blame for the fact that the dog ate the sausage?"
"Is the dog to blame, for doing what is natural to it?"
"Or rather, am I to blame for not clearing away the sausage and putting it back in the refrigerator after I had finished my meal?"
"On the global financial markets, the value of the euro keeps falling every day."
"Who is to blame for this?"
"Many fellow Members say that the speculators are to blame, that the market is to blame, for attacking the euro and depreciating its value."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you the suggestion that, perhaps, the market is not to blame."
"Rather, it is the market that has pinpointed the underlying fault, the underlying cause."
"The underlying cause for our difficulties today is quite simple - European countries have been living beyond their means far too long, spending vastly more than they are able to earn."
"The markets react to this in the same way that my dog reacted to the smell of the sausage that I had left on the table."
"A year and a half ago, Latvia experienced a crisis similar to the crisis that we are now experiencing in the rest of Europe; namely, the financial markets attacked our currency and had lost all confidence in it."
"Instead of complaining about this situation, we corrected our fundamental indicators, we repaired and collected our public finances."
"In my view, if we wish the Europe 2020 strategy to be meaningful, we must have as our first and most important priority the necessity for European countries to control their public spending, for their income to match their outgoings."
"This would restore confidence, ease the crisis and restore calm to the financial markets. Thank you."
"Mr President, today we are discussing, among others, two excellent reports by Ricardo Cortés Lastra and Lambert van Nistelrooij."
"These both demonstrate in a clear fashion the important contribution of Cohesion policy in achieving the goals of competitiveness and employment and the significant role in promoting innovation and growth that the knowledge economy plays."
"The EU 2020 strategy is, on several counts, similar to the Lisbon Strategy, but tries to improve on focusing on and narrowing down the objectives."
"There is, however, one area - a quite significant one - that still remains unclear, namely the delivery mechanism."
"It is left to the Member States and peer review supported by monitoring by the Commission."
"It seems to me that we have not learned our lesson from the experience of the weak delivery of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I urge the Commission to come up with proposals which will ensure a stronger delivery mechanism for the EU 2020 strategy to make sure that all its targets will be met with action and not just words."
"(EL) The Lisbon Strategy set high targets, but Europe did not manage to implement them."
"We are moving towards a new strategy for the next decade, to be true, and in an exceptionally difficult and unfortunate environment."
"We all agree that the priority and the emphasis on the development triangle 'education, research, innovation' is the best investment if we are to get out of the crisis and it allows us to be optimistic about the future of Europe."
"It is important to emphasise that this strategy must be implemented in an environment of solidarity, in an environment of close cooperation between the Member States."
"At this point, I would clarify, for the avoidance of all misunderstanding, that the support mechanism for Greece, despite any delays, demonstrates this solidarity and you should be in no doubt as to the fact that we recognise it."
"In the New Democracy, in our centre-right party in Greece, we made it clear that we respect the money of the other European peoples being put into the support mechanism."
"However, together with the sacrifices required, and which must be divided fairly, and on this point we were critical of certain measures, together with the spending cuts required in order to reduce the debt and to reduce the deficit, growth initiatives which will take the country out of recession are also needed, initiatives which we have not seen to date."
"That is the only way we, too, in Greece shall be able to approach the ambitious targets of the 2020 strategy, which is the only way we shall come out of the crisis stronger."
"(The speaker agreed to reply IN DUE COURSE to a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I have seen for myself how important Cohesion policy is for Wales and I, therefore, welcome the Lastra report on Cohesion policy and Europe 2020."
"There are many projects right across Wales that are benefiting individuals and communities."
"So, I have no doubt that structural funds can help deliver the 2020 goals."
"However, I would like to make the following points."
"The 2020 strategy, the fifth cohesion report and the budget must all be aligned."
"In future, structural funds should be properly financed, the structural funds should not be renationalised and the transitional status should be made available to those regions that fall out of convergent status."
"If we can achieve all these things, I certainly believe that the Cohesion policy can help us deliver 2020."
"It would also make the EU 2020 strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across Europe."
"(EL) I should like to take this opportunity, following the position taken by my close fellow Greek member, Mr Papanikolaou, from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), to make the following clarification, which I consider extremely important in these times of crisis, especially for Greece:"
"Greece is not taking money from other nations."
"The Member States of the European Union borrow at a lower rate of interest and lend, give money to the mechanism and, via it to Greece, at a higher rate of interest."
"We are not taking money from other nations."
"(EL) You are absolutely right Mrs Rapti."
"Of course, Greece's borrowing requirements would be smaller and Greece would be able to raise money more easily on the markets, had there not been such a delay, six months now, on the part of the present Greek Government."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Niebler has already said a great deal that very much concerns me too."
"I am greatly concerned about our future together in the EU."
"I cannot just move on to the agenda without mentioning the crisis."
"One of our major objectives, the euro and its high monetary stability, is at risk of total collapse."
"Prosperity and jobs are not feasible without a secure monetary value."
"We are talking about Europe 2020, but we do not even know what Europe will look like in 2011."
"We are debating meat glued together with thrombin and we are debating driving times for self-employed drivers, as if the major problems of the Union will solve themselves."
"We need to send out strong and rapid signals about regulating, organising and improving the deficits in both state budgets and in the banking sector."
"Let me give you a couple of examples: we need clear definitions and harsh penalties for deficit offenders, such as withdrawing funding."
"We need clear rules for banks, such as banning credit default swaps or requirements for insurance and depositing these against corresponding nominal values."
"Let me also add a sentence from a famous German mayor who was chair of the German Association of Cities and Towns for many years: He who does not spend money he does not have is a long way from being a saver!"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to come back to the report by Mr Cortés Lastra, which I think is a very good report."
"Indeed, the Cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment."
"However, I would like to highlight again the importance of towns and cities here, because they will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Four out of five Europeans live in urban areas."
"Towns and cities are the driving force of economic growth in Europe."
"At the same time, they are experiencing many problems particularly acutely."
"Key words here are social integration, the environment and transport, for example, but also demographic change."
"Therefore, towns and cities have a particular role when it comes to actually improving the living conditions of citizens."
"In addition, Europe's towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation, research and education, and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy."
"All of this should be taken into account during the implementation of these strategies and during the shaping of the future course of the Cohesion policy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake, have been the cause of further national debt that will remain for many years still, and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion."
"We must react in a timely and incisive manner, and, in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to, Europe 2020 must be extremely realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself."
"Three of these seem to me, Commissioner, to be priorities."
"The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets, which, however, must not be divorced from development and economic growth."
"We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality."
"We must support SMEs and new industries, such as IT and sustainable energy and, of course, our infrastructure."
"Let us raise the overall level of education, yes, but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production."
"It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer."
"It is clear that every target should be related to the national context, but within the framework of a broader European strategy."
"I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social cohesion, development and stable national budgets, we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level, to enable European institutions, including Parliament, to take effective and preventive action."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed on the major objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and, if we are all agreed on its objectives, we should now provide ourselves with the means to implement them."
"These means include, for example, the establishment of an EU economic government."
"In order for these fine words and major objectives to become realities and this time avoid what I would call a kind of collective disenchantment with the Lisbon Strategy, it is essential that we provide ourselves with the resources necessary to take action."
"This is also why I fully support the Commission's proposal to have the national budgets inspected in advance by the EU, with the proviso, however, that the national parliaments and the European Parliament are involved in these inspection arrangements."
"However, I should like to speak in more detail about the crisis and young people."
"I think that young people have been the main victims of this crisis, and that we must take advantage of the opportunity provided to us to put young people back at the heart of this Europe 2020 strategy."
"Firstly, the EU 2020 strategy must be an inclusive strategy."
"Mobility, which is the concrete expression of the concept of free movement within the EU, must become a real possibility for all young people, not only for young students."
"That is why I hope the Commission will support my proposal for an extension to the European mobility programmes for young apprentices."
"Furthermore, I also believe that this strategy must promote the upskilling of young people so as to eliminate the curse of unemployment among the young, because we all know that the transition from a learning environment to a first job is one of the major challenges faced by young people."
"The way to make progress in this area is to enhance their skills, for example, by channelling EU funds more effectively towards policies for young people."
"Finally, all young Europeans need to be given mobility opportunities and upskilled because what we need, above all else, is an innovative young generation."
"It is young people who, today, will create the growth and innovation of tomorrow."
"This is why I do not want young people to be left out of this Europe 2020 strategy."
"(ES) Mr President, we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000."
"Some of these have been met, but a lot of them have not."
"There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Ten years on, we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember."
"I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify, in this new Europe 2020 strategy, where we went wrong, as well as enable us to improve so as to achieve better results."
"Firstly, we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential, as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra's report."
"We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing."
"We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels - European Union, national, regional and local authorities - is an absolute necessity."
"If we work together, we will be much stronger."
"It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic, social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here, namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient."
"Furthermore, in the disability sector, that difference will have to be taken into account in some way."
"Finally, I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities, and especially, the need to pay more attention to those areas with special needs, such as mountain areas, coastal areas and islands."
"In short, if we want to be successful, we have to be able to count on the European regions, the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy in line with the new situation."
"(RO) Europe 2020 must be a Europe for its citizens and meet their needs."
"This is the approach which I consider must form the basis of this strategy."
"It is important that, within the new European framework, we continue with the course of action promoting development and the objectives already set, which must be monitored for tangible results so as to achieve a positive impact."
"I am referring here specifically to investments in any kind of infrastructure, enabling us to become much more competitive from an economic perspective."
"We need to continue to pursue economic, social and territorial cohesion policies in order to narrow the disparities between regions and establish a platform for balanced economic development, as is also stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Europe 2020 must be a Europe of global action which can be achieved if the European Union has a common level of development which enhances the ability of local and regional players to respond to the global challenges."
"Europe 2020 is a Europe where regions develop according to their specific potential and use the regional aspect of research, development and innovation for promoting economic development and increasing employment."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on what Mr Seeber has already said."
"If we really want to successfully carry off the objectives of the 2020 agenda, we first need to attend to the job in hand."
"We need strong financial market regulation, regulation that really will be better at supervising and regulating future conduct in these areas."
"However, we must also put our own houses in order, and that means ensuring that we have better controls in place for how effectively money from relevant structural funds is spent and in what ways we should support further development."
"We also need to involve local and regional authorities more in our structures and planning because, ultimately, they are the ones who have to implement tasks on the ground, and make it clear which tasks need to be fulfilled if we are to achieve the objectives we have quite rightly set for ourselves."
"However, setting objectives without robustly and consistently addressing the status quo and the tasks to be completed and without analysing what needs to be done now makes little sense in my view."
"As Mr Ulmer said earlier on, we have moved on to the agenda and we are debating the day-to-day business of this House, food safety and so on, without really being aware of what priority issues we need to resolve."
"That has to be our starting point."
"We first need to focus on bringing our financial situation under control and ensuring that everyone adheres to these rules."
"We must also ensure that Parliament and, in particular, the Commission apply the control mechanisms that have been available to them in the past more stringently in the future and we must have a greater say in what is happening in some Member States."
"(GA) Mr President, I am proud to say a few words in relation to this debate about the 2020 strategy and here are the points I would like to make."
"I must say it is disappointing and sometimes depressing to hear speaker after speaker here in Strasbourg and in Brussels talk about the failure of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It was not all a failure and if it were, I do not think 67% of the Irish people would have voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon last October."
"There have been many benefits for all to see, in particular at regional level, as the Commissioner pointed out."
"However, there are a number of areas which I would be concerned about."
"Firstly, where does the six-month rotating presidency fit into this?"
"I see each country coming in here outlining their priorities for the six months rather than where they fit into the overall targets set down annually for the 10 years."
"I think that is a very important point; no football team changes its manager every six months for him to come in with a different set of priorities which you cannot achieve in a short period of time."
"Secondly, I welcome the instruments which have been brought in to make Member States stand up to their responsibilities, and pay for their failures if they do not do so."
"'Softly, softly' will not do anymore."
"If you are part of a team, and you play badly, you are either dropped or told to up your game."
"We have to up our game."
"Finally, I want to say that I also welcome the suggestion to empower the regions and the cities as part of this process."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 9 May, the EU, at the behest of the Ministers for the Economy and Finance, gave a firm response to the financial markets."
"Although the European Parliament is subject to longer parliamentary procedures, it must not be condemned to inaction."
"I think that this House, and we, its Members, have three essential roles to play."
"First of all, we must throw all our weight behind governments and the Commission in the initiatives they have taken recently."
"Secondly, we must immediately set to work to find the solutions that will enable us, in the medium and long terms, to emerge from the crisis and encourage a growth model that is truly dynamic and supports the real economy."
"That is the entire challenge of the EU 2020 strategy and of the priority objectives which we will earmark for the EU Structural Funds for the period 2014-2020."
"Mrs Bowles, I should like to say to you that, if the Lisbon Strategy is, to some degree, a failure, it is because it was designed several years ago when the economic situation was different from what it is today."
"Therefore, those who condemn this strategy do so because it is inflexible and inappropriate for the current situation."
"This is the problem with strategies."
"Therefore, this 2020 strategy will be all the stronger if it can be adapted to prevailing circumstances."
"Finally - and this is the most important issue to my mind - we must explain at a local level what is happening at EU level and obtain the public's approval."
"European citizens woke up on Monday, 10 May to a new Europe."
"They had not caused this metamorphosis."
"No one can assess its long-term consequences at this stage."
"This metamorphosis will not bear fruit if it is not rooted in democracy."
"We were united in diversity; now we must be united in adversity."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened a great deal today and it has been quite useful, but I also have to draw your attention to a matter that I consider to be important."
"We shall not succeed, in my opinion, by locating all this strategy in the context of a market that is today out of joint, subject to continuous speculation, and in deep crisis."
"As we discuss Europe 2020, we need to bear a situation of this type in mind."
"I would divide the discussion into two parts: first, the market must serve the real economy, and not vice versa; second, I believe that Europe must be the locomotive for this economy."
"As far as the first part is concerned, it has been much discussed, and it is high time that we set up a hedge against this market, so that we do not have to depend on anyone at all, but what is important is the locomotive, and for the locomotive to pull, we also need the means."
"Let us have the courage to change this budget, let us have the courage to take responsibility for setting up a significant fund to serve as a financial hedge, but especially one that can get the TEN-T, TEN-E and E-TEN networks going."
"This is the locomotive that we must bring into play, and to pull the real economy, we also need the private sector, through the PPP mechanism."
"That is the task, Commissioner, which we must tackle immediately, because the crisis is not over, the crisis is with us, and we must make this strong push right now."
"(PT) Mr President, a debate on the Europe 2020 strategy naturally leads to acceptance of better coordination of the various national policies, more Europe, and acceptance of the path of structural reforms to attain growth for our economy."
"However, in order for us to reach 2020, we will have to get through 2010 and, on that subject, I would like to call attention to the balance needed between budgetary consolidation policies and the need to avoid falling back into recession."
"I am a Portuguese national and at this very moment, the proposal that is being made is to increase taxes."
"Fundamentally, the path that the Member States should choose is that of seriously reducing public spending: having tax systems that are competitive and making structural reforms so that we can achieve the necessary growth."
"As well as the long and medium terms, we must think about the short term and start encouraging the existence of creative companies right now."
"We must make a commitment to universities and to research and development, because that is very clear now."
"In order for use to reach 2020, we will have to make it through 2010 in one piece."
"I would like to leave this worry behind now."
"It is clear that we have a Stability Pact, but there is also a Growth Pact, and the key word for our economies in the near future is growth."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive economic space, and one that is economically, socially and territorially cohesive."
"In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why it lost force was because of its highly complex structure, particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of government, particularly those of a regional and local nature."
"Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term."
"Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment."
"The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining."
"I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the European Union, as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways."
"I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment."
"Economic, social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend a special greeting to the visitors to our Parliament who have followed this debate about one of the key issues for the European Union over the next ten years more attentively and in greater numbers than many of our Members."
"We are conducting this debate in much too technocratic a way."
"I grew up in a country where society was organised according to multiannual plans."
"This country, the German Democratic Republic, no longer exists."
"That is why I still have a certain scepticism for programmes which jumble together strategies, desired objectives and planned economy codes, which stretch over a lengthy period of time and which pass on the implementation to others."
"No matter what decisions we make for the European Union in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, it is Member States, national governments and parliaments and regional and local authorities that will have to shoulder the implementation."
"The disquiet with such procedures is very much in evidence."
"A top-down Europe cannot work."
"The united Europe can only work if we continue to build it jointly with national and regional institutions and with citizens."
"The Commission has abandoned the Lisbon Strategy too fast, without carrying out a thorough analysis of why the objectives of this strategy were not achieved."
"Therefore, it is probably no coincidence that, today in Parliament, the reports and questions were lumped together under the title of 'EU 2020', although every one of them deserves a separate debate."
"They contain at least two points on which European policy has been successful so far: creation of the internal market and the cohesion and structural policies."
"However, the EU 2020 strategy indicates that the Cohesion policy will only have a supporting role in the attainment of its objectives."
"Now, that is a contradiction."
"We do not need more planned economy in the European Union; others have failed on that front before."
"Before we then confront Member States with a list of planned economy codes, which nobody at present knows how they are supposed to be achieved, and bearing in mind the uncertainties and turbulence in the economic and financial markets now and in the past few years and their impact on jobs and the social situation in Member States, what we need is an in-depth debate about where the European Union has been successful, where we can achieve common goals, for example, a pact with the EU's regions, and how we can create more community without infringing the subsidiarity principle."
"If we did so, this debate could and would culminate in an overall strategy."
"However, this debate - as we have seen from the example today - has only just begun, and we in the European Union should be the ones to lead it."
"(HU) Commissioner, I think that the guiding principle of any plan or strategy for European development must be to build a Europe that acts as a truly unified region in the service of European citizens."
"We have said a great deal about the economic and social dimensions of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, the European Union today is much more than that."
"The EU is not just a community of interests but one of values; that is what gives it its economic strength and political clout."
"If, by the end of the decade, we truly wish to create a more successful and competitive Europe, we need to pay serious attention to ensuring that our common values receive due respect, are strengthened and implemented."
"We also need to focus on closer harmonisation of Member States' education policies, the reduction of regional inequalities and the continuation of the enlargement process, as well as on the protection of fundamental rights and minority rights, to mention but a few policies that are based on European values."
"Economic growth and the improvement of citizens' living conditions are unthinkable without such values-based policies."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the 2020 strategy is comprehensive and covers many issues, as demonstrated by this afternoon's debate."
"I should just like to emphasise two particular aspects."
"Firstly, with regard to the social dimension of this strategy, I fully support Mrs Berès in her questioning of the Commission, in particular, concerning the setting of quantified poverty reduction targets in this strategy, which, for me, is a sine qua non."
"Also, the principle of an EU-wide minimum income to meet these objectives seems to me to be an obvious need, and must be implemented in practice."
"Secondly, the coherence between the EU budget and this strategy."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission has given any indication so far as to whether it wishes to review our multiannual financial framework for the current period, even though it has revealed its limitations."
"However, if we do not adapt it in accordance with the new challenges in the strategy, we are collectively running a great risk."
"Neither the EU budget, which is too restricted, nor the national public budgets, will be able to start making the investments needed to support the various flagship initiatives in the 2020 strategy."
"Madam President, on page 7 of the Europe 2020 document, it says: 'Europe has many strengths: we can count on the talent and creativity of our people'."
"It does not, of course, say that other people are less talented or creative - that would be terribly unkind and almost certainly unfair - but it certainly singles out the population of Europe for special praise."
"Elsewhere, it bemoans the fact that Europe has an ageing population."
"This, of course, is attributable mainly to sharply falling birth rates, though the document does not say so."
"Perhaps nation states should encourage, as far as states can, a rise in the birth rates of their populations."
"This would certainly redress the population balance."
"Furthermore it might even produce at least a proportionate increase in those talented and creative people who are so necessary for economic and cultural development."
"I do hope I am not tainting the Commission document by linking its parts with reasoned argument, but I have kept within my time limit!"
"(PL) The Europe 2020 strategy cannot do as much as we are saying, here, today."
"It is not possible to do so much for just under 1% of GDP, because that is the value of the European Union budget."
"Let us show what we can do, by creating appropriate and modern legislation, and let us show the purposes to which funds will be assigned from the European Union budget."
"Let us say clearly: there is not enough realism in our expectations of the Europe 2020 strategy, there are too many things to be done and too much hope being created, and the role of Member States has not been defined."
"A rise in employment, reduction in poverty, education and, above all, economic growth are the big tasks and the main priorities which should be put into effect in the present situation, when we are in a crisis and should take action to revive the economy - because this is the number one problem in the Europe 2020 strategy: resuscitating the economy today."
"(RO) The EU's Cohesion policy has helped, and still helps, generate synergy with the research and innovation policies."
"It has also placed the focus on the role of territorial cohesion."
"I believe that the regions should specialise in smart and green developments and define for themselves a set of innovation priorities based on the EU's objectives and their needs, and channel Community resources into these priorities which have been identified."
"At the same time, they must promote models of success as part of the triangle of knowledge and the relations between businesses, research centres, universities and public authorities, especially those established via public-private partnerships."
"I also believe that the exchange of knowledge within regional groups can be facilitated by the Structural Funds as well because European policies are consistently targeted at sustainable development, offering tangible results at regional level."
"All these elements form the concrete bond for achieving territorial cohesion within the European Union."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate today's rapporteurs, especially Mr van Nistelrooij, for the excellent report that was presented."
"Research and development will provide us with the solutions to be taken into account in future in tackling successfully the major challenges we are facing, whether it involves the severe economic crisis or achieving the 2020 strategy's long-term objectives."
"With the impetus provided by the Cohesion policy, whose aim is to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship and develop a knowledge-based economy, research and development must be approached from two directions."
"Based on a top-down approach, research and innovation will be the main areas for identifying solutions aimed at overcoming the problems which we are facing and for boosting economic growth and sustainable development."
"It is just as important for innovation to come out of the laboratories and research centres and be pitched at a level which suits European citizens' needs as appropriately as possible."
"We must encourage local and regional economies to improve their ability to innovate and to identify themselves the most effective solutions as part of a bottom-up approach, thereby utilising regional and local potential."
"(RO) The European Union is facing an economic, financial and social crisis at present."
"The policy of deindustrialisation pursued in recent years has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs, the relocation of European industry to third countries and to a 10% unemployment rate, which is even 20% among young people, thereby jeopardising the EU's competitiveness."
"I believe that the European Union needs to make huge investments in the transport and energy infrastructure, in agriculture, health, education and research but, above all, in sustainable economic development."
"The development of industrial production and, by extension, the creation of jobs in the EU requires investment in modernising European companies so that these developments can lead to greener production."
"In the next 10 years, energy efficiency must be our top priority."
"On top of this, the EU population is ageing and the birth rate is falling, while the high unemployment rate is affecting the sustainability of the pension systems."
"I believe that the time has come for the European Union to defend its fundamental principles and assets, and the biggest asset which the EU has is its 500 million European citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the Europe 2020 strategy and its key priorities."
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Greek crisis: we need to act instead of reacting."
"A coordinated and monitored budgetary policy and supervision and regulation of the financial market are indispensable."
"For the sake of our citizens, we need to pay attention to investment in growth and employment, in order to reduce unemployment and to create and secure jobs."
"That also means strengthening the education sector and investing in education, research and innovation as cornerstones of a sustainable social market economy, and of a sustainable and more environmentally conscious economy."
"(SK) The 2020 strategy and the Lisbon Strategy have something in common: a belief that the economy must be managed."
"The Commission's recipe of 'competition or crisis' unfortunately remains unchanged."
"The 2020 strategy states that easy access to credit and short-term thinking resulted in the behaviour which led to unsupported growth and major imbalances."
"However, further on in the text of the strategy, it states that the Commission will seek to improve access to capital and to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access finance."
"This has again sanctioned greater access to credit, which will again lead to speculation and unsupported growth."
"In 1991, the Malaysian premier of the time announced the Vision 2020 project, or Vavasan 2020 in Malaysian."
"According to this, Malaysia was to catch up with Great Britain, France, Germany and Japan by 2020."
"Ladies and gentlemen, planned economies do not work, as all of our colleagues from the new Member States, including the Commissioner, can confirm."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this discussion today on the Europe 2020 strategy has been extremely interesting and useful for us, the Commission, as was this morning's discussion on economic governance."
"I would like to thank you for this opportunity and for all the messages you sent on this strategy."
"On behalf of the European Commission, I am particularly grateful to Mr van Nistelrooij, Mr Grech, Mr Cortés Lastra and Mr Hoang Ngoc for their reports."
"I am prepared to continue a discussion on various details and even nuances concerning the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, at this time, let me concentrate my answers on some of the key aspects of the discussion with a few concluding remarks."
"First of all, I would like to stress once again the importance of the strong involvement of the European Parliament in the various upcoming steps linked to the Europe 2020 strategy: first of all, the opinion of the European Parliament on the integrated guidelines; secondly, at a later stage, the role of the EP as colegislator on various proposals to be made under the flagship initiatives; and not forgetting, thirdly, the next multiannual financial framework to make sure the future EU budgets better reflect the priorities set for the European Union through the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Let me also be very clear about the objectives of the strategy."
"It has a dual objective."
"First and foremost, it is an essential pillar of the response of the Union to the current crisis."
"It is an essential tool for strengthening coordination of economic policy inside the EU-27 and, of course, within the euro area."
"But besides this short-term objective, this new strategy is about equipping Europe with a strategy - actually, as Michel Barnier outlined in his opening statement, a programme for action - to enable the European Union to exit the economic crisis by restoring economic growth and making sure this growth translates into more and better jobs."
"But we must aim for a different kind of job creation than in the past - a more sustainable one, not only in ecological terms but also economically, socially and financially sustainable."
"It is about restoring a competitive European Union capable of ensuring the sustainability of its unique social model - a competitive EU that is a global leader in terms of tackling climate change, an EU that invests more in its people through more and better education and, finally, an EU that strengthens social cohesion by combating poverty."
"Of course, as outlined in the Commission's conclusions during this morning's debate, this return to strong growth is only possible if we make sure that in the coming years, our Member States undertake the necessary fiscal consolidation, taking account of their respective starting points, not undermining a fragile recovery, and looking at the expenditure side at the same time as the revenue side."
"These are all very important elements."
"I would like to stress once again the importance and the complexity of the fiscal problems that are currently on the agenda, but I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that this financial and economic crisis is much more complex than just speaking about budget deficits."
"At the root of the crisis, you will find a fundamental malfunctioning of the financial sector, starting with the banking sector, the correction of which is also essential if we want to start a sustainable recovery from this situation."
"We also have to address other causes of the recent recession - like the lack of an industrial policy and, to some extent, the lack of a complete success of our previous strategies - to achieve a knowledge-based economic growth and spread this growth to every region, every corner of the European Union."
"That is why we have to reinforce our efforts in terms of economic governance, reinforce our efforts for financial regulation, and also achieve better economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Altogether, I strongly believe that there is no alternative for Europe but to launch this strategy and to launch it very quickly."
"If Europe does not restore its growth path, it will decline economically and will therefore also decline politically."
"While we are discussing this new strategy, most of our main trading partners have not only already put in place 10-year long-term social economic development strategies but they are already implementing them."
"But, if there is one lesson to be learned from the current economic crisis and from its predecessor, the Lisbon Strategy - and I agree with Mr Kelly that often this Lisbon Strategy is exposed to too harsh a criticism - it is that delivery of reforms is key for success."
"It is therefore urgent to launch Europe 2020 at the June European Council and make sure that both the EU and its Member States start the implementation immediately thereafter."
"At this point, I would also like to thank the Spanish Presidency for the efforts it made in bringing together the Member States and for supporting this strategy in recent months and, no doubt, in the coming weeks."
"There can be no delay, considering the current economic situation and the crisis we are currently going through."
"We owe it to the citizens to provide them with solutions to exit the current crisis and enhance the coordination of economic policies, while, at the same time, preparing a return to smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth."
"By acting together in a coordinated way, we will have the necessary weight to be successful on the global stage as well."
"The Commission counts on Parliament's support in making sure the Europe 2020 strategy can be launched rapidly and successfully."
"Following the debate, I should like to express my thanks for your support for my report."
"I wish to make a couple more comments; to raise a few points about social and economic governance in the short term."
"The financial side has attracted sufficient attention and has been made a major priority."
"We have also been able to discuss the medium term this afternoon and make several comments on this."
"We shall be including everything in a Parliament resolution that we shall be discussing in this Chamber before the June summit."
"I wish to make two more comments: one about governance."
"It has been asked whose strategy this actually is."
"One of Lisbon's faults was that the decentralised parties - the municipalities, the regions, our partners - were not sufficiently involved in the process."
"Therefore, I propose a territorial pact with the regions, towns and cities, in addition to the agreement in the Council with the Member States and the Commission."
"Otherwise, this will happen again, and we shall be talking about, rather than to, the regions, our partners."
"If these things do not reach citizens this time, I know one thing for sure, and that is that one can deck out large flagships, but they will soon be more flag than ship."
"Participation in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy should be made more exciting."
"Indeed, this is possible, by saying when it comes to providing subsidies, providing encouragement, that those who stick their necks out, who also provide financing, can participate."
"The whole thing is far too flat."
"Therefore, I invite the Commission to enter into a territorial pact with the regions, towns and cities."
"Finally, integrated policy, particularly across sectors, is crucial; the fragmentation of all kinds of new financing structures does no good and will not help us achieve this agenda."
"My report concerns synergy between research, development, innovation, production and employment in Europe."
"We must fight against fragmentation, and so I urge Commissioner Andor to keep the European Social Fund intact in the regulations, and not to split it up as is sometimes suggested in this House."
"In the little time I have available, I would like to reply to a few of my fellow Members' comments on my report."
"I agree with Malcolm Harbour in that there does not seem to be much willingness to consider the Single Market as being the fundamental tool in the 2020 strategy - which is still not properly defined and developed."
"This is a real shame, considering that a Single Market that embraces a wider and more holistic perspective can be among the top - if not the top - initiatives to provide European citizens with a better quality of life within the Union's strategy."
"Evelyne Gebhardt is also right in saying that today, it is clear that the Single Market, within the scope of the 2020 strategy, requires new momentum that calls for strong leadership on the part of all the Union's institutions, especially from the Commission's side, so that the Single Market can once again restore confidence and trust in our citizens."
"To conclude, Madam President, we need to ensure that the new 2020 agenda does not become over-ambitious and over-burdened, since this will lead to an agenda full of priorities where nothing gets implemented, as happened the last time round."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two taboos have been broken in recent weeks."
"Firstly, the ECB can now monetise sovereign debts."
"Secondly, EU expenditure can now be financed by borrowing and, in particular, when the stabilisation and support funds are created."
"There is a third taboo, which unfortunately has not been broken, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact, which some Members of this House are dogmatically demanding be strengthened."
"Commissioners, we socialists are in favour of federalism."
"We are in favour of the coordination of budget policies."
"However, if the coordination of budget policies means overriding national parliaments so as to put their citizens on a starvation diet, then I fear that that might be a fine EU idea which will itself end up starving to death."
"This is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment."
"Commissioners, the austerity plans in Greece, Spain, Portugal and France do not have any chance of succeeding."
"I ask you to acknowledge this."
"Madam President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their contributions and the climate of constructive criticism that has prevailed during the course of this important debate."
"This report on the contribution of the Cohesion policy to Lisbon and Europe 2020 strategy objectives represents one of the key contributions of the European Parliament to the future Europe 2020 strategy for growth and employment, one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"The report highlights job creation, the fostering of a sustainable economy, education and training to promote development, employment and competitiveness, as well as the key role of investment in research and development, bearing in mind the need to adopt specific measures for regions with natural handicaps."
"However, it will not be possible to implement the Europe 2020 strategy successfully without the participation and full approval of regional and local authorities, as well as that of civil society."
"Regions not only contribute to project cofinancing, but are also capable of gauging the needs of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises better due to their proximity, as well as being in a position to establish a direct link with universities and innovation centres, thus promoting the knowledge triangle."
"In this context, Cohesion policy is not merely a source of stable financial allocations, but also represents a powerful tool in the economic development of all European regions."
"Its objectives of eliminating existing inequalities between regions and of introducing economic, social and territorial cohesion, along with its basic principles of an integrated focus, multi-level governance and genuine collaboration, are all essential elements to the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The item is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Thursday, 20 May 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The EU 2020 strategy's principles are vital for boosting the European economy's competitiveness."
"Structural reforms are the key to exiting the crisis we are in."
"The solutions deployed so far for exiting the crisis have not been targeting the causes which have put us in this situation."
"The causes of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reforms."
"We must focus more attention on our economies' innovative ability because this is where the key to EU competitiveness will lie in the coming period."
"We need to adopt a coordinated approach for using funds earmarked for innovation and regional development."
"Innovation must feature as part of regional development."
"Innovation was an objective in the Lisbon Strategy but, unfortunately, it only remained a principle on paper."
"There were very wide variations in the progress made by Member States and the overall objective was not achieved."
"This is the reason why I am urging all Member States to show some responsibility and abide by the commitments which they also take on."
"The Commission should also play a more active role in coordinating the implementation of this strategy in order to prevent it from failing as disastrously as the Lisbon Strategy."
"The EU 2020 strategy proposed by the European Commission to stimulate growth and employment in the EU emphasises research and innovation."
"Various instruments are already providing a great deal of support to projects being carried out in these fields: the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme."
"These various programmes provide finance to the tune of EUR 86 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"The EU 2020 strategy also emphasises the interdependence of the various EU policies."
"For efficiency purposes, it is therefore essential to establish synergies between the various instruments."
"This being the case, I welcome the importance given by the rapporteur to the role which a strong, properly financed regional policy can play in the achievement of the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that potential beneficiaries are not always fully aware of the possibilities that exist for establishing synergies in the area of funding."
"I therefore think it crucial to improve communication, for example, on the model of the Practical Guide to EU Funding Opportunities for Research and Development."
"In the context of discussions on the effective use of all funds earmarked by the European Union for research and innovation, we have to raise the problem of appropriate promotion for innovative solutions which arise in individual Member States."
"It often happens that as a result of the poor flow of information, investment is made in research projects which have already been carried out by scientists in one of the Member States."
"This is a waste of EU money, which we cannot allow in a time of economic crisis."
"Greater emphasis needs to be placed on improving communication and supporting the purchase by the European Union of existing new technologies, which will also allow additional financial support for innovative businesses."
"It is also important to finance soft projects such as training and the dissemination of knowledge about the significance of innovation for economic growth, better informing of local entities about the programmes which are available, and also flexibility in defining the conditions for granting support, so that countries which currently have a low level of innovation can, by development of the sector concerned, contribute to creation of the competitive advantage of the European Union on a global scale."
"It is also essential to create incentives to investment in local research centres."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises cannot afford to do this, while large, international firms do not want to use them, which deepens the disproportions in the level of innovation between the Member States of the European Union."
"University Business Dialogue (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Pál Schmitt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on university-business dialogue: a new partnership for the modernisation of Europe's universities -."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who - as announced by President Buzek at the beginning of the session - has tendered his resignation from the European Parliament in order to take up duties in his own country, and to whom I send my regards and my best wishes, because he has done a great job."
"This report is the result of his intentions, and it was carried in our Committee on Culture and Education by an overwhelming majority, with just a single vote against, for which I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report, both on my behalf and on behalf of Mr Schmitt."
"Before leaving for Strasbourg, on Monday I went to Rome to visit a private training centre that is achieving superb results, because it has succeeded in placing the vast majority of young people that it trains over the course of time."
"When I spoke to the director of this centre, he said to me: 'Please help us, you in Europe too, to follow this course, to add weight to training that moves in this direction, which enables so many young people to find work; help us also to modernise the relationship between universities and business.'"
"The thrust of this report lies precisely here: today, 20% of young Europeans are out of work, of whom about 30% are graduates; a percentage that is so high that we are forced to ask ourselves very seriously about how we should approach the issue of training young people for entry into the world of work in these times, in this Europe, in this globalised world."
"We have then, in this report, wished to address directly the issue of how to improve the link between universities and business, highlighting certain key points: first, by giving priority to one of the strong points available to the European Union, namely the ability of its citizens to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances of the labour market; the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a 'job for life', and that these days, training and retraining is essential."
"The first point then is lifelong learning; the second, which, in our view, is of fundamental importance, is that of mobility."
"These days it is important, as we highlight in this report, to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds, and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices, but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes, in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses."
"Furthermore, more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged."
"Such a result can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of a system of knowledge vouchers such as that currently in use in a number of Member States, enabling SMEs, in particular, to improve their research capacity without compromising the independence, autonomy and public character of universities."
"The third key point is that of research, namely, we see greater researcher mobility - in both the short and long term, across nations and between academia and business - as imperative in enhancing knowledge transfer."
"Finally, the possibility of extending the good practices in this area that exist in so many countries."
"I shall conclude, Madam President, by illustrating, in relation to this report and the outstanding work done by the committee, how convinced we are that Europe will not win the battle against China or other developing nations by means of low wages, but by having highly qualified professionals and highly competitive businesses, and in this process, it is of maximum importance that universities and businesses realise how they are interdependent, and that the authorities at all levels contribute to developing more efficient methods of cooperation."
"Madam President, honourable Members, this report is the answer to our communication on the dialogue between universities and business."
"I wish to thank all those who have contributed to it, in particular, members of the Committee on Culture and Education and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I would especially like to thank Mr Schmitt, the outgoing Member, who was rapporteur."
"Cooperation between universities and business is one option - no, it is more than that, it is indispensable."
"The only question is what form it should take so that it is appropriate for both sides."
"Better, more intensive cooperation encourages the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, both in business and in academia."
"Contact with real problems and solutions through adapted curricula and internships enriches students' learning experience and prepares them for their future careers."
"Regular and long-term cooperation creates confidence and it can lead to ambitious partnerships and cooperation projects, which bring benefits for business and universities alike in terms of research, development and practice."
"New trends in the labour market and new technologies are changing the demands on graduates and will continue to do so in the decades ahead."
"In order that the quality of life in Europe can be maintained and improved, workers must be able continuously to update their knowledge and skills, and this is going to be all the more necessary if we take into account Europe's demographic development in these years ahead."
"We need an open, flexible and dynamic dialogue between everyone involved."
"For this reason, the European Commission has launched the EU Forum for University Business Dialogue."
"The forum offers all of its participants a platform for discussion and exchange of best practice and mutual learning."
"The European Commission has a moderating role here, helping to remove barriers between these two worlds."
"So far, the EU Forum for University Business Dialogue has met three times in Brussels and held a number of thematic forums on topics such as curriculum development, entrepreneurship, lifelong learning, knowledge transfer, university management, mobility, new skills for new jobs and cooperation between universities and business in the current crisis."
"In collaboration with the European Training Foundation (ETF), a thematic forum devoted to third countries was held in the premises of the European Parliament in December 2009."
"This was followed up in March 2010 by a thematic forum which explored the possibility of expanding the forum's sphere of action to cooperation between schools and business."
"Very recently, on 4 and 5 May, the most recent EU Forum for University Business Dialogue was held in Brussels with the following priorities: cooperation between universities and small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperation between universities and business on innovation, cooperation between universities and business on the quality of education."
"These issues were also addressed in your report."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Pack for her participation in the opening meeting of this event."
"We very much appreciate the positive response to our communication which is reflected in your report today."
"We need more cooperation between stakeholders, based on mutual trust, respect and transparency."
"We are therefore not just promoting economic growth, but also generating social benefits in the widest sense of the word, by helping people to make their way successfully through a rapidly changing world of society and work."
"Madam President, I should like to start by wishing Mr Schmitt, who has left the European Parliament, every success in his new position."
"It was a pleasure to work with him, at least for the period that I have been in Parliament."
"The development triptych of education, research and innovation, as we stressed earlier for the 2020 strategy, is crucial to the future of Europe."
"However, if we are to achieve these objectives, it is true that we also need to recognise the difficulties which our young people are encountering nowadays in the process of transition from study to professional life, which is also being prolonged by the crisis."
"We also all recognise that, in numerous Member States, the education system has weak points, both in terms of standards and in training pupils and students."
"Training, let us be in no doubt, cannot be examined separately from the contemporary requirements of the labour market and, on this point, we need to make use of every means at our disposal to help young people."
"Mr Scurria referred earlier to mobility."
"I would add new technologies and, of course, apart from lifelong learning and formal education, by which I mean universities, we also have non-formal education and informal education, which also give young people skills."
"Education and work are interwoven concepts."
"Consequently, we need to pursue and strengthen dialogue between education systems and work providers."
"We all say that our young people need to be equipped with qualifications and skills and we also all know full well that, today, young people with no skills have fewer opportunities."
"What sort of skills?"
"Skills which the labour market needs, skills which will encourage innovative ideas and initiatives."
"There is no time to lose, unemployment is rising and we all have a duty to engage in this dialogue and to integrate this cooperation as quickly as possible."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too congratulate Mr Schmitt on his appointment as Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament."
"Clearly, European universities must be developed continuously for us to be able to respond to new social challenges and ever-increasing international competition."
"We simply cannot afford to remain where we are."
"High levels of skills and expertise and the knowledgebased economy are, and must be, the foundation of European society now and in the future."
"In this sense, it is important that more attention is paid to the dialogue between our universities and business, and that we try to eliminate the bottlenecks that hamper cooperation. These include the problems connected with intellectual property rights and innovation."
"In Finland, we have an excellent example of cooperation between business and universities, the Aalto University, named after the famous Finnish architect, Alvar Aalto."
"It is a multidisciplinary university which represents a merger of three highly respected universities: the Helsinki School of Economics, the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and the Helsinki University of Technology."
"Economics, aesthetics and technology are in symbiosis with one another."
"The interdisciplinary approach, especially the new platforms - design, media and surface factor - allow academic teams to carry out research and students to work closely with companies and organisations."
"First-rate, new research data is transferred directly to education, meaning that the students can avail themselves directly of the latest information needed in the employment market."
"We must, however, carefully consider how and on what terms we want to improve cooperation between companies and universities."
"It is crucially important that we adhere to the principle of the independence of universities and the tradition of free research in all circumstances."
"Ultimately, the danger is the privatisation of the university sector, but is this the direction we in Europe want to go in?"
"The basis of an independent university system is adequate public funding."
"Making universities dependent on private funding is worrying, because it allows the transfer of power from the university community to those providing the finance."
"That is why special attention needs to be paid to the administration systems of universities."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the various rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation."
"As shadow rapporteur on this matter for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am very pleased with the report."
"We have managed to agree on a report containing recommendations for improving cooperation between universities and business - a report that, above all, contains very specific initiatives for modernising universities."
"Europe's universities, as we all know, limp behind the world's elite, a fact which also has major consequences for Europe's competitiveness."
"It is therefore not surprising that education, research and innovation have been given high priority in both the Commission's work programme and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Of course, I hope that the majority will be in favour of following this upgrading of the priority status of this policy with an increase in funding, too."
"We are currently in a situation where we need to think outside the conventional framework of our education systems and we can start by breaking down the walls between universities and the area that benefits from the universities' output, namely business."
"We are focusing on two things, in particular, and I will say a few words about these."
"Firstly, I would like to mention the modernisation of the curriculum."
"It is important for there to be greater focus on interdisciplinarity and development of the skills that are actually demanded by the business world."
"University courses must reflect, to a greater extent, the requirements of the labour market and they must be set up with that in mind, for example, in the form of more business-relevant curricula, which, in turn, the business community should actively help to keep up-to-date."
"The second thing I would like to mention is mobility."
"It is important to reduce the gap between universities and business and for there to be people who bridge this gap."
"Work placements are a good example of how university students can gain practical experience and then subsequently bring that experience into their studies."
"At the same time, these students are better prepared to enter the labour market after their courses."
"Practical placements should definitely be supported and promoted in Europe."
"Research can also build bridges between universities and business."
"I have talked before about a personal hobbyhorse of mine, namely the Danish business PhD scheme, whereby an employee in an undertaking in Denmark can gain a PhD at a Danish university with the help of a public grant."
"In fact, I held an evening of debate in Brussels on 3 February 2010 in Parliament with broad participation from both the business world and universities, and the view that evening was pretty clear: an EU business PhD scheme would be a most useful tool for promoting specialised business-relevant research, as well as competitiveness, in European business, thereby creating more jobs and economic growth."
"It thus received absolutely unequivocal support from both parties."
"Moreover, it is a most effective method of bringing business experience and practical knowledge into universities and thereby making the teaching more focused on skills and knowledge that are relevant to the demands of the labour market."
"The scheme could be integrated into the existing Marie Curie programme, possibly within the Industrial Academic Partnership programme, and would help to strengthen the pursuit of the goals of the Bologna process."
"I am pleased that, tomorrow, we will be able to adopt a report that contains a recommendation to establish just such a scheme."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the value of this report in opening up the debate, within our Parliament, on the position and role of universities in Europe."
"These universities must, in fact, be encouraged to participate in European integration from the inside rather than to contemplate it from the outside."
"Over the course of European history, universities have always been places where meetings are held, knowledge is exchanged, thought is developed and training is delivered in the various disciplines."
"Today, the effects of the crisis and of unemployment must not result in universities restricting their role as providers of professionals who are immediately ready to work because, in our changing societies, the ability to change jobs is becoming vital."
"On the contrary, universities, as places of higher education and training, must also enable learners to become critical, analytical thinkers, because this will enable them to understand the world in which we live and to use their professional skills wisely."
"European universities must create the conditions for lifelong learning, contribute to the enrichment of intellectual life and play a central role in the knowledge-based society of today's digital age."
"Education is definitely our priority objective, but what sort of education?"
"In one issue of The Economist magazine, a study was published according to which 80% of the skills and expertise considered key by managers of large enterprises are not taught at all at universities."
"The result of this is terrible unemployment figures for university graduates."
"We can perhaps all agree that the solution is to develop links between businesses and universities."
"This has been pointed out repeatedly in various documents, including the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities."
"The key issue, however, is how to achieve these links."
"In my view, the correct way would be to incorporate work experience stints lasting several months, not only for students but also for professors, as integral components of the lifelong learning process."
"There is a need not only for students but also for teachers to maintain regular contact with the real world."
"The cofinancing of such work experience stints should become an integral component of university budgets."
"For businesses, this process means investing considerable effort and often considerable costs as well."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me, but I am going to have to destroy the wonderful unanimity which is prevailing in this Chamber."
"The resolution which is being put to us today relates to the challenges in the relations between universities and business in connection with the implementation of the notorious Bologna process."
"An enormous amount of work has been done in the two committees that examined this text, and numerous improvements have been made to the original text to take account of the real challenges in this area."
"We are all trying to understand the aspirations of our young people."
"We are all concerned to provide young people with the best tools to help them find a job."
"The unemployment rate among young people is, in fact, unacceptable."
"Yet does this mean that, as certain paragraphs in the resolution indicate, we should consider universities merely as machines capable of meeting the needs of companies and the world of business, to the exclusion of all else?"
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left Group do not think so."
"No, the wealth of our universities also lies in producing an increasing number of students with rich and diversified intellectual knowledge, not in simply ensuring that they acquire work-related skills."
"That is the real key to lifelong mobility."
"In many EU countries, there is a growing lack of understanding among those in the university world."
"We in the GUE/NGL Group think that we should listen to them."
"We are asking for a comprehensive report on the Bologna process to be drafted."
"We will not be voting for this resolution, which invites universities to merely meet the needs of business, ignoring the other stakeholders in economic and social life, which is not limited solely to businesses."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level?"
"Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed."
"The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities."
"The arts, music, literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today."
"So what of modernisation?"
"Do you look for the technological developments of the future?"
"If so, the scene today is just as promising."
"Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us, but they owe their beginnings to European universities."
"This tide of higher education often returns home."
"The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world, pursuing their studies further and sharing their information, not least with commerce and industry."
"But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes."
"We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other '-ism', that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus."
"If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds, see that universities are funded properly, encourage those students who wish to study abroad, then simply leave them all alone to get on with it."
"(DE) Madam President, as we know, the interlinking of business and universities has been a reality for some time."
"This situation has led to the current mindless 'one solution fits all' approach whereby partly privatised universities are acting as controlling enterprises with the supposed aim of planning educational output."
"Believing that such a partnership will contribute to modernisation all of a sudden only serves to show how lazy and uncreative our education policy debate is."
"We are living in a time of technical revolution."
"Digital systems are changing us, they are changing the way we act and think, our cognitive skills and, ultimately, our brains."
"What we need therefore is a revolution in research and teaching that will adapt to this situation."
"In such a time of change, continuing to preach the dependence of universities on this subsystem of our society as a step towards modernisation, despite the fact that such an interlinking has not led to any significant improvements in the past ten years, also ignores the importance of teaching and research for society as a whole."
"What we really need in this time of change are scientific curiosity and creativity, but these arise from the possibility of free thinking and from not yielding to pressure, and that includes to the demands of the business world."
"A young mind, a young brain with potential must be able to move freely."
"What you have presented here in your report is the exact opposite."
"This report reflects outdated and failed thinking."
"The entire report is uncreative and I would even dare to say useless."
"It is clumsy phrases chained together across many pages to hide the fact that it lacks substance."
"In the Austrian education system, you would be given a straight fail for this report."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to say to Mr Ehrenhauser that he should pay a visit to our universities and see for himself how creative they are and also that no student is in a position of dependence just because he or she might have been granted a bursary from business."
"That also applies to Mr Repo and Mrs Vergiat."
"We should focus on making sure that cooperation between education and business takes into account small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular."
"We also need to ensure that SMEs are given better, faster and less bureaucratic treatment in the context of research programmes."
"That is important and has also been stated in this report, Mr Ehrenhauser."
"If you had read that, you would have realised this is something totally new."
"Therefore, what we need in this area is enhanced cooperation when it comes to universities and SMEs."
"We need this cooperation at local, national and international level."
"If business and universities cooperate, we cannot assume that one will necessarily learn from the other, because one is training those whom the other might someday employ in their company."
"In this respect, we should ensure that money can flow from business to universities, because public authorities have less and less money and cannot afford to make additional resources available in these areas."
"I am grateful to every business entrepreneur and to small, medium-sized and large businesses that provide money for education because what they are doing, ultimately, is educating the next generation which will further promote economic growth."
"We must support universities."
"We need to ensure closer cooperation between public institutions and the private sector and provide scope for private innovation funds."
"This report therefore strikes precisely the right chord."
"Obviously, we also need people to be trained by those who know what it means to have an entrepreneurial spirit and who know what it means to be a manager."
"We must ensure that teachers and students are equipped with the right box of tools and that we encourage business to participate in actively developing teaching materials for entrepreneurship."
"The comments made by Mr Repo and Mr Ehrenhauser are not in line with the facts and I would like to object to the report being called stupid and dull."
"No, it is good."
"I wish to thank Mr Pál Schmitt, who is presently speaker of the Hungarian Parliament."
"Madam President, most of us here are agreed that we should be supporting our universities and supporting our young people."
"Although I believe - as I think most of us do - that universities are, and should be, autonomous, of course, they also live in the real world and need to take account of what happens in the real world, not least because their students will be leaving them to get jobs in the real world."
"I think that is really what we are talking about."
"We are talking about how the universities can maintain their academic excellence, yet prepare their students for work."
"That is why this dialogue - the contact between universities and the business sector - is so very important, why we have spent such a long time working it through and why Mr Schmitt spent such a long time writing this report."
"What we need is a real dialogue between employers, and employers at all levels, I think."
"I agree that SMEs are important but I think we are also looking at talking to large corporations and also to the public sector, to government employers at national, regional and at local level, the health sector and really all those who employ people, because it is in that way that we will make sure that we get the level of graduate unemployment down and we give our young people a chance."
"Within this, it is very important that we maintain adequate levels of state funding for universities - something which I know in some Member States is becoming more and more of an issue."
"Unless we get that money and unless universities are properly and adequately funded, we will not have balanced courses, we will not have balanced discipline and we will not be able to give our students the chances that they need."
"So, I urge everyone to support this important report and to vote for it so that we can go forward and have a bright future for universities, for students and for employers."
"(PL) Firstly, I would like to express my thanks for the recognition given to my amendment, which invites countries from outside the European Union to the forum for dialogue to which Mr Oettinger referred."
"This will allow us to benefit from the experience of American universities, which, in my opinion, are the best universities in the world, and it would be good if our universities could benefit from them and, at the same time, share our experience with other countries, such as the countries of the Former Soviet Union."
"However, what seems to me, here, to be the most important aspect is to emphasise that in this dialogue between the worlds of business and universities, we should not forget that the university - a school of higher education - is an independent, autonomous institution whose objective is the search for truth - a disinterested search for truth."
"This is how universities arose in Italy, Germany, France and Poland, and I think we should not forget that this goal should also guide universities today, while cooperation with business should not hinder or restrict that noble work of searching for truth - the disinterested search for truth."
"(PT) Madam President, universities are the backbone of Europe; they are probably our best creation."
"There was Europe in the 12th century universities of Bologna, Coimbra, Oxford and the Sorbonne long before there was political Europe."
"However, the world of business and business management that we know today is 30 or 40 years old: it dates from since the War."
"This is one of the few times that a left-leaning Member will ask you a conservative question, so make the most of it."
"Do we really want to dedicate ourselves to a centuries-old European creation or to a business ideology that is a few decades old?"
"Dedicating ourselves to the world of business, as we have been doing in recent decades, is dedicating ourselves inevitably to the short term, and that is what this is about."
"Training plastics engineers now to be unemployed in three years time, to then train a type of financial manager who will be unemployed after four years;"
"I want to ask the European countries of Portugal and Estonia a question."
"What would you prefer?"
"Would you prefer your children to have an education that follows the short-term dictates of the market, or would you prefer that they have the most solid and broadest education possible as has always been the case in European universities?"
"Would you prefer their education to enable them to be in the labour market now, or for the next few decades and the rest of their lives?"
"I leave you with that question."
"(SK) First, I would like to congratulate our fellow Member, the author of this report, on his election to the new and important role of speaker of the Hungarian Parliament."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to express the hope that Pál Schmitt, through his wisdom, broad political outlook, and calm and prudent speeches in this role, will help to make a lasting improvement in Hungary's coexistence with her neighbours."
"I would now like to turn to the new partnership for modernising universities."
"In my opinion, the key statement in the entire text is expressed in the introduction to item 2 of the draft opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where it is written, and I quote, 'that the challenges mentioned in the Commission's notification are not new and so far, there has not been a successful response to them.'"
"To put it more simply, the Commission has produced a vision, repeating and issuing challenges, possibly in the hope that this will achieve something, but there has unfortunately been no significant improvement in this area so far."
"Perhaps it would therefore be wiser, Commissioner, to conduct a thorough analysis as soon as possible into the reasons why the previous challenges did not produce the desired result, and then to come up with a pragmatic definition of new and genuinely effective measures for achieving real cooperation of a high standard between universities and manufacturing companies."
"(GA) Madam President, Pádraig Ó Conaire once wrote a book entitled 'M'Asal Beag Dubh' [My Small Black Donkey] in which he said that the donkey was standing 'with his back to the wind, ignoring life while life ignored him'."
"That description could apply, with respect, to university professors in the past as well, as they lived in their ivory towers immune from the world and the world immune from them, but, thankfully, that now has all changed, and changed utterly."
"In recent times, I have seen three great examples of that."
"Firstly, in my own town of Tralee, the Institute was awarded the European Entrepreneurial Region of the Year Award for their work in business and in entrepreneurial establishment."
"Secondly, in my conversations and meetings with the new professor and President of University College Cork, I have learned that they are really getting engaged with the business community and vice versa."
"Most encouraging of all is that we were in Santiago a few weeks ago and the university there had developed a fantastic model of involvement with the business community and had even created its own bank to encourage start-up companies who often cannot get funding to get the companies going."
"We at European Union level can do a lot in encouraging them, creating the opportunities for development, and also establishing the coordination of research that can be eventually turned into the knowledge economy and the smart jobs we are talking about."
"Madam President, academics are, by nature, an argumentative group, so as a former university lecturer and course director, it has been with great interest that I followed a very public debate in Ireland between academics over the future direction of Irish universities."
"Where these academics converge is in the agreement that universities remain one of Europe's great innovations and that their continued success is essential to the future social, political and economic success of the European Union."
"However, economic success must not be confused with social development, in society as in university; and so this crossroads we have come to in third-level education, with traditional student-based learning in one direction, and the demands of modern business-driven economies in the other, must be navigated with the greatest of care."
"Profit growth and modern development are integral elements of today's universities, but, with many faculties unrelated to business and profit-driven professions - and I am thinking of arts and the humanities in particular - it is important that, in order to retain a balance between both economic and intellectual success, modern universities retain some essential academic links with their more financially naive past."
"(RO) Unfortunately, education curricula place too much emphasis on theory, which means that students encounter problems when they enter the labour market."
"Their education must be provided more on the basis of a practical perspective and dealing with real problems encountered in the economic environment."
"This is why I believe that relations between the academic and business worlds need to be strengthened."
"In addition, universities need to be more receptive to the business world so that they can better adapt their education offering to the labour market's demands."
"This will enable students to acquire the qualifications and develop the skills required by employers."
"A number of Member States, such as France, Germany, Italy, the UK or Spain, have been developing partnerships between universities and the business world for a number of years."
"In Romania last year, a project was launched with European Union funding, which involved 20 faculties receiving new curricula adapted to the labour market's current requirements."
"One of the project's major benefits is that it cuts unemployment by improving the quality of the educational offering and reduces the number of graduates with degrees which cannot be adapted to the labour market."
"These partnerships must not be confined just to within individual Member States."
"In the current situation, I support the promotion and extension of the Erasmus programmes for young entrepreneurs and for trainees."
"(RO) I wish to begin by congratulating Pál Schmitt for the coherent and relevant report on the current situation in higher education."
"We have a major problem, which is that, at the moment, we are turning out unemployed people in every one of the European Union's 27 Member States rather than young people who are completely geared up for the labour market."
"There is a huge chasm between what young people are learning at school and what employers require on the labour market."
"This problem is exacerbated even further as we are currently in an economic and financial crisis, where there is also an obvious jobs crisis."
"The European Union has been a player on the global market for very many years, with an economy based, in particular, on knowledge and innovation."
"If we actually want to have an economy based on knowledge and innovation, we must progress beyond the discussion stage and support more investment and public-private partnerships and encourage partnerships between universities and the business world so that discoveries which are made and the results of scientific research in universities can be utilised in the real economy."
"I, too, was in Santiago de Compostela with Seán Kelly where we visited the local university."
"I can tell you that we saw a very clear model for funding start-ups and small firms launched by students where the university provides credit to students without any guarantees."
"The products successfully developed by the students at the university have an immediate practical use in the local economy."
"This is a model which we need to promote and replicate across the EU."
"(PL) This report is related to the important objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I will remind you all that over a 10-year period, the number of people with higher education is to rise by 10% - from 30% to 40% - and spending by Member States on research and development is to rise to 3%."
"It is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research."
"We should, therefore, thoroughly investigate the systems which have been the most successful in other parts of the world."
"I am talking about American methods related to partnership between business and university, and how to adapt all the results of scientific research to the market, so that what are often wonderful scientific achievements are not left on the shelf but are put to practical use, which means in business."
"Another matter is the need for the effective introduction of a system of education grants and attracting businesses into the system."
"Doctoral programmes should be strongly supported, using the European Social Fund and programmes which are already in existence, such as the Marie Curie programme."
"How can clear schemes of public partnership be created, mainly as part of technology parks and enterprise incubators?"
"How can we get involved with small and medium-sized enterprises, and also get students involved with SMEs?"
"All these things are very important."
"I think it is important not to invest exclusively in the area of technology, either, which is an important area."
"We should also invest in a system for arts and humanities, which should also have an area of cooperation with public bodies and with business."
"A final remark: today, China has as many students as there are in the whole of the European Union."
"Therefore, talking about achieving common objectives is our common task, and I think the participation of business in the dialogue will be an effective way of beating competition from around the world."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would like to express our support for the work of the EU Forum for University Business Dialogue."
"We believe it to be a good instrument with which to strengthen such important relations as those between the public and private sectors."
"We are convinced that in times of economic crisis, when young people have greater problems in finding a job and companies are facing greater competitive pressure, this collaboration represents an added economic and social value that affords it even greater priority."
"It is a dialogue and cooperation that must flow in both directions, from supply and from demand, and must extend to national and regional levels in order to identify the best practices, the best policies and the best instruments."
"We agree that fostering personnel mobility between research centres and companies, promoting private sector investment in R&D, and ensuring that universities provide the job market with well prepared personnel, are all essential actions."
"The European Union is already taking important steps in this direction, such as support for technological platforms, for joint technological initiatives and any public-private partnership formula, as well as for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, given that these are extremely interesting initiatives on the right track, and ones that we must continue to encourage."
"Lastly, Madam President, those of us on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on his appointment."
"(PL) The Forum for University Business Dialogue which has been opened by the Commission strengthens cooperation between universities and businesses so that universities can be helped to initiate partnerships by making use of their scientific and technological knowledge."
"This is a good idea if we want to make the European economy dynamic and truly competitive."
"I would like, however, to point out several flaws in the Commission's proposal."
"Some of the recommendations are too general and leave too much open to interpretation, such as the term 'university' in relation to all institutions of tertiary education, irrespective of their status."
"There are no research instruments for determining shortages of qualifications in the labour market."
"Neither is there mention of any kind of system for education and training which would allow those shortages to be reduced."
"With regard to the lifelong learning programme, it does not take account of the particular situation of people who do not possess a university education."
"In summary, the chosen course of strengthening cooperation between universities and businesses does appear to answer the current needs of the market."
"The most important roles, however, fall to the Member States, which have to ensure effective implementation of the proposals if we want to achieve the intended plans."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the first review of the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union is already looking towards the next 10 years."
"Among the priorities of Europe 2020, that of smart growth based on both the knowledge economy and on innovation stands out."
"The key for proceeding in this direction is integrating the systems of secondary and tertiary education with the labour market."
"The course to follow entails renewed attention to the world of work together with the learning of personal skills, or rather the so-called 'knowledge triangle'."
"Europe can therefore secure its relevance in the international arena if, in science and innovation, it acts in a more unified manner and involves everyone in a position to determine both growth and development."
"In this context, systems of appraising universities in order to establish and measure efficiency and quality standards are more than opportune."
"It is therefore time to move towards that new dimension of European unity known as the 'fifth freedom', or the free movement of knowledge and talent."
"To this end, there must be a European proposal to simplify the work of young researchers via organic links with business in order to meet their development needs."
"In order to attain these objectives, there must be greater investment in programmes such as Erasmus."
"By so doing, study beyond national borders with guaranteed academic recognition for students will be encouraged."
"(RO) At a time when we need new instruments to kick-start economic growth, I believe that it is important for us to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with easier access to research and development."
"Many of these companies suffer due to their difficulty in accessing funding, which means that they are unable to design and develop new products or redesign existing products, thereby encountering a loss of competitiveness."
"What would be desirable is for universities, especially those receiving public funding, to be more receptive to the needs of the SME sector."
"Cutting red tape combined with an increase in public funding for research and development programmes which can generate technologies or products that can be transferred to SMEs could facilitate access to funding for these programmes under the Structural Funds."
"Universities can also contribute to training the SMEs' staff as part of the lifelong learning process."
"The launch of a single European network of business and innovation centres is encouraging."
"I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur."
"(RO) We must ask ourselves what direction we want our education and research systems to go in."
"There is a huge amount of talk about the knowledge-based society, but I wonder whether this concept has not just become a sound bite which goes down well in the media."
"I think that there is too little talk about skills in this context and too much about accumulating knowledge."
"If you carry out a survey among students, you will see that writing essays has become a practice involving the use of a few platitudes to fill up the space requested by teachers."
"There are some who will need to get involved in an economic environment where the recipes for success are no longer guaranteed."
"I think that the business world will not be alone in facing a radical overhaul as a result of the economic and financial crisis."
"This will apply to universities too, which will have to undergo certain transformations so that they can adapt to an environment in constant flux, requiring the acquisition of skills and not just knowledge."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate Pál Schmitt on two counts: on his new post and for his well-structured, comprehensive report, which will definitely enhance the effectiveness of relations between the business and academic worlds in Europe."
"At a time when all the strategies we have adopted are stipulating the need to have well-educated citizens, with skills which are compatible with the demands of the labour market, I feel that a specific measure aimed at improving the interconnection between both areas is welcome."
"I think that a change in attitude is required across the EU, along with a business environment which will help the university curriculum to adapt, just like in North America, through launching and funding specific courses."
"This will help familiarise students with the rigorous requirements of entrepreneurship and will also make European higher education more attractive globally."
"The practical impact must be to offer society added value and provide knowledge and results from the cooperation between universities and companies, thereby generating economic growth and, by extension, a better living for our citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly."
"It would appear that my fellow Member does not know the difference between training and education."
"In times when technology is taking away most of our work, it is increasingly important that universities educate citizens into mature and analytical people."
"That is just what we need."
"We therefore need people who are capable of asking searching questions about social processes."
"After all, business does not set itself such an objective."
"Business wants to train people and is entitled to do that, that is all well and good."
"However, that is only a requirement from one subsystem of our society and it does not represent what we need in a society as a whole."
"Let me make another brief comment: we need scientific creativity and scientific curiosity."
"I do not accept the view, and I certainly do not believe, that business is able to buy the curiosity and the creativity that we so desperately need through their financial input."
"No!"
"(PL) Research, scientific progress and educating students are the main roles of universities."
"The priorities of the Lisbon Strategy are, put briefly, a knowledge-based economy, innovation and scientific research."
"Even if we do not find the results of the strategy satisfying, the objectives set in the strategy are still relevant."
"What ways are there to put into effect these principles and objectives?"
"Firstly, cooperation between universities, the economy and specific businesses, and the financing of scientific research and work experience by business."
"Secondly, exchanges of students and researchers between the universities of different countries, and increasing the funds available for their support."
"Thirdly, financing by businesses of student work experience placements and scientific research which they have ordered."
"Fourthly: mobility of staff is important in order to be able to make full use of educated people."
"Fifthly: development of research and development centres in the area of the economy."
"Finally, I would like to say that the best investment is an investment in the education of the young generation, and I mean lifelong education."
"(RO) I partially agree with the rapporteur."
"I wish to say that in order to achieve the EU 2020 strategy objectives, we need knowledge and innovation."
"We are not talking about purchasing knowledge, but about investing in an education system which is adapted to market requirements."
"At the moment, universities in the European Union offer researchers and students less attractive conditions than the colleges in the United States."
"One of the main reasons for this is the lack of money."
"As was also emphasised by the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, Europeans are competing against each other to attract the best footballers. However, they are losing their researchers to the Americans."
"It is therefore absolutely necessary to revamp Europe's universities so that they can play a decisive role in society and in an economy based on knowledge and innovation."
"One solution to assuage the discontent of employers, who believe that university education does not take into account the requirements of the labour market and does not prepare students to face the current climate, is for university programmes to offer students opportunities to carry out practical work placements in SMEs."
"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for a lively debate and for your many proposals and ideas."
"I believe that there is broad agreement in this House that the dialogue between universities and the working world and business can be beneficial for everyone involved, for the universities themselves, researchers, lecturers, students, businesses and for society as a whole."
"In my opinion, this is not a case of 'whether' but 'how', that is, how we can develop dialogue and cooperation."
"This is about knowledge transfer, about dialogue and information exchange during education and lifelong learning, it is about cooperation in basic research and about fostering a more practical approach alongside the theoretical one in education through insight into business value creation and manufacturing."
"Business does not have a supplanting role here, but a complementary one, and the crucial point is that research will remain free just as teaching will."
"It will make its own decision in this regard; it will not be forced into this by politicians."
"We need a win-win situation, that is, one in which science and teaching institutions, on the one hand, and research and business, on the other, will say 'yes' to this partnership."
"Freedom of research and teaching does not mean floating in a vacuum, but being involved in society and the world of employment."
"For that reason, I believe that this report is a good stock-take and it makes it clear what route we need to take in order to reinforce our universities and strengthen the competitiveness of European business and technology."
"With our forum, we want to make a small contribution, offer a platform and consider how our forum's activities can be supplemented."
"The report provides a good basis for that and is a good source of reference, and for that I am very grateful."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish again to thank the Commission for its communication, which we have adopted for the most part."
"I should just like to dwell on a perhaps critical aspect that has emerged in this debate, because someone emphasised how fundamental the independence of universities, freedom of research and public financing are."
"We are all agreed on this, and that is why I fail to understand these critical remarks, because it is enough to read the report, where, in the very first paragraphs, we have written very clearly and stress that the intellectual and financial independence of higher education institutions vis-à-vis business must be maintained and no relations of dependency on business must arise on the part of higher education."
"It also emphasises that universities should, in all circumstances, maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures."
"This dispels any problems or doubts whatsoever in this area, which is why I do not understand what these problems could be, unless it is a question of old-fashioned ideological exploitation."
"Let us accordingly really give some thought to this, since this report sets out the conditions for effectively improving the lot of our young people and our students, because there is truly no one who wants to leave hundreds of thousands of youngsters in the hands of who knows what business purposes but, on the contrary, only wants hundreds of thousands of students to have the opportunity of studying, training and working in the society that awaits them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 20 May, at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, European graduates must have the experience and the high-quality skills required to take advantage of good career opportunities, to be competitive in the world market and to encourage entrepreneurship in Europe."
"When building a knowledge-based economy, dialogue and the relationship it promotes between business, research and education is very important."
"Although the Member States are responsible for providing education, there are major advantages in establishing cross-border links and in promoting enhanced cooperation between the European business community and European universities."
"I strongly support the rapporteur's efforts to seek undertakings and commitments between universities and businesses, and I agree that this dialogue should focus not only on scientific and technological matters but on all areas of education."
"European graduates must have strong skills that are suitable for employment and they must have easy access to highly important programmes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and for Apprentices."
"Education and training courses must be restructured to recognise the needs of the workforce and of the knowledge-based economy."
"In recent months, research has been undertaken in my country of Lithuania on adapting institutions of higher education to the new needs of the labour market and the creation of opportunities for graduates to find employment as soon as they have completed their higher education."
"Sadly, the research showed that many universities prepare specialists that the market already has in abundance."
"In other words, universities do not always take market needs into account and the ones worst affected by this are the young people who have just finished their studies."
"Therefore, I completely agree with the initiative to provide for a specific strategy or system in future into which we would pour a lot of effort and commitment to strengthen the links between universities and business at local, regional, national, and international level."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the shortage of jobs and difficult working conditions have an impact on the life of every individual, and young people in this situation are particularly vulnerable."
"I would also like to underline that due to the dynamic market, the fast-changing working environment and the ever-increasing development of new technologies, institutions of higher education also have to adapt to the new changes - they must improve and reform curricula in order to ensure a high level of education and solve the question of graduate employment."
"The input of universities alone is not enough; business and government must also contribute to this process."
"The dialogue between the academic community and business, which is intended to modernise universities in Europe, should take account of their present condition, which is adapted to the Bologna process, and should also take account of the economic challenges related to innovation."
"The Bologna process enables a significant amount of flexibility in educating specialists who, as technical students at first degree level, prepare for a profession in a practical way."
"At masters level, they can approach interdisciplinary knowledge about the economy in a developing world with flexibility, while at doctoral level, they provide innovative solutions."
"Universities which educate in a conservative way release into the market specialists who are not useful to an innovative economy."
"Therefore, study programmes should be constantly corrected and agreed on with respect to the needs of different branches of the economy."
"Bringing the work of universities closer to the needs of industry is helped by lectures on enterprise and the issue of intellectual property."
"It is beneficial if undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral dissertations relate thematically to the requirements of the economy or arise directly in response to its needs."
"This is the best pretext for conducting dialogue between the two communities - science and business."
"It would be possible to influence the probability of innovative success to an even greater extent if the practical part of these dissertations was carried out directly in the place where they might one day be put to use."
"An important element of the cooperation of universities with the economy is student work placements, which currently are not organised very willingly because of the costs."
"Furthermore, universities should offer postgraduate courses for people in industry which would cover the latest achievements in science and technology."
"We are tired of hearing young Europeans say, 'They would have hired me if I had experience, but no one will give me the chance to gain any.'"
"The current economic crisis has hit them particularly hard, and they already had trouble entering the labour market and building a sustainable future for themselves prior to the crisis."
"Unemployment among the under-25 age group has reached 21.4% in the EU: double that of the population average."
"The data is not encouraging: unemployment rates seem set to rise, and we are concerned that, by the age of 30, young people with an outstanding education are not yet able to enjoy the economic autonomy necessary to form a family, to be independent, to invest in their future; namely, to show what they are worth and grow as people."
"We want a European Union based on the central role of the individual."
"Our young people must be able to rely on a strong, continuing link between the training that they receive at university and a labour market which can offer them employment possibilities consistent with what they learned during their studies."
"We are calling for coordination between universities and businesses, a review of European programmes aimed at young people and systems of allowances and incentives for the businesses which hire them, together with greater emphasis on information technology, so that policies for young people can be included in all areas of political decision and debate."
"The EU set itself the objective of becoming the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic power by 2010."
"The quickly changing employment situation, the knowledge-based economy and ever accelerating technological development are issues which European higher education and scientific activity currently have to deal with."
"At the same time, the economic crisis engulfing Europe, which has affected European competitiveness and brought about extensive changes in the financial and economic markets, has caused the bankruptcy of whole branches of manufacturing and the loss of many jobs, among other things."
"All of this makes it more difficult to achieve the objectives set out by the EU."
"In the present situation, I think it is important to have more dialogue between universities and entrepreneurs, because improved cooperation will provide greater opportunities for mutual benefit, which later would not just stimulate economic growth but would also be beneficial in a wider social sense, supporting the continuous improvement of a society based on action."
"I think that the Member States must also concentrate a lot more on encouraging people to adapt constantly to the changing job market - which is of prime importance for the European Union, especially during the present economic slump - by promoting lifelong learning."
"Supplementary training and retraining in all stages of life is essential for increasing Europe's competitiveness, for economic growth and for fostering jobs."
"Also taking into account the demographic changes taking place in the EU, I think that in the coming years, the Member States must raise the levels of investment in people, giving priority to the EU's most important resource - its people."
"As Mr Schmitt's excellent report highlights, university-business partnerships are one of the major components of the success of our educational model."
"Even though much progress has already been made as a result of the Bologna process and of programmes such as the Leonardo programme for work experience placements, there is still work to be done."
"Too many universities are still worrying about their academic independence and focusing too much on knowledge at the expense of skills."
"Too many companies believe universities are impervious to the needs of the workplace."
"The fact is, skills and knowledge are closely connected and completely interdependent."
"Companies may be of huge assistance to universities when it comes to providing finance, making syllabuses more vocational, and adapting programmes, if, at the same time, universities maintain their autonomy and their quality standards."
"The EU must help simplify the legal frameworks that facilitate these partnerships and encourage the mobility of teachers and young entrepreneurs."
"However, above all, it is up to the Member States to adapt their legislation, as France did in 2007 with its law on the autonomy of universities."
"We are not talking here about 'marketing' knowledge, as some people are claiming, but about creating a real dialogue which enables the needs of each individual to be identified and adapted."
"Community financial assistance with respect to the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria - 'Kozloduy Programme' (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Harms, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on Community financial assistance with respect to the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria - 'Kozloduy Programme' - C7-0289/2009 - 2009/0172(NLE))."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission and my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for exciting and interesting debates on nuclear waste management."
"We did not always agree, but one thing on which we did agree is that we should provide joint European support to Bulgaria for meeting the costs of decommissioning the four reactor units in Kozloduy."
"At this point, I would like to strongly re-emphasise that in 2006, Bulgaria received EUR 340 million, in the 2007-2008 period, EUR 253 million, and in 2009, EUR 89.5 million."
"In tomorrow's vote, we will be deciding on further solidarity contributions amounting to some EUR 300 million."
"This contribution is being granted because, when negotiating accession to the European Union, the Bulgarian Government agreed to decommission these reactors as a result of the security deficiencies of the Kozloduy plants."
"In my report, I have sought to bring about a change to the final tranche of this payment that we are now deciding (I assume this is the final tranche)."
"I propose that the money which is no longer directly being spent on decommissioning and waste management, that is, waste strategies for temporary storage, in Kozloduy, and we are talking about some EUR 120 million, at least be partly invested in the planning and preparation of the final disposal solution for highly radioactive waste in Bulgaria."
"In other words, I propose that we set up a fund for this task which Bulgaria has not addressed at all to date."
"While I have not been successful in rallying the majority in the committees behind this idea, I do think that this is an important matter."
"I have submitted amendments again for two things to be retained in the compromise solution that is being negotiated by the committees for tomorrow's vote."
"First of all, as regards decommissioning, waste management and final disposal, which also includes temporary storage, I would ask that the Commission very closely monitor the exact cost of what is happening in Kozloduy and how much money we will actually need to ensure decommissioning, waste management and final disposal are carried out thoroughly and according to high safety standards."
"The second thing I would like us to ensure is that the money which is now being sent to Bulgaria is not used for investment in coal or lignite."
"That has not been ruled out in the current draft of the report adopted by the committee."
"For the rest, I am pleased that this report will usher in a lively political debate, as it were, with Commissioner Oettinger about the final disposal of nuclear waste in general and one that will hopefully move things forward."
"The directive has been announced and I eagerly await it."
"Mr President, honourable Members, on the third evening of this plenary session there is another energy-related subject on the agenda."
"This evening, it concerns extending the financial assistance provided by the EU for decommissioning the reactor units at the Kozloduy power plant in Bulgaria."
"This is a sensitive and important subject."
"As a result, I very much welcome the constructive working atmosphere and I would like to thank you for that."
"The subject has been discussed with Mrs Harms, the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the relevant committees in a very businesslike manner."
"I am also pleased that the report largely follows the Commission's views and supports our proposal."
"Firstly, I would like to mention your support for providing initial financing of EUR 300 million from the European budget, in line with EU interests, and therefore for maintaining safety levels in the nuclear industry."
"Secondly, I would like to add that the additional aid should be directed at decommissioning and that the amount required, which at present is EUR 180 million, is reasonable."
"My third point is that, as a result of insufficient financial reserves in the Republic of Bulgaria for historical reasons, the European funding is helping to ensure high levels of safety during the decommissioning work in order to protect people and the environment."
"As far as the current amendments are concerned, I would like to emphasise that the majority of the proposed amendments will be accepted by the Commission."
"Unfortunately, I cannot go into all of them due to a lack of time."
"I would like to explain the Commission's view on two subjects which are very important to us and which are addressed directly in the report, both in the amendments and in Mrs Harms' explanatory statement."
"I am referring firstly to the continuation of financial support for measures in the energy sector."
"In addition to the specific wishes of the Bulgarian Government, several other arguments can be used to justify the necessity of further financial support for measures in the energy sector."
"These include, on the one hand, equal treatment with Lithuania and Slovakia, where corresponding measures funded by the EU will be under way until 2013 and, on the other, other measures to create replacement capacity, including further investments in energy efficiency."
"There are huge potential energy savings to be made in Bulgaria's existing coal-fired power stations."
"Following the decommissioning of the nuclear reactors, the focus of generating capacity in Bulgaria has changed."
"As a result, the Bulgarian power grid is faced with extensive challenges, which can be overcome with additional aid, in order to stabilise and safeguard the electricity network."
"The Commission therefore feels that it is appropriate to continue to guarantee support for measures in the energy sector, including measures relating to the network infrastructure."
"I would now like to look at the subject of support for the development of a geological final disposal solution for irradiated fuel elements."
"The Commission supports the rapporteur's view with regard to the need to develop a solution for the secure final disposal of irradiated fuel elements. However, the development of a solution of this kind cannot be included in the financial aid provided in the Kozloduy Programme for the following reasons:"
"It would distort competition, because all the Member States with a nuclear energy programme are required to develop a solution of this kind."
"Although the final disposal of irradiated fuel elements is part of nuclear waste management, it is outside the scope of the decommissioning process and is not relevant to it."
"What is needed is a secure temporary storage solution for irradiated fuel elements, which will be covered by the current financial support."
"The development of a final storage solution, which we believe to be the next logical step, is nevertheless not a consequence of the closure and decommissioning of the four reactor units at Kozloduy."
"However, I must emphasise that the Commission, as has already been mentioned, will tackle the subject of final storage and produce a proposal this year for the management of radioactive waste, which will also include the development of secure final storage solutions for irradiated fuel elements."
"I am relying on you to make constructive proposals and I am also looking forward to an exciting debate."
"Finally, I would like to summarise the situation as follows."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that it has Parliament's agreement to support Bulgaria over the next four years with the sum of EUR 300 million."
"We also welcome the fact that we can continue to focus on providing support for safe dismantling measures."
"In addition, we are pleased that Parliament believes that projects in the energy sector deserve our support."
"I see the agreement on further financing and its implementation as a sign of the European Union's solidarity with Bulgaria and as an important contribution to nuclear safety in Europe and beyond. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to express my support for the European Commission's approach to this proposal and report, as was voted on in committee."
"I am extremely pleased to see that the line which I defended in my draft report has been presented in the final text and that the European Parliament can now give a clear go-ahead to extending financial assistance from the Community for decommissioning Units 1-4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant."
"Bulgaria has shown a conscientious attitude in its use of the funds for decommissioning the plant by 2009."
"The EU's assistance needs to be extended to guarantee safe and timely completion of the decommissioning operations, which have been carried out with the utmost transparency and protection for the environment."
"The extension of the financial assistance to fund measures aimed at mitigating the consequences of early decommissioning of the four reactors is especially important, taking into account the impact on and consequences for the environment, consumer energy prices and energy supply security in the region."
"Certain attempts were made to exert pressure on this dossier for political and ideological reasons."
"However, we must bear in mind the ultimate objectives of this programme, namely, guaranteed safe decommissioning and fair compensation for Bulgaria, support for the efforts made towards devising a more sustainable energy policy and a demonstration of transparency when managing projects and resources."
"I would like to say to Mrs Harms that the issue of the final disposal of radioactive waste is very serious."
"Particular attention must be focused on this, but it is not an issue which only Bulgaria will face."
"It is a general challenge as a result of which we need to have a strategy and programme specifically devised for the whole of Europe."
"I would also like to assure you, Mrs Harms, that Bulgaria does not intend to use these funds for further development of heating plants powered by lignite."
"You should rest assured that we are intending to meet all our requirements and fall completely into line with European legislation and state-of-the-art technologies in Europe."
"Bulgaria is a highly responsible country and will always endeavour to be a good and decent partner."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask you all to try and speak more slowly, because our esteemed interpreters are constantly sending me SOS messages telling me that they are unable to follow us when we speak very fast."
"The problem is, therefore, that the only Members listening to you are those who can do so in the original language."
"Consequently, I would ask you to make an effort to slow down."
"Otherwise, interpretation will be impossible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the negotiations on accession to the European Union, Bulgaria agreed, under pressure from certain political forces, to close four of the units at its Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, and fulfilled this commitment exactly within the envisaged timeframes."
"For its part, the European Union granted financial assistance as part of the Accession Treaty, restricted to the 2007-2009 period only, with the aim of supporting decommissioning and dealing with the consequences of closing the units early."
"The European Union also gave political guarantees for continuing to provide Community support for the 2010-2013 period."
"This would mean giving the same treatment to our country, at least during the periods of financial support, as to Lithuania and Slovakia, which are also committed to dismantling their nuclear capacity early."
"This is why, at my country's specific insistence and in keeping with the principles of solidarity and equality of Member States, the European Commission drafted the current proposal."
"The amount of the additional funding cannot compensate in any way for the losses the country has suffered running into billions of euro due to the premature dismantling of the units."
"At the same time, this assistance is absolutely necessary for implementing the further process of decommissioning for which the majority of the total is intended to be used."
"No less important for the country is the funding earmarked for measures aimed at modernising the energy sector, reducing harmful emissions, and at improving energy efficiency and savings."
"This report, which was approved by a huge majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, reflects these needs completely."
"This is why we find unacceptable new attempts being made through new amendments being tabled during the plenary session to push through texts against coal plants or to present the direct disposal of the spent nuclear fuel as a foregone conclusion."
"This issue will be a topic of discussion in the European Union from now on."
"On this basis, I suggest that we support the proposal from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and reject the five new amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by thanking the Commission and Commissioner Oettinger personally for the extremely skilful job they have done in producing the document which he is submitting."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Harms, for the efforts she has invested in discussing this document to ensure that it contains topics which are very important to Europe's citizens."
"The fundamental purpose of the document is to support Bulgaria's efforts in decommissioning four of the six units at its nuclear power plant."
"I will not comment on how justified this decision was, but once it is incorporated in the Accession Treaty, this obligation must be fulfilled by the Bulgarian authorities."
"They are, in fact, taking all the necessary action in this respect."
"At the same time, the early closure of such a huge facility, provided for in the economic calculations, entails a huge direct and indirect cost."
"Part of this cost is being compensated by the European Union."
"This decision being tabled today will enable the European Union to put its approach to Bulgaria on the same footing as the approach adopted for two other countries, new European Union Member States, which have assumed and are fulfilling the same commitments."
"It is very important to adhere to the same approach because it is our duty to maintain the coherence of the European Union's policy."
"Sixty per cent of the resources allocated will be used directly for decommissioning the facilities at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, while the remaining 40% will be used for improving energy efficiency and cutting carbon dioxide emissions in Bulgaria."
"I would like to draw particular attention to some very appropriate points which were raised during the discussion in the committees by the rapporteur, Mrs Harms, and which were discussed very widely."
"The first matter concerns the fate of the waste from the spent nuclear fuel and irradiated elements."
"This issue was also mentioned today by Commissioner Oettinger."
"This is an extremely vital matter on which we are expecting the European Commission to table an individual directive in the autumn."
"The European Parliament will then have the opportunity to discuss this matter in depth, which, I am sure, is important to many European citizens."
"As a result of this, I do not think that Parliament's decision on the issue which we are discussing about compensation for Kozloduy needs to prejudge our debate in the autumn."
"In addition, I fully agree with the Commission's argument that if a precedent is created once for funding such a programme, it will then pose a threat to the whole European Union budget."
"Naturally, this does not waive or reduce in any way the responsibility of the governments in the countries which have such facilities to find a definitive solution to the issue of spent nuclear fuel."
"The second matter concerns the use of the resources."
"There is no doubt that the resources received from the European Union must not be used to finance projects which increase carbon dioxide emissions."
"Incidentally, based on the experience so far in both Bulgaria and the other two countries receiving such resources, there is no indication of any such abuses."
"However, what I think we need to see in this text is a coherent European policy and the adoption of the same approach to all."
"It is of paramount importance to European citizens that these resources are used for their intended purpose transparently and effectively."
"The resources allocated by the European Union to Bulgaria go into a special fund which also includes sums from other donors."
"Based on programmes approved beforehand and under the control of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the resources from this fund, along with appropriate national funding, are allocated to the relevant projects."
"The European Court of Auditors will carry out an audit very soon of these funds, including those in Bulgaria."
"I believe that the European Parliament will also monitor closely in future how these resources are used."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as rapporteur on investments in energy infrastructure and shadow rapporteur on security of gas supply, I am very sensitive to issues of energy security."
"I think Europe has a key role to play in this field."
"As a Romanian MEP, I have even more interest in this particular issue of the Kozloduy nuclear plant."
"Being on the border of my country, it has long been a matter of preoccupation in Romania for obvious environmental reasons."
"The Kozloduy power plant is situated four kilometres from the River Danube and 150 kilometres from Bucharest."
"According to international experts, the plant does not have any protective cover and there are major risks of radioactive leakages into the soil and the water table."
"I believe Europe has a responsibility to help and facilitate its decommissioning, and we have to ensure that sufficient funding is made available to this project, as this is crucial to keep safety up to high standards, to ensure the necessary expertise and implement international best practices."
"Decommissioning and dismantling should be done according to very strict rules and standards, otherwise it could pose a security threat to the whole region."
"This is why I fully support this proposal and our commitment to allocate an additional EUR 300 million to this project."
"Let me also remind you that the European Parliament took a strong stance a few months ago on this dossier, allocating the first EUR 75 million in the 2010 budget."
"Nevertheless, I think we should be intransigent regarding transparency in the use of European funds."
"So far, the Commission has been quite dissatisfied with the information on decommissioning received from Bulgaria."
"The monitoring of the funds needs to be strict."
"This is why I believe that the European Commission should first perform a specific evaluation to assess the strengths and weaknesses of past projects in order to improve funds programming together with the EBRD for the next funding period 2010-2013."
"We have tabled several amendments requiring the Bulgarian authorities to present a proper national strategy outlining long-term objectives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors as a prerequisite to the EUR 120 million envelope."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(BG) Mr President, I have a very brief, specific question."
"As the lady has raised questions about safety, I would like her to give me an answer to the following: is she aware that, prior to decommissioning of the four small units of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, they were declared as being the safest reactors in the European Union by the European Atomic Energy Community?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, what can I say?"
"Are we all nuts?"
"Or can anyone else see any reason in it?"
"I think a lot of people have decided to do it one way, and we should follow, and we all support the view that it should be done thus."
"No further comment."
"Mr President, we must bear in mind in today's debate that, over the last ten years, the European Union gave Bulgaria EUR 550 million to close the four units in the Kozloduy complex."
"Today, it is giving it another EUR 300 million, making a total of EUR 850 million, not counting the huge sums given for modifications and safety improvements."
"In other words, we have paid more or less in gold for this nuclear complex and, for some people, it was the golden goose."
"Nonetheless, the Commission continues to indirectly fund the nuclear lobby."
"We are calling for an end to this bartering with the Bulgarian Government."
"We are calling for Parliament to safeguard, together with the Commission, the safe and effective management of nuclear waste and not to consider it as part of the withdrawal programme."
"As the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we are calling for the remaining 40% of the EUR 300 million for the nuclear reactor withdrawal programme to be channelled by the Bulgarian Government to the management of radioactive waste and not to the development of environment-killing uranium- and coal-fired power plants."
"Of course, I hope that anyone thinking of strengthening the nuclear lobby with new constructions has learned a lesson from the recent agreement between Turkey and Russia to build a nuclear plant in Αkkuyu, an earthquake area where the anti-nuclear movement has prevented its construction ......"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Tremopoulos, your time is up."
"However, Mrs Parvanova has raised the blue card to ask you a question."
"Will you allow your fellow Member to ask you a question?"
"Mrs Parvanova, can you please pose your question as briefly as possible?"
"(BG) Mr President, the word 'blackmail' was used here, and a short time ago, my colleague, Mrs Vălean, mentioned that Bulgaria had misused the funds and had not used them prudently from the earlier tranche, which was used for the appropriate purpose as compensation."
"I have one question to ask, which I would like the Commission's representative here and the Commission to corroborate: have there been warnings about this or not?"
"No, I am sorry, Mrs Parvanova."
"This does not comply with the Rules of Procedure."
"The procedure involves posing a question to the speaker who is speaking at the time."
"That question is therefore rejected as is the possibility of a reply."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I fought hard to prevent the premature closure of Units 3 and 4 of Kozloduy."
"Their closure several years ahead of time was not necessary; it was certainly not on safety grounds."
"The effect, as predicted, has been increased use of environmentally unfriendly lignite-fuelled power stations, an increase in electricity prices and a cut in Bulgaria's electricity exports: in other words, both economic and environmental damage."
"We are now paying for mistaken judgments within the European Union institutions."
"It is only right, therefore, that Bulgaria should be treated at least as well by the European Union as other countries that have had to close prematurely their ageing nuclear facilities, and I am glad that the Commission recognises this."
"A lot of money, of course, is involved in this decommissioning process."
"It is vitally important that these funds are properly and efficiently spent and accounted for."
"I hope the Commission can give us assurances on this."
"It is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity."
"Bulgaria will need assistance in creating sustainable new capacity that ensures security of supply and diversification, so that Bulgaria is not reliant on the goodwill of one foreign power."
"I would like to say that the 'Kozloduy Programme' must not only focus on financing the transfer of irradiated materials, increasing energy efficiency in Bulgaria and financing alternative energy sources."
"In my opinion, this programme must also be viewed as a contribution to the economic and social stability of the Balkans."
"This is because the Balkan states as a whole - including Bulgaria - are a vulnerable part of the European Union, as the current economic crisis has shown us."
"I take the view that Article 30 of the Accession Treaty is a framework which must not be breached, as legal consultations with the people from the European Commission have demonstrated."
"Even if this Accession Treaty or arrangement was used up in 2009, a new arrangement must carry on in the spirit of continuity which is set out in Article 30."
"(BG) Mr President, we are discussing here this evening the compensation which Bulgaria should receive for closing the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant."
"This compensation is right, fair and timely because experts reckoned that the losses suffered by Bulgaria as a result of the closure of units 1-4 were much higher than all the compensation paid to it so far."
"However, the following question remains to be answered here: why did we need to get to this point at all and why, as I mentioned a short time ago, did the safest units in Europe, declared as such not by anyone, but by the most prestigious agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, need to be closed?"
"I am also amazed here at the madness of how this report on compensation has ended up in the hands of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who started and ended their speeches with how Kozloduy must be destroyed, much like Cato the Elder used to say the same about Carthage."
"At this point, I would like to address Mr Tremopoulos, who, if I may say, is hardly in a position to speak like this, because it is precisely his country which has just recently received a much bigger amount than Bulgaria is claiming at the moment, due to its blackmail."
"He should therefore not be so insistent in stating what Bulgaria should and should not receive."
"We can now see some amendments tabled by the Greens, which have one aim only."
"This is why the Greens have a problem at the moment."
"Indeed, the problem they have is that they have contributed to the rise in carbon dioxide emissions with the closure of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant."
"Now with these changes, which they want even more blatantly to use to take money from Bulgaria and reallocate it to another area, they actually want to cover up their own guilt."
"This is why they cannot explain to their voters why they, as European Union citizens, have to pay to have more carbon dioxide emissions in the EU."
"In this case, the Greens are adopting positions which are diametrically opposed to their views."
"There is also an amendment which states that Kozloduy should serve as an example."
"However, the only thing which Kozloduy was an example of is how old reactors can be safe and operate perfectly well."
"The only thing it can serve as an example of from now on is as a warning: a warning of how, thanks to political folly, a wonderful, efficient and successful industrial sector in a country can be destroyed."
"The truth is, Mr Stoyanov, that you are hovering on the edge of the improper, the inappropriate, in terms of parliamentary language."
"I have not cut you off because I wish to show our generosity, particularly that of our colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, who I understand to have been attacked in your speech."
"I wanted to demonstrate the fact that we are capable of listening."
"I must say to you, however, that your speech seemed entirely improper to me."
"Should this happen again, I will cut you off because that is a road down which we do not want to go."
"(RO) I would like to thank the Commission because, while we are all preoccupied at the moment by the crisis, the Commission is still concerned about the other existing problems as well."
"I think that Bulgaria is fully entitled to receive the money it was promised for dismantling this nuclear power plant."
"I am an advocate of electricity generated by nuclear power plants and I do not believe that Europe will be able to achieve the specified targets for clean energy without building nuclear power plants."
"However, I firmly believe that every country is entitled to build nuclear power plants, except that I think that we in the European Union have a collective responsibility and a sense of solidarity with regard to the technologies chosen in the construction of these nuclear power plants."
"I think that, in this instance, the European Commission will have to adopt a completely stringent approach in evaluating these projects for new nuclear power plants."
"(LT) I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Rebecca Harms, for her excellent work."
"I agree with the document under discussion and the proposal that EUR 300 million in aid should be granted to Bulgaria for the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant over a period of 3 years, while of course strengthening monitoring of how the funds received are spent."
"It could be said that this is a show of equal solidarity, as other new Member States - Lithuania and Slovakia - are in a similar situation and have received such financial support."
"Units 1 to 4 of the nuclear power plant have been out of operation for some time and it is logical that they should be decommissioned."
"That will reduce the risk to the environment and will help us take better advantage of workers' knowledge and professional experience."
"When shutting down part of the power plant, its staff will face new challenges."
"From our experience in Lithuania, I can say that unforeseen problems arise that are difficult to incorporate into the time schedules."
"True, the biggest portion of the funds should be allocated to the decommissioning of the units, and there is the unavoidable question of storage equipment."
"However, it is just as important to consider people."
"I hope that when using the aid provided by the European Union, the Bulgarian Government will help workers and the community revolving around the power plant to adapt to the changed conditions, and it is very important to help them retrain and use their expertise in other spheres, to promote the creation of new sustainable jobs and switch to the new energy saving environment."
"(PL) The shutdown of four units of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant has no doubt caused a very large deficit in Bulgaria's energy system."
"It has a significant effect on security of supply in the region and must lead to an increase in CO2 emissions, which should be important, at least to some Members in this Chamber."
"In spite of this, it is being proposed, in particular in the amendments, that we turn our backs on the energy problems of one of the Member States."
"This goes against the principle of solidarity, which should govern energy policy."
"It also creates the impression of discrimination against nuclear energy by Parliament, which goes against the principle giving Member States complete freedom in their choice of sources of energy."
"(RO) The way in which the issue of closing down and then decommissioning the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant will be resolved is not relevant, except in terms of the way Bulgaria itself resolves this issue."
"However, as has already been said in this Chamber, the decommissioning process also affects neighbouring countries and may provide a precedent for other countries with similar units approaching the end of their maximum operational life."
"I am not going to hide the fact either, as has already been said, that the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant has been a permanent source of concern for Romanian citizens, especially following the Chernobyl accident."
"This is why it would be important for the decommissioning process to be accompanied by a public information campaign targeted at all the stakeholders who are entitled to know about the stages involved in this process, the timetable, the potential risks of each stage, the way in which fissile material and hazardous waste are protected, as well as about the ecological reconstruction of the Kozloduy area."
"I wish to stress the importance we need to attach to the processing of radioactive waste."
"This is why the funds allocated to Bulgaria for this purpose must be provided at regular intervals without any interruptions."
"I am mentioning this point because, although the costs seem large enough, they are only estimates as there has been no precedent on the scale of decommissioning a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria."
"I wish to end by saying, on a hopeful note, that, with sufficient funding and meticulous planning and subject to the supervision of all the bodies with the necessary powers in this area, the decommissioning process will provide an example of a good use of European funds."
"(LT) When they joined the European Union, some Central and Eastern European countries made commitments in the accession treaties, commitments which were difficult both politically and economically, to decommission nuclear power plants and ensure the safe handling of nuclear waste."
"They are countries dependent on nuclear energy and they inherited nuclear power plants that do not comply with the EU safety standards and requirements in force today and, of course, would be unable to raise the funds required to decommission the plants themselves."
"There are strict requirements in force in the European Union regulating decommissioning and the carrying out of safety works, and the financial and economic crisis is making it difficult for those Member States decommissioning nuclear power plants to carry out decommissioning and fuel disposal work appropriately and on time."
"The Community's concern over the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in non-EU Member States is perfectly understandable, as it may also threaten our future generations."
"Therefore, I welcome the Commission's decision to allocate additional support to Bulgaria from the European Union budget, since it is clear that without the Community's support, just like Lithuania, it would be impossible to ensure the implementation of decommissioning measures to the requisite extent, the Community's common security policy or measures needed to keep European citizens safe and protect the environment."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the open debate on this sensitive subject."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the Commission very much welcomes the overall positive approach of the report and the fact that Parliament agrees with the Commission that Bulgaria should receive further support amounting to EUR 300 million up until 2013."
"The Commission is also pleased that we can continue to focus on providing support for safe dismantling measures and that Parliament believes that projects in the energy sector deserve our support."
"We can confirm, as we have done in the past, that the funds will be used for the intended purpose and we plan to put reliable controls in place."
"We take note of your proposals and amendments."
"I am sure that the Council will take into account Parliament's opinions wherever they can help to improve the clarity of the regulation's objectives."
"Your agreement on further financing for the dismantling work is a sign of the European Union's solidarity with Bulgaria."
"Safety is the highest priority during the process of dismantling nuclear power stations and this is emphasised in the statement."
"I would like to thank you once again for your work and also Mrs Harms for this report."
"Mr President, at the end of this debate, I would once again like to say that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria has been based on international expertise."
"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected these reactors, which have the same design as those in Chernobyl, and saw no possibility of converting them to meet the safety standards which applied in the old European Union."
"It was an intelligent decision which justifies the fact that we have shown our solidarity with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria and, following tomorrow's decision, have treated them equally with regard to the costs of decommissioning."
"Secondly, I would like to point out once again that none of these countries and no other countries in Western Europe or elsewhere in the world have yet found a reliable solution to the problem of the final storage of highly radioactive waste."
"This is a task which still faces us, although many countries have now invested billions in this area and have been looking for a reliable solution for 30 years."
"This is a debate with which those people in particular who are in favour of the high-risk technology of nuclear power need to concern themselves, because, as things stand today, the storage of nuclear waste, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of Europe's citizens, represents such a large and unresolved risk that it is a strong argument against continuing to make use of nuclear power."
"We will be discussing this with Mr Oettinger in future. Thank you for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 20 May, at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In 1999, the European Commission, acting on behalf of the European Union, obliged Bulgaria to close four of its six nuclear power plants as a precondition for its accession negotiations."
"The Commission had been saying for some time that the units in question were eligible for financial improvements."
"Under the agreement, two units were closed in 2002, and the other two in 2006."
"After considerable sums of investment and a number of independent surveys, the units were found to meet all the safety criteria and, according to the Council's Atomic Questions Group, no additional monitoring was needed."
"Bulgaria had become a net exporter of electricity to all its neighbouring countries and sometimes accounted for 100% of the region's electricity deficit."
"The remaining units, however, were closed under the agreement, the region suffered power cuts and the substitute plants resulted in an increase in greenhouse gases."
"I myself put a question to the Commission and the Council, basing it on Mr Van Orden's report on the application by the Republic of Bulgaria to become a member of the European Union, and its paragraph 33. In it, the European Parliament asked the Council to view the closure dates more flexibly until new generation could be built that would not increase emissions, which would not be before 2011."
"The answer was no, however, and instead, the EU showed its solidarity with Bulgaria in the form of considerable sums in financial assistance."
"That is why it is only right to continue providing finance for longer than was planned, because the loss of electricity generation capacity, not to speak of the other strains on the region, have been economically and socially serious for Bulgaria."
"In all honesty, though, we have to ask whether this massive financial investment could have been avoided if the Commission and the Council had reconsidered its inflexible and questionable conditions."
"During the accession negotiations in 2005, Bulgaria agreed to shut down reactor units 1-4 at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant and then to decommission them."
"Originally, the EU intended to provide financial support for the decommissioning process until 2009."
"Now the financial aid has been extended until the end of 2013 and a total of EUR 300 million will be made available."
"Of course, it is necessary to give Bulgaria support during the decommissioning of Kozloduy and to help with the accompanying financial and environmental problems, such as safely disposing of radioactive waste, promoting renewable energy resources and retraining employees."
"However, the financial aid must involve a detailed breakdown of the different plans, strict financial controls and regular monitoring of the use of the funding."
"The money must not be used through the back door to provide financial support for the second Bulgarian nuclear power plant in Belene."
"Bulgaria is currently looking for European investors for Belene and the option of using the decommissioning money for this purpose is a very timely one."
"We must prevent this from happening."
"Careful reporting and thorough on-site investigations by the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Auditors are therefore essential."
"The EU is dependent on energy imports for 53% of its requirements."
"To reduce their energy dependency, some Member States have adopted ambitious strategies for using nuclear power and energy from renewable sources."
"Nuclear power accounts for 28% of the total energy consumed in the EU, while it is the largest source of energy in Belgium, France, Lithuania, Slovakia and Sweden."
"Nuclear power production does not generate carbon dioxide emissions, not to mention that monthly household energy bills are lower in Member States where nuclear power is used."
"However, the EU imposes extremely rigorous requirements governing the safe operation of nuclear power plants and the handling of nuclear waste."
"Stringent measures and high standards with regard to the safety of nuclear power plants and close cooperation between local, regional, national and European authorities provide the conditions for the safe use of nuclear power in the EU."
"The regulation proposed by the Commission guarantees fair treatment for Bulgaria by granting it financial assistance until 2013 for decommissioning its nuclear power plants, which were measures stipulated by the accession treaties."
"Nuclear decommissioning requires long-term financial planning, which continues until the site has been completely reclaimed and all the radioactive waste and spent fuel have been dealt with safely."
"Implementing measures (Rule 88)"

"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 10.05)"
"Europe 2020 (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Union for the Mediterranean (debate)"
"The first item on the agenda today is the report by Vincent Peillon, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Union for the Mediterranean."
"I will give our rapporteur the floor for four minutes."
"Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report; this truly is a collective piece of work."
"We reached 28 compromises; compromises which enriched rather than watered down the strategic vision that we wanted to impart to this report, to our commitment to the Mediterranean."
"I should therefore like to extend my warmest thanks to Marietta Giannakou for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Ivo Vajgl for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Hélène Flautre, and the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on International Trade, Mrs De Sarnez, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Tzavela."
"What was important, for us, was to make it understood that there are strategic issues at stake here for Europe."
"In fact, it is not just a question of thinking that the South needs us; we also need the South, especially in these times of crisis."
"If we want to have a long-term vision, if we want sustainable growth in a multipolar world, then we also need the South."
"In light of this, Europe needs to undertake to make the Union for the Mediterranean an area of peace, security and prosperity for its 800 million habitants and to look at this work as a long-term priority."
"It is this common will that allowed us to come together, because we know that the economic stakes, the demographic stakes, the geopolitical stakes that we are facing, like the social and cultural stakes, presuppose that we are capable of working with the other side of the Mediterranean."
"For us, it is also cultural and civilisation issues that are at stake."
"We know this; Parliament has worked in knowledge of the difficulties of setting up the Union for the Mediterranean for two years."
"We have not avoided tackling the question of conflicts taking place in the South, but we wanted to affirm very forcefully that it was precisely the approach of the Union for the Mediterranean, with specific projects, parity between North and South in decision-making bodies and the possibility, for example, of bringing Israelis and Palestinians to the same table, that was the right method for helping to resolve these conflicts and that, moreover, the Union for the Mediterranean should not be asked to pursue all the objectives at the same time and that it needed to focus on these specific activities."
"In this project - and I do hope that the second summit of Heads of State or Government will be held in Barcelona on 7 June - we, the European Parliament, wanted to send a strong message to the Heads of State or Government to tell them they must make a commitment because this summit must be a success."
"In light of this, we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today."
"First of all, we need to remove certain obstacles, which, of course, include the financial and economic conditions."
"That is why the European Parliament hopes that the European Union will make a financial commitment commensurate with what is at stake, firstly in terms of what is left of the financial perspective 2007-2013, and that, in the financial perspective 2014-2020, the Union's undertaking will be much greater, so that the six major projects on the table can be completed."
"We need to improve the economic and legal environment."
"We need to improve South-South regional integration."
"We also need, in addition to economic conditions, new political conditions, which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration, education, cultural projects and on the rights of men and women."
"To conclude: Europe, in this crisis, needs to look far and wide."
"We must not sacrifice the long term to the short term."
"We must assume our responsibilities."
"Europe needs the South."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is my pleasure to address you today on the Union for the Mediterranean and the report prepared by Mr Vincent Peillon."
"This valuable contribution by the European Parliament is particularly timely as it outlines some of the key challenges facing the Union for the Mediterranean in the months to come - and, by the way, Mr Peillon, I fully agree with the introduction to your report on that debate."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon now in force, the European Union now has an enhanced and more cohesive institutional identity and a mandate to act more effectively on the world stage."
"At the same time, most Mediterranean governments have pursued an ambitious agenda of economic reforms, and the European Neighbourhood Policy is transforming relations between the European Union and its Mediterranean neighbours."
"Since 2004, political contacts have increased in profile and intensity."
"Trade has increased at double-digit rates aided by a steady process of liberalisation and regulatory convergence."
"European Union assistance has been tailored to partners' reform needs and its volume in the current financial framework has increased substantially."
"This is what we have achieved in our bilateral relations."
"However, in the Mediterranean, even more than elsewhere, our network of bilateral relations between the European Union and individual Mediterranean neighbour countries needs complementing with South-South integration and cooperation and the creation of a truly regional economic area."
"Regional integration can make as important a contribution as national reforms to boosting investment and growth, reducing the wealth gap between Europe and its Mediterranean neighbours and, alongside this, ensuring greater convergence around our shared values and in our democratic practices."
"South-South integration and intra-regional integration projects, such as the Agadir free trade agreement, are also key to creating the five million jobs which are needed every year to meet the needs of the region's young population."
"The launching of the Union for the Mediterranean in Paris in 2008 gave a new impetus to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, made a strong bid for co-ownership and shared responsibility through a co-presidency system, put more focus on concrete projects, and provided a technical secretariat to promote regional integration and spur investment."
"As we all know, its implementation has been slowed down by increased tension in the Middle East, but there has been progress with the launching of the proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority."
"There is now space for cautious hope that the political circumstances in the region may become more conducive to cooperation."
"Against the background of major global challenges such as the international economic and financial crisis, climate change and energy security, the Union for the Mediterranean will have to deal with the political situation in the Middle East, launch the operational functioning of the Union for the Mediterranean Secretariat and take stock of progress made by the partnership since July 2008."
"It is an opportunity for a collective reformation of our commitment and political will to create an area of peace, stability and shared prosperity in the Mediterranean."
"To achieve this, the partners should also look specifically at the future development of the Union and at what it can deliver on the ground in terms of projects, jobs and growth."
"The Mediterranean area is extremely dynamic, and the young generation are asking for more jobs and better opportunities."
"They are asking for more accountability and a democratic representation, better education and easier mobility to travel and to study."
"Their demands are not always easy to meet, but ultimately, they should be the beneficiaries of our collective action."
"If we put into place practical projects, such as access to water, food and energy sources, and improved civil protection capabilities, it will be in the interest of our peoples."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is about placing people, entrepreneurs, non-governmental organisations, universities and, above all, young people at the forefront of civil society, cooperation and economic development."
"Better involvement of the citizens should also be accomplished by means of the full participation and involvement of elected representatives."
"This is why the Commission firmly believes that a vibrant and strong parliamentary dimension reinforces the democratic legitimacy of the partnership."
"The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly should be further consolidated and its work better articulated with the other bodies of the partnership."
"We all want the Union to work, and we all know it will be judged on its ability to deliver concrete projects for the region."
"The energy interconnections, the motorways of the sea to connect southern Mediterranean port facilities with European ones, and the Mediterranean solar plan are areas of considerable potential in terms of investment, job creation and enhancing trade relations."
"If we want to tap that potential, we need the private sector and the major financial institutions to work hand in hand."
"And for this to happen, we need one catalyst, and that is the secretariat of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"After several months of hard work by the 43 Euro-Mediterranean partners, we eventually managed to adopt the legal status of the secretariat, to appoint the secretary-general and to approve a provisional budget for the functioning of the secretariat."
"At the heart of our relations with our Mediterranean partner countries is our desire to promote security, growth and stability in the region."
"But there is also the abiding conviction that we are taking part in an even more ambitious project: building a region of peace and affirming our common goals and values."
"I am sure that together with the commitment of the European Parliament and with the parliaments of the European Union Member States and of our partners, and with a strong impetus from the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, we will rise to this challenge."
"Mr President, without doubt, the Barcelona Summit is an uncertainty."
"Without doubt, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is echoing, but never mind."
"The UfM is the only possible response we have at our disposal for speeding up development in the southern countries, strengthening links between them and improving dialogue on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"The region needs to increase its economic development and cultural exchange agreements."
"It needs specific future projects that mobilise energies and involve a larger number of countries."
"With this in mind, we should do everything to promote private and public investment and the European Commission should be more active and should strengthen its role as investor."
"It should also take better account of the effects of the process of liberalisation when preparing the new generation of association agreements."
"Finally, the Agadir agreement should be extended in order to improve the development of South-South exchanges."
"As for agricultural policy, it should preserve the need for food sovereignty and, as we all know, energy is a crucial sector."
"It is important for projects to be implemented first and foremost in the interest of these countries, in order to respond to their needs and contribute to their development, despite, or rather, because of the difficulties."
"The re-launch of the UfM is more urgent than ever before."
"Mr President, in our report on the Euro-Mediterranean market, we confirmed that we recommend maintaining and developing the basic infrastructures which make an economy a single and cohesive economy and it is interesting that now, with the economic crisis, the present economic situation illustrates quite clearly that there are cohesion and common denominators in the South."
"We need to bear this in mind for certain future developments."
"My report places particular emphasis on LNG which, in the very short term, may be the driving economic force for the economy of the Euro-Mediterranean market, not only for supply but also for sale, and in renewable energy sources, another form of economy for the Euro-Mediterranean area, but which are more short term."
"One comment: the Union strategy and policy in terms of energy for Northern Europe are very well documented."
"We have, Commissioner, a huge weakness in policy and strategy for energy for Southern Europe."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Vincent Peillon and the rapporteurs from the other committees, Mrs De Sarnez and Mrs Tzavela, for their reports."
"The report on the Union for the Mediterranean is important because it focuses on immediate and quantifiable targets."
"Their results may be very specific, because Parliament is calling, through the report, for specific budgets to be earmarked via the financial perspective, for assistance for the Secretariat of the Union for the Mediterranean in Barcelona and, of course, for the various differences which exist not to affect the objectives of the Union per se, which are growth, improved individual and human rights, cultural exchanges, energy issues and whatever else can link the peoples living there to the Mediterranean basin."
"Of course, here, today, the Council and the Spanish Presidency, which I assume has a particular interest in the Union for the Mediterranean, are absent and I must say that that surprises me, because the Council should have heard everything the rapporteur and co-rapporteurs said and everything highlighted here, in other words, that this is an endeavour which overcomes the specific difficulties which have prevented programmes from progressing as they should have done."
"The conflict between Palestine and Israel cannot, of course, be resolved through the Union for the Mediterranean, but the presence of officers in the Secretariat gives cause to hope that there will be no pressure from conflicts on our efforts to advance the Union for the Mediterranean with the criteria described earlier."
"It is particularly important for the Union for the Mediterranean to send out a message of democratic development, equality between men and women, and efforts for a civil society in the countries of North Africa too."
"Mr President, what I liked best about this report - and I would like to congratulate its author, Mr Vincent Peillon - is that it is precise and specific."
"If only the precision of this report extended to its subject, that is, the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM)."
"This is because the least that can be said is that in the UfM, there is currently a signal lack of clarity."
"I think that the leaders, who are due to meet - we hope - on 7 June in Barcelona, would do well to follow the specific, precise priorities laid out in the Peillon report."
"Firstly, the political context."
"The UfM cannot continue to be blocked or paralysed by the conflict in the Middle East but, at the same time, neither can it ignore it."
"It must make a positive contribution to resolving the conflict, insofar as it is able."
"Secondly, good projects must be set up and developed in a professional and intelligent manner."
"Thirdly, adequate resources and financial commitments must be found."
"Fourthly, progress needs to be made on creating a positive relationship which avoids obstacles and clashes and which instead seeks out synergies between the UfM and the Mediterranean structures of the European Union."
"We must seek clarification on and commitment to these four central points, these four key challenges, and I believe that this report is a good instrument, a good roadmap, to help us seek this agreement."
"Mr Vice-President, Commissioner Füle, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, for his constructive, open and creative involvement which has resulted in this report."
"I hope that it will be of interest, not just to those of us who have helped draft it, but to others, as well."
"The report deals with a region which throughout history has been a dynamic centre of cultural and spiritual life and of economic and commercial innovation."
"Today, unfortunately, it is the source of numerous problems which concern all of us and the rest of the world, as well, and which we would like to see resolved."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is an important project, but unfortunately, it has not advanced as quickly as we would have liked."
"I would like to see the establishment of the secretariat in Barcelona followed by rapid progress in the implementation of the priority projects."
"The projects must be the driving force behind, or the objective of, the work of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"At the same time, however, we need to recognise that there are some ongoing issues of a political nature, especially the Palestinian question and the undefined status of Western Sahara, and that they have hampered the requisite progress."
"For that reason, we need to make efforts towards more dialogue, more tolerance and confidence-building in the region."
"In that respect, the European Parliament could certainly play a very important and active role and I hope that all the parties involved will welcome this House as one of the players that can help resolve the problem."
"Finally, allow me to add that it is imperative that we pay due attention to future generations, that we promote the exchange of students within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean and that we support EMUNI University, the participation of senior institutions and higher education and cultural fora."
"That will help us raise the level of mutual understanding and interconnection."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean has never been as vital to our future as it is today."
"Together we have tried, in the report on the UfM, to support a different vision of our Mediterranean."
"More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values."
"I should like to talk about the most serious obstacle to our Mediterranean ambitions; the violence suffered by the Palestinian people, who are being occupied, expelled and killed by Israel, while Europe fails to assume its historic responsibility in this conflict and really act for peace by recognising the State of Palestine in accordance with the international laws on which our democracies are founded."
"This coming week, an official Parliament delegation will visit the Gaza Strip in a bid to understand why aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro which Europeans are sending Palestinians is not arriving in the schools and hospitals in Gaza, which I visited in January."
"I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided, without informing either his members - of whom I am one - or the co-chairs of this delegation, not to visit Gaza with Parliament's delegation on the instructions of the Israeli Embassy."
"By boycotting Parliament's delegation to Gaza, our committee chair is discrediting the whole of Parliament, which passed a resolution on the Goldstone report condemning the fact that contacts with the populations in Gaza were being blocked by the Israeli army and demanding that the block be lifted immediately."
"We need to remember this resolution and Parliament's position."
"This being so, I call for Mr Albertini to resign as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, for failing to meet the demands of his office."
"What is the point of financing and supervising elections, if we then refuse to recognise those who have chosen the ballot box over arms?"
"Finally, another obstacle to a really fraternal Union for the Mediterranean is the victims who drown on their way from the south side, partly due to the fact that European borders are completely closed to them."
"Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable."
"We need to be able, as the UNDP recommends, to ensure that the mobility of citizens from the South is equal to our own mobility to the South."
"We must be faithful to our project and to our values."
"Our children will thank us for it and we will be the proud representatives of our peoples."
"Mr President, the Union for the Mediterranean faces real obstacles and what I am asking of the European Union, of all the institutions and of Parliament, is determination, considerably more determination, when it comes to trying to overcoming these obstacles."
"The first and most important of these - there is no doubt about this and other Members have raised this issue - are the conflicts: the Palestinian conflict, in the face of an attitude by the Israeli Government that systematically flouts international law and the very agreements it has signed, such as the Annapolis Agreement on the settlements; the Western Sahara conflict; and, indeed, the military occupation of the north of the Republic of Cyprus."
"These are obviously clear obstacles for any institution that wishes to have that type of relationship between both shores of the Mediterranean."
"Until they are resolved, these conflicts represent a real barrier."
"The group I represent is asking for greater commitment, greater energy in response to all those players responsible for flouting international law."
"However, nor should we forget that another problem facing us is that of the economic and social imbalances which exist throughout the Mediterranean."
"I believe that any solution which seeks to deal with these imbalances in relation to trade by simply and straightforwardly proposing free-trade agreements is not on the right track."
"The right track would be to take account of these imbalances and try to reach trade agreements based on complementarity and solidarity."
"The fact of the matter is that many of the countries on the shores of the Mediterranean are in conditions of absolute poverty and utter deprivation."
"However, and here I insist, the essential thing would be greater commitment on the part of the European Union in response to those conflicts which are currently festering;"
"I am talking about Palestine and Western Sahara."
"There are even conflicts, such as the conflict in the Western Sahara, where the European Union is doing precisely nothing."
"Not only is it doing nothing, but it is upgrading the advanced status relationship which Morocco currently enjoys and is also seeking, in the case of Israel, to upgrade the association agreement to an advanced-status agreement."
"Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, on the valuable report which he has presented to us."
"We all know that the Mediterranean basin is a point at which many cultures meet; at the same time, however, it is a nerve centre and a 'boiler' which has been bubbling for many years now."
"Climate change, the economic and financial crisis, immigration, pollution, over-fishing and damage to the natural environment are some of the problems that beset Europeans and non-Europeans living in the Mediterranean basin."
"Particular importance must be attached to the question of illegal immigration and to effective border controls in the countries in the Mediterranean basin, especially Greece and Italy, which are gateways to the European Union for illegal immigrants."
"A daily battle is waged on the borders of these countries."
"Attention also needs to be paid to strengthening the energy sector and to making use of renewable energy sources and the Mediterranean solar energy programme to stimulate economic growth in the southern Mediterranean countries."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) In 2008, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, announced that he had had a dream of a Union for the Mediterranean."
"This Union was supposed to give a new impetus to the objectives of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, objectives which are based on mutual recognition of common values, such as democracy, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights."
"I wonder how you can talk about common values when, in a country like Mauritania, there is no religious freedom to speak of because, there, Islam has been dominant for well over a thousand years."
"According to its constitution, Syria is officially a popular democratic and socialist-oriented unitary state."
"In practice, however, Syria is a dictatorship."
"Morocco occupies Western Sahara and in Tunisia, human rights are regularly flouted."
"I could go on with a long list of these countries, but I have to be aware of my limited speaking time."
"Are these countries with whom we wish to have more cultural exchange?"
"Are these countries with whom we wish to set up a free trade zone, to be followed by promoting the free movement of persons across the Mediterranean?"
"The outcome of this will be yet more Islam in Europe."
"We cannot allow Europe to become Eurabia: not now, not ever!"
"Before this dream turns into a nightmare, we must call a halt to this process."
"We had another dream concerning the Mediterranean back in 1995, which took the form of the Barcelona Declaration, and then we just did it again in 2005."
"Apart from costing the European taxpayer several billions, these projects have come to nothing."
"Stop wasting taxpayers' money and stop dreaming!"
"All due respect to Mr Albertini, however, for taking a brave position."
"He has the support of my group."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Euromed region constitutes a strategic area of EU policy: we cannot deal with fundamental issues such as the environment, religious values, culture, infrastructure, agriculture, energy, security and migration flows without the responsible assistance of the third countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"Nevertheless, the cooperation framework still has a long way to go: we could say from Barcelona to Barcelona and looking beyond."
"The European Union must step up its commitment in the process of renewing and verifying the individual association agreements with the third countries bordering the Mediterranean, and must fund the major strategic projects, those for infrastructure and for ports."
"On the other hand, we must strongly protect comparable production sectors on both shores of the Mediterranean, especially farming, in order to guarantee sustainable development and a regulatory framework that is as uniform as possible."
"We therefore hope that the EU's role of governance with regard to the Mediterranean countries will be strengthened in order to assert a fundamental principle, namely, cooperation, which represents political success, entrepreneurial success, in a framework enhanced by guarantees protecting individuals."
"I also wished to make a suggestion to Mrs Benarab-Attou: by all means attack Mr Albertini, who is providing strong leadership of the committee, but in his presence, so that he may defend himself."
"This is an essential feature of every democratically elected assembly."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking an extremely significant step forwards by adopting this report, and it will be very useful with a view to the Barcelona Summit of 7 June, a summit which, as we know, is set to be difficult given the deadlock in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and also owing to various uncertainties and difficulties regarding the definition of the administrative set-up of the new secretariat structure."
"Faced with these problems, the Peillon report has been drafted in the only way possible, highlighting, on the one hand, that the conflicts must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, while acknowledging, on the other, that the Union for the Mediterranean will not be fully successful unless these conflicts are settled."
"Therefore, the real challenge now involves a clear, robust political commitment which must come out of the Barcelona Summit, finally enabling the structures of the new institution to function and commit to providing the funds necessary for the major projects that are its main objective."
"Europe must realise that it needs to turn its political and economic efforts and its own interests southwards, because it is here that it can find the solutions to many of the problems currently plaguing it."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for years, an independent researcher, Gabriele Del Grande, has been posting on the Internet the number of people dying in attempts to cross the Mediterranean in boats managed by organised crime groups."
"His meticulous tally-keeping has reached 4 200 victims, 18 of whom died this March: this is veritable carnage."
"For many years in Lampedusa, the elderly cemetery caretaker has voluntarily been giving each body, from the few that are recovered, a decent burial with a cross and a flower."
"These two European citizens are acting on our behalf, too; they are acting to make up for our political failure."
"Their spontaneous efforts highlight the urgent need for a new political architecture and substance, in contrast to the forced returns at sea employed by the Italian Government in breach of international law, which only heighten people's desperation."
"The Union for the Mediterranean should therefore represent a new humanity, bearing in mind that we are running out of time."
"Today, over half of the population from Morocco to Turkey is under 18 years old."
"The Mediterranean is therefore destined to change rapidly."
"(EL) I should like to start by thanking Mr Peillon for the work he has done."
"The report calls on the Member States of the Union for the Mediterranean to establish open dialogue, within the framework of mutual respect and understanding, by promoting human rights and freedoms, and that is something that we support."
"At the same time, however, it does not include any concrete proposal to combat the existing political problems that beset the area. I understand Mr Peillon's logic behind what he says, which may be considered helpful in starting the Union for the Mediterranean."
"On the other hand, however, to turn a blind eye and pretend that nothing is 'going on' in Gaza, for example, is a huge mistake that prevents us from dusting down the problems."
"What worries me is that we are slowly learning in the European Union to live with problems rather than resolve them."
"We need to become more pro-active on the fundamental issues that concern us."
"There is no reference whatsoever to the need for Israel to enter into an immediate, fair and viable settlement of the Palestinian question."
"There is no reference whatsoever to the need for Turkey to demonstrate the necessary respect to all the Member States of the Union for the Mediterranean without exception."
"Reference to the need to withdraw Turkish occupying forces from a Member State is a necessary act of respect - the minimum, I would say - for European justice."
"The Mediterranean washes the shores of several thousand towns and villages of different cultures which have been united by the same sea for over ten thousand years."
"Just one town, however, out of these thousands of towns and villages on the shores of the Mediterranean, just one town is uninhabited."
"Instead of being inhabited by people, it is inhabited by rats, lizards and snakes."
"The houses of the people, together with their memories, have been eroded."
"All that is left are the dreams of thousands of people, many of whom died as refugees."
"The least we can do for the living is to return the town of Famagusta to its inhabitants."
"This should have been a basic demand in the report on the Union for the Mediterranean, because we are working for union, not partition in the Mediterranean."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, own-initiative reports are usually just hot air, but if adopted they are an expression of the political will of the European Parliament."
"This report proposes the setting up of a union of 17 non-EU countries with a parliamentary assembly and a secretariat with funding for projects of a truly ambitious nature."
"The funding of these schemes would run into many billions of euros, which of course would have to be paid for by the citizens of Europe."
"Where this money would come from is not mentioned; the reality is not allowed to intrude on fantasy."
"This report is truly bonkers!"
"But, before we laugh it off, we should remember that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union has the legal right to sign the kind of treaties envisaged here."
"This report proposes the setting up of a Union of non-European countries that could be later absorbed into the Union; that is what this report is really all about."
"(DE) Mr President, when the Union for the Mediterranean was founded almost two years ago, the intention, as we know, was that it should be linked to the Barcelona Process in order to create a closer relationship between the Mediterranean countries and the EU."
"However, this process has obviously come to a standstill because of the conflict between the Arab states and Israel."
"The EU has concluded an association agreement with Israel and provided financial aid, including EUR 440 million as reconstruction aid for the Gaza Strip."
"The citizens of the EU are rightly asking why their taxes are being pumped into the Gaza Strip when everything there is regularly bombed flat again and are calling for conclusions to be drawn from this."
"It is also possible that Hamas is profiting from this aid."
"Throughout all the years, the EU has not succeeded in acting as an impartial mediator in the Gaza Strip."
"Now, the summit of the Union for the Mediterranean in Barcelona, which is planned for the beginning of June, is also likely to break down because of the conflict between Israel and the Arab states."
"Particularly in times of crisis, it is important, in my opinion, to evaluate plans more carefully and, if necessary, to shelve them."
"During this crisis, we will not be able to afford projects which are just about prestige or those which are simply money pits."
"(FR) Mr President, in the follow-up to the Barcelona process, the Union for the Mediterranean is an opportunity to develop our relations with the countries to the east and south of the Mediterranean basin."
"As the excellent report by Vincent Peillon emphasises, we cannot neglect either the potential of this region or the risks which it brings with it."
"Let us at least have the presence of mind to recognise that, since the bombing of Gaza and with the continuing colonisation of Palestinian territories, the Union for the Mediterranean has been painted into a corner."
"The political aspect is blocked."
"We are not even sure if the planned summit in Barcelona in June will actually take place."
"I would not be surprised if we were to learn in the coming days or hours that it has been postponed indefinitely."
"However, we should not give up; the European Union should assume greater responsibility in the search for a political solution."
"We cannot allow the United States to monopolise political crisis management in this region, our region, and confine ourselves to its development."
"Our security and growth depend on the development and stability of the Mediterranean, which is why the Union for the Mediterranean is still the best instrument at our disposal."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report."
"The Union for the Mediterranean may make a decisive contribution towards the creation of balanced Euro-Mediterranean relations and towards strengthening trust between countries in the area."
"The Mediterranean should be an area of peace, stability and security, where democratic principles and human rights are fully respected."
"There are social and economic differences between Mediterranean countries."
"The challenge is even greater as a result of the economic crisis."
"It is to achieve real rapprochement between the Union and Mediterranean countries through growth, cooperation and trade."
"Energy security, combating climate change and the maritime environment are also areas in which close cooperation is required."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is not, of course, the framework for addressing regional conflicts."
"However, cultivating a spirit of cooperation, political dialogue and joint efforts to meet specific targets will help enormously in building up trust, which is needed if viable solutions are to be achieved."
"However, in order for all this to happen and for the Union for the Mediterranean to succeed, suitable financial resources are needed and this time we must not be neglectful."
"(NL) Thank you very much for squeezing me in, as I was held back by an emergency meeting of the Enlarged Bureau of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"Mr President, paragraph 5 of Mr Peillon's report rightly dwells on the need for a just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict."
"The rapporteur calls on the European Union and all the Member States of the Union for the Mediterranean to devote maximum efforts to this cause."
"As Chair of the Israel Delegation, I very much endorse such peace efforts, but I think that they will only be effective once two conditions have been met, and those are: a) that the proposed two-state solution clearly be taken to mean the coexistence of a Jewish, that is Israeli, state and a Palestinian one, and b) that Member States of the EU and those of the Union for the Mediterranean promote a climate of mutual trust between the conflicting parties in the Middle East."
"Here, the common fight against the endemic evil of anti-Semitism, whichever form it takes (including the form of anti-Zionism), occupies centre-stage."
"You could also appoint the same number of Israelis and Palestinians to your secretariat, but we would still have to fight together to win mutual trust."
"That is the acid test."
"(ES) Mr President, a preliminary clarification: in my view, either a representative of the Presidency of the Council, or, perhaps, of the current French co-presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), should have spoken in this debate today; their absence is deeply regrettable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a priority for the European Union to ensure that its closest neighbours form an area of peace, prosperity, freedom and security."
"This should be the primary objective of the UfM, which I hope is due to hold its second summit next month."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon and to express my thanks, most especially, for his open-minded and extremely constructive approach."
"In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on. Some of these disparities are due to serious deficiencies in our neighbouring states."
"It is crucial to promote close dialogue and cooperation within the framework of the UfM, and to bring forward those major joint projects which it has identified, as well as the bilateral dimension of the association agreements, in order to strengthen the relationship between both shores and to be able to reduce these disparities."
"In order to achieve this, our neighbours, too, must implement reforms."
"Standing still cannot be an option."
"I would like briefly to raise three further points."
"Firstly, it is very important for the secretariat of the UfM in Barcelona to be fully operational as soon as possible."
"Secondly, and closely linked to the previous point, the UfM must not fall hostage to conflicts, such as that in the Middle East."
"The UfM can facilitate a solution but it does not claim to be the means to the solution nor should it be blocked by these confrontations."
"Thirdly and lastly, the UfM must also pay particular attention to what is known as Chapter Four of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation: migration, security, social integration and justice."
"Let me just apologise for the Council."
"The representative of the Council could not be here today because it is Thursday morning and the debate on this report was originally scheduled for Monday."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to ask you to call in the trialogue for the Council always to be represented here on Thursday morning."
"In the case of some Council presidencies, and I will not name them for reasons of modesty, the representative was even here on a Thursday afternoon."
"I think that the Council should be present for the majority of the plenary part-session."
"Thank you, I will do that."
"I was simply attempting to explain what the Council said."
"I will do that."
"Thank you very much."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to thank Mrs De Sarnez for the way she has worked with us."
"Today, more than ever before, there is a need for the Union for the Mediterranean, for support for major projects and for institutional development."
"Today more than ever before, there is a need to find answers to the crisis, to research, to climate change, to water, to new energy models, to sustainable development."
"We must therefore promote and conclude trade and economic relations in the area, with short and medium-term measures, a free-trade zone, lifting of tariff barriers, and the opening up of the North-South and South-South markets."
"At the Barcelona Summit, the Spanish Presidency will offer the opportunity for a new agreement, a new situation, a new collaboration, democratisation, economic and social responses."
"The Barcelona Summit can put us into the position where we can assume leadership in the Mediterranean."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the proximity of the Mediterranean peoples is seen in particular, as pointed out by Mr Rinaldi, in terms of the pivotal phenomenon of immigration."
"This should be considered a priority factor by the European Union, because migration flows can and have given rise to problems at human, social, cultural and economic levels which will affect the very future of the two opposite shores of the Mediterranean."
"The mutual proximity of the Mediterranean peoples is also seen in the economic and social cooperation within the European Economic Area and between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries."
"In this regard, our ingrained presence at all levels in the region must enable us to take a leading role to avoid the Union for the Mediterranean replicating the inconsistencies of Barcelona."
"How many mistakes were made, how many times did we think we were making headway, when we were actually moving backwards?"
"Therefore, what we need, first and foremost, is to launch social, cultural and human dialogue based on mutual understanding and promotion of the positive values underpinning our civilisation, but this indispensable factor depends on successful cooperation, primarily at the economic level."
"In fact, the proliferation of agreements and trade has favoured, and will continue to favour, the growth of balanced economic and social relations between the parties."
"Furthermore, in political terms, we must urgently continue the unremitting pursuit of dialogue on security policy, in order to develop ever stronger relations between the countries in question."
"Colleagues, please keep to your time."
"It is 10.57, and at 12.00 we have the votes."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming summit of the Heads of State or Government on 7-8 June in Barcelona is clearly an important occasion for the practical launch of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"It therefore constitutes an extraordinary opportunity to lay down the lasting foundations for real and stronger cooperation for peace and security."
"Precisely for this reason, we must take full advantage of the opportunity in order to establish a development strategy, and so that we can define projects capable of revitalising that area and promoting economic growth."
"I hope that the meeting will strengthen initiatives such as Solar for Peace and Desertec, which are important instruments for the creation of an interdependent regional energy market."
"Lastly, the UfM must boost scientific and technological research and innovation, using existing research institutes to increase the competitiveness of local businesses, too weak to face the challenges of the global market."
"I am convinced that growth of the Union can reinforce the unity of Europe."
"(RO) I wish to say that, nearly two years after the launch of the Union for the Mediterranean, it is time for us take stock of this new federating project and also reflect on its prospects for development."
"From this perspective, I think that the report drafted by Mr Peillon is welcome and I, too, would like to join my fellow Members in congratulating the author."
"Looking ahead to the Barcelona Summit in June, I think that it is very important for us to reaffirm Parliament's commitment to the success of this project in an area which, as we are all aware, is located at the crossroads of three continents and which is obviously important to Europe in geostrategic and cultural terms."
"I am somewhat concerned by Mr Baudis's scepticism regarding the possibility of this summit being postponed."
"I hope that it will not come to this and that we will use all the institutional resources available to us to ensure this summit goes ahead."
"This will mark not only an occasion for reflection, but also an institutional success because the Union for the Mediterranean needs to overcome political impasses and institutional difficulties in the process of implementing the six strategic projects which embody the institution's very essence."
"The durability and credibility of the Union for the Mediterranean depend on its ability to operate."
"To do this, it not only needs adequate funding for implementing the projects and running the secretariat, but I also think that greater involvement is required from civil society and national and parliamentary groups, as well as from the EMPA to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the European Parliament's political priorities must be to help make the forthcoming Barcelona Summit a full success, following two years of deadlock since the Paris Summit of 2008."
"There are many goals, which have also been mentioned today, from tackling illegal immigration to combating human rights violations, but there is also a significant economic aspect: the Mediterranean offers huge potential, starting with renewable energies."
"Accordingly, we must give our full backing to the Mediterranean Solar Plan and the industrial initiatives such as Desertec, involving businesses and universities in order to develop practical cooperation projects."
"Indeed, the peace process, which is the priority, must be accompanied by a process of economic development, precisely to guarantee the necessary social cohesion which can help overcome conflicts."
"(CS) The Union for the Mediterranean is undoubtedly also a courageous inter-cultural project, the success of which depends, among other things, on a willingness to overcome different cultural and social traditions."
"Cultural diversity leads to mutual enrichment if its impulses are perceived openly as an opportunity and not as a threat."
"One of these opportunities is the approach to gender equality in society."
"It is an area regarded with some sensitivity in this region."
"The Union for the Mediterranean must therefore devote suitable attention to this area, and not only because of the commitments here of the Marrakech ministerial conference in November 2009 on supporting both the spirit and letter of gender equality and strengthening the role of women in society, including their participation in public life, and combating violence against women."
"This is one of the key areas that can unleash and provide enormous human potential for the entire region, which can only profit as a result."
"Double standards and a reluctance to change, which is often supported mainly on the pretext of custom and tradition, cannot be accepted but, on the contrary, should be rejected as an obstacle to the development of the Mediterranean region."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union must provide greater support to the Union for the Mediterranean project in both political and financial terms."
"The summit of the 43 Heads of State or Government within the Union for the Mediterranean will take place on 7 June in Barcelona and, as the European Parliament, we must hope that this meeting proves a success for the launch of the UfM institutions and the implementation of the projects."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I have drawn attention to aspects that I consider to be important, such as the creation of a Mediterranean free trade area, the participation of the research and education sector, the growth of broadband and information technology, and also increased opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In particular, regarding this last point, SMEs and business development are already one of the strategic sectors."
"The major projects must receive adequate support from European and international financial institutions and consequently, the new projects should endeavour to involve as many European partners as possible."
"Mr President, President Sarkozy's proposal for a Union for the Mediterranean was the highpoint of the French Presidency of the EU."
"Since then, it appears to have lost some of its lustre."
"This may not be a bad thing, because the EU is itself developing a robust and successful southern dimension of its own Neighbourhood Policy."
"This follows almost two decades of the development of the Barcelona Process and its political apparatus."
"Europe's taxpayers rightly take a very dim view of duplication of effort and waste of resources, and there is some confusion about all these competing processes, but whatever the fate of the Union for the Mediterranean at the summit on 8 June, we must not allow the eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy to fall behind."
"Sadly, we have not developed the putative Euronest Assembly in the same way as the Euromed Assembly which has been active for so long."
"This is principally because of the problems relating to Belarus' participation."
"Lastly, my ECR Group fully supports Mr Albertini, as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to resile from leading the visit to the Middle East."
"This has been controversial and discussed this morning in the enlarged Bureau."
"Any vote of no confidence in the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs by the Socialist Group we will oppose."
"(DE) Mr President, the Mediterranean has been the cradle of European culture and the driving force behind it for millennia and, therefore, I very much welcome this joint approach."
"However, the Mediterranean region is also a bridge for almost unrestricted immigration into the EU."
"In our opinion, one of the most important problems in the Mediterranean area, in other words, illegal immigration, forms part of the six main strategic projects and, therefore, urgently needs to be included."
"Only a joint approach in the Mediterranean countries, including those in North Africa, can help to slow down the flood of illegal immigration."
"This is the only way in which we can stem the tide of refugees at its starting point."
"As well as combating organised people smuggling, the EU must also focus increasingly on fighting poverty, raising awareness and providing information in the countries where the immigrants come from."
"It must be clearly explained to those people who want to migrate that the streets of Europe are not paved with gold, that Europe cannot provide jobs, prosperity and asylum for everyone and that many of these traumatic journeys end in detention and deportation."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the creation of the Union and the holding of the summit of Heads of State or Government, we still lack a clear definition of EU Mediterranean policy and a long-term strategic vision for the development and stabilisation of the region."
"Yet the Mediterranean has enormous potential: one third of global maritime traffic now passes through Mediterranean waters, coming from China, Asia, European countries, India, reaching our waters via the Suez Canal."
"The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows."
"We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects."
"The key points include agriculture, transport, maritime highways, transnational corridors, renewable energy and the Solar Plan."
"In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation."
"Let us reassert these words."
"Mr President, I will leave aside the most pertinent question this morning, and that is: how on earth are European taxpayers going to pay for all of the apparatus and secretariat that has been talked about and proposed in this House this morning?"
"I want to give my view that there is no doubt that stability in the Mediterranean is certainly good for the wider European Union."
"However, with European Union help comes responsibility from the very countries that want to benefit from the institutions and the enhanced economic opportunities."
"I want to focus very quickly on one aspect, and that is the rejection of a thousand tonnes of seed potatoes from Northern Ireland by the Moroccan authorities this year; a trade that had been going on for over 20 years; potatoes that had been inspected according to the normal rules before they left my country and then were rejected by the Moroccan authorities under a different regime."
"I do understand - and I respect - that Commissioner De Gucht is looking into this matter, but I want to stress that we do need responsibility from those who hope to benefit."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it was indeed a good and inspiring discussion."
"I agree with those who say that we lost a lot of time, particularly in building a secretariat."
"I shall come to that in a second."
"We are still facing some very important questions: how to make sure that whatever is going on around the Middle East process does not take the Union for the Mediterranean hostage; how to make sure that the summit takes place and that it creates the momentum you were talking about; and how to solve the issue of the intergovernmental approach vis-à-vis the Community approach as far as the Union for the Mediterranean is concerned."
"I shall make five very short remarks."
"The first is that I should like to express my appreciation of the Spanish Presidency."
"We worked very hard with the Spanish Presidency in recent months."
"We inaugurated the secretariat on 4 March together and the Spanish Presidency is working very hard to make sure that the Barcelona Summit takes place."
"My second remark is that it is very important not only that the secretariat starts its work, but also that it is funded."
"So far, it is funded only by the Commission."
"We will be sending one expert to make sure that there is compatibility between the project and EU policy."
"The secretariat should be small - about 40 people, more or less - and it should be that instrument which makes it possible for us to have more and more projects for the benefit of the members of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"It is also important to say in this connection that there are a number of sectoral meetings going on which will bring benefits."
"Next week, there is a Finance Ministers' meeting in Marseilles, and then next month, Agriculture Ministers will be meeting in Cairo."
"While the Union for the Mediterranean is a very important part of our Neighbourhood Policy, the main bulk of our work with these countries is in the bilateral relationship where many of the southern partners would like to have an advanced status."
"Advanced status, on my reading, also means advanced commitment from our partners across the board, including on human rights and mobility, which are also very important questions."
"I agree with the honourable Members who were calling on us to ensure a greater synergy between the bilateral and multilateral approaches."
"My last remark is that we are determined to work with the European Parliament."
"One of the next occasions will be the discussion on the neighbourhood package where we assess both the bilateral and multilateral framework of our neighbourhood."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three brief comments."
"Firstly, we have not been lacking in respect for anyone, especially not people who might be victims, but we considered that compassion, moral indignation and insults do not add up to a policy."
"Secondly, we have not, of course, ignored the conflicts which exist either in Cyprus or in the Sahara or, of course, in the Palestinian territories."
"Seriously, however, did we think, in the common foreign and security policy or in the various negotiations that have taken place, that it was up to the UfM to deal with these issues?"
"You cannot be everything to everybody and confusion of the mind is not a recipe for efficiency."
"Thirdly, I too am sorry that the Council is not here."
"It is not a good sign when you find out that this lack of political will is giving us cause to believe - Dominique Baudis is right - that the summit on 7 June is in the balance."
"Be that as it may, Parliament will have assumed its responsibilities."
"The people who constructed Europe did so with a long-term vision and a keen sense - following the fratricidal wars that divided us - of the importance of specific policy."
"It is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the Mediterranean in this report."
"With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy, as I said earlier."
"We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves."
"When you turn in on yourself, when you stop having exchanges with the outside world, then you start to die."
"That is why I think that this collective piece of work is an important piece of work and I hope that the Heads of State or Government - who have not recently lived up to their historic responsibility - listen and take heed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and Eastern Partnership are two cooperation initiatives intended to consolidate the European Union's neighbourhood policy."
"I believe that the European Parliament needs to monitor developments with these initiatives closely, particularly at the present juncture when global geopolitical and economic balances are being redefined."
"This initiative will help foster a suitable climate of trust for achieving common objectives, whether economic, cultural, educational or relating to regional security."
"I wish to emphasis that real progress in strong, regional cooperation will only be achieved by implementing large-scale projects and conducting dialogue at every level."
"In addition to the six strategic investment sectors specified, I think that new projects need to be launched in areas such as food, agriculture and culture."
"The Barcelona Process stalled for political reasons, first and foremost, because of the regional conflicts in the Mediterranean area, but technically, it is still alive, as shown by the major integration projects that the Union is supporting with its own funding and by the progress made in defining the institutional structure of the UfM."
"Since it was established in Naples in 2003, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has carried out its activities of coordination and democratic control over the implementation of these projects, which tie in with a number of major challenges facing the region: cleaning up the sea, transport, renewable energies, education, small and medium-sized enterprises and civil protection."
"However, the political drive needed to get the Euro-Mediterranean strategy off the ground has been lacking."
"The resolution on the Union for the Mediterranean is an important political act which, after more than two decades of considerable energy devoted to eastward expansion, draws the attention of the Council, the Commission and the Member States to the need to modify their geopolitical outlook and place the promotion of relations with countries of the Mediterranean basin at the heart of their foreign policy, starting with the adoption of a common position on the Middle Eastern conflict."
"This report on the Union for the Mediterranean marks the interest and investment of the European Parliament in dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean."
"The inauguration of the seat of the UfM in Barcelona and the designation of its first Secretary-General are a vital step in specifying the projects to be implemented within the framework of this Union."
"However, the UfM does, nonetheless, face certain political tensions."
"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still blocking its development: the interruption of the process following events in Gaza, the boycott of a previous summit in Istanbul; there are numerous examples."
"In this difficult context, we seriously hope that the second UfM summit scheduled to take place in Barcelona on 7 June will give new impetus and a new dynamic to it and to the missions it has to accomplish."
"Without doubt, persisting regional conflicts will make its mission difficult if they are not resolved, but we are asking the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the UfM to live up to their political and historical responsibilities."
"The meeting in Barcelona will mark our commitment to the Mediterranean."
"The Union for the Mediterranean, which was founded almost two years ago on the basis of the Barcelona Process and under the leadership of France, still faces many challenges."
"The political dialogue between the EU and its southern neighbours is not restricted simply to the subjects of migration and economic agreements."
"It also includes areas such as disaster control, energy and the environment."
"The Mediterranean regions are hard hit by water shortages and drought."
"In 2007, one third of Europeans lived in regions where water was in short supply."
"This problem is even more acute in the Maghreb countries, which do not have the necessary technical and financial resources to use water more efficiently."
"In the case of sudden, heavy rainfall, floods can cause even more damage, because of the infrastructure problems in these regions."
"Water is fundamental to all life and, therefore, it is necessary for us to increase our financial and economic cooperation."
"Projects which improve environmental protection can only be implemented on the basis of improved collaboration between the countries in the Mediterranean region."
"The need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus (debate)"
". The next item is the report by Mr Kirilov, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus (2009/2216 (INI))."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who contributed to the elaboration of this important report which outlines the need for an EU strategy towards the South Caucasus region."
"The South Caucasus is not only a region in the immediate neighbourhood of the Union - Romania and Bulgaria have a sea border with it - but also a region of great strategic importance for the Union in political, economic and security aspects."
"Therefore, the European Union's main objective there should be to participate actively in its stabilisation and to encourage the development of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia towards stability and democracy; to establish good neighbourly relations and integration in EU policies."
"The European Parliament supports strongly all the initiatives which increase the EU presence in the region and, in particular, the most recent one, the Eastern Partnership."
"It offers a valuable framework for increased regional cooperation, introduction of visa-free travel to the Union and conclusion of comprehensive free trade agreements."
"This is a two-way process that requires efforts and dedication from both sides; it is in the vital interests of the three countries to continue their efforts towards further democratisation."
"Good governance, political pluralism, rule of law and respect for human rights are of paramount importance for determining their future relations with the Union."
"Therefore, the European Union should continue providing financial and technical assistance to them in order to promote these principles within the framework of political conditionality."
"The region's strategic geopolitical location, its increasing importance as an energy, transport and communication corridor connecting the Caspian Sea and Central Asia with Europe and the growing EU preoccupation with energy security suggest a more active participation in the energy projects of the region, including the completion of the Nabucco pipeline project."
"However, these ambitious EU policies can hardly be achieved when there is a big shadow over the region: the unresolved conflicts in Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh."
"They are also a serious impediment to democratisation, political stability and social and economic development."
"Unfortunately, it was owing to the 2008 war in Georgia that the Union realised that it needs to play a more active role in the region as far as conflict prevention and conflict management are concerned."
"The deadlock situation due to these conflicts and the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty justify an increasing pro-active EU policy."
"This is particularly valid for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict where the Union has been practically absent."
"Simply stating support for the work of the Minsk Group at this stage is not enough if the EU takes seriously its new, more active role in foreign policy."
"The Union is the international mediator that is accepted by both sides and whose presence does not raise controversies."
"There is a need for the Union to lead the international efforts for rehabilitation and reconstruction in this conflict area by initiating reconciliation projects, people-to-people programmes and contacts, and by sending a mission into the region once a political solution is found."
"The conflicts in the region also demand a special effort with regard to the situation of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, which has serious humanitarian consequences."
"The European Union has the means and experience to contribute to the creation of a more tolerant atmosphere in the South Caucasus."
"It should also draw from its own historical experience and show to the people of the region that they can live together in peace and prosperity and can restore the good relations and trust which historically existed."
"It is a main task for the Union to try to convince the leaders and the people - the hearts and minds of the people - in the region to support the peace initiatives, not the threats, not the tensions."
"So there is a good future if we try to do it all together."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this exchange of views with the European Parliament on the European Union's relationship with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, the three countries of the South Caucasus."
"I already had a very good discussion on the South Caucasus with the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee on 28 April, shortly after my visit to the region."
"I welcome this report as a valuable contribution to the reflection on how the European Union can build an even stronger and broader relationship with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"Let me recall that we have a solid framework of engagement, namely, the well-established European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership launched last year."
"The former continues to be one of the European Union's top priorities for its external relations."
"Successful implementation of the latter, with the active engagement of the partner countries, will further strengthen our relations on the basis of shared values."
"Let me underline two very important milestones along this road."
"Last week, the Commission published its third annual progress report for the South Caucasus countries."
"The ENP action plans and the regular assessment of their implementation remain an essential tool to advance political and economic reforms in those countries as well as their cooperation with the European Union."
"This time, we have chosen a five-year assessment for the European Neighbourhood Policy package."
"The main objective is that we want to use the findings as a basis for extensive consultations with the Member States, with you here in the European Parliament, and with our partners in the neighbourhood, to get your - and their - feedback as to whether we have the right tools and instruments in place, whether the amount and the allocation of resources is appropriate, and whether the speed and the scope of our efforts are right and are going in the right direction."
"The results will be presented in the framework of next year's package, which should make our policy more coherent and which will, without doubt, lead to a higher degree of ownership by our neighbours."
"It will also be an ideal opportunity to make our case for the provision of adequate resources by the next financial perspective very strong."
"The second milestone is the authorisation by the Council, again last week, of the opening of the negotiations on association agreements with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"The adoption of these negotiating directives is a clear signal of our strong commitment to further deepening the relationship between the European Union and the countries of the South Caucasus on the basis of shared values and principles including democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"The Commission is already preparing for such negotiations, which are expected to start within the next few months."
"These two areas clearly demonstrate that the EU already has a well-established and comprehensive strategy for the South Caucasus, whose potential we are seeking to exploit to the fullest extent, a strategy to bring this region closer to the European Union."
"In the light of the report by Mr Kirilov, which is a very valuable and much appreciated contribution, I conclude that the European Parliament's views converge very much with those of the Commission on a number of points."
"The stability and security of the South Caucasus have a direct impact on Europe."
"Therefore, the European Union shares the responsibility for supporting the peaceful resolution of conflict and confidence-building."
"The South Caucasus matters to the European Union, not least due to its energy and transport links."
"Improved governance and a stronger system of the rule of law will facilitate trade and investment as well as mobility of persons."
"The new association agreements will expand the trade provisions under the partnership and cooperation agreements."
"I believe that the European Union is on the right track in strengthening relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"Let me stress, however, that the responsibility for the establishment of a constructive framework for engagement is a joint effort."
"The commitment of our South Caucasus partners to approximation with Europe needs to be translated into further progress towards democracy, market economy and political stability on the ground."
"I thus call on Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to move forward in their efforts towards a modern, inclusive, pluralistic democratic and prosperous society at peace with their neighbours."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I had the opportunity to present the opinion of the Committee on International Trade on the need for a European strategy for the South Caucasus."
"I know that this report is complex and sensitive in many areas."
"The strategy is vitally important for ensuring a consistent good neighbour policy."
"It reaffirms the European Union's role as a global player in the region in terms of general foreign policy and security policy."
"Cooperation with the South Caucasus in the energy sector and in fostering democracy and good governance must be included among the EU's main priorities."
"This is important for regional cooperation as well, and also because of the geopolitical situation of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, on the one hand, and of Russia, Iran and Turkey as a candidate for accession to the European Union, on the other."
"Trade barriers must be lifted and commercial and economic ties between the EU and the South Caucasus strengthened."
"This will boost political stability and respect for human rights and will generate sustainable growth and prosperity in the region."
"This is another reason why the signing of an association agreement and of comprehensive free trade agreements must become a key objective in our foreign policy for the South Caucasus."
"This will contribute to the settlement of frozen conflicts, enable Azerbaijan to join the World Trade Organisation very soon and improve these countries' administrative and institutional capacity."
"In this respect, I call on the Commission to show greater commitment to achieving these goals."
"Mr President, we will be voting today on a report on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus."
"This is a very important subject."
"Given the prevalent political situation in the region, it is crucial for the EU to play a more active political role."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I have been working very hard in particular to highlight the EU's role in the South Caucasus and to identify what concrete measures we in the European Union can take in order to help the affected countries and to bring them closer to the EU at their own individual pace on the basis of their own specific conditions."
"The report proposes two important steps that the EU should take quickly in order for it to be possible to implement the strategy - upping the pace of the negotiations on visa liberalisation and establishing a free trade area between the EU and the South Caucasus."
"All the countries in the region - Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - are former Soviet States, and Russia continues to influence the region much more than some people understand."
"In order to enable security, stability and peace to be maintained in the future, the EU therefore needs to have a greater presence in the region than we have at the moment."
"It is very important that the citizens of these countries have better prospects of joining the EU and it is crucial for the EU to understand the importance of stability in the Caucasus."
"I have also been eager to obtain clear reports of the long-term antagonisms that exist in the region and the ever-present danger that these will evolve into armed conflicts."
"I am therefore very pleased to see the text clearly reiterate our unconditional support for Georgia's territorial integrity and inviolable, internationally recognised borders and strongly condemn the recognition by the Russian Federation of the independence of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as contrary to international law."
"The report that we are voting on today received broad political support in the committee, which was pleasing to see."
"I would like to call on everyone to vote 'yes' to the amendments tabled by the PPE Group together with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Kirilov very much for his comprehensive work, which, as has already been said, has made a valuable contribution to our strategy in this region."
"When I was in the region recently, in Tbilisi, someone from another country in the area said that regional cooperation was a concept which had been imposed on the region by Europe."
"This demonstrates the attitude of many politicians and people in positions of responsibility in this region."
"Actually, we do not want to cooperate at all, but if Europe wants us to, then we probably have no other choice."
"We must make it quite clear that in Europe, regional cooperation formed the basis for us to come together and for peaceful development and it must be the same in this region."
"Many of the negative external influences to which the region is subject, including pressure from its former big brother, Russia, would certainly have less of an impact if the countries in the region were able to work together."
"The region is not only important for Europe but also, of course, for its neighbours."
"I am thinking in particular of Turkey, which is a neighbour we can work very closely with in this region."
"I would like to see a joint solution found in the near future for the two problems which Turkey is or may be partly responsible for, in other words, those relating to its neighbour Armenia, on the one hand, and to Nagorno-Karabakh, on the other."
"There is nothing to prevent the Armenian troops from at least leaving those provinces of Azerbaijan which do not form part of Nagorno-Karabakh."
"This would lay the foundations for an improved relationship between Armenia and Turkey."
"The members of this group, and Mr Severin and myself in particular, have repeatedly raised the idea of a union between the EU and the countries around the Black Sea, because we believe that cooperation between this region and the EU, but also with its neighbours Turkey and Russia, is very important."
"I think that the content of this report could form the beginnings of a union of this kind. At the moment, this is still a vision, but I hope that it will soon become a reality."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I believe that this report provides an important starting point for a coherent approach to the Caucasus region and provides a quality benchmark for the reports which we will have in the future."
"For this reason, I wish to congratulate Mr Kirilov and I believe that the efforts made by all the political groups have managed to produce a totally coherent approach to this region."
"In my view, 2010 can offer both the European Union and the countries in this region a window of opportunity because more active participation by European diplomacy in the three high-profile dossiers involving conflict, by which I am referring to Abkhazia and Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the dispute between Turkey and Armenia, may help make significant progress."
"The conclusion of this report, which emphasises a key factor for our energy security, is that we, the European Union, need to have greater involvement in order to normalise the security situation in the region."
"I think that the approach to adopt is to expand the commercial partnership."
"However, this should be accompanied, at the same time, by significant attempts by the European Union to bring democracy and stability to the region because the temptation towards totalitarianism still has a strong influence in this region, and we also have a general lack of democracy."
"We must devise major, well-supported policies and projects so that the factors relevant to this region, particularly, a lack of governance, the spread of conflict attitudes and, last but not least, corruption, can be eliminated."
"However, to achieve this, democratic will is required from both us and the governments in the region."
"The report mentions all these points which I have spoken about, and many others which are important to the European Union's approach."
"I am referring to individual rights and freedoms."
"I also think that it is crucial for the European Union and its Member States to consider a strategic partnership."
"Mr President, like the previous speakers, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kirilov, for his good work and for the high quality of the report, which is extremely comprehensive."
"I would like to touch on a few points which have not yet been highlighted, but which are very important to me."
"It is, unfortunately, the case that the three frozen conflicts in this region represent a huge obstacle to the full development of the European neighbourhood policy and not only that, but also the development of the countries themselves."
"If you have a real or assumed external enemy, things are relatively simple."
"In this case, governments and states often put too little emphasis on combating poverty, on doing something for their own population and on taking responsibility for their people."
"This means that the need to move away from high levels of military spending, which are criticised in this report and which have risen in recent years, towards spending on social services, culture and the environment, which benefits the population, is a central element of this report and I am pleased that it has been included."
"Another aspect which was addressed, for example, in the Tagliavini report on the conflict between Georgia and Russia, is the need for disarmament on an intellectual and linguistic level to counteract inflammatory language and the manipulation of history."
"All of this is necessary in order for us to make genuine progress in bringing peace to this region."
"Other factors include the need for more democracy, support for civil society, the protection of ethnic, sexual and religious minorities and human rights issues."
"All of these things remain relevant."
"One example from Azerbaijan is the case of two young bloggers who were brave enough to criticise the government and have now been in prison for six months and have not yet been released."
"The freedom of the media is a problem in all the countries."
"Fortunately, all of these aspects are covered in this report and I see this in the same way as the previous speakers."
"The regional dimension and cross-border cooperation are important."
"Therefore, we support the Commission in its ongoing joint activities in this area."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, as the Kirilov report makes clear, the countries of the South Caucasus are strategically important to our Union, not least in terms of energy security, e.g. Caspian oil and gas production and transit through the countries of the region."
"Sadly, however, this region remains paralysed by frozen conflicts, the most recent of which is, of course, Russia's de facto occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia which, in our view, are Georgian sovereign territory."
"We cannot, in terms of EU-Russia relations, simply pretend that this did not happen."
"Through the mechanisms of the ENP's Eastern Partnership, we must now, of course, redouble our efforts to reward Georgia's determined efforts to realise its Euro-Atlanticist aspirations, and I and my group fully support an FTA eventually, visa liberalisation and association agreements for all the countries in the South Caucasus."
"As a strong friend of Armenia, I am glad that the final version of the report is more balanced than the initial ones."
"However, I still remain concerned about elements of the report which appear to contradict the EU's official position on the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue and the Minsk Group's position in particular."
"Armenia has now made courageous efforts to resolve this long-standing impasse over Nagorno-Karabakh."
"It has also sought to normalise relations with Turkey, a move which should stabilise the South Caucasus."
"If only Turkey itself would respond in a similarly constructive manner without preconditions."
"If this border could be reopened, it would not only relieve the embargo on long-suffering Armenia, which has gone on far too long, but also allow economic prosperity in a very poor and underdeveloped region of Eastern Turkey."
"So there is enlightened self-interest for Turkey to move on this issue."
"It is not credible in my view that Turkey can justify the permanent closure of this border with Armenia because of its so-called solidarity with its Turkic brother, Azerbaijan, over the unresolved NK dispute."
"This is as logical as saying that Greece should shut down its border in Thrace with Turkey in solidarity with the Greek Cypriots over the Turkish occupation of Cyprus."
"We in the EU believe in open borders and free trade as a sine qua non for peace and stability on our continent and also in the South Caucasus."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate Mr Kirilov on the excellent work he has carried out in a field full of difficulties, but also opportunities, such as that of relations between EU countries and the countries of the South Caucasus."
"Europe has embarked on an interesting Eastern Partnership project, which has met with support and interest from Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan."
"However, the challenges to be faced are many and concern energy, economic and political issues, and especially security issues, as in the case of Georgia, the Nagorno-Karabakh question and the tensions between Turkey and Armenia."
"The development of relations between the European Union and these three countries will be much more effective if a climate of mutual cooperation can be established between Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, in accordance with the principle of territorial integrity and with the UN resolutions that form the basis for ending the unresolved conflicts in the area."
"It is important to stress the policy of the inviolability of a state's borders, which the EU has always supported: borders that cannot, under any circumstances, be modified using military force."
"(BG) Mr President, I would like to begin by informing you, ladies and gentlemen, that the rapporteurs, Mr Kirilov and Mr Kazak, belong to parties which automatically vote in the Bulgarian National Assembly against acknowledging the Armenian genocide."
"Against this background, it is not strange that, as Mr Tannock also said before me, this report deviates from some of the positions put forward so far."
"A large number of respectable Armenian organisations have contacted me, especially about the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, and informed me that the report has not, for instance, been mentioned and that there were no consultations with leading figures in the Minsk Group."
"It is also the case that, although the report refers to the Madrid criteria, it deviates from them."
"This is why I would like to make this constructive criticism to Mr Kirilov because I believe that unilateral representation of the one side will not improve the situation and will not help resolve the conflicts."
"A flexible approach is required which sees things from absolutely every perspective."
"Otherwise, we will only deepen the conflicts rather than resolve them."
"Mr President, I believe that democratisation, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights are the cornerstones on which our future relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have to be built."
"Cross-border cooperation at regional level in the South Caucasus will also increase this region's potential cooperation with the European Union."
"There are several very important dimensions to our economic cooperation, one of them being energy cooperation and security, especially in the context of valuable projects supported by the European Commission - such as the Nabucco Pipeline project."
"The Caspian Sea and the Black Sea regions are vital for European energy security and the EU strategy for the South Caucasus rightly recognises those elements."
"I would like to highlight very briefly three very specific elements."
"One of them is the involvement of local authorities in cross-border cooperation, because we need strong regional cooperation in the South Caucasus; then the issue of the accession of Azerbaijan to the WTO."
"I believe that the Commission is to give Azerbaijan the technical assistance and all kinds of help needed to accomplish this accession."
"The third and last point is the technical assistance mechanism that we could probably provide in order to strengthen the banking system and the financial system in the South Caucasus states."
"This would give the business environment and investors a very good prospect."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Kirilov speaks about the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus."
"Indeed, I believe a strategy is needed, but a strategy needs goals and goals pre-suppose a clear geopolitical identity."
"Perhaps we have to work on our geopolitical identity to define it better."
"What are our goals in the South Caucasus?"
"In a nutshell, stability, openness in the region and interoperability, legislative, democratic, political and so on."
"One has to recognise the specificity of the region within the Eastern Partnership and approach that specificity as such."
"One has also to recognise the specificity of each country within the region and to address it properly."
"We have to acknowledge and assess the role of Turkey in the region and use our negotiations with Turkey as a frame for developing an EU-Turkey partnership in addressing the local and regional challenges."
"As has been said already, Turkey, I am sure, could be very instrumental from this point of view."
"We must also acknowledge that the region is part of our common neighbourhood with Russia, and we have to try to find ways of promoting common policies in that common neighbourhood."
"The security issues for sure, and perhaps some issues related to energy, could be dealt with in a trilateral format."
"This would perhaps help us to promote solutions for the local, so-called 'frozen' conflicts."
"In this respect, we have to accept that those conflicts are only parts of a coherent, broader and more complex problem with a bigger, global relevance."
"Therefore, a package deal should perhaps be considered."
"Likewise, I think we have to get rid of some ambiguities and understand that the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity cannot always be applied together."
"Finally, I think that we have to consider a conference on security and cooperation in the South Caucasus with a view to developing a stability pact for that region."
"(PL) As permanent rapporteur of the European Parliament for Armenia, I should like to emphasise the need to define a clear and effective European Union strategy for the South Caucasus."
"We have great hopes for this region as we build a free and democratic Europe."
"To do this, we must very consistently support the countries of this region and encourage them to make further free market reforms."
"In this context, it is of fundamental importance to complete, as quickly as possible, the negotiation process for a new type of association agreement between the countries of the South Caucasus and the European Union."
"I am convinced these agreements will be a stimulus for the region to continue efforts at introducing democratic standards."
"The example of Georgia shows that such reforms have already brought results."
"In Doing Business 2010, a ranking of business-friendly states prepared by the World Bank, Georgia is in 11th place, which means that in four years, it has advanced by as many as 101 places."
"Transparency International has said that, as a result of the reduction in bureaucracy achieved during President Saakashvili's term of office, the Corruption Perceptions Index for Georgia has halved."
"The European Union should appreciate the fact that President Saakashvili is consistently applying a free-market policy, and his reforms are a good example for the other Caucasus states."
"(DE) Mr President, on 9 May, President Buzek and 20 000 people celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Robert Schuman declaration here in Strasbourg."
"Against this background, I would like to say that the South Caucasus is faced with two alternatives."
"One is to become something like the Balkans before the First World War, but on a global scale, and the other is to become something like the European Coal and Steel Community after the Second World War."
"In the Kirilov report, we are choosing the second of these two options."
"I agree with Mr Swoboda that if the three states in the South Caucasus were to work more closely together, the impact of external influences, such as the Russian influence, could be reduced."
"Therefore, it is in the interests of all three countries to come together."
"I support Armenia in its efforts to gain recognition of the genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire."
"However, Armenia would be much more credible if it finally withdrew its troops from Azerbaijan."
"We urgently need a peaceful solution in Nagorno-Karabakh and in the occupied Azerbaijani areas."
"Just as importantly, we need more stability in Georgia, because if Georgia is broken up, as many people in Moscow want, then the whole region will be destabilised."
"For this reason, the main issues are peace negotiations, a solution for the nationality conflicts and, above all, the return of displaced people to their homes."
"In the 21st century, displacement must not continue to be used as a political tool."
"People should not be attempting to maintain the process of displacement."
"We need a great deal more sensitivity and much more action in this area."
"(LT) I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Evgeni Kirilov, for his thorough and very significant report."
"The European Union calls on Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to do everything they can to ensure that these countries become stable, peaceful and really democratic states where human and minority rights are guaranteed and where there is civilised competition between government and opposition."
"It is not so easy to talk about regional cooperation when we know very well that all three countries have been damaged by frozen or completely fresh conflicts."
"Nevertheless, the European experience (in particular, if we remember the origins of the European Union following bloody wars) is eloquent testimony to the fact that the only solution is to talk, negotiate, heal wounds and act with an eye to the future and not the past."
"The countries of the South Caucasus will have a clearer European perspective if they are able to cooperate among themselves and in the broader region."
"Clearly, that also depends on the behaviour of neighbouring countries."
"The European Union has opportunities to play a more active political role in the South Caucasus to ensure, above all, the implementation of poverty reduction programmes, the alleviation of social isolation, gender equality and women's rights and investment in education and health care."
"It is important to accelerate the development of direct contact between citizens of the South Caucasus and European Union Member States."
"In particular, we ought to increase the number of students, teachers and researchers participating in mobility programmes."
"That is the common interest we all share."
"(PL) This is an important step for the European Parliament towards opening the door to nations which are obviously European, such as the Georgians and the Armenians."
"Frankly speaking, it is a step which certainly is overdue."
"It is a pity it did not happen two years ago, when Georgia became the object of Russian military intervention."
"Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction."
"I hope it will be given specific political content, and also that the EURONEST Parliamentary Assembly will play a role as an instrument of support for the ambitions of those states which are obviously European in outlook."
"Finally, I would very much like those of us who are talking, today, about the democratic deficit in the countries of this region, to speak as clearly about the democratic deficit in a neighbour of these countries, I mean Russia, so that we do not have a double standard."
"(PL) Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are undoubtedly European states, they are undoubtedly European nations."
"These states are members of the Council of Europe and take part in many international missions in cooperation with the countries of the European Union."
"The European Union must recognise the fundamental right of all states to self-determination and the right of nations to decide their own future."
"We cannot accept the archaic principle of regions and spheres of influence."
"I would like to devote a few seconds to the question of Georgian territorial integrity."
"It is very good that the Union has declared its support in this matter."
"The Union is seen, not only in the world, but also - and more importantly - in these countries, as a guarantor of security in the region."
"We must remember this."
"Unfortunately, some parts of the ceasefire agreements of 12 August and 8 September 2008 have not been implemented."
"I understand that talks are under way in Geneva, but perhaps we should draw attention to this once again in our bilateral talks with the Russian Federation."
"A second matter is that of visas."
"I agree with Mrs Malmström, who has said this is the way to bring people together and enable the citizens of Europe to travel."
"This should, without doubt, also apply to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"(RO) Bearing in mind the importance of the geopolitical situation of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in relation to the European Union, Turkey, as a European Union candidate country, Russia and Iran, it is necessary to devise a European Union strategy for the South Caucasus, focused on promoting economic growth, political stability and respect for human rights."
"Trade is one of the key instruments available to the EU for achieving these objectives."
"Concluding free trade agreements with these states would boost foreign investments, create new jobs and encourage economic growth in the region."
"Guaranteeing energy security is a common concern for the European Union and the South Caucasus region."
"Energy cooperation must be stepped up specifically by completing the Nabucco project as quickly as possible and by providing the EU's support for energy projects which promote energy efficiency and the development of alternative energy sources in the South Caucasus."
"(PL) Georgia and Armenia, and this is stressed by the authors of the report, are dynamically and successfully implementing a European strategy, a neighbourhood policy strategy."
"We ought to respond to this, and we should, in every case, take account of the specific character of specific countries in the South Caucasus."
"This strategy, for each of the countries, should include such areas as transport, the natural environment, culture and society."
"Mr President, in the context of the South Caucasus, mention is very often made of frozen conflicts and ethnic problems."
"It is very good that we do talk about them."
"However, the correct response of the European Union to the problems of the South Caucasus should be an emphasis on modernisation and on changing these countries so that the conflicts do not play such a large role."
"In this debate, we have very often forgotten that Georgia has just finished fighting a war."
"We are considering what to do about this."
"If we want the South Caucasus to be free from war, we must go for modernisation, because Georgia at least, but also Armenia and Azerbaijan, have recorded such high economic growth in recent years that they deserve our support. Thank you."
"(BG) Mr President, I welcome Mr Kirilov's report, which highlights the need for the European Union to play a more active role in the South Caucasus, a region of significant geopolitical importance."
"The positive development in the South Caucasus is of benefit to both the neighbouring Black Sea region, for which the European Union still does not have, unfortunately, a clear strategy which we can expect to discuss here some time soon, and to the European Union as a whole."
"I wish to express my concern about the delay in the process of ratifying the protocols signed between Turkey and Armenia last October."
"I think that neither side should stipulate conditions for ratifying these protocols which are in the interest of both the Turkish and Armenian peoples."
"As the report correctly notes, the negotiations between Armenia and Turkey on opening the border and establishing diplomatic relations and those being conducted in the OSCE Minsk Group about Nagorno-Karabakh must be treated as separate issues."
"The European Union must definitely make a more active commitment in the future settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."
"Based on our experience in the Balkans and recently from Georgia as well, the European Union is in a good position to play a key role in this region."
"A stable, secure and prosperous South Caucasus is in our interests and it is high time for us to assume our responsibility."
"The Treaty of Lisbon provides the European Union with a framework to become a real global player."
"A specific example of this would be the European Union's participation as a formal member of the Minsk Group, and not only certain individual Member States being members of this group."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are eight requests to speak under the 'catch the eye' procedure."
"There is not time for everybody because we must proceed to the vote."
"I am, therefore, going to allow only six Members to speak."
"(PL) The report on the South Caucasus is a good report."
"I would like to stress that in the report, particular attention is drawn to the role of the European Union as a mediator and a promoter of values but, above all, as a promoter of cooperation between the countries of the region."
"The problems which we have to solve are, principally, questions of the territorial integrity of these countries, but also how to strengthen them economically."
"As the European Union, we can help these countries here."
"I would like to stress that one of the main problems is the unresolved matter of refugees."
"Mr Posselt spoke about this."
"I think it is really disgraceful that in this day and age, this problem cannot be solved."
"I think a certain deficiency is the fact that the report does not refer to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, although all the countries in the region were, after all, signatories to it. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, today we are debating a very important and well-drafted report on an important area close to the EU, the South Caucasus."
"The area motivates perfectly the general recommendations of the EU security strategy."
"It is strategically located; it allows for the transport of Caspian oil and gas towards the EU; and it has its own, significant reserves."
"That requires our total attention and determination to act."
"However, precisely because it is strategically and energetically relevant, the area is fiercely contested by foreign powers exploiting its internal divisions and conflicts, be they still 'frozen' or 'defrosting'."
"If the EU is interested in making full use of the potential of the South Caucasus, then it must act together, rather than individually, and be more resolute in its actions, even if that involves making others less happy."
"For that we need a strategy."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Kirilov and Mr Kazak on their work."
"If our relations are seen purely through the prism of our need for oil and gas, we will exacerbate tensions and fail to achieve security in other senses."
"It is the need for peace and economic development in the South Caucasus which should drive our policy; that means engaging with NATO to ensure their new strategic concept reflects this, engaging with Russia and Turkey as powers in the region to seek to maximise agreement and extending the true hand of friendship to the people through association agreements and visa arrangements and so on."
"We should welcome the statement of Mr Medvedev and Mr Yanukovich on Moldova, which shows how much can be achieved through diplomacy, and I congratulate Commissioner Füle on the development of the Eastern Neighbourhood Partnership so far."
"I look forward, as the European Union develops a common foreign and security policy, to a more active engagement of the Union on all aspects of relations with the Black Sea region."
"(RO) I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Kirilov and thank him for his cooperation in drafting the report."
"I wish to emphasise two points."
"The first one concerns the issue of democracy."
"Bernd Posselt was saying earlier that the countries in this region need to cooperate."
"These countries can cooperate if Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia are governed by the rule of law and they are going to be predictable and pluralist."
"If this is going to happen, the EU will have something to gain."
"The second point naturally concerns the energy issue."
"I wish to stress at this point the role of Georgia and Azerbaijan as transit countries for energy resources and for the diversification of energy supply sources."
"However, I would like to say that it is good that Armenia will also be involved in these projects, including transport-related projects."
"In this regard, the keyword is transparency"
"(DE) Mr President, in order to reduce Europe's dependence on Russia for its supplies of energy, we should take natural gas from the Caspian basin through the South Caucasus to the EU."
"This will give the Caucasus a key role."
"This region is not only the world's largest transit point for the trade in gas and oil."
"It is also the place where the interests of Russia and the West collide and where even Turkey wants to become involved."
"In addition to the oil and gas contracts, Turkey is attempting to conclude a stability and cooperation pact."
"Stability in the Caucasus is undoubtedly also in the EU's interests, but we must not leave the responsibility for this plan to Turkey, otherwise new dependencies and even pressures will arise in the accession process."
"As the example of Cyprus shows, Ankara does not pull its punches."
"The ongoing power struggles over the European supply of natural gas have already delayed the construction of the large-scale Nabucco pipeline project, which has been in the planning stage for a long time."
"I hope that the competing South Stream project will have more success, so that the resources from the Caspian area are not lost to China."
"(SK) Armenian Government representatives yesterday warned me that the report on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus, in the section dealing with the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, includes formulations which do not conform to the official EU position as set out in the provisions of the declaration adopted by the foreign ministers of all OSCE states, and the provisions of the declaration issued by OSCE ministers in Athens on 2 December 2009."
"Items 8 and 10 in particular contain formulations which do not correspond to the Madrid principles agreed between the signatories of the OSCE Minsk Group."
"If these items are adopted in the proposed wording, they could become a serious obstacle to further progress in the process of a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh."
"In the interests of enabling the previously-mentioned concerns to be reviewed, I would therefore like to propose that we consider one of the two previously-mentioned options: either to remove the contentious provisions from the report, or to postpone voting on the report until a later date, so as to give our friends in the Caucasus time to explain their position on the report to the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the last speaker, Mr Paška, made a very important point."
"I would like to make three very short remarks."
"Firstly, I believe that we have a strategy, through the Eastern Partnership, to get these three countries closer to the European Union - and, in fact, they are saying 'as close as it gets'."
"Secondly, I think we have instruments for that: association agreements, economic integration agreements, mobility (the visa issue) and, last but not least, a different European Union - a European Union which could combine the Community approach with the common foreign security policy approach."
"My third remark is that I am looking forward to a discussion with honourable Members on the neighbourhood package, where we could also discuss the question of whether the concept 'as close as possible to the European Union' needs to have some institutional definition."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, once again, thank you very much for the comments and for the fruitful cooperation we had in the process."
"Thank you for all the comments and for the support I received from the majority of the colleagues who spoke."
"I would like to thank the INTA draftsperson, Mr Kazak, for the constructive ideas presented by his Committee, and the contribution of the ITRE Committee, many of whose suggestions found their place in the report."
"My gratitude goes also to the AFET secretariat and for the numerous experts, NGOs and other organisations who work actively in the region and who gave their valuable input and support."
"I just want to say one thing."
"We should apply the same principles."
"I heard some criticism from some colleagues."
"We should know that this House definitely would not support us if we speak about territorial integrity and self-determination for Georgia."
"We should know that the universal application of principles is the best basis to start and build relationships."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will take on board the recommendation made by the Parliament in this text and devise a comprehensive strategy for the EU towards the South Caucasus, and I would like to point out that Commissioner Füle made a very timely visit to this region."
"I would like to appeal to Baroness Ashton to do likewise and try to engage in conflict prevention in the area."
"Let me say that we welcome and support last week's decision by the Council to adopt the negotiating directives for the future association agreements with the three countries, and we believe that upgrading the contractual relations with the three countries is an important step."
"The time is right to step up with measures to prevent negative developments in the region and the escalation of tensions."
"Otherwise, we risk intervening again when it is already too late."
"We should not wait for it to happen again."
"The big lesson Europe has learnt is the lesson of integration."
"This is the only sustainable way of reconciliation with the past and investment in a better future."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In adopting this report, the European Parliament reaffirms the particular importance of the South Caucasus to the European Union, as well as the need to devise a strategy for this region."
"The three countries in the South Caucasus region, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, are part of both the Black Sea Synergy and the Eastern Partnership."
"Consequently, we have the framework and instruments to enable the European Union to become more actively involved in the region."
"The European Commission must come up with specific initiatives on cooperation in the following areas: energy security, transport, economic development and environmental protection."
"The South Caucasus region is particularly important for the southern corridor and, therefore, for the whole of Europe's energy security."
"Romania is involved in specific projects aimed at developing the southern corridor."
"On this point, representatives of my country, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed the AGRI Agreement. This provides for the construction of two liquefied natural gas terminals in two Black Sea ports, one in Georgia and the other at Constanţa in Romania."
"I would like to stress that we cannot ignore the frozen conflicts in the region as the situation in them may deteriorate, which would destabilise the region."
"in writing. - The situation in the South Caucasus region needs especially now a proactive approach by the European Union with the Lisbon Treaty providing the EU with a mandate to become much more engaged and present in the region."
"The full-scale Russian military invasion of large parts of Georgian territory in August 2007 dramatically demonstrated that so-called frozen conflicts can easily become sources of devastating regional conflicts if major powers like the EU are not actively engaged in the area."
"In 2007, both the EU and NATO were clearly left unprepared to face the new situation."
"Within the framework of Eastern Neighbourhood Policy, the EU is well placed to have a prominent role in contributing to confidence-building, reconstruction and rehabilitation."
"First of all, this means strengthening the presence of the EU in the region."
"We support fully the constructive mission of our special representative Peter Semneby."
"However, we cannot limit ourselves to monitoring missions."
"In addition and in violation of 2007 agreements, the EUMM is still not allowed to enter the separatist entities under Russian control."
"Such a situation is both intolerable and humiliating."
"We can continue cooperation with the Russian authorities only on condition that they fully honour their own commitments."
"The conflicts in the South Caucasus have reached a very dangerous ceiling, where we have got used to the idea that they are intractable conflicts."
"Whatever efforts are made - whether real or feigned - are only intended to create a certain kind of fog in the negotiations, which will certainly not lead to resolution of the conflicts."
"This applies to the territorial disputes between Georgia and Russia, and also, in a special way, to Nagorno-Karabakh."
"From my point of view, development of the situation between two of the countries - Armenia and Azerbaijan, which, under the Eastern Partnership and in European Neighbourhood Policy, are our partners - is an unacceptable policy of consent to the fact that these conflicts are intractable."
"The European Union, acting in agreement with Russia, which is a very important partner in this matter, must bring about a situation in which a clear statement of positions is made."
"This should involve, above all, sending a clear message to those countries which want to aspire to membership of the EU that solving territorial problems and at least partial resolution of the matter of refugees are basic conditions for thinking seriously about membership in the near or distant future."
"For me, the future and the way the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is handled are a litmus test of what the sides want to show on European matters and how they demonstrate their credibility in this area."
"in writing. - It was about time to discuss a strategy for the Caucasus, and this strategy should not close its eyes to the unpleasant processes ongoing between Ukraine and Russia."
"The case concerns the prolonging of the lease of the Sevastopol naval base up to 2050."
"The statements by Russian leaders that the Black Sea fleet will never be used against its neighbours do not sound too sincere."
"Why is the fleet there, then - to entertain kids and the elderly in Crimea?"
"Ceterum censeo, France has decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action."
"Announcement by the President"
"First of all, I would like to tell you about the difficult situation in Poland."
"In view of the dramatic flooding in Poland, where a significant amount of the country is flooded and people have lost all their possessions, I would like, on behalf of the European Parliament and all of us, to convey expressions of support and solidarity with the Poles and most sincere expressions of sympathy with those who are suffering, today."
"(Applause)"
"There will be a debate on this at the next part-session of the European Parliament, on 16 June 2010."
"I am sure the European Union will show solidarity and respond positively to the request from the Polish authorities for financial support."
"We have our own European Union Solidarity Fund, which is so important in this kind of natural disaster."
"Amendment of the agenda"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, a meeting of the Conference of Presidents was held."
"We finished the conference 10 minutes ago."
"We discussed very thoroughly the questions of organising the vote on the resolutions on the Europe 2020 strategy."
"As you very well know, it is a strategy which is intended to bring our citizens work, prosperity and stability throughout the Union for a whole decade."
"So it is a crucial strategy for the future situation in the European Union, and also for outside the Union, because we can only be strong if we are strong internally."
"In relation to the discussion during the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, arguments were put forward for voting on our resolutions on the Europe 2020 strategy today, because we would like to have them as quickly as possible so that we can participate responsibly in the discussion being held on this subject with other European institutions."
"However, there were also arguments saying that we need a strategy which we will adopt by a huge majority."
"If we want to influence the situation in the Union, we have to organise a big majority which supports the resolutions."
"There is a fear that there may not be such a majority, today."
"So, on the one hand, we need the strategy as quickly as possible and, on the other, we want a strong resolution."
"This is what we need."
"In relation to this responsible discussion among the chairs of our political groups, I have decided to submit a proposal that the debate be postponed."
"This is in accordance with Rule 140 of our Rules of Procedure."
"I will say this again: the decision is very important, because we realise the resolution is needed quickly, but we need a resolution which has strong support, and these matters are of great importance."
"Mr President, thank you for your statement."
"I should like to add that our Hungarian friends are in the same situation as our Polish friends in terms of floods."
"We therefore have the same thoughts for our Hungarian fellow citizens as for our Polish fellow citizens."
"(Applause)"
"I endorse your presentation."
"In a crisis situation, democratic forces must join together."
"It is with this in mind that I had proposed to the Conference of Presidents, before this Strasbourg session, that this decision be postponed to June, because I had noticed certain discrepancies and ambiguities."
"I did not obtain a majority at the Conference of Presidents - we are a democratic Parliament here - and we have therefore tried to prepare this resolution."
"At lunchtime yesterday, during discussions in our respective groups, we realised that time was short."
"I do not want to say that the work was botched, as that would be to refuse to recognise the work done by our services, our Vice-Presidents and the people responsible for preparing this work."
"We thought, before all or some of the heads of delegation, that it would probably be best, for Parliament's image, to get the text withdrawn and to vote next time; the crisis, may I point out, will not be over by the month of June."
"We discussed the matter and we agreed to decide that the heads of the large groups would ask for the vote to be postponed until June."
"Martin Schulz told me - and was the only one to do so - that first of all, I needed the majority of the group, but everyone needs the majority of the group."
"We did not therefore discuss amendments in our group yesterday evening, nor did we discuss the resolution today, as the group was in favour of postponement, in order to find a solution, which Parliament considers indispensable towards our fellow citizens."
"In the meantime, we have received a letter from Guy Verhofstadt; that is what made us decide to request a simple three-week postponement."
"In this crisis situation, I am asking you to grant it so that we, Parliament, can show our fellow citizens that we are a strong body and responsible men and women."
"Mr Schulz would like to speak against the proposal."
"Mr President, at the beginning of his speech, Mr Daul referred to the difficult situation in Hungary."
"Many countries are currently experiencing problems."
"For example, the people of Slovakia have been hard hit by flooding."
"We have a strong feeling of solidarity with the citizens of all the countries affected by hardship of this kind, including Hungary, Poland and Slovakia."
"Mr President, you and Mr Daul described the situation in the Conference of Presidents as well as yesterday and also this morning."
"I have nothing to add about procedural matters."
"However, on behalf of Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mr Bisky and myself, I would like to explain that we did not vote in favour of your proposal to postpone the vote this morning in the Conference of Presidents, because we believe that we should and, in fact, can vote today."
"There was a desire to adopt a resolution of this kind in Parliament on a broader level and with a broader majority than was the case in February."
"What has happened in the last few days does not relate to procedure but to content."
"However, one thing is completely clear."
"There has been a move away from the content which enjoyed general consensus in February and, given the serious crisis, this is not surprising."
"There are several different solutions."
"There are solutions which some people believe are good, and that is legitimate in democratic terms, and there are our solutions, which differ from those and which we believe are better."
"We cannot bring ourselves to the point of exhaustion in the search for a consensus."
"Now is the time to take up firm positions."
"You can take up firm positions and we will do the same."
"We have attempted to find a consensual solution, but this did not work. Therefore, we should now try to obtain a majority for one position or the other."
"If there is a majority in favour of postponement, I must say at this point that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will, of course, remain open to new negotiations."
"However, the starting point for these negotiations will be the text which we have submitted together with our fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Therefore, Mr President, I am of the opinion that we should vote today."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"I would also like to thank Mr Daul and Mr Schulz for calling attention to the fact that there are also floods, today, in other parts of Europe."
"You are absolutely right, and expressions of solidarity are due to all the affected countries and all the people of Europe who are today facing danger."
"Mr President, the water flooding into Poland is flooding from the Czech Republic, where it caused enormous damage in the first stage of these floods."
"The Czech Republic is also part of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I was talking about this a moment ago, when I thanked Mr Daul and Mr Schulz."
"Thank you, too, Mr Březina, for drawing attention to this."
"We have disastrous floods."
"Thank you very much."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"(DE) Mr President, I am very pleased that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were mentioned in the report on delivering a single market to consumers and citizens."
"Paragraph 46 rightly states that access to finance is their greatest problem."
"That is correct, because it is still easier to secure financing of millions of euro for a hedge fund than to obtain a loan of EUR 100 000 for a small business."
"Against this background, I would like to see the report not only describing what should ideally happen, but also requiring the Commission to take concrete action."
"(SK) Closer dialogue between universities and businesses will, in my opinion, contribute to economic growth."
"I am alarmed at the increasing unemployment among young people."
"The uncertain employment situation faced by young people often discourages them from starting a family or makes them want to postpone it excessively, and this ultimately has a negative impact in the economic and social sphere regarding the demographic transformation of Europe."
"The dialogue should therefore include measures to support the entry of young people onto the job market, enabling the full development of their potential."
"Other topics should include making use of education as a means of combating poverty, inequality and social exclusion, with special attention being devoted to people with disabilities."
"For the reasons mentioned, I support the proposed report."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and it was the right thing to do."
"As regards nuclear energy in general, however, I would like to say that many citizens are confused by it, and in my own country, almost everyone is against nuclear energy due to the terrible disasters which occurred in Sellafield and in Chernobyl."
"As such, I recommend that the Commission investigate the advantages and disadvantages related to nuclear energy, and that they publish a paper in order to give citizens the opportunity to make up their minds based on the truth rather than on emotions."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on the excellent job that you have done on your first day in the chair."
"(SK) The European Community provides financial assistance to Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria to support their efforts towards fulfilling obligations connected with the withdrawal from operation of first-generation nuclear reactors."
"The financial assistance for operational withdrawals which was provided to Bulgaria up to 2009 was intended mainly for preparatory work."
"The aim of the proposed continuation is to provide Bulgaria with assistance so that the country can operate and ensure the safety and maintenance ..."
"(The speaker was interrupted)"
"(NL) Mr President, a few of the amendments which the rapporteur has tabled to his report are nothing short of staggering."
"The rapporteur proposed dropping all the wordings about sound public finances, the breaches of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) which need to be brought to an end and the importance of the strict enforcement of the SGP and 250 members actually supported him in this."
"Staggering!"
"The aim of the rapporteur and of the 250 other members is to destroy the economy."
"How can it be that we still have 250 members who refuse to cut their coats according to their cloth?"
"Two hundred and fifty members of the European Parliament who fail to understand that the land of plenty does not exist!"
"All Member States will have to shed a lot of blood, sweat and tears to purge their debts, put their finances back in order and steer a different course."
"Obviously, this is a tough message and will not go down well with the voters."
"However, if we fail to do this, the whole of Europe will go bankrupt!"
"The path the rapporteur suggested is a recipe for how to destroy the sustainability of public finances in the short term."
"Fortunately, the amendments have not been adopted."
"Mr President, I welcome this report on public finances."
"It is a vast improvement on the first draft."
"High debt and deficit levels are a grave concern to the UK and across many Member States."
"We must wean ourselves off fiscal stimuli and quantitative easing, and these should not be the accepted norm."
"There is a need to focus on overcoming our high unemployment levels now and reducing the tax burden on employment and SMEs."
"Resources are scarce and we agree that, where money is available, it should be directed to growth boosting investments, such as R&D and greener, smarter innovation."
"Finally, we cannot hide from our issue of ever-ageing populations."
"Pension schemes must be transparent and taken into account when looking at public debt."
"There are some issues that I was wary of in this report."
"Migration, for example, needs to be handled sensitively."
"It can meet certain gaps in the labour force but must be controlled and take into account local factors."
"Yes, I agree that European problems do need European solutions, but we must be aware of the global economy and must respect the fundamental powers of our national governments too."
"(NL) I voted against the Hoang Ngoc report, mainly because of the nonchalance with which it calls for yet more mass immigration into Europe."
"How detached from the real world can the European Parliament actually get?"
"Our cities are already groaning under the problems of mass, uncontrolled immigration."
"It is time that we carried out a cost-benefit analysis at European level of the immigration of foreigners from outside the European Union."
"The governments of several Member States that have already been confronted with this issue have refused to calculate the cost of immigration and seem to think that it would be undesirable to gain any knowledge about this matter."
"How can that be?"
"We must also take into account the problems this will cause the developing world, which will witness a brain drain and the vital forces of their societies being siphoned off into Europe."
"Their problems will become even more severe, resulting in yet more immigration."
"Mr President, I voted against the own-initiative report on the Union for the Mediterranean for a number of reasons."
"There is no doubt that a stable Mediterranean is a huge prize for the wider Europe."
"However, at a time when the economic climate across Europe is perilous, it is entirely inappropriate that this House should contemplate the expense associated with such a plan."
"Grand meetings of Heads of State, a 40-strong secretariat and neighbourhood packages do not represent a frugal economic policy at this particular time."
"Furthermore, I opposed Amendment 5 for asking that the upgrading of EU-Israel relations under the Preferential Economic Association Agreement should not proceed."
"In the delicate balance that is required from Europe, such calls will do nothing to give confidence to Israel that this House will act as an honest broker."
"(DE) Mr President, in the early 1980s, when I was a young journalist, I paid a visit to King Hassan of Morocco whose accession bid to the EU had just been rejected."
"Following the visit, I wrote an article calling for a Mediterranean community."
"I had the privilege of working for Otto von Habsburg here, who said that the Mediterranean Sea had never separated Europe and its neighbours, but it must bring them together."
"In his biography of President Sarkozy, Jean-Paul Picaper wrote that the idea for the Union of the Mediterranean came from the pan-European movement."
"Why am I mentioning this?"
"Because I want to make it clear that this is not just a French obsession, as many people have said, and it is not a waste of money, as a previous speaker has stated."
"After the Eastern Partnership, it is the European Union's most important foreign policy tool."
"However, this is precisely the reason why we must ensure that it is properly designed and has a political structure."
"It must not simply be a free trade zone, because we know that the Mediterranean, as Churchill said, and I am aiming this remark at my British fellow Members, is the soft underbelly of Europe."
"We must ensure that this is not the case in future."
"Mr President, I supported the original paragraph 12 in this report expressing concern about the use of ethnic cleansing as a prelude to Russia's recognition of the puppet entities of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"My proposal was to call on Russia to honour its ceasefire commitments without delay and to lift immediately its blocking of EUMM access to South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"I find it is a really intolerable and humiliating situation that the EU representatives have to ask for access to these entities which had been agreed."
"Against this background a call to Russia to respect the sovereignty and integrity of the Georgian Republic has no authority, unfortunately."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The internal market and the euro represent two real shields for the European Union in the financial, budgetary, economic and social storm which the 27 are currently weathering."
"I voted in favour of this report, because it reaffirms the key role played by the internal market and gives a very good overview of the current stakes (budgetary coordination, development of education and research, aid for SMEs, strengthening and accessibility of SOLVIT and the Enterprise Europe Network)."
"This is a reflection and a travel warrant which perfectly complements that of Professor Monti, who recently submitted his report entitled 'A new strategy for the single market' to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which addresses the current shortcomings of the internal market."
"The economic and financial crisis has substantially damaged the single market integration process."
"It is unfortunate to witness the re-emergence of economic protectionism at national levels which might result in fragmentation of the internal market."
"A large number of SMEs are leaving the market because their access to finance has been severely restricted in the times of crisis."
"It should not be forgotten that SMEs form an essential part of the backbone of the European economy and are the main drivers of economic growth and social cohesion."
"Member States should put greater efforts in implementing the Small Business Act and removing red-tape and other administrative and bureaucratic obstacles for SMEs."
"I voted against the report, because it promotes elements which are extremely onerous to real viable growth and to the interests of the workers and consumers in the EU in general."
"Firstly, the rapporteur not only draws the wrong conclusions; he also starts from the wrong premise in formulating his proposals, given that he claims that 'the single European market, along with the euro area, best illustrates the true meaning of EU economic integration and unity, and is certainly the most visible achievement of European integration for EU citizens'."
"He forgets the lack of fundamental social and political union and overlooks the real conditions in many of the countries in the euro area today."
"He refers, in particular, to the social market economy, a vague term which basically means liberalisation of the market at the expense of even the last residue of social policy."
"The rapporteur also fully adopts the philosophy of competitiveness and the Europe 2020 strategy, which is not only baseless, but will have even more negative consequences for the people of Europe."
"We all know that the Europe 2020 strategy was launched with the aim of helping the European Union emerge from the current economic crisis and prepare its economy for the new decade."
"For this reason, I believe that the EU 2020 strategy must set realistic objectives for achieving by 2020 a green, knowledge-based, social market economy and sustainable development."
"Another objective is to create jobs in the agricultural and environmental sector as the single European market must be the cornerstone of the EU 2020 strategy, tackling the challenges of economic growth and consumer protection."
"I voted for this report because it argues that the single market is not solely tied to the economic aspect."
"It is essential to ensure that, in the revival of the single market, a holistic and a common approach is adopted whereby consumer and citizen goals, particularly those related to economic, social, health and environmental concerns, are fully integrated in a revived single market."
"The internal market, as well as the policies related to it, has allowed the European public better access to goods and services, and more variety at a lower cost."
"The principles of the internal market have meant that European consumers have had access to more information and better protection of their rights, but they are also becoming more aware of their obligations."
"For this reason, the reality of the internal market is not static but dynamic."
"It is a reality that is changing in a globalised world; thought must continue to be given to how to develop it and improve its implementation."
"I agree with the rapporteur and would stress the importance of the European Union's internal market for European integration itself, for greater social cohesion, for sustainable development, for competitiveness, and for economic growth that will enable us to face up to future developments and compete in a globalised market."
"The construction of an integrated, fully functioning single market is a process that is essential to deepened European integration, social cohesion, economic growth and the sustainable development of the EU."
"However, the economic crisis has undoubtedly affected public and consumer confidence in the single market."
"It is important that the European public sees the importance of the single market, the way it works and, most importantly, the benefits that it can bring to the public, consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Reviving the single market means that its various stakeholders must adopt a common holistic approach which incorporates the objectives of consumers and the public into a renewed single market, particularly those linked to economic, social, health and environmental concerns."
"This new programme for consolidating the single market must be carefully monitored so that it values social justice, guarantees the integrity of the market, stimulates innovation and aids the transition to a new digital era."
"These imperatives are likely to provide the single market with a competitive advantage against other major world economies."
"In order to create confidence in this single market, it is necessary to ensure that consumers are protected and to safeguard the public's social and environmental needs."
"I admire the rapporteur for managing to write, in all seriousness and without laughing, that the single market and the euro have served as Europe's protective shield during the profound crisis that has affected us for the last two years."
"Nothing has protected us, least of all the Europe of Brussels."
"On the contrary, it has established all the conditions needed for us to bear the full brunt: free global movement of capital, dismantling of public services and systems of social protection, increased job insecurity, and a monetary policy left in the hands of a central bank that is indifferent to the economic needs of Member States."
"These are the consequences of establishing a single market that has remained incomplete since 1992."
"It has also been an element of inertia, a superfluous element to be taken into consideration when Member States took things in hand."
"As for the euro, I think we should ask all those countries suffering from speculation what they think of its capacity to protect them."
"Today, it is a crisis factor in itself."
"The common European market is an important achievement of European Union integration."
"It gives many possibilities to our citizens as well as to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In a report on the strategy and future of the EU market which was published and presented last week, Professor Mario Monti points clearly to the fact that citizens and consumers should be among the main beneficiaries of the common market."
"The market is not always favourable to them."
"Therefore, when working on further legislative proposals, their concerns should be taken into account to the greatest possible extent."
"We should try to ensure that questions, for example, of recognition of professional qualifications, correct implementation of the Services Directive, e-commerce, small and medium-sized enterprises and consumer protection are priorities as we continue to build the common market."
"As Professor Monti has rightly observed, a certain fatigue with questions of the EU market can be felt in Member States, but it is precisely now that we need a strong common market more than ever before, as the crisis of recent months has shown us."
"Therefore, I welcome Mr Grech's report, which I had the opportunity to work on and which was our comment on the matter of the consumers and citizens in the EU market."
"in writing. - This report could not have come at a more critical moment."
"The ongoing financial crisis has created a sense of mistrust and led to more discussions about protectionist measures by governments."
"In the long term, this would have detrimental effects on Europe's economy."
"I believe there is a connection between the economic problems and the lack of motivation in completing the internal market."
"Mr Grech correctly points out in his report that the citizen is the real centre of the internal market and that it should be the economy that works for the citizen, not the other way round."
"In Mr Monti's report, 'A new strategy for the internal market', he warns that the internal market is more unpopular than ever but also more needed than ever."
"It is my belief that we must act boldly, whilst taking into account citizens' concerns, to re-energise the internal market."
"I voted in favour of the Grech report, although in my opinion, it could have underlined more the situation of SMEs."
"However, with the important amendments passed, the result was well-balanced and I hope it will lead to well thought out legislative initiatives by the Commission."
"The construction of a single market has always been and continues to be one of the EU's main objectives."
"A well-functioning single market is a fundamental process to further European integration, social cohesion, economic growth and sustainable development within the Union."
"Doubts have been emerging over what stage the single market is at, because of the recent economic crisis: there are those who argue that it is fragile at the moment."
"If this is true, it is very damaging to the integration process of the single market, and to the history of the Union itself."
"It is very important at this stage to find an instrument that clearly and unequivocally informs the European public how the single market works, as well as the huge benefits that it can bring to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The report is moving in the wrong direction."
"Now it is time to protect companies in the various Member States from the effects of the global financial crisis and to put in place clear regulations for speculators and the free market."
"Instead of this, the cultural and economic differences between the markets, companies and business practices are being sacrificed in favour of a globalised market."
"For these reasons, I have voted against this report."
"I voted in favour of the Grech report on delivering a single market to consumers and citizens."
"This document indeed finds a balance between, on the one hand, the objectives of an open economy capable of stimulating growth and job creation and of providing an integrated response to the major challenges of the future (such as competitiveness, research and development, industrial policy, and demographic and environmental issues), and, on the other, those of an economic system that is up to the task of delivering consumer protection and the social and environmental safeguards that citizens need."
"We must not forget the citizen and consumer in our recovery strategy."
"Europe must also adopt a holistic approach that fully integrates our citizens' concerns and other horizontal policy areas, particularly health, social and consumer protection, labour law, environment, sustainable development and external policies."
"The report urges the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal to ensure implementation of an affordable, expedient and accessible Europe-wide collective redress system by May 2011, which I advocate."
"This report consists of the best content-free rhetoric I have seen this year and, for this reason, I cannot support it."
"That said, it does contain both good and bad proposals, and I am therefore abstaining."
"I voted in favour of the report on university-business dialogue because, in my opinion, it is essential that the link between training and the labour market should be improved."
"This is not a question of orienting students in line with the desiderata of the private sector, but of enabling young people to take account of the implications of working life."
"Links between universities and businesses need to be strengthened in order to make it easier for students to access work and for businesses to accept untypical careers more easily."
"I support this report on a more active partnership between universities and businesses."
"Universities play a key role in the successful transition to a knowledge-based economy, but the active participation of other interested parties, i.e. businesses and government institutions, is also required."
"To achieve efficient results, the education sector needs to be restructured and modernised and curricula need to be reformed and brought up to date in order to satisfy the needs of the labour market."
"Once the conditions have been created for graduates to find work in small and medium-sized enterprises, we would bridge the gap between the supply of young specialists and the demand of the labour market."
"This own-initiative report contains truly positive ideas for the future of our universities."
"Any change to the academic training system which helps modernise training programmes and, above all, brings graduates and the world of employment closer together, should be welcomed and strongly encouraged."
"Today, the European university system, one of the most important elements of our daily life with which we can sow the seeds for a robust, lasting economic recovery, must open up to the labour market: forging solid links, in terms of mutual exchange between universities and businesses, is a priority for Member States' institutions, and it must be mainly local and regional authorities which have a say in endeavours to bring the economic and training sectors together successfully."
"Only universities that talk to the businesses in their respective regions can hope to prepare young people to enter and permanently stay in the job market."
"We all need, now and always, training establishments that are up-to-date and which, above all, reflect regional needs: this too, I am certain, is a vital ingredient for the growth of our regions."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"Today, knowledge is a greater priority than ever."
"More needs to be done concerning the knowledge triangle, adopting a framework of reforms needed to make knowledge a social value, and strengthening the ties between businesses and universities, as in the case of the Knowledge and Information Communities of the European Institute of Technology (EIT)."
"It is crucial that universities integrate the economic and social environment into their main sphere of action within their research and innovation programmes."
"It is essential to develop an investment strategy for new sources of growth, stimulating research, development, innovation and education with a view to strengthening our industrial base, an excellent service sector and a modern rural economy."
"The role of both public and private institutes of higher education, universities and polytechnics will be very valuable in building state confidence in these institutions."
"They should enjoy autonomy so that they are able to make their essential contribution to Europe's development."
"It is necessary to strengthen both the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary facets of education and research programmes and cooperation between universities."
"Information and communications technologies are a key instrument in this respect."
"I voted for the report on university-business dialogue: a new partnership for the modernisation of Europe's universities, because it presents measures that contribute to enhancing European learners' employability."
"Cooperation between the education sector and business is essential for bridging the gap between the supply logic of the education sector and the demand logic of the world of employment."
"I believe that partnerships that enable the modernisation of universities, especially those that promote better education and qualifications for individuals, are essential for increased European competitiveness."
"This qualification will be reflected in terms of innovation, research and development, which are crucial for sustained economic and social growth."
"Partnerships must be established between universities and businesses in order to facilitate the entry of these workers into the labour market, helping reduce the high levels of unemployment that are being recorded today in particular."
"In this context, I would also reiterate the importance of the European Union's cohesion policy, funds from which will be extremely useful for this purpose."
"In March 2000 in Lisbon, and March 2002 in Barcelona, the European Council approved the strategic objective of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, making its education and training systems a global benchmark in terms of quality, and creating the European Area of Research and Innovation."
"The Member States are responsible for education and training policies, while the role of the EU is to support the improvement of national systems through new instruments at EU level, mutual learning and the exchange of information and best practice."
"The knowledge-based economy and rapid technological development present challenges to higher education and research in Europe, but they also open up new opportunities which must be effectively harnessed."
"In this context, creating quality partnerships in higher education and business is of the utmost importance."
"I believe that cooperation between the education sector and business at local, regional, national and transnational level is crucial for bridging the gap between the supply logic of the education sector and the demand logic of the world of employment."
"The report on university-business dialogue adopts a position which we do not see as the way to modernise education."
"We must take the looming threats to free, public and democratic access to education very seriously."
"We believe that the errors resulting from the Bologna Process must be acknowledged urgently and, contrary to what the rapporteur says about the Bologna Process, the issue of mobility as a means of bringing the Member States closer together and making them more equal must be demystified."
"Furthermore, we should not forget that the Bologna Process is not neutral and involved initial investment, or that it has, at the same time, followed a policy of taking responsibility for university funding away from the state."
"The issue surrounding universities' autonomy is referred to several times in the report in question, with the idea of a 'partnership' between universities and companies being added to this point as a way of ensuring funding for the institutions."
"This university-business concept is moving away from the real meaning and value of education as a universal right and approaches education in terms of commercialising it, stripping it of content and quality."
"It is a neoliberal approach, to which we are opposed."
"I endorsed the Schmitt report on university-business dialogue: a new partnership for the modernisation of Europe's universities."
"I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who is, unfortunately, no longer a Member of the European Parliament."
"I warmly congratulate Mr Schmitt on his election to the Hungarian Parliament and on his being elected speaker."
"I wish him all the best."
"The EU currently finds itself in a very schizophrenic situation."
"On the one hand, there is a clear demand for universities to train practically oriented professional workers on undergraduate courses."
"On the other hand, people who really understand technical education know that the first three years of proper study at university should provide students with the theoretical foundation for further successful studies."
"This is the root of all the misunderstanding."
"A forum of universities and businesses, whatever format it takes, will always concentrate in particular on 'practically useful' graduates."
"However, the real bearers of fundamental research and important innovation are mainly graduates of engineering, master's and doctoral studies."
"If they are to achieve important results in their fields, of course, these graduates must acquire a proper grounding in the most important technical disciplines in the first three years of their studies."
"It is hard to imagine that they could get by on secondary school mathematics and a fleeting knowledge of the basic technical sciences, supplemented with an examination in simple and double-entry bookkeeping and a practical knowledge of preparing projects for an application to a grant agency."
"Responsible university lecturers advocate a view that does not vary greatly from my own, despite all the various declarations, forums, communications and new partnerships."
"For future discussions, I therefore recommend drawing a clear distinction between university education according to the Bologna Declaration and 'traditional' university education."
"The new, additional forms of so-called lifelong learning are, of course, also desirable."
"University-business dialogue is essential for the high-quality training to which the EU's young people aspire."
"Cooperation between the education sector and business at all levels is crucial for bridging the gap between the supply logic of the education sector and the demand logic of the world of employment."
"Partnerships between education and training institutions and companies are essential in order to enhance learners' employability, improve entrepreneurial potential, and facilitate familiarity with the world of work."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"In its communication, the Commission refers to universities and colleges being given real autonomy."
"This kind of autonomy should go hand-in-hand with financial autonomy and this is unrealistic during the period of austerity which lies ahead of us."
"There are many examples of very fruitful cooperation between educational institutions and business."
"The need for increased dialogue in the context of the Bologna Process is not worded clearly enough and, for this reason, I have abstained."
"Probably no EU Member State would doubt that cooperation between education and business is essential."
"Given that the crisis has highlighted not only problems of unemployment, but the importance of education that meets the demands of the market, I am pleased that by approving this document, the European Parliament is striving to initiate dialogue between the academic and business world."
"This should be viewed as something long-term, right from the beginning of studies in universities: various exchange programmes, the promotion of internships in companies, perhaps even consultations between universities and companies when devising curricula."
"If future employers integrate into the education system right from the beginning, there is a greater chance that we will prepare specialists who can better meet the needs of employers in the labour market."
"I voted in favour of European Parliament resolution No on university-business dialogue: a new partnership for the modernisation of Europe's universities (2009/2099 (INI)), because the dynamics of today's labour market, economic development and change to development priorities require cooperation at many levels."
"Higher education throughout Europe faces a huge challenge."
"It has to keep up with a dynamically developing world and changing expectations of the market with respect to new employees."
"Today, the fact that opportunities in education and the level of education do not match market expectations is a very important problem."
"Preservation of this system, which is full of inequalities, is a mistake we cannot accept."
"For just this reason, the changes we should introduce must concern the whole field of education and the way young people perform in the labour market."
"As a former president of the Students' Parliament of the Republic of Poland, a statutory institution which represents all students in Poland, I often meet people who have just begun or are just ending university."
"Awareness of the labour market and its requirements is very low, and the level of education is equally unsatisfactory."
"In political bodies as well as student bodies, a common view is that what is important is how many practical and work experience placements people have completed, how many subjects they have studied or how many languages they can speak."
"However, the market needs quality, not quantity."
"Therefore, it is essential that we take action to improve cooperation between universities, the academic world and business."
"I voted for the Schmitt report to encourage cooperation between universities and companies."
"Nowadays, universities must engage in closer cooperation with the business world in order to provide a suitable response to the requirements of the labour market, especially in a globalised economy."
"In this respect, dialogue and cooperation between universities and companies should be based on reciprocity, trust and respect."
"This objective could be achieved by introducing a system of knowledge vouchers, similar to that used in several Member States at the moment, which will enable SMEs in particular to improve their research capacity without compromising the universities' independence, autonomy and public nature."
"Both universities and companies can benefit from jointly developing multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial skills, as well as from the flexible adaptation of study areas, profiles and specialities to the needs of the economy and those of small and medium-sized businesses."
"I voted for the report on the university-business dialogue: a new partnership for the modernisation of European universities."
"The EU needs to establish closer links and partnerships between universities and the business sector in order to develop a society based on knowledge and applied research and improve graduates' integration into the labour market."
"Unfortunately, discrepancies are being noted increasingly more often between graduates' skills and the qualifications required on the labour market."
"I encourage the Commission and Member States to draw up medium- and long-term forecasts for the skills required in order to correlate study programmes with economic development."
"Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to the need to increase the number of jobs, which is a priority for the EU, especially during the current recession."
"We encourage the Commission to promote using the resources and instruments available to it the development of an entrepreneurial culture by simplifying procedures and cutting red tape in order to boost exchanges between universities and businesses."
"Finally, I wish to stress the importance of lifelong learning, particularly through distance learning courses specially adapted to the new technologies and beneficial in particular to the over-45s, who are more vulnerable and exposed to social exclusion."
"The European Union protects its citizens."
"Apart from European regulations on dangerous products which people are trying to bring on to the internal market, apart from joint measures taken against terrorism, apart from joint initiatives to guarantee peace in Europe, the European Union is involved in the dismantling of nuclear power plants constructed during the Soviet era which might put our health in danger at any time."
"Twenty-four years after the horrendous accident in Chernobyl, I am pleased to have contributed towards security on our continent by voting in favour of this report."
"It is, in fact, vital that the measures taken in Bulgaria under the Kozloduy Programme continue in the period from 2010 to 2013."
"in writing. - UKIP regards the safety of nuclear power generation as being of great importance, but perceives the EU's assistance to Bulgaria, ostensibly for this purpose, as being motivated by political considerations (preventing the reprocessing of fissile material, conveniently close to Bulgaria, in neighbouring Russia) and doctrinaire ones (the imposition of unrealistic wind-power policies) as well as by a desire to fund local conservation projects, which are not relevant to the remit of decommissioning."
"Consequently, UKIP members have voted against the extra funding asked for in this report."
"The rules in force in Central and Eastern European countries regarding nuclear power and radioactive waste prior to accession were less demanding than the rules applicable to the EU at the time."
"The EU's intervention and financial assistance were therefore necessary, with the aim of increasing the level of protection of human health and the environment."
"The proposal on which we are voting fits into this framework."
"The proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission is intended to provide financial assistance for the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Plant in Bulgaria and to ensure that the resultant radioactive materials are dealt with."
"According to the rapporteur, without EU assistance, safety may be compromised insofar as Type WWER 440/230 reactors have serious design faults which it would not be possible to overcome."
"The protection and promotion of human and environmental health are priority objectives in European development policy."
"Given this, I believe it is absolutely vital for the EU to safeguard sufficient financial and technical resources for decommissioning Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Plant in Bulgaria, as advocated by Parliament in this resolution."
"In so doing, Europe is closing off a major producer of high radioactive emissions and eliminating the risk of serious accidents."
"Alongside the safety conditions for decommissioning operations, it is crucial that the European Community assume an active role in helping Bulgaria to overcome the negative effects that the decommissioning will have on economic competitiveness, energy sustainability and the state of the labour market."
"In this context, the strategy for EU intervention must ensure support to encourage the creation of new jobs and sustainable industry in the areas affected by the decommissioning."
"in writing. - The Parliament today approved EUR 300 million to further assist the decommissioning of the Kozloduy 1-4 nuclear reactors."
"I do support this as further assistance will be necessary to ensure the safe decommissioning of the reactors."
"Parliament, however, rejected financing by these funds for polluting lignite power plants."
"Also, the proposal to use part of the funds to help Bulgaria find a solution for the final storage of nuclear waste was rejected."
"This led me to vote against the amended proposal."
"However, I abstained on the legislative resolution to allow for decommissioning funding by the EU."
"We can only be delighted by any move towards the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant and the implementation of research programmes for renewable energies and nuclear waste."
"This is a step towards the gradual phasing-out of nuclear power, which we advocate."
"However, I wish to stress that I am baffled by the insistence on the 'final disposal' of nuclear waste."
"This method cannot provide a long-term solution, given the risks it poses to our ecosystem."
"I am also concerned by the lack of guarantees regarding the allocation of EU financial assistance aimed at facilitating the decommissioning process."
"How can we be sure that the EUR 300 million will not be partly used to finance the new Belene nuclear power plant in Bulgaria?"
"Has Commissioner Oettinger not already committed himself to financing that project?"
"I am voting in favour of this report in the hope of finally witnessing the decommissioning of the Kozloduy reactors."
"The accession of Central and Eastern European countries to the EU and their use of nuclear energy have led to the need to provide financial assistance to these countries so that they can effectively deal with radioactive waste and can improve protection of human health and the environment."
"The financial assistance adopted here is, therefore, within this framework."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"In its accession agreement, Bulgaria, like Slovakia and Lithuania, agreed to decommission part of its nuclear energy production."
"Financial assistance was provided until 2009 for the permanent decommissioning of the nuclear energy plant at Kozloduy, but a request was made, as was done with the other Member States, for this to be extended until 2013."
"To this end, it will receive approximately EUR 860 million in assistance."
"However, the complete decommissioning process takes a long time since it is not enough simply to disconnect the power plant completely from the grid."
"In such cases, where there is a desire to shut a nuclear plant down earlier than planned, provision must be made for a replacement energy supply."
"Bulgaria did not destroy its energy supply, but it affects neighbouring countries, since they stop receiving electricity."
"The closure of four reactors means a loss of 1 700 MW of energy for Bulgaria."
"The Bulgarian Government is unable, without the financial help of the European Union, to dispose safely of the spent fuel, part of which was, in any case, disposed of somewhere outside the EU Member States."
"I am also aware of the fact that the Bulgarian Government does not have reserves to draw on in the event of permanent decommissioning and, therefore, we must provide assistance."
"We have already invested a great deal of money in the permanent closure of nuclear power plants, but let us just consider whether it would not be more worthwhile if, instead of shutting down nuclear plants, we modernised them."
"I am not thinking specifically of Kozloduy here."
"We need to support the improvement of the safety norms in Central and Eastern European countries, since it is on account of their low level that nuclear power plants need to be shut down."
"As long as there is no satisfactory solution to the problem of the final disposal of radioactive waste, it is hardly surprising that the candidate countries do not know which alternative they should choose."
"We must ensure that we do not provide financial aid to increase the protection for people and the environment and then find that the fuel elements are sold and possibly used for military purposes."
"Of course, it is in the security and environmental interests of the whole of Europe to find a final disposal solution."
"However, the resale of atomic waste must be stopped."
"When we have reached the point where the decommissioning of two reactor units costs EUR 1.78 billion, it is clear that the fairytale of cheap, climate-friendly nuclear power is over."
"This report highlights some of the problems involved with nuclear power and the decommissioning of nuclear reactors, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"In keeping with the commitments assumed through the EU accession treaty, Bulgaria must close Units 1-4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, which the EU granted financial assistance for up until 2009."
"I voted for this report to support Bulgaria's action to obtain an additional EUR 300 million in funding up to 2013 in order to complete the decommissioning of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, clean up the site and manage all the resulting waste in a sustainable manner in conditions which will not cause any harm to people's health and the environment."
"Furthermore, I support the Commission's request to monitor and audit the implementation of all the projects which will be run using this grant: research/innovation aimed at introducing technologies based on renewable energy sources in order to meet the requirement to realise a further reduction of 18 000 kt CO2-eq produced from decommissioning."
"Particular attention must be focused on retraining the workforce to prevent unemployment from rising even higher and on the development of local communities, especially during the current crisis."
"All these processes must be carried out in a manner which is completely transparent to citizens, in compliance with the provisions of all the multilateral environmental agreements which Bulgaria is party to (Aarhus, Espoo, etc.)."
"in writing. - As expected, we the Greens lost our last chance to amend the Harms report during the plenary vote on Community financial assistance with respect to the decommissioning of four units of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria."
"Today, the EP agreed to give EUR 300 million (until 2013) to Bulgaria for their current programme to decommission 4 nuclear units in Kozloduy."
"This positive signal towards Bulgaria was the reason why the rapporteur and the Greens/EFA abstained on the legislative proposal."
"Thanks to the Greens, the EP has finally recognised that Bulgaria has hardly any policy regarding the final disposal of nuclear waste."
"However, the Bulgarian government - with the help of the EPP and S&D - managed to eliminate any provision that would support any real progress on the issue of final disposal."
"Currently, the main hazards to humans and the environment are displaced to Russia, where most irradiated fuel elements are exported."
"The EP has nevertheless managed to secure more public participation, transparency, auditing and reporting provisions compared to the original Commission proposal."
"We will see now whether any of these will be incorporated by the Council, which has the final say since the EP is only consulted on nuclear related issues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as with Bulgaria's Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, the decommissioning of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania was one of the conditions for accession to the European Union."
"The decommissioning of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in 2009 has had a severe impact on Lithuania."
"After Lithuania regained independence in 1991, Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant contributed a lot to our economy and provided more than 70% of our country's energy consumption."
"Due to decommissioning, we were forced to relinquish our status as an energy exporter and become an importer of a broad spectrum of energy."
"Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was a cheap source of energy for industry and consumers and was also a source of income thanks to exports."
"Like the decommissioning of Kozloduy, the disappearance of Ignalina will result in the loss of business and jobs for the local economy."
"Full financial support from the EU for Kozloduy and Ignalina is important in order to correct some of the economic and social consequences experienced with the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants."
"The financial turmoil of recent years has shaken Lithuania and many EU Member States, and has put on hold hopes of building new advanced nuclear power plants in the near future."
"However, it would be foolish on our part to give up nuclear power plants entirely."
"Nuclear technology is by no means a panacea for our energy security and natural disasters, but the use of efficient and safe nuclear energy could contribute to overcoming long-term strategic challenges."
"The Structural Funds put in place in our regions need to interlock better with European loans for research and innovation. The van Nistelrooij report contains useful recommendations on improving the use of all of these loans."
"There is undeniable potential here for financing and growth for our territories."
"Similarly, greater synergy between the various financial instruments can only be beneficial at a time when we need to kick-start economic activity."
"Finally, these funds should all be involved in the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Having noted the quality of the report, I supported it with my vote."
"Innovation can be most effectively addressed at regional level by the proximity of entities such as universities, public research organisations or industry, promoting partnerships in the field of knowledge transfer, and the exchange of best practice between regions."
"The cohesion policy is a fundamental pillar of the European integration process and one of the EU's most successful policies, encouraging convergence between increasingly diverse regions, and stimulating economic growth and the creation of jobs."
"Promoting and applying successful models in the knowledge triangle is vital, as is ensuring the sustainable development of regional strategic research frameworks for innovation, in conjunction with businesses, research centres, universities and public authorities."
"I would like to highlight the potential of regional 'clusters' of those leading the way in knowledge-based mobilisation of the capacity of regional competition, and the inclusion of the development of 'clusters' in both the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the 7th framework programme."
"I would also like to draw attention to the importance of the knowledge and innovation communities created within the framework of the European Transparency Initiative, which link the main regional knowledge-based 'clusters' within Europe."
"I call upon the exchange of knowledge in regional 'clusters' to be promoted through the structural funds, since these 'clusters' represent a great opportunity, particularly for disadvantaged regions."
"I believe it is appropriate to analyse the way in which the indicative framework of the Community Strategic Guidelines 2007-2013 and, in particular, Guideline 1.2 on Improving Knowledge and Innovation for Growth, was followed by the Member States and Regions in their National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs) and Operational Programmes."
"Such analysis enables us to have a more specific view of what has been done and what challenges remain to be overcome, in an area that is increasingly on the agenda."
"At times of crisis, the avoidance of waste and duplications is not just beneficial but urgently required: I believe that it is important to carry out a thorough assessment of how cohesion, research and innovation policies are linked up with their instruments (Structural Funds, Seventh Framework Programme for RTD and Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme) to make them more efficient and productive."
"Research and innovation are priority areas and are absolutely crucial for competitiveness and the success of the European economy in the current global climate of crisis, intense competition and increased efforts to address new challenges such as climate change and territorial cohesion."
"This crisis exacerbates the risk of regional imbalances and the worsening of economic and social conditions in the most disadvantaged regions."
"In the light of this, I support this resolution, which stresses the urgent need to achieve greater efficiency, flexibility and simplification of access to structural funds, so as to ensure quick access to support and financing mechanisms for new business projects and for the revitalisation of small and medium-sized businesses."
"This is a strategy that is extremely pertinent and important for the territorial cohesion of the EU, as it simultaneously ensures that this crisis becomes an opportunity to capitalise on strengths and improve efficiency in the profitability of resources."
"I voted for this report as research, development and innovation are key elements which can help the European Union to emerge more quickly and stronger from the current economic crisis, while also achieving the proposed economic development objectives."
"A consistent policy is required to do this, which is well targeted and funded appropriately."
"However, I think that consideration must be given to the regions' varying social and economic features."
"Limits need to be accepted and objectives set according to the actual situation, while requirements need to be identified by consulting all local, regional and national agencies."
"Innovations are important, but they cannot be dictated from above, as the Europe 2020 strategy attempts to do."
"However, they can be supported by means of subsidy programmes."
"It makes little sense for applicants for subsidies to be faced with a jungle of different funding institutions and regulations because of the lack of coordination between the EU and the Member States."
"Every step which we take towards simplification is a good thing, provided that it does not open up opportunities for abuse."
"The approaches described in the report seem to me to be good and I have voted in favour of them."
"Cohesion policy is an essential pillar in the process of European integration and one of the most successful EU policies, facilitating convergence between regions, as well as stimulating growth and employment using financing from the structural funds. In the current period of 2007-2013, all Member States have devoted a significant amount of their total financial allocations to innovation and development activities."
"I believe that cohesion policy is ready to create synergies with research and innovation policies regarding capacity building, networking and knowledge transfer."
"Better use of funds will mean better research, knowledge and innovation capacity in the various regions, with the strengthening of the territorial aspect of partnerships for the design and delivery of public policies."
"This report is an initiative that I support because I think that it is essential for synergies to be implemented between the structural funds devoted to research and innovation and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development, with a view to greater efficiency in achieving the goal of the knowledge society."
"I voted in favour of the resolution, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament."
"The long-term sustainability of our public finances is fundamental today to the credibility of European economic and fiscal policy."
"The Greek crisis has proven that."
"Faced with the markets and credit rating agencies, the public powers need to demonstrate that they are responsible."
"This is also a necessity imposed by the demographic reality of today and the coming years."
"I therefore firmly rejected the positions advocated by the rapporteur, Mr Liem Hoang Ngoc, calling for the public deficit policy to be maintained."
"We must assume today that the public finances of numerous Member States are not sustainable and have the courage to remedy that."
"Our boat is taking on water."
"Even if it is not yet sinking, it is high time we started bailing."
"During the vote on Thursday 20 May on the report by the socialist MEP, Liem Hoang Ngoc, on the long-term sustainability of public finances, the UMP and Modem groups in the European Parliament voted enthusiastically for a text which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe had amended line by line in order to turn it into a neoliberal manifesto."
"I voted against this text, which is an insult to the citizens of Europe."
"The UMP and Modem are raising the spectre of unsustainable deficits to justify unprecedented austerity measures throughout Europe from 2011."
"They propose transforming the Stability Pact into a Social Regression Pact."
"In this text, the right goes as far as rejecting the creation of a European public credit rating agency, while the private agencies are beating the drum and leading speculative attacks against the States in the euro area."
"However, it forgets that the rise in deficits is first and foremost the result of the crisis, the bank bailout packages and the failure of neoliberal policies."
"Today, the right is presenting the invoice to the citizens."
"The huge deficits and debts facing many Member States of the EU is indeed an important problem, having created the financial crisis which we are experiencing and which we all need to manage."
"However, the causes of these financial aberrations are not the causes identified by the rapporteur."
"State budgets have been derailed because: a) in every crisis, state spending (social spending, spending for growth) increases, b) the merchant banks were saved and c) tax competition was intensified, with a clear reduction in corporation tax over the last twenty years."
"Consequently, our analysis of the facts is completely different from the analysis made by the rapporteur, who believes that the governments are responsible for the financial derailments."
"Last year, the budget deficit and public debt in the euro area amounted to 6.3% and 78.7% respectively of GDP, which was a much higher level than that set in the Growth and Stability Pact."
"The Growth and Stability Pact's limitations have been highlighted in the current crisis, as it has not been an adequate instrument for harmonising national economies."
"Consequently, I support a review of the Pact and the search for alternative mechanisms for restoring the convergence of the economies within the EU, as well as the setting up of a European public credit-rating agency and closer coordination of Member States' budgetary and monetary policies."
"In fact, I regard the decision made last week by the European Central Bank to purchase bonds issued by the governments in the euro area as a positive step."
"I decided to vote against the final report on the long-term sustainability of public finances as these aspects which I consider as being fundamental to ensuring the single European market's stability and to maintaining a modern welfare state in Europe have been removed from the report."
"In the times that we are currently experiencing, in which many countries are facing serious difficulties with their public finances, it is essential to adopt political measures that lead to economic and social stability, but especially those that stimulate growth."
"As well as the deficit, the level of public debt must be analysed and best practices regarding this issue adopted, in such a way as to make a more stable situation possible and to prevent the recurrence of the same errors in the future."
"I also consider it essential to adopt reasonable criteria for the concept of recovering economy, since the Member States' situations are different."
"Finally, I would stress the need for a competitive tax policy, not just for the EU, but also with regard to third-country investments."
"As the current crisis has shown, with its profound impact on economic development, the quality of life of citizens and social stability, the sustainability of public finances is a prerequisite for economic recovery and the reliability of development."
"The inadequacy of the revision to the Stability and Growth Pact has also become clear."
"I would therefore like to reiterate the need to strengthen the mechanisms of EU institutions, with a view to greater integration and territorial cohesion, so as to ensure greater capacity for intervention and protection in order to counter risks and deviation from common policy."
"I would also like to highlight the social concerns stressed in this report, which warns of the wide disparity between incomes of members of the public."
"This is a situation which undermines productivity and economic competitiveness."
"I agree, therefore, with the need to encourage Member States to introduce appropriate reforms in order to address these imbalances."
"Tax fairness and efficient government public spending are essential to the process of economic recovery and social cohesion."
"Reducing poverty, ensuring social cohesion and stimulating economic growth and productivity are indisputable priorities in the EU, and they will certainly be helped by a gradual reduction of the tax burden on jobs and on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I agree with the report: current public debt and deficit levels will be difficult for future generations to bear, but are also a major problem today."
"However, I disagree with the proposed solutions."
"I do not believe that a report which omits the reason for the recent explosion of this debt and deficit can be taken seriously."
"It should be noted instead that it is the fact that the private debts of banks and the financial sector have been taken on by Member States, and therefore by the citizens and taxpayers of Europe, which has caused these deficits to increase to such an extent."
"We must hammer home the fact that the EU and the Eurogroup are now only taking action in order to please those markets that you believe to be rational and efficient, but which panic when the deficit becomes too great, and panic once again because they fear that the measures taken to reduce it may hinder a semblance of economic recovery."
"They have gorged themselves by charging a high price for a risk taken on the Greek debt that you have just done away with by adopting the latest measures."
"They have won on all fronts, increasing their own profits even further."
"Never mind the consequences for the real economy and the people."
"I was forced to vote against the report by my colleague, Liem Hoang Ngoc, which the European right and liberals completed in a way which deprived it of its substance, simply defending dogmatic adherence to the Stability Pact and hence to austerity policies."
"Budgetary policy is not an end in itself; it is a tool which responds to political objectives."
"The priority should not be austerity, otherwise we shall nip in the bud what little growth is available; what we need is a philosophy of employment growth that we need to defend."
"For this, the EU needs to be given the resources to act, which means giving ourselves tools to steer the economy over and above those currently available to us under the Stability Pact, which are inadequate."
"This document is proof of the desire to create a system of redistribution that caters for society as a whole."
"Its positive proposals relate to migration policies."
"It rejects the 'indiscriminate cuts' that have been made in public investments in the name of the crisis."
"After that, however, an inverse logic is introduced in specific proposals."
"Raising the retirement age; sanctioning a Stability and Growth Pact as a solution to the crisis even though it is clearly one of the causes; congratulating the European Central Bank for rescuing the banking sector; and promoting a social economy based on a sustainable, competitive market - so many neoliberal dogmas are repeated throughout the text."
"The crisis will make no difference: Europe is blinded by its dogmatism and deaf to its citizens' demands."
"I am voting against this report."
"Despite the fact that the global economic and financial crisis is spilling over onto the sustainability of national budgets to a worrying degree, the report under consideration by this House contains passages that prevent me from voting in favour."
"First of all, paragraph 59 states that we can help end the crisis by raising employment levels and proposes the adoption of policies in favour of immigration from outside the EU, even leading to the award of citizenship."
"On the one hand, the text unduly confuses the economic issue with that of migration policy, while disregarding, in particular, the already high unemployment rate."
"On the other hand, I do not think that Europe should promote the award of citizenship."
"Furthermore, some of the proposed amendments seek the creation of a tax on financial transactions and a European rating agency."
"We certainly cannot achieve better financial market regulation by introducing a new tax."
"Lastly, with regard to the creation of a public rating agency, the amendment tabled does not hit the mark, since the best practical way to safeguard investors' trust is by guaranteeing the impartiality and independence of rating agencies, and not by subjecting them to political influence."
"in writing. - I deeply regret that the right wing has finally 'kidnapped' this report on public finances and has completely changed the main aim of it, making it a very neoliberal report."
"I applaud the decision of the rapporteur, Hoang Ngoc, to withdraw his name from it."
"in writing. - (FR) It is simply unacceptable that this report has been adopted by the majority Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament; that is why, in line with our rapporteur Mr Hoang Ngoc, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has voted against it."
"How can anyone want to make our fellow citizens pay for a crisis for which the banks and speculators are largely responsible?"
"The measures advocated by the PPE Group and the ALDE Group, namely the swift consolidation of public finances, cuts in public spending, particularly pensions and health care, and the unconditional implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, will have disastrous long-term consequences on our societies We are heading straight for disaster if we do not establish a tax on financial transactions, as Mr Hoang Ngoc has proposed, and if we do not launch viable recovery measures."
"Let us not bring the citizens of Europe to their knees."
"The main purpose of this report was to analyse the long-term sustainability of the European Union's public finances with a view to its economic recovery."
"The debate on this in plenary could not have come up at a more opportune time, given the unprecedented economic and financial understanding reached last week by European leaders."
"On the one hand, the package of measures adopted - specifically the unblocking of aid for Greece, the accelerated restructuring of Member States' public finances, and the creation of a financial stabilisation mechanism - demonstrate strong solidarity."
"However, they make a period of sacrifice foreseeable, which will affect all Europeans."
"These sacrifices must be distributed in a fair and balanced way."
"This is a time for brave decisions at national level, with a long-term view and without cutting any corners."
"The public books are balanced by cutting spending and by increasing income, or by both at the same time."
"At a time of economic recession, we have no alternative but to substantially decrease public spending by cutting waste and optimising the state's operations."
"Following several amendments, the final content of this motion for a resolution focuses on some of these challenges; that is why I voted for it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in 2009, Lithuania and some of our neighbouring EU Member States almost hit rock bottom."
"Maybe vultures are not circling above our heads, but we still do not feel safe: Lithuania's GDP fell by 4.1% from quarter to quarter and in the first quarter of 2010."
"Most Lithuanians understand that the need for painful victims and severe measures will not disappear overnight."
"The long-term sustainability of public finances is essential to achieve stability and growth."
"The solution is to reduce the budget deficit."
"In the report, it is accurately observed that high indebtedness and deficit levels are threatening sustainability and could have a disastrous impact on employment, public health care and pensions."
"The decision we have to make is not one to be taken lightly - the increasing government deficit is becoming a huge burden for future generations."
"Financial stability is important for the recovery of the Lithuanian and European economies."
"Therefore, I agree with the measures debated this week, for example, proposals on the European Systemic Risk Board and the European System of Financial Supervisors."
"Now more than ever, we need smooth coordination of markets and hedge funds and better supervision."
"We also have to continue to seriously implement our international commitments."
"Most importantly, it is essential to regain the public's trust and restore the economic self-esteem of each of our countries."
"We can achieve this by ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances, talking straight and being transparent in everything we do."
"The report on the contribution of the cohesion policy to the achievement of the Lisbon and Europe 2020 objectives is fundamental, in that it illustrates the extent to which this policy may be instrumental to the future of the Union."
"The Structural Funds, which guarantee the cohesion of European territories and finance innovation, help to bring about initiatives which, without any doubt, generate growth in the regions."
"I sincerely believe that the cohesion policy will be a vital instrument in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives, which is why I voted for this report."
"The difficulties that have always been highlighted by the political, social and economic diversity of Europe's heritage - as part of a large, but still disparate territory - have resulted, since the eighties, in the development of the cohesion policy."
"Cyclically, passing from one programming period to the next, Europe has been faced with the need to update its cohesion objectives."
"It has done so by revamping both the means, for which the Structural Funds have been, are, and will continue to be the essential financial basis of any EU policy which seeks to increase internal cohesion, and the ends, with which the various objectives and individual actions have constantly been reoriented in line with the requirements of the time."
"I am in favour of Mr Cortés Lastra's own-initiative report: the EU 2020 strategy must be included among the objectives of the cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013, supported by the objective of territorial cohesion and by the pragmatic approach of sharing the objectives at local level."
"Only in this way will we avoid the risk that the EU 2020 strategy will be reduced to one where the eurocracy blows its own trumpets, as was the case with the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Structural Funds play a vital role in delivering the EU 2020 strategy, insofar as they constitute a powerful instrument for the economic development of all of Europe's regions."
"Mr Cortes Lastra's report rightly points out that the Lisbon Strategy only achieved concrete results when it was linked to the cohesion policy."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur's recommendations on the improvements that need to be made to the governance system in the EU 2020 strategy compared to the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is vital to establish closer links between local and regional authorities and civil society stakeholders within the framework of multi-level governance."
"I would join the rapporteur in stressing the importance of a simplified approach to the use of Structural Funds in the future regulatory framework."
"After all, simplicity is one of the keys to efficiency."
"I am completely in favour of the proposals put forward in this report, seeking inclusion in the cohesion policy in order to pursue the objectives set out for the 2020 strategy."
"The new Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the principle of economic, social and territorial cohesion, and without this solidarity clause, the EU itself does not make sense!"
"The ultimate objective of the cohesion policy is reducing disparities between the levels of economic development of the various regions and tackling the structural backwardness of the most disadvantaged and outermost regions."
"In the approach to the 2020 strategy, which is engaged in promoting growth, competitiveness and employment, it is important to note that the cohesion policy can be an important instrument for successfully achieving the goals that the strategy sets out."
"The ultimate objective of the cohesion policy is reducing disparities between the levels of economic development of the various regions, targeting resources specifically for growth and employment."
"The 2020 strategy presents significant and ambitious challenges for Europe in five areas that are seen as strategic: (i) employment; (ii) innovation and research; (iii) climate change and energy; (iv) education, and (v) combating poverty."
"As I have said, this is an ambitious and daring strategy."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it must be conceived so that it is in harmony with future cohesion policy, and that the 2020 strategy must also be implemented at regional and local level, something that failed to happen with the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is crucial for economic development and growth in the different regions."
"As I come from a region of Portugal whose interests and wishes are often passed over in the interests of centralised power, as I have already publicly stated, I believe that implementing the 2020 strategy objectives at regional level may be of greater benefit to more balanced regional development."
"In the European development project, there is much progress to be made on territorial cohesion, which is crucial in combating poverty and social exclusion, promoting employment and sustainable development, and in social cohesion."
"I have no doubt that small and medium-sized enterprises have a crucial role in the success of building Europe."
"Therefore, I support the recommendations made in this report, such as the need to simplify the rules for accessing and managing the allocation of the available funds in order to encourage their use and effective implementation, covering the entire EU territory."
"The regions implement more than a third of public investments in the EU, and the spending of the structural funds is increasingly concentrated on objectives related to growth and employment."
"I believe that it is essential for the EU to take immediate steps and concrete measures to 'meet the special needs of regions characterised by natural or demographic handicaps of a serious and permanent nature, such as coastal regions, islands, mountain regions, cross-border and outermost regions'."
"I would also like to reiterate that 'education and training are the fundamental preconditions for the development of the EU and can make it more competitive in the face of global challenges'."
"The rapporteur finds it regrettable that the 2020 strategy has not duly incorporated an assessment of the Lisbon Strategy, and we share that opinion."
"The stated objectives of the Lisbon Strategy - economic growth, employment and social cohesion - have not been met; on the contrary, the situation in these areas has become worse."
"As we have been saying, this situation is a result of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, and what objectives they were too!"
"Very specifically: liberalisations, privatisations, and making employment laws less regulated and more flexible."
"These options, instruments and objectives have now been taken up again by the 2020 strategy."
"In the same vein, the rapporteur argues for the completion of the 'free, open and functional Internal Market'."
"Well, it has been this very 'free, open and functional Internal Market' that has led to the most poverty and social exclusion in the EU, and undermined its territorial cohesion."
"We do not, therefore, accept the alignment of the cohesion policy with the 2020 strategy, for the sake of its real objective: reducing disparities in the development levels of the various regions, and instituting true economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"The main objective of cohesion policy is to strive for a uniform degree of development across the regions of the EU."
"Thanks to the multiannual programmes and strategies which have been put in place as part of that policy, individual regions and, in particular, the poorest ones, have the opportunity for sustained economic growth, increased competitiveness and the creation of jobs."
"Over half of all investments in the public sector are being made at regional level, so local authorities are becoming the main participants in the realisation of the current Lisbon Strategy, and in the future of the EU 2020 strategy."
"We should give full support to the realisation of projects which come under cohesion policy, remembering that their greatest beneficiaries will most often be rural areas, and the author's promotion of the partnership approach makes it possible to inform the citizens efficiently about the objectives and results of projects which have been undertaken."
"It seems that we are providing funding for disadvantaged areas which then ends up being spent in relatively prosperous regions."
"There are problems with subsidy policy throughout the EU."
"On the one hand, money is invested in regenerating villages to prevent rural communities from dying out and, on the other, these efforts are counteracted by regulations on privatisation and deregulation."
"It is no use having a vibrant village centre if the village is almost cut off from the public transport network and the post office has been closed down."
"The report does not focus in enough detail on the problems of cohesion policy and, therefore, I have voted against it."
"This resolution is an important document as it sets out the best course for the association which is needed between the cohesion policy and the EU 2020 strategy."
"At a time when there is much thought about the European cohesion policy after 2013, it is indeed important to present it as an indispensable tool of compliance with the EU 2020 strategy, reiterating the statement that cohesion policies are essential for enforcing the original plan of EU integration."
"The cohesion policy has been important in creating a better balance between European regions, and is now seen as crucial for overcoming the current financial crisis that the EU is experiencing by strengthening competitiveness and local potential."
"At a time when the EU budget is not expected to increase and when there is pressure on the cohesion policy budget (approximately 45% of the EU budget), we believe that a good link between the objectives of the cohesion policy and those of the EU 2020 strategy are essential for strengthening cohesion and simultaneously contributing to a positive response from all regions and members of the public to the challenges facing the EU."
"in writing. - It is a pity our alternative resolution on cohesion policy and EU2020 was rejected."
"We, the Greens/EFA, have thus decided to abstain in the final vote on the Cortés Lastra resolution."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cortés Lastra, originally produced a very balanced report on the relationship between cohesion policy and the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Its aim was to correct the extensive earmarking of cohesion policy carried out by the first Barroso Commission."
"It justifiably asked the question as to whether cohesion policy is a tool of the Lisbon Strategy and the new Europe 2020 strategy or whether it has independent significance and an independent value."
"The rapporteur had achieved a balance between these two aspects."
"We should be grateful to him for having promoted the independence of cohesion policy."
"We supported his approach."
"Unfortunately, the amendments, which were largely tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), heavily diluted the original intention of the report."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance very much regret that."
"For this reason, we submitted the report once again to plenary as an alternative resolution, largely in its original form."
"Unfortunately, it did not receive a majority of the votes."
"This was not surprising, given the vote in the committee."
"However, our aim was to use this alternative resolution to make it clear that there was a minority view in Parliament which wanted to give the regions more rights to independent development than the earmarking model of the current structural fund period made possible."
"The cohesion policy is essential to realising the 2020 strategy's objectives: the promotion of education, training and research, the creation of jobs, and economic growth."
"Following the Lisbon Strategy's failures regarding the goal of cohesion, not least the lack of adequate consultation of the European Parliament and of participation by regional and local authorities, the report stresses the importance of the cohesion policy's contribution to future strategic objectives."
"It is, therefore, important to move towards a greater sense of ownership of the strategy's objectives amongst local and regional authorities and entities."
"The regions have a crucial role to play as the vehicle to reach economic and social actors, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Given its horizontal approach, only through a strong and properly financed cohesion policy can development be fostered in the European Union, and the Union made more competitive in the face of global challenges."
"The regional dimension of Europe must be strengthened with a strategy that takes into account the specificities of the various regions or groups thereof, such as the outermost regions."
"For the above reasons, I consider the cohesion policy an essential instrument for realising the objectives of the 2020 strategy, so I voted for the report."
"The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is a formidable project which requires strong political involvement on the part of the European Parliament."
"I voted in favour of this report, because it contains the following three ideas which are very important: 1) the new institutional structure needs to be effective quickly, in order to make the UfM operational; 2) adequate funding is vital if the UfM is to achieve its objectives and thus clarify the six major strategic projects (de-pollution of the Mediterranean, transport, renewable energies, education, SMEs, civil protection); 3) the success of the UfM depends on resolving regional conflicts in the Mediterranean basin."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is an ambitious project with a number of undoubtedly positive aspects, in particular, as regards the future possibility of strengthening, by means of this political and economic partnership, instruments to control immigration and combat the flows of illegal immigrants which have affected the Mediterranean in recent years."
"This is another reason why Europe can benefit from the prospect of a forum for dialogue with the Mediterranean countries, almost always transit countries for the majority of the illegal immigrants who reach the southern coasts of the continent."
"Of course, the channel for dialogue which will be opened must not be interpreted as an instrument to facilitate the flows, but one for regulation and for combating illegality; it will be down to economic trade, together with an overall pacification of the Middle East region - to which the UfM will have to endeavour to make an active contribution - to promote social and economic growth in the immigrants' countries of origin."
"Therefore, if the Union is built on solid political bases and has specific objectives, it will enable us to help, in their own countries, those people who today would wish to arrive en masse on southern European shores."
"In the hope that greater importance is placed on migration at the forthcoming summits of the Union for the Mediterranean, I am voting in favour."
"By voting in favour of the Peillon report, we have all acknowledged that the Mediterranean basin is an area of key importance, and that in a multipolar and interdependent world, large regional integrations, such as that of the Mediterranean, will be better positioned to cope with social, cultural, economic, environmental, demographic, political and security-related challenges."
"The Mediterranean encompasses at once all of these challenges, which are crucial for the stability of the entire region, and which call for concerted, determined action."
"At the forthcoming meeting in Barcelona, the Euro-Mediterranean Heads of State or Government will come together again to assess the progress made by the Union for the Mediterranean."
"In my opinion, three political points should be considered at that time:"
"a) the time taken to follow up on the creation of the institutional set-up, determined in Paris, and the failure to make the most of the parliamentary dimension offered by the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly;"
"b) the inadequacy of the financial resources and synergies employed; while recognising the progress and significant, tangible commitments made by some of our countries, including Italy, the overall impact of the Union for the Mediterranean with regard to creating an area of economic prosperity remains weak;"
"c) the difficulty in decisively tackling issues such as peace, stability and security, an essential requirement in order to provide the Union for the Mediterranean with a political dimension and unity of purpose."
"in writing. - We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean."
"This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa."
"It would also allow North African al-Qaeda operatives in these countries to more easily enter Europe and carry out terrorist attacks."
"We also note the way the EU grants Morocco privileged economic status, despite that country's violent occupation of Western Sahara and the plundering of its resources."
"In order to be an effective lever in building peace and prosperity and in promoting human rights, cooperation between European countries and other Mediterranean countries needs to be based on the principles of equality and mutually beneficial cooperation for the people in the area."
"It should help to resolve international and bilateral problems on the basis of the UN Founding Charter and international law, putting particular emphasis on the need for a fair and viable solution to Palestine, the Western Sahara and Cyprus."
"Unfortunately, no mention is made of these in the report, just as no mention is made of the unacceptable conditions under which thousands of people travelling with no travel papers are held on islands and in towns of the Mediterranean, affecting the human dignity of us all."
"In order for there to be real cooperation, the procedures for dialogue and understanding need to be strengthened and account needs to taken of the asymmetries in the area in all trade agreements, so as to safeguard equality between all the states."
"This sort of cooperation should strengthen and promote social and cultural exchanges and help to shape common policies and actions to protect the environment and combat climate change."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted against report on the Union for the Mediterranean."
"This is because we cannot support the EU contribution to projects as part of a Union for the Mediterranean being allocated significantly increased resources in the EU's new financial perspective for 2014-2020."
"It is very important that we have constructive cooperation with the countries around the Mediterranean based on the principles of equality of treatment, solidarity, dialogue and respect for each country's dissimilarities and distinctive features."
"Regional cooperation with the EU in the Union for the Mediterranean must not, as some powers would like to see, become a substitute for integration into the EU and membership of the European Union."
"In addition, it is crucial for the EU to take responsibility and maintain its credibility, meaning that it must not promise money for various purposes without sustainable funding."
"Following the Paris Declaration on 13 July 2008, which created a new Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), the previous Barcelona Process should have acknowledged a new impetus, as expressed in the Declaration: 'a renewal of efforts to transform the Mediterranean region into a space of peace, democracy, cooperation and prosperity'."
"However, for the European Union, 2009 was a year of major changes (there were European elections for the President of the Commission, the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force, the struggle against the economic and financial crisis, etc.) which have delayed the implementation of the UfM."
"I believe that this report correctly identifies the next steps towards achieving the objectives that were outlined when the UfM was created."
"I also look forward to the results of the second summit of Heads of State or Government, scheduled for 7 June in Barcelona this year."
"The strengthening of the Union's Mediterranean relations is essential, and I believe that only political dialogue and increased cooperation between the Union and the other Mediterranean countries will stimulate the creation of a space of freedom, justice, peace and sustainable and lasting prosperity."
"in writing. - I supported this report on the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM)."
"Europe and the Mediterranean share many cross-border challenges which can be better addressed through a regional integration process, with effective institutions which can surmount the limits of bilateral cooperation."
"Such challenges are all the more acute in a context of crisis, and it is in the EU's interest to address the growing disparities between both regions, thereby contributing to a viable and secure future for the people of the Mediterranean."
"The EU and the governments within the UfM must prioritise the setting up of its institutions and infuse them with a coherent political strategy which keeps at its core the promotion of democracy and the advancement of human rights, including social rights."
"If these goals are to be meaningfully furthered, peace agreements between neighbours in the Middle East have to be reached."
"This necessitates an end to Israel's siege of Gaza and settlement policy, combined Palestinian commitment to non-violence and its State building programme along with mutual respect for the 1967 borders."
"I will continue to oppose the upgrading of the EU-Israel association agreement until Israel comes into compliance with its human rights obligations."
"I voted for the report on the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) because it advocates greater involvement of the European Parliament in this regional initiative."
"If the summit that is to take place in June in Barcelona is to be a success after two difficult years trying to get it off the ground, it is essential that the European Parliament be able to contribute because the result is of enormous importance to the success of the UfM."
"Any impartial observer would say that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership has not been making as much progress as would be desirable, and that there is still much to do before it really takes shape and acquires real and productive content."
"Historically, the Mediterranean Sea united rather than divided."
"The cultures that emerged on its shores constituted the nucleus of what was Western civilisation, and both sides contributed to forging identities with clear affinities."
"Religious wars replaced the bridge that had been there with a chasm, but in a way, that bridge is still there."
"I hope that the European Union, alongside its partners, will take real steps towards promoting and structuring a Euro-Mediterranean partnership capable of conquering fear, differences and mistrust, and surviving into the future without collapsing."
"Both sides of a sea that was once a powerful civilisation's lake have everything to gain from this development."
"Given the precarious social and economic situation in southern countries, the deepening of relations with the countries of the Mediterranean is now all the more important."
"In this regard, I believe that there is an urgent need to move forward in a concrete and effective way with consolidating the Union for the Mediterranean."
"The strengthening of Euro-Mediterranean relations is becoming more pressing due to the impact that it will certainly have on consolidating a space of peace and cultural, economic, political and social development."
"I would like to emphasise, however, the concerns arising from situations relating to women's rights, gender equality and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation: areas where the strengthening of European influence may be a factor for positive change."
"On the other hand, the enormous potential of renewable energy resources in the Mediterranean region is an example of the gains that the European Union could enjoy and make use of in order to achieve efficient energy policies, besides broadening the EU's trade area to 800 million people."
"We completely disagree with the guidelines established in this report, which essentially aim to increase the economic domination of the EU's big companies over the southern part of the Mediterranean; access to, and control of, natural resources, energy in particular; the exploitation of labour power; and the repression of immigrants."
"It is noticeable that the majority in Parliament seem to live in an ivory tower, totally unaware of the consequences of so-called 'free trade'; they persist with these policies and so contribute to making the situation worse."
"For example, in Portugal, more than 100 000 jobs are being lost in the textile sector because thousands of companies are going bust, which is, in turn, because of increased external competition."
"That is why a break with this path of progressively liberalising international trade is needed."
"This path has meant that the rights won by the workers and the sovereignty of the people have come under attack, natural resources and biodiversity have been appropriated by the big multinationals, the environment has been destroyed, unemployment has increased, millions of small farmers have been ruined, and food sovereignty and security have been put at risk."
"We demand the establishment of equitable and fair economic relations that are at the service of the people and the countries in both regions."
"I supported the report drafted by my French socialist colleague, Vincent Peillon, because the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) aims to promote the process of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation through specific strategic measures both for Europe as a whole and also for the Mediterranean zone."
"In fact, regional integration is necessary for the promotion of peace, which is one of the main issues at stake in this cooperation, and it therefore needed to be strengthened."
"I think that the UfM is an excellent instrument for intervening with a very firm hand in the conflicts which persist in this zone and even for providing solutions to them."
"I hope that the next summit in Barcelona is a success, that the Member States really do re-launch the UfM and that, once the secretariat has been set up in Barcelona, a whole series of projects can take shape, in everyone's interests."
"This report certainly has the virtue of stressing the urgency of recognising two states, the Palestinian State and the State of Israel, living in peace and security, and of fighting for women's rights and against discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"However, its virtue ends there."
"This text is essentially a pledge to current and potential private investors in the region, as evidenced by the numerous injunctions regarding the necessary protection and financial security of investments."
"This text also endorses the Barcelona Process and the creation of a Europe-Mediterranean Free Trade Area that goes entirely against the regulatory objectives that the situation demands."
"I am voting against this report."
"I believe that the interests of European and Mediterranean citizens should always take precedence over those of the financiers."
"The role of elected representatives is to strive for the common good."
"It is unfortunate that those who drafted this text did not make that their priority."
"in writing. - (DE) The Union for the Mediterranean is seen by some people in Europe as a prestige project initiated by a few political leaders."
"However, I believe that the increase in cooperation between the countries on the shores of the Mediterranean is very much a positive thing."
"Particularly with regard to the increasing influx of migrants from Africa, it is essential for these states to coordinate the measures which they are taking in response."
"The structures of the Union for the Mediterranean provide the ideal means of supporting the work done by Frontex and, in particular, of involving the African states in projects so that economic migrants can be encouraged to remain in Africa."
"The various projects that are planned, such as an increase in the exchange of students and the numerous economic programmes, which are intended to promote trade between the EU and the African states, are also very positive."
"However, these countries must not be pressurised into agreeing to a free trade zone, because this involves a serious risk of causing major damage to local and regional markets."
"Although I do not fully agree with some of the points made for the reasons mentioned, the report is balanced and this is why I have voted in favour of it."
"With a view to the constructive development of relations between the European Union and third countries, I endorsed the report on the Union for the Mediterranean."
"In order to strengthen cooperation, we need to support the Barcelona Process, which has been less active recently."
"However, the Union for the Mediterranean Summit of states planned for 7 June 2010 in Barcelona is the perfect opportunity to put current declarations into effect, for the European Union cannot allow itself to lose significance in the region, with which it has traditional ties."
"Institutional structures, such as co-presidency, should be used to intensify measures for greater integration of the societies and economies of both sides of the Mediterranean Sea."
"The Heads of State or Government on both sides of the Mediterranean will meet in Barcelona on 7 June 2010."
"It is vital that this meeting leads to real progress - I am referring in particular to the establishment of institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, but also to progress in the areas of economy and commerce, employment, the reduction of poverty, agricultural issues, food security, water and rural development."
"It is also essential that greater resources be devoted to the Union for the Mediterranean, which will be the main issue in upcoming financial negotiations for 2014-2020."
"With that in mind, we should remember that it will have to be possible for EU aid to be combined with private funds and coordinated with those offered by the European Investment Bank and investment funds such as InfraMed."
"Moreover, the strengthening of South-South trade and the establishment of a Europe-Mediterranean Free Trade Area are essential for economic development and poverty reduction in countries on the southern shore."
"These measures are clearly mentioned in the resolution that has been submitted to Parliament, and I therefore support it."
"in writing. - There have not been any big surprises in the amendments tabled by GUE/NGL (all were rejected) except for the first part of Amendment 6 (Western Sahara)."
"I wish to make it clear that I voted in favour of Amendment 6, which stresses Morocco's responsibility in the situation of Human Rights violations in Western Sahara."
"The second part of Amendment 1 (which underlined the need to increase finances for the UfM) tabled by Brok, was also rejected."
"We voted in favour of the report as a whole (adopted by a large majority)."
"I voted for the Resolution on the 'Need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus'."
"The South Caucasus is strategically important to the European Union."
"At the same time, the European Union can and must help this troubled region to develop economically and commercially."
"We can use trade policy to promote respect for human rights, energy security, democracy and good governance."
"In my capacity as well, as my political group's virtual rapporteur for this resolution, I urge free trade agreements to be signed with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"I believe that these agreements will foster economic development in the region by boosting investment and creating new jobs, which will reduce the level of poverty."
"I completely agree with this report, as I believe that following the Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership Summit, the EU should strengthen its partnerships in the East, particularly with the three southern Caucasus countries, through a clear and well defined strategy."
"Maintaining peace, the stability of borders and the resolution of border disputes, progress towards democracy, the rule of law and the promotion of regional cooperation are essential for development in this region of the world."
"I therefore believe that the EU's action must be marked by encouragement for sustainable development, based on principles of good governance, absolute respect for human rights and policies of good neighbourliness, which should have peaceful coexistence between these countries and their neighbours as their prime objective."
"In this regard, I would like to highlight the important role that will come to be played by the EU Parliamentary Assembly - Eastern Neighbourhood countries."
"The geostrategic importance of the region, particularly with regard to the supply and transport of raw materials between the East and West, must be an important factor in establishing future agreements between the EU and these countries."
"The recent conflict between Russia and Georgia - a country which has been proclaiming that it wants to join the European Union and that it shares the EU's ideals - makes it clear that a strategy needs to be defined for the South Caucasus region."
"Historically wracked by bloody conflicts and squarely within Russia's sphere of influence, the South Caucasus has been taking tentative steps towards stabilisation."
"However, potential sources of conflict remain, and these must be handled with the greatest possible seriousness and care; the tense relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan is ample evidence of this."
"I hope that the European Union will expand on what it already knows about this region, and contribute to peace and progress between the peoples of the South Caucasus."
"I also hope that the EU will contribute to the adoption of and generalised respect for freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law in the region."
"The policy of enlargement and strengthening EU trade, political and cultural relations with third countries underscores the strategic importance of the Southern Caucasus countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"Considering the geostrategic location of these countries, bordered by the powerful Russia, Turkey, and Iran, the European Union can and should adopt an influential approach and a collaborative role which can further peace and security in this region."
"This will be crucial for ensuring the best economic development conditions, both cultural and social, along with the democratisation of this region, which will also encompass the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea."
"The process of deepening relations aimed at integrating these countries into the European Union will certainly help to improve levels of justice, freedom and human progress."
"I also endorse the importance of an energy market development strategy for the EU, as advocated in this report."
"This report on the EU's strategy for the Caucasus is just another part of the process of spreading a narrow viewpoint to disguise its economic and geopolitical interests in the region."
"This viewpoint is very focused on the 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia, and on issues of territory and Russia's sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"As the rapporteur himself states, what is at stake is that the three countries of the Caucasus are essential for the 'transit of energy resources' and the 'EU's energy supply' - on which the Union depends greatly - and 'free trade' agreements to make the 'economy more attractive to foreign investors'."
"It is in the light of these interests that the implicit support for the re-launched arms race and military build-up in the region should be understood; the EU is taking part in this process by getting involved in the sabre rattling between the USA, NATO and Russia."
"The majority in Parliament is involved in this hypocrisy: Parliament has set itself up as the knight in shining armour that defends states' territorial integrity now that it is about Georgia, but promoted, aided and continues to aid the process of Kosovo's secession from Serbia."
"The South Caucasus is a very interesting area which has been a constant topic of discussion in Europe for two hundred years now."
"There has been a conflict of interests in these places between Russia, Iran and Turkey throughout this period."
"The rugged contours of the landscape and the rich history provide a hint of the enormous ethnic and religious complexities."
"Now the EU has also discovered this region."
"It is truly wonderful how Mrs Tagliavini has obtained a perfect knowledge of the entire area, including the historical and present-day contexts, on the basis of the negotiations in Georgia."
"In fact, I bow down deeply before her."
"It is excellent that the authors of a report on the need to develop a new EU strategy for the South Caucasus have taken notice of an organisation such as the OSCE."
"It is a pity that they apparently failed to spot the relationships between the states in the area and Iran, and also the specific intentions of Turkey in the region."
"The authors have clearly forgotten the 'glorious' declaration of the independent state of Kosovo, and their unconcealed attacks on Russia and repudiation of local elections in Abkhazia and South Ossetia include the formulation 'de facto organs of the occupied territories'."
"This strongly reminds me of the findings of the mission of a certain Lord Runciman in the pre-war Czechoslovak Republic."
"Despite this, I believe it will be possible in the near future for the Members concerned to improve their knowledge of this part of Europe and for the next session to be more balanced."
"For the aforementioned reasons, the GUE/NGL Group will abstain from the final vote on the resolution."
"Unfortunately, this report on the EU strategy is not balanced and I have already mentioned this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Although the committee took some of my amendments into consideration, I still believe that the report is going in the wrong direction."
"Instead of taking a neutral and balanced attitude to the issue of Georgia, it uses the wording of US foreign policy, which aims to weaken and isolate Russia."
"With regard to the relationship with Armenia and, in particular, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, the EU has changed its position."
"This is completely incomprehensible and should be condemned."
"The rapporteur has apparently never visited the region and, therefore, he could not form his own opinion of the situation."
"For these reasons, I have voted against the Kirilov report."
"I voted against Amendment 7 because it removed an essential part of the report's text where Parliament calls on Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and the inviolability of its borders which have been recognised internationally."
"It also condemns the Russian Federation's recognition of the independence of the Georgian separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as being contrary to international law."
"Firmly setting out this stance will help avoid establishing a similar precedent in future."
"in writing. - I am glad everything we wanted was adopted in the AFET Committee and the corrections tabled by the S&D, EPP and Greens were all adopted."
"The final vote, which was positive, has been very easy for us."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Council position at first reading: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Religious freedom in Pakistan"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on religious freedom in Pakistan."
"author. - Madam President, Pakistan's inability to develop a strong and enduring democracy has impacted - quite severely, in my view - on religious freedom in that country."
"Successive leaders have used Islam to justify repression of minorities and justify autocracy, particularly of a military nature, although recent government efforts to remedy this must be recognised."
"Pakistan's constitution, although nominally upholding religious freedom, still allows for laws such as the blasphemy laws, which are discriminatory towards non-Muslims, and the persecution of Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities is a common feature."
"The emphasis on religious identity that was the basis for the foundation of Pakistan, and its creation, sadly appears to foster a climate of intolerance and often even violence towards those outside the religious mainstream."
"The proliferation of Deobandi madrasahs, preaching messages of hatred against the West, has created an environment in which extremism and fundamentalism flourish and too many EU citizens - including from my own country, the UK - have gone through their clutches."
"The clearest manifestation of this is the Pakistani Taliban, a terrorist movement whose intentions were again made only too clear recently in the, mercifully failed, Times Square bomb plot in New York."
"I fear personally that nothing will change in Pakistan until that country develops an education and political system that truly supports the principles of religious freedom, tolerance and equality."
"author. - Madam President, my group, ALDE, welcomes the measures taken in the interests of religious minorities by the government of Pakistan since November 2008, and supports the efforts of the Federal Minister for Minorities in establishing a network of local inter-faith harmony committees to promote dialogue between religions."
"Nevertheless, much needs to be done along the road towards genuine religious freedom in Pakistan."
"Reports and surveys carried out by independent agencies reveal that minorities in Pakistan are deprived of basic civil liberties and equal opportunities in jobs, education and political representation."
"The legal provisions are dangerously vague and continue to be open to misuse, which affects people of all faiths in Pakistan."
"We know also that women in Pakistan face domestic abuse, including physical and psychological abuse."
"Much, therefore, remains to be done."
"Madam President, our resolution on Pakistan consistently raises concerns, which we see resulting especially from the laws on blasphemy."
"At the same time, however, we are keen to acknowledge the excellent developments that have taken place under the present government in Pakistan, and we encourage the country to continue with the democratic policy of reform that respects the rights of minorities."
"Shahbaz Bhatti, the first minister for minority affairs in Pakistan's history, has this past week been a guest of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"We greatly value his work and the reforms that the government has made."
"The list of improvements is impressive: a quota of 5% for minorities in public office, the recognition of minority festivals and places in the future senate, to mention just a few."
"The most inspiring project is the grassroots Interfaith Harmony committees, if they succeed in alleviating tensions between different groups in the country and thus prevent the recruitment of terrorists."
"It is a significant act of peace whose impact will radiate far and wide."
"This unarmed peacekeeping work is the best possible war against terrorism, because it gets to grips with its very causes."
"If success is achieved in this, it will be worthy of a peace prize."
"I would like to say to Mr Tannock that this is, at the same time, the very education system that he called for."
"As representatives of a community based on liberty, equality and tolerance, we are obliged to condemn discriminatory practices even if they occur far beyond the borders of the Union."
"The removal of representatives of religious minorities from the electoral register, as happened in 2007 in Pakistan, is certainly one such practice."
"Furthermore, pursuant to Article 260 of the Constitution of Pakistan, the country's citizens are divided into two categories: Muslims and non-Muslims."
"A recent requirement now means that a note about religious identity also has to be included in passports."
"A group which suffers particular discrimination in Pakistan is the Ahmadiyya community, which the Pakistani authorities do not even allow to take part in public assemblies or to engage in publishing."
"The law on the crime of blasphemy and the death penalty it carries also affect religious minorities in particular."
"The Council of the European Union should place this subject on the agenda for relations with Islamabad as a matter of urgency."
"After all, under the Cooperation Agreement signed six years ago between the European Union and Pakistan for the years 2007-2013, Pakistan is receiving EUR 200 million from the EU budget."
"Recent events in Pakistan have shown that the country is ready for profound changes to its system."
"I hope that just as in the case of the long-awaited revision of the constitution, which was at last carried out, it will soon also be possible to amend other legislation which clearly discriminates against Pakistan's minorities."
"Madam President, freedom of religion is not guaranteed in Pakistan."
"In 2009, an increase in violent attacks against religious minorities has been observed, and that includes murders."
"In addition, nearly 80% of people from minority groups live below the poverty line."
"However, this is not the only problem with regard to the violation of human rights in Pakistan: other issues include a restriction on freedom of assembly, threats against civil society organisations, the arrest of trade unionists, kidnappings and the murder of journalists."
"Since Pakistan declared its support for the war against terrorism waged by the United States, hundreds, if not thousands, of people suspected of having links with terrorist groups have been arbitrarily detained: arrests without warrant, detentions with no legal basis or access to a lawyer, detentions in unspecified locations, forced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture."
"In the only prison in Lahore, 4 651 prisoners were held in 2009, while the prison has a capacity of only 1 050 prisoners."
"Violence against women continues to increase: rapes, suicides, acid attacks and women being burned."
"I would need not two minutes or two hours but two whole days to describe the ordeal suffered by young girls and women in Pakistan."
"It is within this context that this House, which is concerned about respect for women, freedom of conscience and human rights, is preparing to use its new power of veto for the conclusion of a readmission agreement between the European Union and Pakistan, thus demanding additional guarantees on the conditions for the implementation of such an agreement on the readmission of Pakistani nationals and Afghans who have transited through Pakistan."
"author. - Madam President, as an international socialist, I strongly defend the right of each individual to freedom of religious belief and practice, on the basis that the fundamental rights of others are not transgressed."
"The people of Pakistan, and even more so the religious minorities, are, at the present time, caught between the institutional bigotry of the Pakistani state and, in some regions, the ultra-reactionary and obscurantive forces of the Taliban."
"There is, of course, a fundamental contradiction in right-wing groups in this European Parliament claiming to stand for freedom and human rights in Pakistan, while supporting the war in Afghanistan which is having a severe spill-over effect into Pakistan with very detrimental consequences."
"The slaughter of civilians in Afghanistan by NATO forces and by Western-supplied armaments in Pakistan, apart from being criminal in itself, can push some civilians into the arms of the reactionary groups."
"At the heart of the crisis in Pakistan are the feudal capitalist structures under which enormous levels of poverty flourish at the present time."
"Neither the corrupt elite in Pakistan, represented by the present government, nor the main opposition party, have any answers for the people."
"Independent organisations representing working people and the poor are critical."
"The Progressive Workers Federation is one such organisation whose half a million members are trying to rebuild strong social traditions to unite working people, cross national and religious lines, and unite men and women."
"This is the future direction that Pakistan needs to take."
"Madam President, we must take a critical but also a very objective and discerning approach to Pakistan, which is an important ally."
"Pakistan is an Islamic country and we must respect that."
"It was founded by the Muslims from British India because of their religious affiliation, in the same way that India was founded by Hindus."
"Both countries have had minorities from the beginning and both have developed a great tradition of tolerance."
"This respect for all religious minorities and, in particular, for Christians, must be reinforced."
"I believe that we can put the emphasis on this."
"Who will support the cause of Christians, if Europe, a continent which is almost completely Christian in nature, does not?"
"We are under a very special obligation but, at the same time, we must make it clear that we respect the leading and often constructive role which Pakistan has played and can continue to play in the Islamic world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, blasphemy laws in Pakistan, as various colleagues have pointed out, are easily abused by extremists as an excuse to use violence against religious or non-religious minorities."
"Of course, freedom of religion is important, but freedom from religion is also important."
"These blasphemy laws in a society in which freedom of expression is repressed in the name of religion pose another risk; last Wednesday, a court in Pakistan banned the social networking site Facebook in the country."
"The Pakistani Telecom authority instructed all Internet providers to block the website."
"The measure was taken to prevent people from learning about alleged insulting remarks on Islam or the prophet Mohammed."
"A cartoonist took the initiative to call on people to produce drawings of the Prophet to resist pressures such as that brought upon the popular series South Park, which led to edits in the programme."
"Facebook, as well as on-line services and platforms, are an important virtual passage to the rest of the world."
"It opens up sources of information and contact for Pakistanis and allows them to engage in an exchange of ideas; especially the young generation of Pakistanis can be enlightened through the Internet, as school materials often contain discriminatory and one-sided language."
"Criminalising free speech is not an effective way of allowing Pakistani society to deal with diversity."
"Cartoonists, journalists and citizens should be able to speak their minds freely even if that means insulting some people."
"Challenges to free speech are not exclusively found in Pakistan; in Europe, we face serious challenges to open debate as well."
"Threats to journalists, cartoonists and artists are becoming more common and they challenge our liberal, democratic societies."
"Self-censorship is becoming more common and politicians, cartoonists and journalists now need protection against death threats."
"Let us be inspired to stand for freedom of expression in the European Union, but also in Pakistan and the world over."
"It is the best remedy against extremism."
"The 2008 elections restored democracy and civilian government in Pakistan, although that democracy is not completely stable."
"A number of decisions made by the Pakistani authorities on questions of religious liberties are worthy of respect, but it would seem that further measures are now needed."
"Making it possible for people from religious minorities to take up work in the federal sector, recognition of their holidays and the establishment of a National Minorities Day are a step towards the stabilisation and democratisation of the country."
"It should, however, be pointed out that there are still no precisely defined rights which protect minorities, which can lead to bizarre situations like the handing down of a 25-year prison sentence to a Christian couple for touching the holy book of the Qur'an with unclean hands."
"Some religious communities are still being persecuted, and it is also disturbing to note the effective implementation of regulations based on Sharia law in rural areas, especially in the north of the country."
"We should continue to give financial support to the defenders of human rights in Pakistan and urge the Pakistani authorities to give their citizens full rights to religious freedom."
"Madam President, I agree with much of what has been said in connection with violations of human rights in Pakistan."
"I would particularly like to highlight the situation of the Ahmadiyya Muslims and the persecution to which they are subjected."
"This takes the form of habitual persecution, cold-blooded murder, discrimination and harassment at all levels of society."
"It continues to take place, despite the fact that improvements were promised by both the previous and the current governments."
"Such improvements have not been forthcoming, and the persecution continues."
"It is time for the international community and the EU to wake up and take action to put a stop to the violations of human rights that are continually taking place in Pakistan."
"When the state of Pakistan was established in 1947, its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, said these memorable words: 'We are starting with the fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one State.'"
"These are empty words these days, especially for the estimated 15 million Christians living in Pakistan."
"They are surrounded by a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and threat, both in the cities and in the countryside, and even in the capital, Islamabad."
"Sadly enough, the Pakistani legal system condones the precarious position of the country's indigenous Christians."
"This is the result of the historical process of creeping Islamification of Pakistani society since the late 1970s which has led to the alarming deterioration in the legal status of Pakistan's Christian community."
"In specific terms, we are talking about the testimonies and blasphemy laws of the 1980s, legal instruments which have effectively outlawed Christianity, as testimony given by a non-Muslim in a trial is worth only half as much as testimony given by a Muslim - and that is if the judge wishes to hear evidence from a Christian in the first place!"
"The blasphemy laws pose even more danger to Pakistani Christians."
"They prescribe life imprisonment for desecration of the Qur'an and the death sentence for derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Mohammed."
"In short, a Christian in Pakistan can suddenly end up on death row if any Muslim testifies against him!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that has created an almost unbearable atmosphere of fear and uncertainty."
"Hundreds of Pakistani Christians vegetate in prison for years without access to any legal process."
"I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to link any form of aid to the Pakistani Government to the urgent abolition of this pernicious discrimination against the country's religious minorities."
"Madam President, the constitution of Pakistan differentiates between Muslims and non-Muslims, thereby enabling discrimination on the basis of religion."
"In this context, it is important to recall that in December 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari reiterated the pledge of the PPP (Pakistan People's Party) to uphold the rights of minorities to be treated as equal citizens."
"Unfortunately, reports and surveys done by independent agencies reveal that minorities in Pakistan are deprived of basic civil liberties and equal opportunities in jobs, education and political representation."
"So, the overall picture concerning religious freedom in Pakistan, even without going into the details, is controversial and gives a lot of ground for concern."
"I would also like to stress the contradiction between the Pakistan Government's commitment to freedom of religion and its leading role in the organisation of Islamic countries in endorsing their 'Combating Defamation of Religion' agenda at the United Nations."
"In this context, I would like to recall the EU Council conclusion of 16 November 2009 on the relationship between international human rights law, which protects individuals and groups of individuals, and the concept of defamation of religion."
"Colleagues, I would like to remind you all that we are going to be short of time this afternoon, and everybody that goes over time detracts from the number of one-minute catch-the-eye interventions that we will be able to take."
"(PL) There is an American saying that there are no free lunches."
"Meanwhile, we should be saying that European Union aid cannot be given for free and that we cannot give EUR 200 million without wanting anything in return."
"Let us want something!"
"We should at least want respect, for example, for similar standards to those which are, for us, a kind of moral, ethical and political beacon."
"The situation in which for many years now in Pakistan, there has been persecution of people of creeds other than Islam - and most of them are Christians - is absolutely unacceptable."
"We often talk about the affairs of different minorities, not necessarily religious minorities, in Europe and the world."
"Let us now defend the Christian minority and other religious minorities in Pakistan although, of course, this is not the only problem facing a country troubled by serious political conflicts and which, unfortunately, faces the prospect of destabilisation."
"(HU) If we examine the Pakistani situation, we are faced with two incontrovertible facts."
"First, Pakistan is a key strategic player in the fight against terrorism."
"We must do everything possible to ensure that the safety of European citizens is not in danger."
"Secondly, Pakistan takes a different view of religious and ethnic minorities when compared to the view based on the values affirmed by Europe and by advanced liberal democracies."
"Europe cannot remain silent if other states grossly violate human rights and, therefore, we must express our concern even if one of our strategic partners is concerned."
"The European Union can take credible steps with regard to third countries only if it addresses satisfactorily the problems of religious and national minorities on its own territory."
"It must be clear throughout the world that one of the core values of the EU is the high level of protection given to human and minority rights, which the Union considers first of all to be binding on itself, or would say that it ought to regard these as binding on itself."
"Only then can we effectively demand that our partners make similar advances or steps on the path towards them."
"(PL) We welcome the fact that Pakistan is engaged in the fight against international terrorism, but this circumstance must not obscure other, very drastic facts, which show that in this country, drastic violations of the rights of religious minorities, especially Christians, are being committed."
"Every so often, indeed very often, information reaches us of further attacks, beatings, threats and even murders, including the burning alive of Christian people only because they are Christians, including women and children."
"This kind of information gives rise to a question."
"Why is this happening in a country which plays such a significant role in international relations and in the fight against terrorism?"
"Well, it is happening because, unfortunately, the authorities in Pakistan are, to a considerable degree, responsible for creating an atmosphere which encourages such things, by unsuitable legislation on blasphemy and by not reacting to inappropriate actions of the law enforcement agencies and the judicial system in Pakistan."
"We must expect fundamental change, including from the European Union and its institutions, in relation to such conduct."
"(DE) Madam President, around 75% to 80% of all those suffering religious persecution worldwide are Christians."
"We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world."
"For me, religious freedom is a central concept of our human rights policy."
"Therefore, I regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the European Parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of Christians."
"At the same time, I am pleased that we are jointly tabling a resolution today about the dreadful situation in Pakistan."
"Of the 156 million people in Pakistan, 95% are Muslims, around 3% Christians and around 2% Hindus."
"As a Christian, I would like to focus once again on the situation of the Pakistani Christians, who are subjected to severe persecution."
"Anyone who allows violent attacks on Christians to take place must receive a response from the civilised world."
"Therefore, the EU should introduce a criterion in its development policy and economic cooperation which covers this issue and allows sanctions to be applied if necessary."
"We now move to the catch-the-eye part of the debate."
"I have had far more requests than we can accommodate."
"We are only meant to have two minutes."
"I am going to take four speakers."
"(DE) Madam President, in the case of any country, it is important to consider its origins and whether the developments in the area of human and minority rights are moving in the right direction."
"As head of the European Union monitoring mission during the last elections two years ago, I made several recommendations and I am pleased to see that the country has begun implementing some of them."
"These include ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - this has not only been signed, but has evidently also now been ratified - and also the UN Convention against Torture."
"It is good that there is now a minister in place who is responsible ex officio for minority issues and who will gradually attempt to overcome discrimination."
"Among other questions, that of the Ahmadis has also been raised."
"One of my recommendations was that next time, they should be taken off their separate electoral register and incorporated into the main electoral register."
"I believe that this would be a specific measure which would help to bring an end to discrimination against this minority."
"(FI) Madam President, I would like to say that I, too, met the minister for minority affairs here this week."
"I was convinced that he was trying to establish mutual understanding among religious groups."
"He too, however, was unable to answer the question of why Pakistan, even though it is in the UN and is a member of the Human Rights Council, has, in its role in the organisation of Islamic countries, very strongly defended a new international code to combat blasphemy and the defamation of religion."
"This surely cannot be an ideal way to promote mutual understanding between religious groups."
"I would hope that the European Union will take firmer action internationally in this matter to prevent such new laws, which jeopardise the implementation of human rights, from entering into force."
"The United States of America has been a lot more active than the European Union in this matter."
"(PL) Madam President, the situation in Pakistan is developing dynamically and we are receiving conflicting information, and we have to observe the situation there very carefully, so as not to make a mistake."
"It is good that the government of Pakistan has adopted certain measures in the interests of religious minorities, such as guaranteeing minorities 5% of jobs in the public sector."
"It is good that the government of Pakistan has reserved, or has promised to reserve, seats in the Senate for minorities, including women representing minority groups."
"Nevertheless, something must be done."
"Both the government of Pakistan and the authorities in Pakistan must do something about the law against blasphemy, which carries the death penalty in Pakistan and is often used to justify censorship, criminalisation, persecution and, in some cases, the murder of members of political, racial and religious minorities."
"The authorities in Pakistan must do something about the Penal Code, which provides for the death penalty for all people guilty of and convicted for blasphemy."
"In a country which is receiving help from the European Union, and in the 21st century, killing people in this way must not be allowed. Thank you very much."
"(RO) After nearly nine years of military dictatorship, the elections held in Pakistan in 2008 heralded the start of a process of democratisation in this country."
"Unfortunately, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated a few weeks prior to the elections."
"The Pakistan People's Party, which she headed, won these elections."
"Although minorities in Pakistan face a number of problems, several positive measures have been initiated under the leadership of the current government."
"Intercultural dialogue has been promoted, a 5% quota has been set for minorities in the federal administration and some Muslim public holidays have been recognised."
"The Pakistani Government's commitment to give seats to minorities in the Senate is to be commended."
"I would finally like to emphasise the particularly important role played by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism and extremism."
"Madam President, honourable Members, the European Union has been closely following the situation regarding religious minorities in Pakistan."
"Pakistan's constitution recognises freedom of religion and provides that the State will protect the rights of minorities."
"Recently, Pakistan has made progress: this includes the adoption of constitutional amendments, strengthening the role of elected assemblies in Pakistan, and institutional developments in the area of human rights, in particular, the establishment of a Ministry of Human Rights and a Ministry of Minorities."
"In addition, an independent National Commission of Human Rights is being set up."
"Moreover, Pakistan ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."
"This is a step in the right direction, provided that these instruments are implemented effectively."
"Nevertheless, Pakistan should redouble its efforts to ensure better integration of religious minorities, including the Christian minority, within social, economic and political institutions."
"Pakistan's international reputation has been tarnished by incidents such as that which took place last year in Gojra, when seven Christians were burned alive when extremists attacked a church and people's homes, as well as attacks on Shi'ite Muslims and discrimination against Ahmadis."
"With regard to the rights of religious minorities, the EU has consistently used political dialogue with Pakistan in order to raise human rights issues, and has also taken diplomatic steps on a number of occasions."
"In addition to this, since 2007 the EU has maintained a dialogue on human rights within the framework of the Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan, which makes provision for a regular dialogue on governance and human rights."
"During these discussions, the EU has always insisted on respect for individual rights and minority rights."
"As part of that dialogue on human rights, the EU has also repeatedly raised the issue of the application of the blasphemy laws with the government of Pakistan."
"In absolute terms, it seems that most of the defendants are Muslims, but I am aware that the blasphemy laws have often been used against religious minorities, and that false accusations have been made as a way of settling personal scores or for reasons of financial greed."
"The last meeting of the Joint Committee took place on 25 March 2010, preceded the day before by the meeting of a subgroup on governance, human rights and migration."
"On that occasion, the issue of minorities in Pakistan was raised."
"At the same time, we did not hesitate to mention Pakistani concerns over the situation regarding religious minorities here at home, in Europe."
"The European Union also plans to raise these issues at the next meeting with Pakistan, on 4 June this year."
"Much of Pakistan's population has no access to education and is ignorant of the basic rules of social behaviour."
"Through the cooperation aid provided by the European Commission, priority has been given to improving access to basic education in the context of Pakistan's politics and education."
"I am hopeful that in the medium term, this will lead to a more tolerant attitude towards the concept of religious freedom."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Reportedly, Pakistan has the harshest blasphemy laws in the world."
"The exercise of the rights to free expression and religion can result in imprisonment and death."
"Section 295B and C of Pakistan's Penal Code criminalise derogatory remarks regarding the Koran and the Prophet, providing for punishments of life imprisonment, and death, respectively."
"Section 298 punishes the deliberate wounding of religious feelings, and sections 298A, B and C penalise derogatory remarks of holy figures and places, and outlaw the religious group of Ahmadis (who consider themselves Muslim)."
"Freedom of religion includes the freedom to believe in any religion and the freedom not to believe in any religion."
"Pakistan's minister for minority affairs announced yesterday that amendments are being prepared to stop the misuse of the blasphemy laws."
"I believe these laws should be repealed, as any modified text will only be a legacy of the past and allow for continued violence and discrimination."
"In recent years, the Pakistani Government has adopted a series of measures which clearly demonstrate a certain sensitivity to the situation of national minorities."
"These include the appointment of Shahbaz Bhatti as federal minister for minorities, a 5% quota for public sector workers and the commitment to representation for religious minorities in the Senate, to name but a few."
"These efforts must be encouraged."
"However, many more steps need to be taken to improve the situation of religious minorities."
"I believe that one key element in this is to review the provisions on offences committed against religions, known as the Blasphemy Law."
"The possibility of abusing the provisions of this law has created a climate of intolerance which has encouraged religious violence, discrimination, intimidation and persecution of religious minorities."
"Apart from the legal aspect, it is important for the government to adopt decisive measures to prevent violence."
"The promotion of tolerance is the key to protecting religious minorities in Pakistan."
"European civilisation as we know it today would not be possible without religious freedom."
"The search for something which goes beyond the individual must go hand in hand with toleration."
"The path to God - and also the path from God - is different and unique for each individual."
"If nothing else, we have learned this during the two thousand years of Christianity in Europe."
"This experience has been long and painful, purchased with the lives of millions of innocent people."
"We Europeans therefore have the right to tell others not to take that path."
"Therefore, we will always, and in every country, condemn the perpetration of violence and the murder of innocent people, especially now, when it involves our ally and friend."
"2."
"Situation in Thailand"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Thailand."
"author. - Madam President, Thailand is going through a violent crisis with the red-shirt demonstrators on the one hand, and the army and the yellow-shirts on the other."
"Around 80 people have already lost their lives and nearly 2 000 have been injured."
"Democracy is threatened and the country finds itself in a government-declared state of emergency."
"The state of emergency has resulted in censorship."
"Media sources such as TV, radio and Internet have been blocked."
"Halting violence is very important, and we encourage all parties to use self-restraint in the process of doing so, but in seeking to restore the calm, the state of emergency should not be abused to restrict fundamental rights and individual freedoms."
"Censorship needs to end and freedom of the media and expression need to be restored."
"These values are important for the European Parliament in their valuable relationship with Thailand."
"As we have all observed, because it has been the main topic of news, since early April, Thailand has experienced an atmosphere of political violence that it had not seen in the last decade."
"I would first of all like to express my solidarity with the families of the victims of the violence on the streets."
"I think that we have here what I would describe as a conventional confrontation between the freedom of expression and association, on the one hand, and the need for the government to maintain public order, on the other."
"The train of events has passed very quickly over recent days and hours."
"Relative calm seems to have returned to Bangkok, although the capital was ablaze last night following intervention by government forces."
"Let us hope that a new spiral of violence can be avoided."
"However, to ensure this happens, we need moderation because democracy cannot prevail through violence."
"I think that the government will have to implement the roadmap which it presented on 3 May."
"I also believe that investigation of the recent events and punishment of the guilty are measures required to ensure reconciliation."
"Madam President, the 'red-shirt' demonstrations have been suppressed with bloodshed."
"I would just like to say the following, without wishing to add fuel to the fire, since a European Parliament urgency procedure requires us to appease a crisis and to seek solutions rather than further inflame people's anger."
"Firstly, any citizen can legitimately aspire to free and fair elections."
"That is an undeniable right, and one that should be granted to all Thai people."
"This option was proposed at one point by Prime Minister Vejjajiva, then rejected by the 'red-shirts'."
"We must now return to it."
"Secondly, I condemn the use of live gunfire on protestors and the brutal repression of recent days which, according to official sources, has claimed at least 12 victims, including an Italian journalist, and left many people injured."
"It is time to stop the violence that has become widespread across the whole country."
"In doing so, I do not advocate taking one side or another, but I call on the Thai Government to prioritise a negotiated solution, to ensure that the declared state of emergency does not limit individual freedoms or freedom of expression, which would only exacerbate tensions, and I call on him in particular to consider a return to the polls."
"The current turmoil runs the risk of dividing the country."
"In the north-east, which is a rural area with a Laotian culture, there would be almost insurgent opposition against the central area, Bangkok and the south, which are all Democratic strongholds."
"This could lead to the emergence of quasi-terrorist movements, attacking what can be called the bureaucracy and elite that are the bastions of power."
"There absolutely must be a return to elections, negotiations, and an end to the violence, whilst maintaining freedoms."
"Of course, these are very simple words, and perhaps rather naive in relation to modern-day violence."
"This parliamentary resolution was deliberately chosen to avoid any explosion of violence in Thailand and to leave room for dialogue, but that does not mean that we can dispense with all calls for democracy."
"Madam President, the images of the anger, violence and destruction in Bangkok are still fresh in our minds."
"Although attention has now, to a certain extent, moved away from the highly charged situation in the Thai capital, the risk of further violent clashes is by no means over."
"The violent conflict between the so-called red shirts and the government, backed by the army, has already resulted in more than 70 people being killed and almost 2 000 injured."
"The government has announced that it will investigate these deaths and those which occurred in the last few days must also be included in this investigation."
"It is important to consider the fundamental causes of these recurring protests and clashes in order to find a viable political solution."
"Part of the Thai population is severely disadvantaged and socially excluded."
"These people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of rights."
"They are fighting against their comparatively low standard of living."
"Other factors include conspicuous and widespread corruption within the political leadership, but also among the people in positions of responsibility within civil society."
"These structural problems must be exposed and resolved, if a lasting solution is to be found, rather than just bringing an end to hostilities."
"We call on all the parties in the conflict to play a serious and constructive role in finding a solution to this major crisis."
"However, both sides must use only peaceful and democratic means to bring this about and, for this, they need the support of the EU."
"Madam President, for several weeks now, the 'red-shirts' popular movement has been demonstrating in Bangkok in order to demand respect for democracy."
"Let us remember that the current government, even though the President has only been in power since December 2008, is nevertheless the result of a military coup that occurred in September 2006."
"What were the 'red-shirts' demanding?"
"The Prime Minister's resignation, the dissolution of parliament, early elections - in short, democracy."
"On 4 May 2010, the Prime Minister announced a reconciliation plan based on those famous early elections, but the assassination, on 13 May, of General Khattiya, commander of the 'red-shirts', terminated negotiations."
"This is the context in which we have prepared the resolution before us today."
"Yesterday, the army intervened, killing several people including an Italian journalist."
"For us, it is essential that the resolution on which we are going to vote takes account of these events, particularly given that the main leaders of the 'red-shirt' movement immediately surrendered and urged the population to remain calm."
"In fact, it is the matter of the succession of the king that is being called into question."
"He has remained strangely silent."
"The message we must convey is that democracy cannot be imposed by force, and that it is not acceptable to quash demonstrations by sending in the army with orders to shoot on sight."
"The resolution does not even condemn the violence."
"We will not vote in favour of it."
"The Thai people have the right to democracy, and everything must be done to avoid another military coup."
"Thailand - a country which, until recently, was considered a bastion of democracy and stability in South-East Asia - has recently experienced its most dramatic events in almost half a century."
"Fighting continues in the conflict between supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, known as the 'red-shirts', and the government and the army."
"Over 60 people have been killed, including foreign nationals and, among them, citizens of EU countries, nearly 2 000 people have been injured, and the capital, Bangkok, has sustained a significant degree of damage."
"Of course, the victims' families deserve our expressions of sympathy, condolences and solidarity, but we must also be aware that the Thai nation is, today, very divided."
"Human rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are significantly restricted, and the conflict will be very difficult to solve by peaceful and political means."
"Therefore, pressure is needed - international pressure, including from the European Union - on both sides of the conflict so that they will resume talks and try to resolve their dispute by political means, and not through violence."
"Madam President, in the street fighting which has come to resemble a civil war, 75 people have been killed and more than 1 800 injured since last week alone."
"Following heavy military intervention, the leaders of the demonstrators have surrendered."
"However, the situation in Bangkok is continuing to escalate."
"I have received phone calls about it both yesterday and today."
"Until now, some areas of the capital were not affected by the conflict, but that has changed."
"The situation in the north-east is also chaotic."
"The dramatic images convey one clear message."
"Regardless of whether people are wearing red, black, yellow or green shirts, they must stop the violence and not allow the situation to escalate any further."
"The position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is clear."
"There is no alternative to objective discussions."
"All the incidents must be investigated by an independent commission."
"We very much welcome the plan to bring the parliamentary elections forward."
"Mr Tajani, the EU must take an active role and act as mediator."
"We have the diplomatic means to break the spiral of violence and start the process of constructive dialogue."
"Mr Tajani, we must act, because Thailand is being shaken to its foundations."
"I, too, wish to express my solidarity with the Thai families grieving in the wake of the violent clashes in Bangkok."
"The situation is all the more alarming as there are no real prospects of resolving the internal conflict."
"Reprisals on the streets of the Thai capital, which have caused tens of deaths and hundreds of injured, cannot be accepted in any way as a means of resolving existing problems."
"The brutal use of force and introduction of censorship, which bans television channels from broadcasting anything other than programmes approved by the government, are violations of basic human rights."
"In fact, it is the duty of the European Union and the whole civilised world to condemn the use of armed force against civilians and to request the release of those arrested illegally, as well as the most impartial investigation possible into the deaths which have occurred."
"If anything, the losses of human life are only serving to harden the opposition's intransigence and fuel the violence which has also spread to the north-east of the country."
"There is the risk of these street clashes degenerating into civil war."
"I believe that international organisations, primarily the UN, have to intervene as soon as possible to prevent an even more serious deterioration in the situation and to mediate the start of a necessary dialogue between the authorities and the opposition, as the only democratic option for resolving the current crisis peacefully."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, I condemn the brutal repression by the Thai Government and State against the protestors in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand."
"Despite propaganda that these were terrorists, in the main, they were, in fact, impoverished farmers from the north and around Bangkok, sections of the urban working class, and their families, who saw their protest as a struggle against the enormous poverty and hardship that they suffer."
"Unfortunately, these oppressed people look to the billionaire and former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, for a solution."
"Despite some populist measures against poverty when he was in government, Mr Thaksin represents the capitalist elite and deceives the masses."
"On the other side, there is the current Prime Minister Abhisit and his party, who represent other sections of the elite."
"I think the poor rural masses and the urban working class in Thailand urgently need their own independent organisation to fight for their rights, and I hope that the next mobilisation in Thailand might be a united struggle of workers, poor farmers, students and youth, dedicated to overthrowing all corrupt elites and bringing the major wealth of Thailand into public ownership and democratic control and, in a socialist Thailand, transforming the lives of its people and also fighting for the rights of all minorities."
"Madam President, I condemn the use of bullets against protestors in Thailand: thousands of people died; hundreds were injured."
"As reported by Amnesty International, eyewitness accounts and video recordings show clearly that the military is firing live rounds at unarmed people who pose no threat whatsoever to the soldiers or to others."
"Among the dead, there are medical doctors and children."
"Thai soldiers must stop firing; violence against protestors cannot lead, and will not lead, to a democratic solution."
"The government must be aware that crushing the protestors may clear the streets for now but will not solve the problem that brought the people onto the streets, and before anything else comes human life, so stop the firing."
"(SK) The demonstrations in Thailand have unfortunately been going on for several weeks now."
"The civilian population are suffering violence as the direct victims of bloody confrontations between armed anti-government demonstrators and the forces of the state."
"I would therefore like to express my sympathy with those who have lost family members."
"I consider it an absolute priority in this tense situation for both sides to denounce physical force and to prevent further losses of life."
"I also support the call for an immediate end to the ongoing violence and for the opening of constructive dialogue, with the aim of settling the conflict by peaceful and democratic means."
"At the same time, I call on the Thai Government not to resort to unwarranted and unjustified violations of human rights during the declared state of emergency."
"(SK) The political conflict in Thailand very quickly grew into serious civil unrest, which resulted in the deaths of many protestors following intervention by the forces of repression."
"If the state authorities use brute force and uncontrolled repression against the citizens of their own country, this deserves condemnation."
"Therefore, Madam President, Commissioner, the EU must use its political influence on the parties involved in the conflict and call for a peaceful solution to the political solution in such a way that Thai citizens do not pay the price for the political disputes between leaders of individual groups."
"The Thai Government in particular must take responsibility for providing a calm and peaceful solution to this conflict."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a ceasefire and an end to censorship: I believe this to be the two-pronged action which the Commission, with the greatest determination, but also with the greatest consistency, with those values considered inalienable by this Parliament, must endeavour to obtain."
"In a climate of civil war such as that prevailing in Thailand, a return to democracy through free elections - initially discussed, initially hoped for, but now in some doubt - requires a crucial step, namely, awareness of the international community's support for the Thai people and for the country's return to full democracy."
"To allow the international community to be involved in this phase, the crucial factor is information, and this is why the state of emergency must not be a form of veiled censorship."
"The Internet, newspapers and the media must be in a position to inform the international community of the dynamics in play in Thailand, so that the international community, with as much awareness of the facts as possible, can be supportive at this time of restoring democracy."
"Madam President, honourable Members, Thailand is going through a tragic phase in its political history."
"The country, known for its economic and social dynamism, is currently affected by a profound crisis which could threaten stability if a solution to the current conflict is not found."
"Indeed, this crisis strikes at the very heart of the country: much of the population seems to have lost confidence in the institutions that govern it."
"In turn, the government is struggling to implement the solutions that the current circumstances demand."
"Political fragility has resulted from this, leading to violent confrontations and acts of aggression which directly affect human rights and fundamental rights."
"There is persistent uncertainty over the future of the country."
"In such circumstances, the European Union deplores the fact that people have lost their lives, such as the Italian journalist Fabio Polenghi, who was killed yesterday morning during clashes between demonstrators and soldiers."
"No political or ideological crisis can justify this fact, nor the armed confrontation."
"On two occasions already, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has reminded the warring parties to show restraint."
"Even a state of emergency cannot be allowed to result in excessive measures when it comes to fundamental rights and the right to freedom of expression."
"These rights are threatened by the disproportionate use of force."
"To prevent the situation deteriorating any further, it is crucial that negotiations should resume."
"The Commission has taken note of the roadmap put forward by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva."
"Thailand will not emerge from the current crisis unless it deals with its major structural problems."
"It is essential that the legitimate claims of disadvantaged social groups are recognised by all parties involved in governing the country."
"This is an indispensable step towards national reconciliation."
"It is therefore imperative for Thailand to find a consensus with all parties on how to move towards a more incisive society."
"As a partner to Thailand, the European Union is ready to support the country, as far as it is able, during this complex process."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Thailand is going through a very serious period in its history."
"The 'Land of Smiles' has become one of tears, blood and, maybe tomorrow, one of a civil war between government forces and the so-called 'red-shirts'."
"How did things reach the point where a demonstration calling for democratic elections ended with dozens of dead and thousands injured, the political assassination of an opposition leader, scenes of urban guerrilla warfare, the beginning of insurgency in several provinces and the establishment of a state of emergency and curfews?"
"The King is a highly respected figure in the country, but does not seem able to reduce tensions."
"Continued uncertainties over his succession suggest that this instability will persist."
"The violence must stop."
"The current government certainly came about through elections, but elections that were held following a coup and the dissolution of the opposition parties."
"This injustice must stop."
"The solution lies only in the swift organisation of general elections and the prior restoration of the political freedom of all parties involved, so as to ensure the elections are democratic."
"The EU should use its good economic and political relations with Thailand in order to bring about this solution."
"3."
"Burma"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Burma."
"author. - Madam President, with this resolution, the European Parliament calls on the Burmese Government to put an end to human rights violations and to start genuine dialogue with the opposition and ethnic representatives of Burma, as well as with the international community, and to take concrete steps towards a peaceful transition to a democratic system of government."
"Burma is going to hold an election this year for the first time in 30 years."
"Unfortunately, the election laws published do not provide for fair and free elections."
"The opposition is not involved in the process and many of the opposition leaders are still under house arrest."
"Many political activists are in prison, and the opposition party has decided to boycott the elections completely."
"The last thing I want to say is that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Burma has condemned the gross and systematic human rights abuses."
"I hope Parliament will do the same."
"The situation in Burma forces us to turn our attention to this country repeatedly."
"Today, we condemn the intention to conduct elections under completely undemocratic conditions and on principles which have excluded the main opposition party and deprived hundreds of thousands of Burmese of the right to vote and to be candidates."
"This is an obvious attempt to keep the opposition out of the elections."
"In such conditions, even the very expression 'elections' does not correspond to reality."
"We also condemn the fact that under the new constitution, the army will be guaranteed at least 25% of the seats in parliament and will have the authority to suspend civil liberties and the legislature at any time it deems this necessary in the interests of national security."
"We condemn the continued and systematic violation of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic rights of the people of Burma, but we also appeal to the governments of other countries - of China, India and Russia - to do what they can by putting economic and political pressure on the Burmese authorities to bring about change there."
"Madam President, the starting point for this resolution is the almost mezza voce dissolution of the party led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who is a recipient of the Sakharov Prize and has been under house arrest for years."
"By dissolving her party, the National League for Democracy, winner of the last elections, the military junta is trying to eliminate a whole section of the opposition before the elections this coming October."
"However, to put the icing on the cake of what will be not so much a democratic ballot as a complete electoral farce, political prisoners and monks have now also been excluded from the ballot."
"The junta continues its abuses of power, large multinational companies continue to benefit from their contracts with that junta, and the Commission has reduced aid for refugees who have fled to the border with Thailand."
"Unfortunately, we have a series of examples of countries and regions where the international community is powerless to restore democracy and the rule of law."
"Burma is one of them, with its stream of resistance fighters and martyrs, of which Aung San Suu Kyi is the most famous icon."
"Is it too much to ask the European Union, I might almost say out of decency, not to cut its aid for the refugees on the border of Thailand and Burma, and to begin immediately to finance cross-border aid, particularly medical assistance?"
"Is it not a matter of urgency that High Representative Ashton and the Member States should support the recommendations of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Burma, namely, that a committee be established to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity, which could be included in a United Nations General Assembly resolution this year?"
"Let us make Burma a textbook case, one that shows our ability to promote democracy without the use of bombs and tanks."
"Madam President, in 1990, the Burmese human rights activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded the Sakharov prize by the European Parliament."
"In the years before and after this date, the critical human rights situation in Burma was the subject of numerous parliamentary resolutions."
"Similarly, other international human rights organisations have been involved with the situation there."
"Although improvements have been made in individual cases, the human rights situation in Burma remains extremely poor."
"Against the background of a very good and comprehensive report, the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma has now called for an international investigation commission to be established which will have the mandate to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"The High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, should take up and support this call, for example, in the next General Assembly of the United Nations."
"Elections are due to take place in Burma at the end of 2010 and the government has now implemented measures which deny many citizens the right to vote and stand for election."
"This applies, in particular, to political prisoners and Buddhist monks, who make up a total of 400 000 people."
"We are protesting against this and calling on the High Representative to express this criticism clearly in her bilateral and multilateral talks."
"Finally, in the light of the complex human rights problems in Burma, it is incomprehensible that the European Union has cut its financial support for refugees on the Thai-Burmese border."
"That is not acceptable and we are calling on the Commission to reverse these cuts and to begin providing cross-border aid for Burmese refugees once again."
"Madam President, this is the second time since the start of the year that we have discussed the situation in Burma."
"The concerns we expressed on 10 March this year, with regard to the so-called electoral process initiated by the Burmese junta, have merely been confirmed."
"The conditions imposed by the electoral law have led to the National League for Democracy refusing to participate in the process."
"It must be noted that these electoral laws forbid prisoners to vote and therefore exclude hundreds of political prisoners."
"Since then, the National League for Democracy has been banned."
"We welcome the tone of this resolution calling for increased economic sanctions."
"We also regret the reduction in humanitarian aid for refugees."
"Personally, I would like us to go further and, as President Obama and the United States have done, for the European Union to ban any investment in euro in Burma."
"However, some major economic groups in Europe have powerful interests in that country."
"I am delighted that we have called for an international arms embargo, and I sincerely hope that the EU can play an active role in bringing about global consensus on the matter."
"Commissioner, I would like you to inform us of your position on this matter, either today or later on."
"author. - Madam President, what more can we say about Burma that has not already been said, including calling again for the release of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi who has become a global icon in the struggle for freedom?"
"This resolution, like many before it in this House, chronicles the brutal repression of the Burmese people led by a military junta they never elected and have fought very hard to get rid of for many years."
"The way in which this junta is now cynically trying to hold sham elections such as to ensure the opposition will be muzzled is entirely characteristic of these generals and the way in which they arrogantly disregard the opinions not only of the Burmese people - their own people - but of democratic leaders around the free world."
"Despite this resolution's focus on immediate events in Burma, I urge the Council and Commission also to give due consideration to how best to support Burma when it is finally free and democratic once again."
"Burma will need our help, not least to develop a strong civil society and a legal system which should focus on transitional justice for the many crimes committed by the junta."
"That may all seem a long way away, but if the brave people of Burma can learn anything from us in this Parliament in Europe, it is that the light of liberty can never be extinguished by tyranny and that the freedom that is their inalienable right will surely once again be theirs one day."
"The human rights situation in Burma is giving particular cause for concern."
"This country has been governed for several decades by a military dictatorship which has violently repressed opponents of the regime."
"The authorities have announced the organisation of elections during this year for the first time since 1990."
"However, they will be run based on an undemocratic framework."
"Hundreds of thousands of citizens will not have the right to vote or stand as candidates, and at least 25% of MPs will be from the military."
"The main opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and Sakharov Prize, will not take part in the elections."
"I urge the European Union, through the High Representative, and the international community to step up their efforts to establish democracy in Burma and secure the earliest possible release of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"She has been under house arrest since 2003 and is an important symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, in organising farcical elections and refusing a national dialogue involving all political and ethnic groups, the Junta shows that the 'pragmatic' engagement with it is not working at all."
"The international community must act against the oppressors of the Burmese people."
"The EU can do much more than just renewing sanctions on the regime."
"It should use all means to strengthen civil society and assist those who resist oppression in Burma."
"It must work to mobilise the UN, ASEAN and the USA to put pressure on China and India to end their support for the Burmese regime and to stop the arms trade going on, namely with North Korea."
"The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma concluded last March that 'human rights violations are the result of a state policy that involves authorities in the executive, military and judiciary at all levels' and that these human rights violations 'may entail categories of crimes against humanity or war crimes under the terms of the [Rome] Statute of the International Criminal Court'."
"His predecessor had already called for the UN Security Council to investigate crimes against humanity in Burma, as it did in Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur."
"What are EU Member States waiting for to ask the UN Security Council to refer the criminals in power in Burma to the International Criminal Court?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Burma will hold so-called elections this year."
"However, these cannot be free and fair if Buddhist monks are banned from voting and the opposition is not even involved."
"The National League for Democracy was disbanded by law this month and Aung San Suu Kyi, a political prisoner and recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, cannot run in the elections."
"Democracy and the rule of law are essential for economic growth and the European Parliament remains strongly committed to the people in Burma."
"Asian countries are encouraged to do the same and to use their economic leverage in the process."
"The Burmese people need our support as gross and systematic human rights abuses continue at the hands of the dictatorial state."
"These serious crimes need to be investigated, yet the government in Burma chooses self-isolation and refuses to allow the EU envoy for Burma to enter the country."
"Self-isolation impacts the population on many levels such as through news media that cannot operate freely in the country."
"Regrettably, the new constitution does not grant human rights, and we call on the Commission and the Council to support the UN recommendations in setting up a commission of inquiry into the human rights violations."
"In the meantime, restrictions on freedom of assembly, association and expression, including those on the Internet and mobile phones, need to end."
"Until then, restrictive measures provided for in the EU decision will have to be enforced."
"By banning the trade in arms and by funding refugee programmes, the EU continues to stand by the Burmese people and their human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I have just had some sad news."
"One hour ago, I was informed that a senior leader of the National League for Democracy, Takin Soe Myint, has passed away."
"That is very sad news which we have to add to that special joke that some call elections in Burma."
"I add my voice to those who clearly condemn these elections, especially the fact that they are depriving hundreds of thousands of Burmese access to their passive or active right to vote."
"This also includes the situation of Aung San Suu Kyi, who is in prison."
"This is something that we cannot remain silent on."
"Once again, we have to ask the Burmese regime to heed the appeals of the international community to allow all those prisoners of conscience to be released."
"This is important also in the sense that has been mentioned by Ana Gomes."
"I also understand that we have a strong responsibility in asking, urging and pushing India, Russia and China to stop selling weapons to the junta regime in Burma."
"There is also good news there."
"We have to welcome the European Union's support for the global arms embargo, and, once again, we have to urge the European Member States to have a clear coalition on a consensus for such a ban."
"It is also important to remember - and this has also been said - that we cannot now cut the funds for the refugees living on the frontier."
"We have to establish a clear policy of support for these people."
"I have been there many times."
"We have to say clearly that this is not the time to stop the help these people need, especially for medical assistance at the present time."
"(RO) Burma is not a democracy, even though it is going to organise elections, because, as we are aware, the authorities in this country show deep contempt for any democratic principle."
"This military dictatorship is completely unscrupulous and reserves, as has already been said, seats in parliament for the military and bans, in general, citizens with democratic convictions from participating in politics."
"There can be no question of an improvement in the political climate in this country unless Aung San Suu Kyi is released."
"Another leader of the National League for Democracy also said that he is unable to serve his country after spending 20 years in prison for his convictions, simply because the military in Burma ban people, who have served such sentences which the military have actually passed, from standing as candidates."
"I call for a national dialogue because this will be the only way to enable this country's society to be changed."
"(FI) Madam President, Burma is holding its first parliamentary elections for 20 years."
"It will hardly come as a surprise to anyone that the elections are already, at this stage, looking anything but free and democratic."
"The amendment to the constitution in 2008 guarantees that 25% of the seats in its parliament will be for the army."
"In addition, this year's legislative reforms would exclude tens of thousands of Burmese from the right to vote, including political prisoners and religious minorities."
"Buddhist monks have long been the target of a special kind of persecution."
"The international community needs to make an effort to do something."
"It is regrettable that the Commission has cut funding for refugee camps on the border between Thailand and Burma."
"Humanitarian aid is needed in abundance, and there must be international efforts made to get it there."
"It is also most important that Burma embarks on a dialogue between political and ethnic groups."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, honourable Members, the situation in Burma continues to concern us."
"As you are aware, the roadmap continues to be put into action, with preparations for the first elections held by the government in 20 years."
"Thirty-one political parties have come forward so far to stand for election."
"Civil society has been active."
"Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy withdrew from the elections following pressure from the government; it has therefore been dissolved."
"A new party, the National Front for Democracy, which may be eligible, consists partly of former leaders of the National League for Democracy, in other words, the former party of Aung San Suu Kyi;"
"It accepts the decision of ethnic groups as to whether or not they will vote."
"If they boycott the election, following a disagreement over the replacement of ethnic armies with border guards, it would take away the credibility that these elections need."
"This shows the degree to which the situation keeps changing, and I doubt that the European Union will be invited to observe the elections."
"We are also still very concerned about the human rights situation."
"The report by Mr Quintana, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, is very clear."
"Many political prisoners have still not been released, despite appeals from the international community."
"Fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are still not respected."
"Socio-economic conditions are difficult for most of the population, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic groups."
"How can we really help?"
"The European Union's statements are evidence of our critical view and our willingness to contribute to a solution."
"Our approach includes development aid; in fact, the EU is one of the most generous donors."
"Furthermore, the Millennium Development Goals and a continued dialogue with the government of Burma on sectoral policies are vitally important."
"In addition to the areas affected by the hurricane of 2008, our aid targets the most vulnerable regions of the country, as well as the refugee camps along the Thailand-Burma border."
"In answer to your questions, I can assure you that the Commission will continue to help uprooted communities in order to enable them to find decent living conditions."
"The conditions needed for them to make a return to their countries do not exist."
"We need to guard against the institutionalisation of the camps and, consequently, the extent of our aid will be determined by local needs."
"In addition, the Commission has been in contact with the Thai authorities."
"It should be remembered that there are also aid programmes focusing on education, agriculture and food security."
"In addition, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid programmes provide aid in the area of water and food security."
"There is also aid aimed at restoring socio-economic conditions in Burma."
"Each citizen receives about USD 2.4 on average, in comparison with USD 36 in Laos and USD 60 in Cambodia."
"In conclusion, I can confirm that we will redouble our efforts to promote our values."
"The people of Burma are entitled to receive aid and to know that the European Union will not lose interest in their future."
"(DE) Madam President, you are undoubtedly a competent vice-president and you are also highly influential."
"I very much welcome that fact."
"You have not given some Members the opportunity to take the floor as part of the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, not because you did not want to, but because we have such a tight schedule."
"The European Parliament is the voice of human rights and we are making do with just one hour."
"So many of us have something to say and want to put pressure on the Commission in order to achieve results."
"Are you personally in favour of holding the vote not at 16.00 or 16.30, but instead at 17.00 or 17.30, for example, so that we could have an extra hour and finally change this rule of procedure?"
"We need the opportunity to speak out."
"We must be able to exert pressure on the Commission, but preferably not under such strict time pressure."
"I know that it is not your responsibility, but I hope that you will intervene on our side so that we can finally change this rule of procedure."
"Mr Mann, I understand your frustration."
"I dislike not being able to give Members the floor on issues of such importance, but you are also correct in saying that it would require a change to our Rules of Procedure."
"The other thing I would say is that, during the debates, if all Members who spoke kept to their speaking time, then we would be able to take more people under catch-the-eye."
"That, I am afraid, is the problem, but your comments have been noted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law"

"Resolution: Religious freedom in Pakistan"
"Before the vote on paragraph 13:"
"(DE) Madam President, our fellow Members have negotiated very skilfully and have agreed on a very good resolution with the groups."
"However, paragraph 13 is confusing and muddled and does not actually mean anything."
"This is why we are proposing a new wording, which reads as follows: 'Is concerned about the possible misuse of the 'Combating Defamation of Religion' campaign at the UN, stressing the Council conclusions of 16 November 2009'."
"The content is the same, but the wording is tighter."
"We are asking you to vote in favour of this new wording."

"The organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (debate)"
"The first item on the agenda is the report by Mrs Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/15/EC on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities - C6-0354/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (HU) The proposal put forward is intended to amend Directive 2002/15/EC in connection with social protection."
"The Commission's proposal touches on three issues: the exemption of self-employed hauliers from the scope of the law, the provision of a more precise definition for night work and support for the application of the law."
"The directive itself and, hence, its amendment, are supplementary in nature and only apply to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, like other laws applicable to road transport activities."
"Therefore, it could not extend to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted against the amendment (30 to 19 votes)."
"Several misapprehensions arose while the law was being drafted."
"I would like to address a few of those which may have influenced MEPs."
"First of all, experts have reached the unanimous conclusion that if the Commission's proposal is rejected, resulting in the directive's scope being extended to also include self-employed hauliers, it will not improve road safety."
"Available statistical data and studies on accidents show that only 6% of accidents are caused by the fault of lorry drivers, and fatigue is cited as a reason in only 0.06% of cases."
"Also, driving time, which has a real effect on road safety, is regulated by a different act of law, Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, which also applies to self-employed hauliers."
"Loading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time, as the law does not apply, for instance, to journeys under 100 km."
"Secondly, trade unions fear that self-employed hauliers could even work up to 86 hours if they are not regulated."
"The regulation includes stringent rules on driving time."
"It is capped at 45 hours per week for any two consecutive weeks, not to exceed 56 hours in any single week."
"This is accurately recorded by digital tachographs and the regulation also includes detailed rules on rest periods."
"Therefore, the claim of a possible 86-hour working week is an assumption not supported by any statistical data, study or survey."
"Thirdly, the Commission's proposal would limit the scope of the directive to employees and false self-employed hauliers."
"So far, there has been no law regulating the working time of self-employed entrepreneurs."
"Working time restriction is an important means for the social protection of employees."
"However, in the case of self-employed hauliers, the employer and the employee are the same person, and protecting private transporters from themselves is an extreme measure."
"Fourthly, when the arguments run out, the real reason is revealed: social dumping."
"Do not be confused by the term, because self-employed hauliers and small enterprises can also be unpleasant competitors on the market, just like self-employed hauliers arriving from new Member States."
"My experience is, unfortunately, that the case of the phantom Polish plumber has returned to haunt us."
"I would like to move on to talk about a common labour market phenomenon that should not be dealt with, and indeed cannot be dealt with exclusively in the field of road transport."
"This is the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs, which is a real European problem with adverse effects on competition and the labour market."
"This is the issue that needs to be addressed, and this expectation was stated clearly in the proposed amendment."
"Proposed Amendment 30, tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group is based on the Commission's proposal and is supported by the Council, and I would like to thank the Council for their support."
"We will vote on the amendment section by section."
"I would like to add one more thing. As a compromise solution, we recommend allowing each Member State to extend the scope of the directive to self-employed hauliers, if they want to."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, today, this House is discussing an extremely difficult and sensitive subject."
"The question is whether or not entrepreneurs who are self-employed drivers should be covered by the directive on the working time of mobile workers."
"The inclusion of entrepreneurs would be a precedent and a clear deviation from the general Working Time Directive."
"This directive only regulates the working time of employed workers, not of entrepreneurs."
"Discussions about the inclusion of self-employed drivers have been going on for a long time."
"Firstly, consultations between social partners in the 1990s did not yield any result."
"Then, the legislator could not reach a conclusion after four years of discussion - between 1998 and 2002 - and therefore asked the Commission for a thorough impact study."
"The Commission has now carried out studies and made an impact assessment which clearly demonstrates that this directive is not the right tool to address transport policy issues such as road safety or competition conditions, but that enforcement in respect of the non self-employed is a real issue."
"This is also the sense of the Commission proposal."
"Firstly, I wish to express my deep respect for your rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, who has done an excellent job."
"I am very glad to see that the rapporteur shares the Commission's concern over the weak enforcement of the rules and the general problem of false self-employment, and I appreciate Mrs Bauer's constructive proposals."
"I believe that the rapporteur's proposed amendments have the potential to protect employees even better against possible exploitation by employers."
"Where Europe definitely needs action is in respect of so-called false self-employed drivers - that is, those drivers who are formally independent but, in practice, are employed by a single company which gives them orders and pays them."
"Both the Commission proposal and the amendments proposed by the rapporteur give a clear message to industry: the phenomenon of false self-employment will not be tolerated and the legislator will be vigilant in putting this rule into practice throughout Europe."
"As regards road safety, let me stress that working time must not be mistaken for driving time."
"The situation regarding the latter has radically changed since 1998."
"As you know, this House, together with the Council, adopted new driving time rules, introduced modern, reliable digital recording equipment and adopted a specific directive on enforcement."
"Today's debate is not on road safety."
"The statistics and the studies that the Commission has made available to Parliament give absolutely no indication that the inclusion of self-employed drivers would improve road safety."
"At a time when we hope to begin to recover from the economic crisis, it would not be a good move to impose an additional administrative and financial burden on small and fragile undertakings which have managed to survive the economic recession."
"Instead of imposing red tape on entrepreneurs, Europe needs a working time directive which will really ensure protection to those employed and dependent drivers who need that protection."
"(FR) Madam President, my point of order concerns the code of conduct adopted by this Parliament in terms of ordinary legislative procedure negotiations."
"I fail to understand how the Commissioner can speak of an agreement with Parliament when he has spoken with only one single member, a member who basically had no mandate from the appropriate committee to negotiate what you are calling a sound agreement."
"Commissioner, you are flouting the operating rules of this institution."
"That gives us the right to raise the issue of how the institution to which you belong operates."
"That was not a point of order."
"You are listed as a speaker later in the debate."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her report and for her excellent work in recent months."
"The fundamental issue is whether or not the working hours of self-employed workers in the transport sector should be regulated for the first time."
"The Commission says not, nearly all the Member States say not, and the majority of my group also says not."
"If we were to include self-employed drivers in the directive, it would only serve the interests of big business."
"We need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, however."
"We need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been tightened up."
"All drivers - whether self-employed or employees - must take a minimum of 11 hours rest over a 24-hour period."
"That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this."
"I was the European Parliament's rapporteur on tachographs at the time."
"I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for preventing the regulation being extended to vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. Digital EU control devices in all commercial vehicles would have resulted in time-consuming and expensive documentation obligations."
"We want to reduce bureaucracy, not increase it."
"I therefore recommend that this House support the compromise that the rapporteur has reached with other groups."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, the position of this group has been consistent throughout; my position as rapporteur has been consistent ever since 2002 when we first proposed the inclusion of self-employed and independent drivers."
"We remain convinced that that needs to be the case, and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission's proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow, just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March."
"We very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate."
"Rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the European Parliament's Employment Committee, she has actively worked to promote the view of the Commission and Council."
"The other institutions, as Mme Berès has said, have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear Employment Committee recommendation to the plenary: the rejection of the Commission's proposal."
"Madam President, a tired driver is a dangerous driver, irrespective of employment status; we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is."
"Once again this morning, the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time."
"It is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed, a 'false' self-employed, driver, to drive between 86 and 95 hours per week; perhaps not every week, but one week is enough of a danger in itself."
"If the Commissioner doubts that figure, he can come to see me any time he likes;"
"I have the figures from the people working in the sector."
"This is a fact."
"We must reject the Commission's proposal."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bauer for her hard work."
"The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include, or exclude, self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive."
"It is crucial to remember that all drivers, employed or self-employed, come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time, their break times and their rest periods."
"Therefore, road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive, and, if anybody believes that they are not, then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive."
"There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers."
"Therefore, we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers."
"Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that: it is scaremongering and is not based on any reliable data."
"This legislation, if it includes self-employed, will be virtually unenforceable."
"Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the job under way?"
"According to the legislation, working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station."
"This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking, together with its various subsidiary places of business."
"Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver's home be defined as his work station, and who will police and enforce the legislation?"
"Yes, there are issues relating to competition for self-employed, but this legislation will not deal with those matters."
"In fact, in my own country, we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system."
"Finally, if we reject the Commission proposal, we will end up with bad law."
"It is disproportionate and will not achieve its aims, and it will pile further red tape and bureaucracy on already struggling SMEs in most countries and particularly in my own country, Ireland."
"It is unenforceable, and that makes an ass of the law."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter we are discussing today relates to an absolutely fundamental question: do we in the European Parliament want to ensure that we have a social Europe with fair competition and decent working conditions?"
"Or will we allow the market and the laws of chance to reign in a transport industry that is coming more and more under pressure?"
"For us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here in Parliament, there is no doubt at all."
"We want self-employed drivers to be included in the Working Time Directive."
"Thus, we reject the Commission's proposal to exclude self-employed drivers, for the following three reasons. Firstly, self-employed drivers need to be covered by working time regulations so that we can ensure traffic safety in Europe."
"With a lorry weighing a tonne behind them, it is absolutely essential to put a limit on their working time to avoid tired drivers and accidents."
"Secondly, we want to ensure fair competition within the transport industry."
"In recent years, we have seen an enormous growth in the number of 'false' self-employed drivers."
"This has been the industry's solution to avoid the working time regulations."
"As legislators, we must not create incentives for there to be more self-employed drivers in Europe."
"Instead, we must ensure that there are uniform rules so that we create a level playing field."
"Thirdly, we want to ensure a good working environment for everyone."
"From EU studies, we know that self-employed drivers are sick more often and are more stressed than employed drivers."
"Is this a reasonable state of affairs from the point of view of health and safety?"
"We do not think so."
"A great deal has been said about this directive, and many incorrect things have been said."
"I would like to dispel two myths."
"Firstly, there is the myth concerning administrative work."
"Office work does not form part of the regulation, and it is very important to establish that fact."
"We should bury this myth."
"Secondly, there is the myth concerning enforcement."
"I have heard my fellow Members say that it would not be possible to enforce this directive. To these Members, I would simply say that we have a digital tachograph that can provide the measurements."
"It currently does this for employed drivers, so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers."
"Finally, I would just like to say a few words to Mrs Bauer."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I have been very disappointed in how the process has been carried out recently."
"Mrs Bauer broke all the good rules of negotiation, she broke the 'code of conduct' of this House and now she is presenting what she calls a compromise."
"As far as I am concerned, this is her responsibility - it is not a compromise that is valid for Parliament."
"It is her filthy proposal that she has produced with the Council by skirting all of the rules."
"I would like to finish by saying that this is not about Mrs Bauer's negotiation methods; it is about people and it is about whether we want to ensure decent conditions in an increasingly pressurised transport industry."
"This is something that I hope everyone in Parliament will support when we vote tomorrow."
"Madam President, some of my fellow Members claim that compliance with the 48-hour working week serves the interests of self-employed drivers and of road safety."
"This is a dirty campaign, as self-employed drivers continue to be covered by the Regulation on driving times and rest periods in any case."
"There is absolutely no threat to road safety."
"The problem is that some southern European trade unions fear that self-employed Romanian and Bulgarian drivers will take all the business."
"Those Members follow the trade unions like quivering lapdogs."
"That is the heart of the matter."
"Mr Kallas, the Commissioner for Transport, wishes to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive."
"He deserves our support in tomorrow's votes."
"If he fails to obtain it, 16 June will be a dark day in the history of the European Parliament."
"It will kick citizens when they are down and give them piles of red tape on top."
"And then we complain that voter turnout falls further with every new election."
"Madam President, once again we are in a debate that is crucial for protecting the rights of road transport workers and road safety."
"The Commission's insistence since October 2008 on changing the 2002 directive is unacceptable."
"The Commission now wants it to cease to apply to so-called self-employed drivers, which would aggravate everyone's working conditions, particularly due to the possibility that working hours will be increased to intolerable levels simply to allow greater profits for the major employers in the sector."
"As an example, so-called self-employed drivers could end up working up to 86 hours per week over the whole year."
"This would not only jeopardise their health and safety, but would also present a danger to the safety of all other road users."
"It would also encourage social dumping and the deregulation of employment due to the increased numbers of drivers who falsely state that they are self-employed."
"Being receptive to arguments and studies that demonstrate the dangers of approving such a proposal, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already rejected it twice, but unfortunately, the rapporteur, with the support of the Commission and the Council, has insisted on pursuing negotiations on the directive alone, as though the decision by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had never been made."
"That is why we are now in this very serious situation."
"This issue needs to be clearly opposed by a majority in Parliament, but this has already been jeopardised by the Commissioner."
"We advocate rejecting the proposal, so as to prevent the continuation of this grave threat to workers' rights and the safety of all road users in the European Union."
"We therefore call for the rejection of the Commission's proposal and compliance with the 2002 directive which, since 2009, should be being applied to self-employed drivers in order to combat social dumping, protect the right to health and rest for workers in the sector, and improve road safety conditions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are planning to extend this directive to self-employed drivers for the sake of a supposed increase in safety."
"However, the arguments put forward are misleading and will have a detrimental effect."
"They are misleading because safety is already guaranteed under the 2006 regulation, and detrimental because the competitiveness of thousands of small independent businesses, which have already been sorely tested by the economic crisis, is at risk."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not pretend to be unaware of the fact that the legal and technical disputes regarding the directive actually conceal yet another power struggle between European statists, who are ready to place a new, dangerous burden on businesses, and the supporters of the human face of Europe, who are in touch with our citizens' real needs."
"By intervening to legislate on the organisation of self-employed drivers' working time, Parliament would be setting a dangerous precedent, authorising a European-branded takeover of entrepreneurship and free enterprise."
"It is time to put our words into practice."
"Let us stop exploiting small and medium-sized enterprises for our own ends."
"It is all too easy to praise widespread entrepreneurship when the aim is to come up with effective strategies to combat the crisis, and then to sacrifice these when EU bureaucracy wants to reassert its strength."
"I oppose the utopian war of principles with practicality."
"Europe must not encroach on the sphere of private enterprise and must respect the requests of our regions."
"(FR) Madam President, I am in favour of including self-employed drivers in the proposal for a directive, and I therefore reject both this proposal by the Commission and the Bauer report."
"I am outraged by the way this proposal runs counter to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing, from this day forward, unfair competition from false self-employed drivers."
"This report introduces the practice of unfair competition and will allow it to develop with the growth in the number of false self-employed drivers."
"This proposal also runs counter to the interests of employees."
"At the very time when we are all working together to build a social Europe, this report reinforces social dumping between Member States."
"It is against the interests of employees, it is against the interests of Europe."
"In short, this report flies in the face of road safety."
"I presided over a region crossed by heavy traffic from all over Europe, with significant accidents which gave rise to legal actions."
"These serious accidents should not escape our attention."
"We shall have to account for our decision to our fellow citizens."
"What is more, in 2002, two Member States of the European Union appealed to the European Court of Justice to repeal Directive 2002/15/EC because it included self-employed drivers; the Court rejected their appeal on the grounds of road safety."
"Finally, what we need is a European regulation between all Member States because, nowadays, transport is a European matter."
"The vote in committee was clear. I hope that it will be just as clear in plenary."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Bauer, I am obliged first of all to talk about my profound disappointment with you for the way that you have carried out a negotiation in which Parliament was not respected and for the way that you are presenting this debate here today, which is very economical with the truth."
"It is not true, Commissioner, that this is about including self-employed drivers: they have already been included since 2009."
"It is you who wish to remove the self-employed from the directive."
"Nor is it true, Commissioner, that we are not talking about health and safety on the road: that is exactly what we are talking about, Commissioner."
"We are not talking about anything other than the safety of self-employed drivers and members of the European public who travel on the roads; that is what we are talking about and here you are wheeling out false arguments."
"As always, you are adducing bureaucracy. It is not true."
"You have been singing the praises of the tachograph and the great strides that its use has caused in the regulation of driving in Europe."
"It can be applied without any need for bureaucracy."
"What you are doing is putting the economic interests of the few above the rights of the majority; that is what is really happening."
"Once again, you are disproving what you say about people coming before business: business comes before people for you."
"I wish to record our protest here and I hope that Parliament once again says that the public, safety, law and truth are what is most important."
"I protest, Commissioner: I am very disappointed."
"Mrs Bauer, I am very disappointed with the way in which you have carried out this debate and this negotiation."
"(DE) Madam President, we have heard a great deal already."
"It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct."
"However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees."
"It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work - whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker."
"That is only right."
"Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules."
"Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here."
"If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice."
"That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs."
"We consider Mrs Bauer's proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account."
"We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal."
"(DE) Madam President, the previous speaker described an ideal world in which drivers themselves decide whether they want to be self-employed or employees."
"Unfortunately, in reality, drivers no longer have this choice; instead, they are generally being pushed into being self-employed - or at least, ostensibly self-employed."
"That is the big problem that we face here - and if what we have here is a private compromise between a Member of Parliament and the Council which is being presented as a general compromise and which does not give consideration to this issue, then we are playing into the hands of social dumping in Europe."
"Go and have a look at what is happening on the roads by visiting a checkpoint."
"Take a look at what is really going on in this sector."
"Go and have a look at the accidents - then you will realise that, as Members of the European Parliament, we cannot allow ourselves to advocate social dumping."
"Madam President, it is vital that self-employed workers remain free of the clutches of the Working Time Directive in this way."
"This area of work is already heavily regulated via the driving time regulations and to listen to people saying that people are driven into self-employed work is utterly ludicrous; it is a choice that people make."
"The only thing bogus in all these discussions is the scaremongering claims of people saying that there are road safety dangers associated here."
"We talk here endlessly about promoting entrepreneurs; we talk about allowing them to flourish in the European Union."
"We are here actively encouraging small businesses, and to discourage them simply cannot be the way forward."
"So I would urge you to vote with Edit Bauer."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months."
"I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense."
"The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes."
"Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become - how riddled it is with lies and half-truths?"
"What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers."
"However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours."
"That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment."
"It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard."
"It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work."
"As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers!"
"We cannot pass laws on the basis of 'Let's see what happens'."
"Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious."
"My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads?"
"Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence."
"Let us abandon this nonsense."
"This is about fair competition."
"It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours."
"Do not play games like that with this House!"
"Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions."
"It is not a road safety issue."
"All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph."
"Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency."
"Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business."
"If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers."
"Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector."
"The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce."
"I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect."
"You do not hear that very often from this part of the House."
"(ES) Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers' associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive."
"We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion."
"Firstly, because of workers' safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation."
"Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market."
"Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes."
"There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded."
"(FR) Madam President, just for once, I will speak about procedure."
"Clearly, everybody agrees that we should support SMEs and, by rights, everybody ought to be concerned about issues regarding, at one and the same time, safety, workers, road users and the conditions for free and undistorted competition."
"However, after Parliament rejected this text in spring 2009, that summer, your predecessor, Commissioner Tajani, then canvassing his government for his re-appointment as Commissioner, told us that he would have some new proposals to make."
"Those new proposals were never referred to the relevant parliamentary committee for its consideration."
"Moreover, Mrs Bauer's report was rejected by more members of that committee than had rejected the previous report."
"Mrs Bauer had no mandate to negotiate, on behalf of this Parliament, a first-reading agreement with the Council."
"The Commission and the Council have knowingly flouted the operating rules between the institutions. Mrs Bauer has flouted the code of conduct of this institution."
"This Parliament questions at times the nature of a first-reading agreement because it reduces our ability to negotiate."
"Now, in this instance, if Mrs Bauer's amendments are approved, there will be a first-reading agreement that has not been examined by the bodies of this Parliament."
"At a time when we are seeing a balance being restored between the institutions thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament is turning its back on using its collective intelligence."
"I request, as a minimum, that Mrs Bauer's proposals, which have never been examined in committee, be referred back to committee for consideration."
"(NL) Madam President, I support the Commissioner."
"Self-employed workers organise their own working hours, and that is the way it should stay."
"There is a difference between self-employed and employed workers, and that is only right and proper."
"This has nothing to do with road safety, as driving times and rest periods are identical whether the worker is self-employed or employed."
"These are monitored by a tachograph, which is intended for that and no other purpose."
"We do not look beyond this to monitor the road safety situation of employed and self-employed workers."
"A second point relates to something I consider very problematic in the proposals by those who advocate including self-employed workers in the scope: how on earth are you going to monitor this?"
"How do you propose to drop in on self-employed workers and ask when, where and how much they have worked?"
"This kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable."
"We should not be making such legislation; we should not be including self-employed workers in the scope of the directive concerning employed workers."
"(FI) Madam President, I come from Finland, where there are few people, distances are long and there are a lot of self-employed people."
"We do not need, will not tolerate and will not put up with extra restrictions on self-employed drivers."
"I am glad that the Estonian Commissioner, who is familiar with conditions in the northern countries, knows this, and that also applies to the Slovakian rapporteur."
"I want to thank you for that."
"This is an important question of principle."
"We cannot place restrictions on small business that apply to Europe as a whole."
"This may be a precedent and it is very dangerous."
"How does Europe think it will achieve growth and employment if its administrative decisions destroy employment and the preconditions for growth and kill them off?"
"I am on the side of Finnish owner drivers and in this case, that also means on the side of small business entrepreneurs all over Europe."
"After all, there will be no growth or increased prosperity in Europe if administrative decisions prevent small business entrepreneurs from working."
"(Applause)"
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there must not, under any circumstances, be any restrictions put on the working time of self-employed drivers other than on their driving time."
"The matter of road safety is addressed by restricting driving times and having compulsory rest periods, for which there is the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council pertaining to road transport and driving times and rest periods in force, and that applies to all - yes all - lorry and bus drivers, including self-employed ones."
"A much better option to prevent accidents through tiredness would be more effective monitoring of the driving times and rest periods in force rather than artificially restricting the working times of the self-employed."
"Now there is a move to include such jobs as cleaning the vehicle, technical maintenance and completing consignment sheets in the restrictions on the working hours of self-employed drivers."
"How can we check whether a self-employed driver is washing his wife's car or his truck in his own backyard?"
"This is quite incomprehensible, because there are no restrictions on the working hours of other entrepreneurs."
"It would be a serious precedent if we went down that route."
"As the previous speaker rightly said, in the Nordic countries, like my country, Finland, the transport sector is dominated by small business entrepreneurs and mainly consists of firms with just one or two vehicles."
"Restrictions on the working hours of entrepreneurs would favour large, supranational transport companies and would make it difficult for new transport firms to start up in business."
"The sector will certainly not be of interest to the young if we start to restrict artificially the potential to make a living."
"It would mean a dearth of capacity and increased costs."
"Already, logistical costs are, on average, higher in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe on account of our northern location and sparse population."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall get straight to the heart of the matter, namely the issue of self-employed workers."
"A reminder that the scope has covered all self-employed drivers since March of last year would certainly not go amiss."
"That is the present state of affairs; that is the point of departure the rapporteur should have taken into account."
"Consequently, this is not the precedent the Commissioner claimed it to be."
"A more pragmatic approach should have been possible, namely including self-employed workers within the scope but, at the same time, taking account of the specific nature of self-employed drivers and keeping red tape to an absolute minimum."
"As the rapporteur from the Committee on Transport and Tourism knows, I had drawn up a number of proposals."
"I proposed, for example, that the digital tachograph measure not only driving times and rest periods but also loading and unloading operations, supplemented by a kind of unmonitored fixed time for a number of other activities, such as administrative tasks and also cleaning and similar operations."
"She also knows quite well that activities such as customer contact are neither subject to monitoring nor counted as working time in any case."
"Therefore, I regret that neither the Commission nor the rapporteur was willing to take account of this in any way whatsoever."
"The proposal to let Member States decide for themselves whether or not self-employed workers should fall within the scope does not strike me as a good one."
"The objective must be to arrive at common, uniform ground rules at European level so that the same rules apply to all."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive."
"This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules."
"By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules."
"Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition."
"Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost."
"It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks."
"In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers' health and safety."
"(MT) I think this Parliament would agree that European drivers should be provided with the best conditions, that we should ensure our roads are safe, and that we should do our utmost to regularise this sector without jeopardising European competitiveness."
"However, there is disagreement about whether we should involve the self-employed in all of this."
"I believe we should not arrogate to ourselves the competence to regulate the way they use their time."
"If there is abuse among the self-employed, we should target the abuse, rather than those honest individuals among the self-employed who are trying their best to continue to improve this sector."
"I believe we should exercise great care when it comes to introducing bureaucracy, because too much of it can cause harm and break this sector, especially at a time like this when we have a crisis on our hands which is having a negative impact on all European sectors."
"I therefore congratulate Mrs Bauer for her report and for the compromises she has recommended."
"I would like to appeal to all of us to be careful when we come to regulating the self-employed themselves."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the directive represents an important step in improving the health and safety of workers in this sector, but also in improving road safety and ensuring fair competition."
"These are the words of the Commission itself when the directive was introduced on 23 March 2005."
"Since then, the Commission has done a U-turn and submitted a proposal that excludes self-employed workers."
"That sets a precedent and I cannot defend such a policy."
"There are various reasons not to support the proposal which, in my eyes, represents a step backward socially, a reduction in road safety and an incentive for unfair competition."
"Neither has the proposal been designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"To me, this U-turn demonstrates an inability to implement European policy."
"Despite being twice rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and once in plenary, contrary to a European Economic Area report as well as a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the directive - European law - is simply being amended and steered towards a point where economic interests are the only thing that count."
"Madam President, as a former self-employed truck driver, I support keeping the self-employed in this directive."
"Own-account drivers, I know for a fact, are under tremendous pressure to work night and day."
"Commissioner Kallas, your speech and your proposal is a disgrace."
"It puts drivers' health and safety at risk. It puts other road users at risk."
"It puts SMEs at risk from unfair competition, and it puts increased pressure on decent employers to push their employees into self-employment."
"Fifty per cent of drivers have admitted falling asleep at the wheel."
"Twenty per cent of accidents are due to fatigue."
"Thirty per cent of drivers' working time is taken up loading and unloading and helping passengers."
"Ms Harkin, if you are still here, what they do in their attic is their own business."
"This Parliament must stand up for citizens' safety and against those who want an unregulated transport sector."
"Commissioner Kallas, go back to the drawing board."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to agree with Mrs Morin-Chartier."
"We must not forget that we are dealing with the European Court of Justice in this matter, which has made it quite clear that priority must be given to road safety and that this concerns an existing directive on working hours and rest times."
"Do we want to suddenly call into question a common European regulation on road safety?"
"Why would we do that?"
"It would be absurd and incomprehensible."
"If self-employed workers were to be excluded from this directive again, then, in addition to their 56 hours of driving time, they would also be able to spend 28 hours loading and unloading."
"As a result, they would become a menace on the roads."
"I certainly would not like to encounter such drivers on the roads of Europe."
"How can we suddenly start promoting the distortion of competition at the expense of our common health?"
"How could we explain that to our citizens?"
"That is why I urge you to reject the Commission proposal."
"(DE) Madam President, just as I have done for many years, I am today working for road safety, for an improvement in working conditions for professional drivers, and for an improvement in their professional image."
"It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times, which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional drivers, be they employed or self-employed; rather, it is about the regulation of working hours."
"It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees - in other words, it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road safety."
"There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves."
"How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy, and on what basis would we be checking this anyway?"
"Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way - and perhaps, in future, also those of self-employed tradesmen, architects or Members of Parliament - would send out the wrong signal."
"Instead, the Member States should be working to combat the problem of ostensible self-employment among drivers."
"I am in favour of the proposal put by the European Commission and Mrs Bauer."
"Madam President, extending the Working Time Directive to cover self-employed people is nonsensical."
"It is window-dressed to protect employees' rights and therefore has no place in a self-employed framework."
"It is also unenforceable without infringing people's liberties by carrying out checks in their homes."
"This is not a matter of road safety."
"Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 already covers driving time and is applicable to large companies, small businesses and the self-employed."
"You still need an operator's licence to work if you are self-employed and would therefore be the registered holder of that licence."
"Anything which may jeopardise the licence would therefore jeopardise the licence holder's whole livelihood."
"With this in mind, it is safe to assume that there is just cause for self-employed drivers to be even more fastidious than big firms."
"Everything directly related to the service would be considered part of working time; for example, paperwork, maintenance and general administration."
"In large firms, people are employed to do this; therefore, administration time has no impact on driving time."
"Self-employed doing their own administration would find, under the directive's conditions, little time left to do the driving itself."
"As an aside, I believe the Commission also proposed a relaxation of restrictions over night work by introducing a two-hour qualifying period before night-time restrictions apply."
"I rarely agree with the Commission but this would also be a welcome amendment."
"I fully support the rapporteur, Ms Bauer."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe."
"Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important - and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act."
"Tomorrow's vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping."
"What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue."
"More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it."
"As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter."
"It is time to act at last."
"(PL) I would like to ask: how can entrepreneurship be stimulated during a crisis?"
"How can a growth in the numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises be stimulated?"
"How, for example, can economic activity be stimulated, if this place - the European Parliament - is going to be a place where we bring in new legislation which restricts that entrepreneurship?"
"After all, if people want to start up on their own in business, including the transport business, they should have the right to do so."
"We must not treat them, on the one hand, as businesspeople and, on the other, say that they have to comply with criteria designed for employees."
"We could do the same to people who run a restaurant, on their own and with their family, or for people who run a shop."
"We must not confuse these two things."
"There is a certain excess of legislation, and the European Parliament also contributes to this."
"I know that, in Poland, we had the best regulations on economic activity at the beginning of the 1990s. Now we have increased the number of these regulatory burdens, and the result is that this is meeting with criticism."
"From whom? From the people who are running a business."
"I endorse what Mrs Bauer says, although I am not, of course, going into the questions which came up when this compromise was being negotiated."
"Madam President, in a time of economic challenge, this Parliament has made much of its credentials in encouraging entrepreneurship and competitiveness but, at the same time, we are setting about restricting the right to work of self-employed lorry drivers."
"I have to say that I reject as utterly bogus the claims in this House this morning that this is about health and safety."
"We are all concerned about health and safety and do not want to see any more accidents on our roads."
"I represent Northern Ireland. It is right on the edge of Europe."
"The road transport industry is hugely important to the economy and the inclusion of self-employed lorry drivers will only have a negative impact on competitiveness."
"It is an industry that is highly regulated through tachograph rules, and the financial implications of further red tape would be devastating."
"It would also be hugely damaging to those hoping to set up as independent drivers."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, demonstrates a failure to understand democracy in that she continued to negotiate - with no mandate - against the decision of the Committee."
"If the European Parliament is serious about creating growth and wealth, then we Members must reject the Commission proposal."
"Self-employed drivers must not be excluded from the Working Time Directive."
"This would be a backwards step, since the same rules must apply to self-employed bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers as to the employees of enterprises."
"It cannot be our aim to have fewer and fewer people working more and more - and generally for less and less money."
"It cannot be our objective to have bus drivers and long-distance lorry drivers jeopardise their own health as well as the safety of other road users."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important at this time, because the truth is that we will only find a way out of the debt crisis if we work more."
"It is entirely unnecessary to burden the self-employed with yet more bureaucracy and paperwork."
"Quite simply, if we are to be able to ensure social security in Europe, then it is very important that we increase productivity and competitiveness."
"Consequently, the driving times and rest times currently guaranteed by tachographs are entirely sufficient."
"I would ask those Members who advocate that the directive should apply to all to apply it to themselves and to have a tachograph installed in their own cars - and then not to use their cars on Thursday evening when they go home after working here for 15 hours."
"Ensuring safety is important but, on the other hand, we must also protect the self-employed."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you very much for this debate."
"I listened with great interest to all your contributions."
"There is a great temptation to go into detail and to have a debate on the details of this discussion, but I would like only to say that I still confirm the Commission position, which is built on facts."
"We do not have the studies mentioned here that self-employed drivers are regularly working 90 hours per week, and we think that the Driving Time Regulation, which we would like to enforce, will harmonise practices between Member States and will fulfil this task to ensure and improve road safety."
"Road safety has improved very largely due to the use of the Driving Time Directive."
"We do not have the information that they are more sick, and why do we sometimes think that small and medium-sized enterprises are behaving irresponsibly, that they do not care about road safety or about their own health, so they must be more regulated than others?"
"The Commission cannot support legislation which limits the freedom of entrepreneurs in the road transport sector to organise their working time, while in other sectors, entrepreneurs are not subject to similar working time restrictions."
"However, if the vote in this House confirms the rejection of the Commission proposal, then the Commission will review all possible options, including withdrawal of the proposal, and if Parliament decides to include self-employed drivers in this directive, we will enforce your will."
"We will immediately inquire with Member States how they apply the working time rules on self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules."
"rapporteur. - (HU) I would like to address five matters very briefly."
"The Rules of Procedure."
"I have studied the Rules of Procedure carefully, and as far as I know, MEPs have full discretion to carry out their mandate and therefore they can consult whoever they want. According to the Rules of Procedure, the parliamentary committee does not require MEPs to voice the committee's position."
"It is the plenary session's position that is binding."
"That is exactly what the Rules of Procedure say."
"I do not question, either, the grounds on which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament submitted its proposed amendment, nor who it consulted."
"In agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, I also had informal discussions with representatives of the Commission and the Council when I thought it was important."
"I agree that the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs is a real European problem, and we incorporated it in the proposal, in cooperation with the fellow Members who considered the exclusion of self-employed entrepreneurs important."
"This issue must be addressed, but it is not a sector-specific problem."
"There is a misconception that has been stated repeatedly here, namely, that compliance with this law can be monitored at an international level."
"This law requires monitoring at a national level."
"Let me add that at a 4% rate, inspection would be more expensive than moving the European Parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg."
"I would like to ask my fellow Members to take this into consideration as well."
"If we reject this proposal, I would also like to say to my fellow Members that we are creating an advantage for third country hauliers."
"I would like to ask my fellow Members to bear in mind that this is the proposal which the Commission approved."
"To reject the proposal of the Commission, that is, of the European Commission, is to make it pointless, expensive and impossible to implement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 June 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I approve of the position adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the rejection of the Commission's proposal and agree that in conjunction with Parliament, the Commission must take action so that a new improved proposal is submitted by the Commission in future."
"I would like to stress that the Commission's proposal to remove self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive would represent a significant step backwards in EU social policy and in the area of transport."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that 'false' self-employed drivers weaken the overall labour market, and the main problem is that in practice, it is difficult to prove 'false' self-employment."
"If we fail to take concrete action and legal measures, then false self-employed work by drivers will become one of the labour market's greatest problems and we will be unable to avoid unfair competition."
"In order to improve the working conditions of all drivers and ensure their social rights and guarantees and in order to improve road safety, as well as avoid unfair competition in the European road transport market, we cannot adopt the Commission's proposal such as it stands today."
"The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates."
"This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future."
"It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States."
"I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself."
"Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads?"
"Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition."
"This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed."
"We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies."
"I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow's vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation."
"In certain EU countries, there is justified concern on the part of the trade union movement about phoney selfemployment in connection with the Working Time Directive and selfemployed drivers."
"Outsourcing and, as a consequence, employers evading their responsibilities, are growing problems."
"The way to solve the problem that has been suggested, that is, that selfemployed drivers should be included in the directive, however, is wrong."
"The right way to resolve the problems associated with phoney selfemployment would be to agree on a definition for selfemployment between worker and employer organisations at EU level."
"At present, the innocent have to suffer."
"With regard to this issue, we should proceed in accordance with the compromise which, among others, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, ViceChair of the centreright European People's Party (Christian Democrats), was building."
"Under this, freelance drivers remain outside the scope of the directive, but Member States may, if they wish, apply the regulation of full-time working hours to freelance drivers in their own country."
"The suggestion would probably mean that Parliament and the Council would reach agreement on the directive at first reading."
"It is a pity that Parliament is not allowing any opportunities for a compromise."
"While we should be focusing more on improving the status of entrepreneurs, instead there is the possibility that the working hours of genuine entrepreneurs will be restricted."
"This is worrying, because the opportunities for small entrepreneurs to earn a living generally depend solely on the work they put in."
"Food information to consumers (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Sommer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers - C6-0052/2008 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend the four minutes allotted to me to six minutes, because this dossier is so huge that otherwise, it will not be possible to speak adequately on the matter."
"Consumers have a right to know what foods contain."
"Only if they have information on the composition and nutritional value of foods can they make an informed purchasing decision."
"Although Community law contains a great many regulations and directives on food labelling, there has not, until now, been a comprehensive mandatory labelling system."
"It has now become difficult for food manufacturers and distributors to maintain an overview of the multiplicity of existing laws - whether these are EU laws or national laws of the Member States."
"There is legal uncertainty, distortion of competition and obstacles to trade in the internal market."
"The present draft regulation is intended to deal with all these issues by providing uniform EU-wide food labelling."
"The aims are improved information to consumers, better regulation, harmonisation and less bureaucracy."
"The Commission draft does not live up to these requirements, however, since it is based on assumptions and suppositions concerning consumers' wishes and requirements, imposes unrealistic labelling requirements - such as the 3 mm font size, which does not even ensure that the information is legible, and favours big business to the detriment of SMEs - which actually make up 80% of the food sector."
"In so doing, it contravenes the Small Business Act."
"It also runs counter to the goal of harmonisation in the internal market, in that the intention is to expressly allow 27 additional national labelling systems."
"Extensive amendment of the Commission text is therefore called for."
"That is what we have attempted to do."
"Information must be legible."
"However, font size is only one of many factors in this."
"We need rules on the font, line thickness, contrast, etc. We need binding guidelines on legibility."
"Information must be comparable and therefore it must always relate to 100 grams or 100 millilitres, without an option of only stating the nutritional value per portion."
"Then, when shopping, people will be able to see at a glance which is the 'lightest' yoghurt - regardless of the size of the yoghurt pot."
"Information must be understandable."
"It is time to get rid of the kilojoule at last, which nobody can work out."
"We want to concentrate on kilocalories again; that is what consumers are interested in, and it is what they understand."
"Stated portion sizes must reflect reality and be realistic and understandable to consumers and, if possible, should be uniform throughout the EU."
"Information must not be allowed to mislead consumers concerning the content of the products or their origin or their actual nature. Imitation foods such as cheese analogues and processed meat that is made up of small pieces pressed together should be labelled as such on the front of the packaging."
"Consumers need to know what they are buying."
"In the final event, however, consumers will no longer bother reading if we in fact overload the front of the products with further information."
"Consequently, I am proposing that the only nutritional value stated is the number of kilocalories per 100 grams or 100 millilitres."
"Then they will read it - it is what interests them, and I believe that is a realistic solution."
"I also think we should remove nutritional profiles."
"I hope that we can stop them. These profiles are superfluous because the new regulation labels nutritional values in any case."
"Nutritional profiles discriminate against basic foods, and the threshold values for salt, sugar and fat are entirely arbitrary - having been thought up by Commission officials on no scientific basis whatsoever."
"The real aim of the regulation on the provision of information on nutritional values and health properties of foods is to provide truthful health information, and for this, we do not need any additional assessment of individual foods or their classification into good and bad foods."
"In the end, it is overall diet and lifestyle that count."
"We should ask ourselves why the big food corporations are currently lobbying so hard for nutritional profiles."
"That is something we should really question."
"The so-called traffic light system proposed here has the same kinds of shortcomings as nutritional profiles."
"Once again, it incorrectly forces us to classify products as good or bad."
"The threshold values for the colours are arbitrary and the breadth of each colour category is too great."
"It discriminates against basic foodstuffs, favours imitation foods, and also favours products containing artificial ingredients; in other words, those containing sweetener rather than sugar and flavour enhancers rather than salt."
"That really cannot be in the interests of consumers."
"The GDA model - the industry's model for labelling - has obvious shortcomings."
"It is incomprehensible because it contains too many figures."
"It is misleading because it only describes the daily requirement of a 40-year-old woman and provides no recommended daily amount whatsoever for the amount of sugar consumed, for example."
"It is difficult for SMEs to implement the GDA model. That would once again provide big business with a competitive advantage."
"That is another good reason why GDA labelling should not be made mandatory."
"We also need to protect our traditional food production."
"Only then can we ensure the continued existence of the regional specialities and our food diversity in the EU that we are so fond of."
"We therefore need extensive exemption of non-prepackaged products from this regulation, since traditional products are precisely those that have not been standardised."
"These manufacturers can still provide information on allergens, for example, verbally when making the sale."
"Then a few words on country of origin labelling."
"The question is whether consumers really want to know where all the ingredients in their foods come from or whether there is actually a protectionist agenda at work here."
"I would firstly like to know whether it is feasible, which is why I am calling for an impact analysis."
"Lastly, it should be stated that food labelling can never be a manual for good diet."
"We need information campaigns and we need to educate people in the Member States about balanced diets and healthy lifestyles."
"It is not the job of the legislator to nanny its master, which, in this case, is the citizen."
"It must provide assistance, but our citizens are responsible for themselves and it is not for us to take over that responsibility."
"Finally, I would like to express my great thanks to all those involved, the shadow rapporteurs, even if they were not always prepared to compromise, everyone who has supported me, particularly my ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as I have said on previous occasions, our aim is to ensure that consumers know what they are buying and what they are eating, thus making it easier to choose a diet for themselves and their families in tune with their needs, their wishes and their goals; citizens - consumers - have a right to the right information."
"I would appeal to honourable Members to keep this firmly in mind throughout the debate."
"Before turning to the substance of the proposal, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sommer, for preparing the report, and also the shadow rapporteurs."
"Whilst being sympathetic to most of her statements, I cannot say I agree with all of them."
"I should also mention the input from other committees, IMCO and AGRI."
"Allow me to briefly highlight the most important issues covered by the proposed amendments."
"The question of mandatory origin labelling is very important and needs careful assessment."
"Indeed, there is a recurrent demand for the mandatory provisions of such information for some foods."
"The Commission could partially accept the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling."
"Origin labelling for basic primary foodstuffs which have not undergone substantial processing and are generally considered as single ingredient products could be a pragmatic option."
"However, given the complexity of the matter, the application of any mandatory labelling should be subject to the entry into force of delegated measures and be based on impact assessments."
"Legibility is a major issue and one of the main complaints that consumers make."
"This is a key demonstration that we are putting consumers first in our debate and I hope that honourable Members can support the idea of a minimum font size."
"It is thus regrettable that the amendments tabled would undermine the aim of having measurable criteria as a basis for enforcement."
"I share the concerns of honourable Members about imitation foods."
"I am therefore happy to see Parliament table an amendment containing a provision to explicitly prohibit such misleading practices."
"However, the introduction of a definition and specific designation of such products would provoke legal problems, and we therefore need to find those designations which give correct and unambiguous information to the consumer."
"I am also pleased to note the broad support for mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling and the endorsement of voluntary schemes by Member States."
"The principle that consumers should know what they eat should apply not only to prepacked foods but also to food that they buy over the counter or when they eat out."
"I am therefore not in favour of amendments which would limit the scope of the draft regulation."
"That said, I am open to changing the text on non-prepacked food so that allergen information alone would be mandatory, while Member States could decide on further mandatory requirements for such food."
"Turning to the suggestion for mandatory labelling of nano-ingredients, I am pleased to accept the amendment in principle, although there needs to be a suitable definition."
"Finally, on the issue of nutrient profiles, let me state that I cannot accept the amendments to delete or modify Article 4 in the proposed way, as this provision would undermine the existing regulation on food claims."
"We are all aware that many claims are misleading for consumers; some because they are not substantiated, others because they do not give the full picture of the food in question, claiming only their positive aspects."
"It must also be stated that claims are made on the sole initiative of the manufacturer for the purpose of selling more products."
"We are not imposing nutrient profiles on anyone."
"We are insisting on nutrient profiles where manufacturers choose to market their products through claims, so that consumers can have balanced food information."
"The establishment of nutrient profiles does not prohibit or in any way limit the food products that manufacturers can produce."
"Food manufacturers can continue to produce whichever way they want to."
"However, it is unfair to our consumers and citizens to allow claims that may mislead them."
"It is, for me, a question of providing our citizens with honest and full information about the products which they are consuming."
"Let us not forget that the Claims Regulation was adopted following in-depth debate amongst the institutions."
"The core principles of the regulation remain valid and relevant."
"Having said this, I am looking into the establishment of nutrient profiles with an open mind and I am ready to consider positively certain exemptions as they relate to traditional and basic products with an important dietary role."
"On this basis, I urge you to support the Commission's endeavours to ensure that we have a meaningful basis to protect consumers and foster innovation in the food sector."
"Thank you for your attention."
"I now look forward to an interesting debate and hearing your views."
"Madam President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has formulated an opinion in respect of Mrs Sommer's report on food labelling."
"In our work in this committee, it has been crucial for us to ensure that consumers receive the proper tools to be able to make healthy and correct choices when it comes to food."
"Thus, in the committee, we are in agreement that using food labelling to mislead consumers is totally unacceptable."
"We are also in agreement that consumers must be provided with clear information through good labelling."
"Of course, we also agree that the rules should enable the internal market to function as well as possible."
"Thus, we are in agreement on the fundamental principles."
"However, when it comes to the specifics - the question of how this is to be done - there was not a particularly high level of agreement in our committee, and the same degree of disagreement could also be seen in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"This shows what a difficult issue this is."
"Therefore, in actual fact, I should first and foremost like to urge the rapporteur to remember that this food information is intended primarily to be a tool for the consumer and not a marketing tool for enterprises."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather angry as I stand here before you, because I am going to focus on Amendment 101, concerning country of origin or place of provenance."
"A split vote amendment was tabled on behalf of my group in order to clearly distinguish between the two, since they do not mean the same thing."
"In short, the country of origin is the country in which the foodstuff was last processed, while the place of provenance is clearly the place of origin of the raw ingredient, notably fruit and vegetables, and Mr Dalli pointed this out."
"Now, what is particularly serious is the fact that Parliament's services have rejected this split vote amendment and are incapable of telling me which rule of the Rules of Procedure allows them to do so."
"I am even being told that this is standard procedure."
"This is therefore very serious because this decision - an arbitrary one in my view - will obviously influence the substance of the decision."
"Madam President, I would ask you to speak to the services on my behalf in order to denounce this arbitrary decision and to ensure that, within the next 24 hours, the services reconsider and accept this sound amendment."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Sommer for her tough, committed work."
"She has been subjected to some baseless criticism that she does not deserve."
"That also obscures the fact that there are many matters on which we agree."
"We all want better labelling of imitation foods."
"Cheese is made of milk, and if it contains other things, then it must be labelled as an imitation on the front of the packaging."
"We also all want binding nutritional labelling."
"We do not yet have this. It is something that we all want."
"We also all want it to be in a unit that consumers understand."
"On this matter, allow me to tell you a joke that is doing the rounds here in Germany - and perhaps in some other countries too: 'What do you call the little animals that sew your clothes tighter while they are in the wardrobe?"
"Calories.'"
"Nobody anywhere in Europe would tell this joke using kilojoules."
"The kilojoule has not taken off as a unit."
"It confuses people and therefore, we do not need to specify it as mandatory information."
"The calorie is the unit that informed consumers use in their calculations."
"There is thus a great deal of agreement. There are also differences, for example, on the matter of nutritional profiles."
"Our group wishes these to be removed, or at least clarification that basic foods will be exempt."
"There has been heated discussion over salt in bread, French cheese and similar things."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli and President Barroso for having attempted to provide clarification on these matters."
"There is no College decision, however, and consequently, we need this to be clarified once and for all."
"I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in this area."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, this proposal has been highly controversial and it is extremely complex."
"As the shadow rapporteur for my group, my guiding principles have been to ask: what information do consumers want when buying food for their families, and how best can we provide this information?"
"Our continent faces an obesity epidemic on a scale never before seen."
"We are eating too much fat, sugar and salt, and it is contributing to heart disease, diabetes, increased risk of cancer, strokes, liver disease and even depression."
"Of course, simply ensuring consumers can easily identify the nutritional content of their food is not a magic cure, but it will enable consumers to be more aware of the food they buy, compare products and identify the healthiest option at a glance, thus taking control of what they eat."
"I am proposing we use a colour coding system to do this, not to make a judgment on the product as a whole, but to inform consumers if the product they are buying is low, medium or high in salt, fat and sugar."
"This will only apply to complex processed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, breakfast cereals and all of those convenience foods produced on an industrial scale whose nutritional content - which is often poor - consumers are often unaware of or misinformed about."
"May I stress that this will not apply to German bread. It will not apply to butter or cheese or apple juice, or even alcohol."
"I have emailed every MEP with more information so please, before you make up your minds, read it so that you know exactly what is being proposed, rather than listening to misleading industrial lobbying or flawed arguments from certain quarters of this House."
"I would also urge colleagues to support mandatory country of origin labelling."
"It is clear that consumers are becoming more conscious of the origin of the food on their plate and want honest food labelling."
"Of course, this will not always be feasible."
"Nevertheless, for single products, it is clear that their agricultural origin should be available to consumers and this is 100% feasible."
"It is already in place for beef, for fish, and for fresh fruit and vegetables."
"For the ingredients of processed products, it is, of course, more complex, which is why it is only being proposed for meat, poultry and fish in processed foods."
"On a final note, we talk a lot in this House about the importance of consumer choice and prevention in public health."
"Now is our chance to prove that we are serious."
"Colleagues, actions speak louder than words."
"Please support my proposals."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement at the start of this debate, and also Mrs Sommer for her work as rapporteur."
"I have the impression, after almost a year in this House, that we believe we can change the behaviour of millions of Europeans just like that with a mere piece of legislation."
"The same belief surrounds this regulation."
"However, we must realise that nothing is as hard as changing people's behaviour, particularly when we are talking about 500 million of them."
"Therefore, our ultimate influence over that behaviour via labelling will be limited."
"This does not mean I am completely dismissing this regulation through reservations - absolutely not - but we do have to be realistic about the force of this instrument."
"We must realise that consumers are entitled to the information."
"In addition, whatever the outcome of this debate, consumers will obtain much more information after the second reading."
"In the longer term, on the other hand, we must invest more in education, and in teaching people from the bottom up how to have healthy lifestyles."
"Another point is that the debate in this House concerns the fundamental objectives of this directive."
"Are we forcing people to make a healthy choice of foodstuffs or are we giving them the opportunity to decide for themselves what foodstuffs to choose?"
"We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, believe people should be given the information, and that they are capable of making their own choices."
"Finally, we must be sure to strike a balance with regard to the amount of information we provide to people, as too much or too little will never work."
"I believe we are on the right track per se."
"Let us trust that people who can vote for us are also sufficiently capable of choosing the right foodstuff in the shops if provided with the appropriate information."
"Madam President, the power that consumers possess is based on them receiving information."
"If we do not force undertakings to provide correct information, consumers will not receive it and then the whole of the internal market will collapse."
"We cannot determine centrally what information is important for a particular consumer."
"Consumers have different requirements and we need to try to satisfy as many of those as possible."
"We run the risk of playing into the hands of the industry if we are reluctant to warn consumers about high calorie content, salt, fat and so on. It is no stranger to have a colour coding system for nutrient content than to warn consumers when they buy an energy guzzling car or an energy intensive refrigerator."
"We must not defer the origin marking by carrying out studies; we need to implement it right now."
"The animals and those who want to protect the animals' welfare cannot wait until information is available as to whether animals have been transported live to slaughterhouses far away."
"Neither must we play into the hands of the alcohol industry."
"Alcohol manufacturers are constantly demanding to be treated in the same way as regular food undertakings, but now that we are about to regulate food, they no longer want to be included."
"That is disgraceful."
"Many consumers do not know that alcohol has a high calorie content and that, for example, a glass of white wine contains twice as many calories as a similar quantity of a soft drink."
"When it comes to nutrient profiles, I take a completely different view from Mrs Sommer."
"They reduce the possibility of undertakings describing products as beneficial when they are not."
"The system specifies limits and reduces the possibility of false marketing."
"I totally agree with the Commission on this issue."
"Finally, I would like to mention a couple of minor issues."
"We said 'no' to thrombin at an early stage."
"There are other similar products on the market, and Mrs Sommer and I have both tabled amendments that are intended to provide a correct description of these products."
"I hope they receive support."
"We currently sell sausages on the market that contain large quantities of connective tissue and fat but are nevertheless referred to as meat."
"We now have a chance to rectify this."
"With regard to egg products and other products of animal origin, we could label them according to the system that already applies to eggs, in other words, a system that indicates the conditions under which the animals have been reared."
"That would be a step in the right direction."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, one of the most contentious items in this debate has been country of origin labelling."
"I firmly believe that consumers have a right to know the origin of the food they purchase and, particularly in the case of meat, if it has been produced to high welfare standards and has not been transported over great distances prior to slaughter."
"But the sourcing of raw materials in processed food is irreversibly complex, as ingredients are chosen based on price, quality and availability and countries of origin in a single meat processing plant may alter day by day, and even hour by hour."
"The constant adaptation of labels would carry higher costs and will inevitably increase packaging waste."
"These additional costs would be passed on to the consumer."
"That is why I believe that the feasibility of mandatory labelling rules must first be subject to an impact assessment, and I am glad that Commissioner Dalli said that he supports that."
"But while this debate focuses on raw materials or ingredients of foodstuffs, it does not cover the origin of the final product."
"This is particularly important for specific products like whisky."
"It is still possible for low-quality whiskies from countries like India, China and Japan to pass themselves off as the genuine article by carrying pictures, images or names on their labels which are reminiscent of the traditional whisky-producing countries in the EU in order to increase their competitive advantage and mislead the consumer."
"We must guard against this, and I therefore urge you to support Amendment 254."
"Again, the question here is whether Europe chooses the food industry or the consumer."
"Tomorrow, you will nail your colours to the mast: will you support a clear system of colour coding for food labels or will you place your trust in the industry?"
"The political choice is simple, as far as I am concerned."
"If you wish to safeguard commercial interests, you will support the ideas of the food industry."
"If you want a label that you have helped choose to indicate high, medium or low sugar, salt or fat, you will vote for a system of colour coding."
"60% of your voters are overweight, as are 25% of our children."
"25% of people have reading difficulties."
"Why does everyone consider colour coding normal on energy labels for housing, cars or electronic goods, for example, but patronising on foodstuffs?"
"Nutrition experts and consumer organisations recommend a simple colour coding system to make food labels understandable and to make it easy for people to make their own choices."
"I, too, support that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are being asked to vote on a draft report on information to consumers, but have we really asked ourselves what consumers want?"
"Have these considerations been agreed on behind closed doors in Parliament, or do they reflect the interests of consumers?"
"The latest survey announced by the Commission may not be representative of the increased awareness that consumers have developed in recent years with regard to information about their food choices."
"It is not only the origin but also the ingredients and other characteristics that are becoming a fundamental part of the decision-making process."
"Are we aware that the decisions we make today will influence tomorrow's purchases?"
"Should it not be consumers who determine the market?"
"Why not try to understand, through a new survey or by maintaining ongoing direct dialogue with consumers, what it is that they really want?"
"We must represent consumers as best we can."
"That is why we are here and, from the meetings I have had, I have discovered that consumers want to be involved more."
"They do not expect the buying process to be complicated by the inclusion of pointless information on labels, but nor do they expect overly simplistic, misleading choices such as the traffic light system, which risk providing irrelevant information that is not necessary for an informed choice and does not meet their needs."
"Our approach must not be paternalistic but open to dialogue."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Jobbik believes that the provision of appropriate information to consumers is of vital importance."
"We support the mandatory indication of the place of origin and we also believe that it should be possible to hold not only the manufacturer but also the distributor responsible for non-compliance with the rules."
"In addition to the numerical data, which are often difficult to interpret, we believe it is necessary to introduce uniform colour coding that distinguishes healthy food from unhealthy foodstuffs."
"However, this is not sufficient for healthy foods to gain ground."
"It must be said that multinational companies are responsible for spreading these poor quality products they call foodstuffs throughout Europe."
"It must be said that Cora, Tesco, Auchan, Metro and the like are responsible for flooding the Hungarian market with junk they call food."
"Why on earth are Chinese garlic, Chinese peaches, Brazilian frozen chicken and carcinogenic Slovakian baby food needed on the Hungarian market?"
"Jobbik firmly believes that smallholders and organic farms should be supported, not multinational companies."
"This will provide the solution to having healthy foodstuffs on the market."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it."
"This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it."
"I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles - as well as the conditions for their use - before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006."
"An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market."
"As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer."
"There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling."
"Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit."
"On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission's proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems."
"Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products."
"Mr President, over 60% of Irish adults are overweight or obese and similar figures can be found across Europe."
"This regulation will help us tackle not only this obesity crisis, but also other health problems such as diabetes, stroke and heart disease."
"Unfortunately, the current industry-developed GDA labelling system is complex, arguably misleading and generally misunderstood."
"Traffic light food labelling is a simple, universally understood and transparent system that health and consumer groups support and many health-conscious food producers have already voluntarily and successfully adapted."
"I also believe that alcohol producers should label their products for calories and sugar in a similar fashion."
"Nobody has yet offered me one good reason why alcohol should be excluded."
"We all know there has been massive industry pressure on this piece of legislation."
"I urge my fellow MEPs to resist this pressure and take a pro-health stance by supporting traffic light and alcohol labelling in tomorrow's vote."
"(FR) Mr President, my speech will focus on the issue of colour coding."
"We are told that 'it is complicated'."
"That is not true; it makes things easier."
"We are told that 'it is a ban'."
"It is not a ban; it is actually a form of information."
"We are told that 'it treats consumers like children', but in that case, we should also be told, Mr President, why it is that consumers' associations are actually demanding this colour coding."
"We must be clear, and stop all this hypocrisy and pretence."
"We have a choice to make here between, in fact, defending public health and the consumer, and bowing to demands from lobbies, which, moreover, are very short-term demands because, without this labelling, they are only relevant in the very short term."
"As far as I am concerned, as far as we are concerned, the choice should be clear."
"It is perfectly clear that we are in favour of this information for consumers, information which social security and health authorities in Europe are also calling for, precisely because it is a means of combating obesity and a number of diseases."
"So let us not give way!"
"Let us be well aware of the reasons why we are here, the reasons for which we were elected."
"We are here to defend our fellow citizens."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are what we eat, we are steadily becoming the products of industry."
"This is linked to the fact that it is becoming common for people to be overweight and the by-products of that, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are also becoming common."
"The packaging of food must provide clear and truthful information on its content."
"The clearest indication of its general health-promoting properties would be the traffic light model, which even a child understands at a single glance."
"If we do not achieve this at EU level, at least it should be permitted nationally."
"I would also like to focus attention on the matter of trans fatty acids."
"The Committee was in favour of the compulsory labelling of industrial trans fatty acids, and I hope that Parliament as a whole will follow suit."
"The Committee commissioned a summary to be drawn up of studies of the effects on health of trans fatty acids."
"According to that summary, there is so much evidence of their harmful effects that the most obvious option would be to ban industrial trans fatty acids, as they have in Denmark."
"At the very least, they should appear on packaging labels in order for us to know what we are buying, when, for example, we purchase biscuits, chocolate, potato crisps or ice cream."
"Mr President, first of all, I welcome the report and I want to congratulate the rapporteur."
"She has been at it for some considerable time and she has certainly shown herself to be a very able rapporteur."
"Let me make one thing very clear."
"I am totally in favour of labelling of origin, but I think we have to be very clear about what we mean by labelling of origin."
"We must ensure first of all that people - the consumers - know where the produce came from."
"Then the consumer also has to know very clearly how that food was prepared or how it got to where it is."
"I agree with the rapporteur on this, and I think we are in danger here of going too far too soon."
"This is a process, a first reading."
"Let us be very honest about this as we will come back to this again and again."
"I want to see us proceed with a degree of caution, but let us get it right."
"I do not want us to over-regulate in Europe to a position where even we in Europe do not know where we are coming from."
"We are in great danger of over-regulating ourselves out of the market."
"We have to control this and get it right, and I am totally in favour of it."
"I think we should use the time between the first reading and the next reading to have an impact assessment to see what the cost and what the effect of this will be, because in the long term, that it what we require."
"Mr President, I do not think anyone in this House will argue with the fact that consumers want and need safe, traceable and wholesome food, and no one can argue that there is not a need for accurate and honest labelling of food."
"However, we must be careful not to create information overload in any labelling system."
"Too much unintelligible information will lead to consumers ignoring the essential information and paying attention to information which has no real value."
"Therefore, simplicity and valuable information should be the key criteria in a labelling system."
"I, like my colleagues, support country of origin labelling."
"I do believe that it is important that we know where our food comes from."
"The farming and fishing industries and communities which are represented in this House produce food under very stringent regulation yet, for example, 60% of the fish we eat is imported into the EU and, in most cases, not reared under the same strict environmental and regulatory regimes."
"We need to ensure that our systems create level playing fields for our communities and our industries."
"In Northern Ireland, the agri-food industry is hugely important and again, I would appeal for us not to penalise the industry with unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise two particular points."
"The first one concerns nutrient profiles."
"I am against their deletion, as I would remind you that they were drawn up with the sole aim of determining whether or not a foodstuff can carry a health claim."
"The aim, in fact, is to avoid consumers being misled by health claims that are sometimes displayed on foodstuffs that are often very high in fat, salt and sugar."
"I therefore put it to you that we should reject the amendment to delete nutrient profiles, profiles which, I might add, we approved in 2006."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the risk inherent in Amendment 205, which envisages labelling meat derived from animals that have been ritually slaughtered."
"The danger is that it would stigmatise certain religious groups, as labelling of this nature would create ill-founded distrust amongst certain consumers."
"May I remind you that some meat which is entirely suitable for consumption is sold on the ordinary market, as it cannot be consumed by believers for religious reasons."
"What is more, this meat comes from certified abattoirs, which fully meet health criteria."
"The economic consequences would therefore be quite significant, the survival of a number of ritual abattoirs would be under threat, and that would jeopardise the livelihoods of small, local farmers."
"What I think we need is a good dose of common sense in labelling so that consumers receive the right information."
"More importantly, however, I believe that colour coding will also have the effect of stigmatising produce."
"I do not think that it is quite the right solution yet."
"(ES) Mr President, the thousand amendments from the committee that we are seeing in Parliament are the best demonstration of our goodwill."
"However, as well as goodwill, I think that we have to be practical when labelling food if we do not want to have the opposite effect to the one we are aiming for: in other words, confusing consumers rather than informing them."
"It is a case of warning, not explaining."
"It is a case of informing them what they can eat and in what quantities they can eat it."
"Is labelling on fat, sugar and transfats necessary?"
"Indeed it is."
"Is labelling on things that affect cholesterol - on all substances that affect what we have mentioned: obesity and people's health - necessary?"
"Nevertheless, including other types of information, whilst potentially very informative, could end up being confusing in the case of some foodstuffs: for example, the place of origin, or, in the case of meat, where the beast was born, where it has passed through, where it was raised and where it was slaughtered."
"It is up to us to be practical and to make sure that this regulation becomes one that will harmonise and inform consumers; if not, it will cause greater confusion and impose issues that, far from achieving better levels of health, will achieve greater levels of confusion."
"That is why I suggest that for some foodstuffs, we opt for a guideline daily amount instead of the traffic lights, because that way, it is very clear that if you eat a certain amount or twice that amount of a given product, you will get fat and, therefore, that you should only eat one of them."
"Some of us are suggesting a maximum daily allowance in place of other types of code so as not to confuse consumers further."
"Mr President, what could be simpler than laying down rules for giving information to consumers?"
"But different interpretations and different practices in different countries and competing commercial interests have led to much complexity."
"Personally, I will be voting for traffic lights, country of origin labelling and more information about alcoholic drinks, but past experience suggests there is still plenty of room for confusion."
"In his opening remarks, the Commissioner referred to the legislation on food health claims."
"In a response to a parliamentary question he has just given me, he says that 44 000 applications for health claims have been made by companies."
"The European Food Safety Authority is completely swamped and the Commission has not yet given a single opinion in response to these applications."
"The Commission itself is now in breach of European law, so this is a complete mess."
"Perhaps the Commissioner will use his closing remarks to tell us how we are going to get out of it."
"Mr President, the principle of providing more and better nutritional information to consumers has been at the forefront of this report and is a commendable aim."
"However, during the process of the report through this Parliament, I have had enlightening discussions on the font size on a packet of chewing gum, whether chicken is in fact a meat, or whether a Twix bar is classified as one portion or two."
"We have forgotten what is important and essential to the consumer."
"The traffic light system of labelling excessively simplifies nutritional profiles, causing even the most basic information to become vague and abstract."
"This directly affects the choices available to consumers and has a disproportionately negative impact on staple foods."
"Just as certain Members have been quick to make judgments, the traffic light system provides too judgmental an assessment of foodstuffs and the complex nutritional composition of food; its place in the diet cannot be reduced to a simple colour."
"Consumers want to know where their food is from, and essential information on what is in it - especially allergenic information - to allow them to make the best choice of food product."
"I believe they are intelligent enough to do that."
"They do not want to be dictated to about what food they can and cannot eat."
"(PL) From the point of view of the common internal market, the question of harmonising the principles of labelling and the mutual recognition of food products is of great significance."
"Currently, additional national legislation and existing EU legislation on food products, which is variously interpreted by different Member States, are a source of difficulties in trade and the flow of goods, and of problems in the area of competition."
"I am troubled by the provisions concerning the obligation to provide information about the country of origin of products of specific categories."
"In my opinion, this is an expression of the protectionist attitudes of Member States, and is at variance with the idea of a common market which eliminates fundamental barriers and difficulties in the movement of goods."
"Therefore, bearing in mind the good of consumers, I think that information on the country of origin of products should be given based on the voluntary principle and in cases where the lack of this information could mislead the consumer concerning the true source of the product."
"I consider such an approach to be balanced, both from the point of view of the good of consumers and the interest of food producers."
"During this debate on the Commission's regulation and Mrs Sommer's report, the question of a balanced diet and the eating habits of EU residents has been raised many times."
"In my opinion, food labelling is only one of many aspects of information for consumers about healthy eating."
"It can extend society's knowledge in the area of healthy living, for example, by campaigns and educational measures, but it cannot be a substitute for this knowledge."
"Therefore, I am opposed to the introduction of colour coding of foods, which might have permanent consequences for eating habits."
"Ultimately, in our society, we cannot and must not introduce legislation on the basis of which citizens are not responsible for their own behaviour and the choices they make."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the task of politics and the task of the European Parliament should be to further improve the quality of life enjoyed by Europeans."
"That includes a healthy environment, and it also includes wholesome food."
"If I am to eat healthily, then I, as a consumer, need this information."
"We urgently need feasible, mandatory country of origin labelling so that consumers can make an informed decision as to which foods they buy from which region."
"On the other hand, however, we also still need nutritional profiles, because only these can ensure that consumers are not misled as to whether a food is healthy and whether the ingredients really promote health and a good diet."
"In addition to this, however, we definitely need clarification and education in the area of nutrition."
"That includes wholesome food from a healthy environment as well as the requisite amount of exercise."
"(PL) Mr President, it is not every day that we debate legislation which is the cause of such intense interest among our electorate."
"It is a well-known fact that a clear label on a food product influences consumer decisions and, in addition, encourages producers to promote healthy food."
"One issue which has come up in the legislative process and our discussion concerns information about the origin of food."
"Labels have to state the country of production of food items, including in the instance of processed food."
"In this second case, it will certainly be more difficult, but it seems to me that a good solution is the idea of giving information about the origin of the primary ingredient of a processed food product."
"Equally important is information about the contents of alcoholic beverages."
"I share the view that information about the ingredients and nutritional values of alcoholic beverages should be available on the packaging."
"The consumer ought to know if the vodka he is buying was made from cereals, potatoes or perhaps bananas."
"No one in this Chamber questions the need for change and the introduction of more comprehensive legislation."
"I hope we all agree, too, that this should be a move in the direction of European consumer expectations, although also taking into account the capabilities of small and medium-sized enterprises in the food sector."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is being asked, as we know, to express a definitive opinion on food information to consumers."
"I should start by saying that this has unquestionably been a difficult, long and controversial legislative process, which could not have been shortened."
"The aim, in fact, is to harmonise European food legislation through regulations that will make information to consumers transparent, thereby preventing a situation in which they are led to make confused choices or choices that may even be harmful for their health."
"The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States."
"It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers."
"On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers."
"At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods."
"In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition."
"There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health."
"(PT) Mr President, the labelling of food products is vital in order to guarantee food safety."
"I advocate clear information for the consumer but, at the same time, less bureaucracy, the simplification of regulation, more legal security and increased competitiveness in the food industry, without forgetting the smaller companies."
"Direct selling by farmers cannot be subject to the rules of this regulation, nor can local and artisanal products."
"Products like these ensure our diversity and safeguard our deepest roots."
"Consumers need to be informed without their choices being pressurised or our regional products being stigmatised."
"The Commission's proposal is overly nannying because it tries to push consumers in a certain direction instead of giving them the information."
"Some want to decide what is on our menu; others want to tell us which dishes we can and cannot eat."
"I assure you that the Portuguese, and particularly those from the Minho region, will never give up eating pica no chão or arroz de cabidela; they will never give up caldo verde and cozido à portugesa, accompanied by good local desserts and a bowl of vinho verde tinto."
"I therefore welcome the amendments, the adjustments and the work done by the rapporteur."
"I agree with his point of view and his report, and I advocate that consumers should be aware and well informed, but that it should be their responsibility alone to decide what to eat."
"Mr President, we are talking about food information to consumers."
"As Members of this House, we get information on many things and it is not so much the information, but what we do with it, that is crucial."
"I want to address two specific points in this report."
"One is country of origin."
"We do have country of origin labelling for beef."
"Perhaps the Union would not have chosen to have it, but a crisis forced us to have it."
"It seems to have worked very effectively and very well."
"I support the idea that, particularly in relation to meat products, there is a need for country of origin information for consumers so that they know where their food comes from."
"Let me move on to my second point, the issue where I would give an amber light."
"I have read - and indeed thank those who have given me the information - about traffic lights and GDAs, and I have tried to analyse this information extremely carefully."
"I have a number of points to make."
"We have health warnings on cigarette packs."
"I do not smoke, I think the warnings are wonderful and I will not smoke."
"Those who smoke continue to smoke through all the alarming warnings that are on the labels."
"Can I stress that labels will not make you thin. Labels will not reduce obesity."
"We need a much deeper discussion around this problem."
"We should ban lifts and cars so that we get more exercise, but we are hardly likely to take that particular route."
"I am glad this is a first reading."
"I think the issues are too complex to solve at this stage."
"We need a deeper debate and discussion and to come up with something that is in the best interests of the title of the report: 'Food information to consumers'."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur."
"Effective food labelling is indeed very important."
"Consumers need to know what they are eating, and they need to find that out in the brief time that they are in the supermarket doing their shopping."
"However, the information must be provided in such a way that you do not need a degree in food science to understand it."
"Our target group for this information is quite different, after all - it is not those who already have an excellent knowledge of how healthy different foods are."
"I consider one area to be particularly important, and that is the area of traditionally produced products, particularly products processed and marketed directly by the farmer."
"The contents of these products are often not standardised - I am thinking, for example, of jams and juices - and it is simply not possible to state information such as the precise sugar content or precise calorific values."
"In recent years, we have done a lot of work to reduce the distance travelled between farmer and consumer, and today, factors such as life on the farm, farmers' markets, and so on are very important overall for the image of farmers and agriculture."
"We have also spent European money on promoting such things as part of our rural development programme."
"Moreover, in such sales, there is often a direct relationship between the farmer and the purchaser, and that is often more important than information on labels."
"Consequently, I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support those amendments that are aimed at finding a sensible solution for this category of sales."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that there are health problems in the European Union, nor is there any doubt that the interests of consumers must have priority or that food is unlike other commodities, in that it is something that we consume and put into our bodies."
"It is therefore obvious that we must take particular care when talking about foodstuffs and their labelling, and that the precautionary principle - as rooted in the treaty - must also apply here."
"However, it is naïve to think that we can solve these problems through food labelling."
"Take a look at the US: there are many overweight people in the US, and yet the Americans have the most stringent food labelling."
"Consequently, we need to give particular consideration to how to deal with this problem here in Europe."
"I therefore believe firstly that a traffic light system, as proposed, will not achieve our objectives - since the confusion it creates is greater than the information it provides."
"Secondly, however, it is also my belief that a GDA system, as has also been proposed, is very likely to provide the information that knowledge-seeking consumers will find useful for making the right choices."
"Thirdly, I believe that country of origin labelling is important, particularly for foods."
"Most consumers want to know where their food comes from and where it was manufactured."
"Fourthly, I believe that health information must be scientifically based if it is to influence consumers' decisions."
"I have one final request to the Commissioner: we are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the financing of the EFSA."
"This is the only authority that charges no fees for its activities."
"Please would you tell us something about when we can expect this."
"(DE) Mr President, today's good news is that the new legislation will provide uniform, mandatory nutritional labelling that relates to 100 grams, thereby providing greater comparability."
"Statements of nutritional value provide consumers with information that allows them to make an informed purchasing decision."
"The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying."
"Imitation products that are not clearly marked as such deliberately mislead consumers."
"Imitation cheese, pressed ham products, vanilla yoghurt that contains no vanilla whatsoever - these are just a few examples."
"All these imitation products must be labelled as such."
"I am pleased that we will send a clear signal to the Council tomorrow and that all of us here are agreed that we need better labelling."
"As far as I am concerned, the task is to provide information; we should leave consumers to make up their own minds, however."
"That is why I am against traffic light labelling."
"There are no unhealthy foods - only unhealthy, unbalanced diets."
"The traffic lights are misleading."
"I am in favour of food labelling according to the GDA model and am pleased that we are likely to vote to move towards this tomorrow."
"(HU) Consumers must know what they are eating."
"That is why the Hungarian parties fully support the combined colour-coded hybrid labelling system."
"The National Association for Consumer Protection in Hungary also supports this scheme wholeheartedly."
"The combined colour-coded system is an excellent, easy to understand and unambiguous system."
"It allows the provision of authentic information and will help consumers choose healthier food products."
"In order to eliminate the concerns regarding the consumption of traditional products, we only recommend the utilisation of this labelling system for certain product categories."
"That is perfectly clear."
"We also support the specification of the country of origin as extensively as possible."
"We must confirm this regulation requiring country of origin specifications for single ingredient products such as fruit and vegetables, meat, fish and other foodstuffs."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while it is a priority for this Parliament to ensure that consumers have food that is safe and from a guaranteed, traceable source, it is just as much of a priority to promote easy access to food information through appropriate labelling systems."
"The adoption of clear, intelligible food labelling is a step in this direction and may, in fact, influence consumers' choices by encouraging them to buy healthier products from a guaranteed source."
"In this context, I would like to ask this House to carefully examine an amendment that has been tabled and signed by 40 Members, Amendment 351, which calls for consumers to be given information not only on the origin of the raw materials used in some unprocessed agricultural products that arrive on our tables, but also on that of raw materials used in processed products comprising a single ingredient; in other words, those that contain an additive in addition to the agricultural product."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to make two points about this regulation."
"It is essential that we confirm tomorrow our vote on mandatory origin labelling of foodstuffs, which already exists for a large number of products: not only for fish, fruit and vegetables, but also for unprocessed beef, and this type of labelling has been around since the mad cow crisis."
"We must also ensure that this European regulation protects the investments of the very large number of SMEs which innovate and create employment."
"We must therefore get rid of all those measures which will not only fail to work, such as, for example, nutrient profiles, mentioned in Article 14, but which will also, clearly, prove to be a waste of time and money for entrepreneurs."
"I would like to conclude very quickly with a question to our Commissioner, Mr Dalli."
"I should like to hear the view of the Commission on Amendment 205, dealt with at length by Mrs Grossetête, which envisages adding a label for animals which have been killed by ritual slaughter."
"As has already been said, this would stigmatise these products for no purpose and would be particularly counterproductive for this sector."
"I would like to know where the Commission stands on this very important issue."
"(DA) Mr President, I am the European consumer and I want to know what I am putting in my mouth."
"In my country, I can, of course, read where my salad, meat and cheese come from."
"We consumers are entitled to a clear overview of the composition of the food that we buy without having to be trained chemists or clinical dieticians."
"We welcome the fact that the 100 gram and 100 millilitre declarations are to be stated on the front of the packaging, as statistics show that this is the information that consumers are looking for."
"We must not confuse consumers with far too many labelling schemes, nor should we destroy the regional diversity of food-producing areas by imposing a detailed labelling system for non-prepacked food."
"Neither should we put obstacles in the way of the many small and medium-sized enterprises that make up the food industry."
"That would cost thousands of jobs throughout Europe, and we cannot afford to let that happen."
"(SV) Mr President, my vision is that we should strengthen the power of consumers by providing clear, simple and comprehensible information on food without burdening small producers with more bureaucracy in the process."
"I am therefore opposed to any form of misleading labelling and falsification."
"I am opposed to the traffic light labelling system because it scares people and does not respect the fact that we all have different health requirements and lifestyles."
"For the same reasons, I am opposed to labelling of mandatory daily intake."
"I am in favour of the country of origin labelling of meat."
"The Commission must come up with proposals for practical solutions that can be evaluated and with regard to which we can then adopt a position."
"We have two opposing alternatives: either politicians preach from the top down and determine what we should eat or we get greater freedom of choice and the right to more information."
"I am in favour of a nutrient profile labelling system that is flexible and based on research."
"The food industry must take responsibility and must clean up its own act and work to eliminate things that result in poorer food."
"Food is a health issue and it is important to realise that."
"We need to work together for better food."
"(EL) Mr President, I too support coloured labels, but I should like to highlight another issue."
"Every single hour, tropical virgin forest equal in size to three hundred football pitches is turned into palm plantations."
"That is so that we can get palm oil, which is used to produce the foods on our shelves."
"However, this information is concealed from our fellow citizens."
"I call on the House to vote in favour of Amendment 263, which states that it must be compulsory to list palm oil in foods which our fellow citizens find on supermarket shelves, so that our fellow citizens do not fund global deforestation, loss of biodiversity and climate change without wanting to do so and without knowing that they are doing so."
"When we vote in this Chamber tomorrow, we shall decide if citizens can assume environmental responsibility for the foods which they choose or if they are to finance companies, without knowing it, to destroy the environment and our common future."
"(DE) Mr President, three million European schoolchildren are overweight and the number is increasing by a further 85 000 each year."
"Naturally, being overweight causes a range of chronic illnesses and that is why what we eat as food is important."
"In other words, we are what we eat."
"It is in the interests of consumers that we have clear, understandable food labelling that makes reference to certain ingredients."
"I therefore welcome the idea of providing all consumers with a quick idea of the fat, sugar and salt content of a product."
"What really does not belong in this regulation, however, is responsibility for the origin of the ingredients of a product."
"It is therefore important that someone assumes responsibility for where the ingredients used in a ready-made product come from."
"In this connection - in this sensitive segment of the market - it is also very important that we have sanctions in place: sanctions for those who deliberately deceive consumers and make false statements concerning the products and their ingredients."
"(DE) Mr President, we are talking today about information, and information can be distributed all over the world at the press of a button."
"There is no shortage of information; rather, what is lacking is clear, brief and appropriate information."
"One thing is certain: a food label cannot be a manual for healthy eating."
"Knowledge of diet is something that must be communicated in the family, in schools and in communities."
"Everyone needs to have some basic knowledge if they are to be able to use the information on food labels to put together their own healthy diet."
"GDAs, nutritional profiles and health claims are not necessary on labels."
"Traffic lights that can be red and green at the same time - since high sugar and low fat are not mutually exclusive - are of no help to consumers."
"Region of origin labelling is no longer appropriate in today's world."
"Our dairy in the Eifel takes in milk from Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg."
"So what is the country of origin of the cheese produced?"
"Obviously, we must take action to prevent consumers being deceived."
"The label must state what is in the product, without any possibility of misunderstanding."
"A cheese substitute must be clearly recognisable as such and designated accordingly."
"A food additive, a piece of meat that has been stuck together, must not be sold as ham on the deli counter."
"I urge you to support the rapporteur's proposals."
"(PT) Mr President, good labelling on food products is vital."
"Information about the place of origin is important, as is information about the level of fat, sugar and salt."
"For this reason, if it is to be effective, the information must be clear and accessible and must only contain the essential facts."
"However, this does not mean that certain traditional products, which are, in many cases, an expression of the culture in specific regions of Europe, can or should not be exempt."
"With regard to wine, I think that it should also be exempt for two reasons: firstly, it is a special product that is already covered by a specific regulation."
"Wine does not contain fat or sugar but alcohol, which is already graded in current labelling."
"Moreover, red wine is even recommended by the World Health Organisation."
"Secondly, the new labelling would only be detrimental to a sector of the economy that is already experiencing great difficulties."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need not be afraid of stating the place of origin of the products that we, our families and all citizens consume."
"Consumers, who must be guaranteed complete freedom of choice, have a right to know what products they are buying, what those products contain and where they come from."
"These are necessary tools that will enable consumers to rationally assess their dietary and consumer decisions. In this respect, an informed purchase is the first step towards a healthy, balanced diet that helps people look after their health."
"We are aware that for economic reasons, or for the sake of convenience, many businesses would prefer to omit much of the information from their labels, but that cannot be approved by the legislator, who must act solely in the interests of European consumers."
"Effective labelling should not make discriminatory judgments between good foods and bad foods, but can provide consumers with tools to help them make independent, informed decisions."
"The Lega Nord has always fought to protect and safeguard quality products that are locally grown if possible, because it believes that a good, healthy diet is the key to improved health and quality of life."
"(RO) The subject of colour coding seems to be the most heated point of discussion in today's debate."
"This idea might be attractive, but it is definitely not effective at all and is even dangerous."
"Perish the thought for saying that providing consumers with correct information and adopting measures against food-related illnesses should not be a priority."
"However, I also think that we must not demonise certain foods."
"There are no good or bad foods, only consuming excessive food."
"Many traditional European products could end up being avoided by consumers or altered by producers, which would have serious repercussions on our food industry."
"I wish to finish by pointing out that I share Mrs Grossetête's view regarding meat obtained via ritual slaughter and Mr Dorfmann's view about hand-made food products, which are also an important tradition in Europe."
"Last but not least, I support Amendment 351 mentioned by Giovanni La Via."
"(SK) First, I would like to applaud the work of the rapporteur, Renate Sommer, who, in drawing up the report, has focused on improving the directive drafted by the Commission."
"I firmly believe that we must focus on meaningfulness when indicating the nutritional value of foods."
"The necessary data must be stated in comparable values, and must not get lost in symbols and signs."
"We must also focus on intelligibility."
"The main information should be stated on the front, so that it is clear at first sight."
"Supplementary information on ingredients may also be provided on the other side of the product."
"We must also focus on objectivity."
"Suppliers must be responsible for the accuracy of information on products, even under the threat of sanctions."
"Another aspect we must monitor is the legibility of the information."
"The size and thickness of the lettering mentioned in the Commission's proposal are insufficient."
"The main information must be clear to the consumer at first sight."
"As far as country of origin labelling is concerned, I can see a number of unresolved issues."
"Final producers often purchase semi-products on the market according to price, alternating between different suppliers in different countries, and these raw materials are then mixed together in the final product."
"I am talking about specific products, such as salami or sausages. In such cases, it will clearly be difficult to state the country of origin."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this is an extremely important consumer protection issue."
"A recent opinion poll indicates that European citizens believe that the food safety situation has deteriorated over the last 10 years, and one consumer in three still does not trust the quality of produce."
"It is imperative, therefore, to bring up to date, simplify and clarify food labelling in the European Union so as to ensure that consumers are better protected."
"Allow me to raise two points."
"As regards colour coding, we are in favour, provided that it also contains a reference to nutritional values expressed as a percentage."
"What is more, I am opposed to mandatory nutritional labelling for wines and spirits."
"We would like to see a regulation covering wines and spirits drawn up over the next three years rather than over the next five years, as the European Commission proposed."
"That, Mr President, Commissioner, is what I wished to bring to your attention."
"(SK) I would like to thank my colleague, Renate Sommer, for her exacting and thorough work on the report on this draft regulation."
"It is a very important legal standard, especially from the perspective of the health of Europeans, which is the first priority."
"Today, it is beyond doubt that many diseases and lifestyle-related conditions are connected with poor nutrition, and we must therefore approach this problem on a conceptual basis."
"I would like to emphasise that consumers must get clear and transparent information on the nutritional value of a product, but must then make their own decisions."
"Our aim is to tell consumers what is, not what should be."
"I therefore consider the system of traffic light labelling to be superficial and rather inadequate."
"Since up to 80% of agri-food producers are small and medium-sized enterprises, it is also necessary to emphasise that the measures adopted must not burden them excessively."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for this lively and interesting debate which generated such strong views on many areas of the proposal."
"These views will, of course, be carefully considered by the Commission."
"There are certain issues that we believe are fundamental for consumers - for example, availability of information on allergens on all food; front-of-pack nutrition labelling with endorsement of additional labelling by Member States; the inclusion of measurable criteria for legibility; and balanced information concerning consumer health."
"I would like to emphasise once again my strong support for the principle of nutrient profiles, and would stress that we will not be stopping the production of any food and that work on this will proceed in an open-minded manner."
"The Commission cannot accept deletion of this provision from the Claims Regulation."
"I would like, if I may, to react to some of the issues that were raised here today."
"On the EFSA financing, I can say that we are working at the moment on a non-legislative report which should be ready after the summer and which will state what our direction will be in this regard."
"On innovation, I believe that our proposals are not against innovation."
"I am in favour of innovation - as is the Commission - but it must be responsible innovation."
"We want innovation that works for the consumers and innovation that works for consumers' health."
"On the issue of the claims made and the approvals mentioned by Mr Davies, I must state that, under Article 13, we did have about 44 000 claims by Member States."
"When we asked Member States to revise these claims, they were reduced to 4 000."
"This indicates to me the lax and superficial way in which claims are made and why it is important that we control these claims that, as I have said, are made as a marketing tool to sell products."
"In fact, this process has been slightly delayed because of the volumes, but we are working on batches."
"The first batch has been completed by EFSA and is being reviewed by the Commission for publication, and the second batch is also well advanced at EFSA."
"This is an ongoing process."
"On the other hand, 50 claims have already been judged under Article 14, and the Commission has pronounced itself in favour or against."
"Work on this is therefore progressing - we have been delayed but the work is going on."
"I would like to make another comment on the impact assessments."
"The Commission has supported this proposal with wide consultation of stakeholders and a terrain impact assessment weighing the cost and benefits of the various policy options."
"The impact of several amendments tabled by honourable Members today and in the past to add extra labelling requirements has not been subject to any assessment."
"For the sake of better regulation, I believe that impact assessment should underpin the decision-making process at all times."
"I would like to end by again thanking Mrs Renate Sommer and all honourable Members for their contributions."
"A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is, as usual, being made available to Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 June 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The debate that we are tackling today is especially important."
"European law provides a series of regulations and directives on food ingredients and labelling."
"At present, however, no coordinated labelling requirement exists among the Member States."
"It seems clear that the large number of generic European rules on food information makes it difficult for European consumers to find clear guidance."
"Instead of plugging the gaps as they are intended to do, the individual Member States' additional regulations have hindered trade within the European Union internal market."
"For these reasons, I believe that only a uniform, Europe-wide food labelling system can hope to eliminate these problems."
"Mandatory labelling must be presented in a comprehensible format so that consumers can make informed purchases."
"Consumers do indeed continue to occupy a special place in our decision-making process when it comes to safeguarding both their health and the quality of the goods that they buy."
"I must stress the importance of safeguarding European businesses from all forms of counterfeiting and unfair competition while, at the same time, promoting a reduction in red tape."
"Stating the name of the producer on food packaging is also essential information for the purposes of promoting the European food industry's competitiveness."
"The Sommer report is crucial not only for giving consumers clear information but also for avoiding distortion of the market and acting as a catalyst for the European economy, through transparent mechanisms and the uniform application of rules within the EU."
"It is a surprise, then, to see the re-emergence of attempts, in the form of changes to the session, to integrate wine into this scheme of labelling with information on energy values and sugar levels."
"It is already mandatory for wine labels to mention a number of things, and adding new requirements means that they would become overloaded, difficult to read and of negligible practical value."
"The special requirements for labelling on wine can be explained historically by the fact that this is a highly regulated product with certain qualities."
"For this reason, it should come under the proposed five year exemption, which will allow a careful analysis of the information that labels should include."
"The financial crisis currently affecting Europe means that prudence is required in a context where the wine sector is primarily composed of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In addition to the already heavy costs of quality production, this will be an extra requirement with little practical use."
"Given this, I believe it is inopportune and mistaken to label wine according to the regulation currently under consideration."
"The report on food labelling has the aim of unifying seven existing directives and one regulation, and clarifying current regulations at the European and national levels."
"The current disharmony causes uncertainty and confusion over the information stated on foods regarding ingredients and nutritional values."
"The side effects of these changes towards unified food labelling in the EU include boosting the competitiveness of European producers, and promoting healthy eating among the population at large."
"I fundamentally disagree with the Commission's proposal to leave it largely to the Member States to make their own legal arrangements."
"This would lead to further fragmentation and disunity in the internal market for food, and would completely nullify the main aim of the regulation, which is to have unified and clear food labelling."
"The Commission's proposal for 3 mm lettering would, in many cases, be unworkable in practice."
"Compliance with this would mean changing the sizes of individual packaging, which logically entails higher costs for producing the packaging, transporting the products packaged in this way and warehousing the products, as well as higher costs for the food and for the environmental disposal of the packaging."
"The Commission has completely overlooked small farmers and the direct sale of unpackaged products."
"It is unacceptable for the Commission to present us with such unbalanced and incomplete proposals which fail to take account of the latest scientific developments."
"I agree in principle with the modified version of the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I will therefore be voting in favour of this new version."
"Today, we are voting on a regulation that is designed to safeguard consumers by guaranteeing their right to information about the food sold to them, so that they can make informed purchasing decisions."
"We are not here to dictate what European citizens must eat."
"Therefore, we cannot accept approaches such as traffic light or nutrient profile labelling that give foods the green light or the red light on the basis of so-called health principles which, apart from anything else, do not take account of gastronomic traditions or local specialities."
"What is more, leading nutritionists believe that there is no such thing as good foods and bad foods, but only good diets and bad diets, depending on how individual foods are combined in a person's overall diet."
"Both the traffic light and nutrient profile models overlook the fact that the human body also needs these much maligned fats, sugar and salt in order to function properly."
"I should also like to draw attention to the need to specify the origin of foodstuffs."
"We are well aware that in some countries, ingredients may be used that are harmful to health and poor hygiene standards may be tolerated in the production sector."
"We must protect those businesses, too, that pride themselves on the quality and wholesomeness of their products."
"With our vote, we can make some major progress in this direction."
"We have spent around EUR 90 million on the EU campaign to promote a healthy diet for European school children."
"The aim is to encourage children to eat healthily by offering them free fruit."
"So we are spending millions on drumming it into the heads of children that they should eat apples and other fruit."
"Then we plan to introduce a food labelling system in which foods with a low sugar, fat and salt content would have a green traffic light on the label and those with a high content a red traffic light."
"All of a sudden, those apples which we have supplied at a cost of millions of euros would have a red label because of their sugar content and would therefore be seen as being unhealthy."
"The kids would probably not find anything very complimentary to say about the EU if this were the case."
"Even those people who do not think about what they eat have finally got the message that consuming excessive amounts of convenience foods, biscuits, sweets and alcohol is unhealthy."
"For all the people who want to take their health into consideration when buying food, or who are forced to do so because of an illness, a complete list of ingredients is much more important."
"This will make it easier for diabetics, for example, to calculate the number of bread units, instead of having to guess how much insulin to inject."
"For the 10% or so of consumers who apparently read the nutrition labelling, the calorific value and calorie content are the ideal solution."
"In contrast, a confusing colour-coded system does not really serve a useful purpose."
"in writing. - Many European citizens suffer from diet-related health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease."
"And cases of these conditions - which are often preventable - are on the rise."
"A heavy reliance on processed and convenience foods, combined with a lack of accessible information about their contents, means that consumers do not always make healthy choices about their diet - even if they want to."
"We have a right to clear, accurate information about what we are eating, and it should be easy to compare different products, especially in terms of their fat, sugar and salt contents."
"The labelling standards, particularly the colour coding which I will be supporting in tomorrow's vote, will help both those who have specific dietary needs, as well as those who are conscious of their general diet, to make the right choices."
"Education about diet and nutrition alone is not enough - it must be backed up with accessible and reliable information which people can easily use."
"This is vital to ensuring that people can make the right choices about their diet, and is one of the best ways we can tackle the diet-related diseases which are so prominent across the European Union."
"The report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, which will be put to the vote today during the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, is another step towards enabling consumers to obtain the information they need about a product and thereby make an informed decision about whether to buy it."
"On the strength of this legislation, the Union will introduce a system of food labelling which will be mandatory in all Member States."
"It is an example of good legislation, which rationalises the current system of seven directives and one regulation."
"Harmonisation of legislation at European level means that the correct functioning of the common market will be guaranteed by enabling consumers to make informed choices, while at the same time ensuring legal protection for producers."
"The multiplicity of different systems of food labelling only causes unnecessary doubts among consumers when making purchases, while the information which is given is often illegible or not displayed properly on the packaging."
"This is especially important in view of the obesity epidemic in Europe."
"Mrs Sommer's report is intended to change this situation, and so I am going to vote in favour of its adoption."
"Quality of statistical data in the Union and enhanced auditing powers by the Commission (Eurostat) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Karas and Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the quality of statistical data in the Union and enhanced auditing powers by the Commission (Eurostat) - B7-0314/2010)."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is an important political signal that the European Parliament wants to send in these times."
"The tabling of this oral question in the midst of the process of redesigning Eurostat and drawing up the European Parliament's statement to the Commission is also a sign of our determination."
"In submitting a separate resolution, we are demonstrating that the European Parliament needs and wants Eurostat to act independently and comprehensively."
"This is the first direct response by the legislature to experiences in and with Greece."
"At the same time, we should not forget that in 2005, the Council rejected Commissioner Almunia's Five Point Plan and thereby prevented the Commission from being equipped with the necessary instruments."
"We are catching up with what we could have done, and needed to do, long ago."
"Consequently, I would like to remind both the Commission and the Council that the political will exists to evolve all the instruments needed to ensure that the euro is supported not only by the pillar of monetary union, but also by the pillar of economic union."
"I call on the Council not to block, not to delay, not to prevent, but rather to give the Commission this opportunity."
"We also want to know whether any investigations are being made into where Eurostat and/or the Member States have acted incorrectly in recent years, since it is only once we have a clear analysis that we can know which corrections and additions need to be made."
"What does the European Parliament want?"
"We want independence, we want comparability - and therefore minimum standards for collecting statistics, minimum standards for the institutional structure of the authorities and cooperation with the ECB."
"We want all actions to be able to be checked, which is why Eurostat must be able to carry out unannounced checks at any time."
"We want its powers to be extended because we want insight into all the data - including that at regional and municipal level and for social security."
"We want seamless cooperation, we want to strengthen the coordination function and we want the Commission to tell us before we conclude our report whether everything that has been agreed with the Council so far is sufficient."
"We do not think so."
"We are talking about a minimum declaration, catching up with what has not been done, taking the next step towards greater independence and more comprehensive powers."
"author. - Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is consistent and united in its view that Eurostat has to be strengthened and we have, for a long time, been in pursuit of establishing higher quality statistical data."
"We know the history as Mr Karas has already referred to it."
"In 2005, the Council brought shame on itself and sowed the seed of the current sovereign debt problems by weakening the Stability and Growth Pact and simultaneously denying audit powers to Eurostat."
"With that history, it takes time to regain trust, and lack of trust contributed to why, in the recent troubles, Member States had to put a lot of cash on the table."
"Words and political commitments by the Ecofin Council were not enough."
"Soon, we will at last have audit power for Eurostat, all the more important now because it is the key that can make other plans about economic surveillance effective."
"A tool to get a grip on an outturn is so much better than just a grip on promises."
"We want the quality of data to be improved, for it to be timely, and we want to be able to examine upstream input to national accounts, and we ask: is the new power given to Eurostat sufficient?"
"Even now, the Ecofin Council has added in some conditionality to the new auditing power, actually less restricting than many of us feared, but has it undermined the possibility for really early investigation and intervention?"
"The European Parliament's report favours unconditional rights for Eurostat to do so-called methodological visits."
"Of course, resources must be targeted where needed, but investigation needs to happen at the time of suspicion, not after the event."
"Finally, when will we know that like is truly compared with like?"
"What progress is being made to ensure that accounting procedures are standardised and sufficiently transparent to capture off-balance-sheet activity and any other innovative practices?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first thank Mr Karas, Ms Bowles and others for raising these very important issues concerning the quality of statistical data and Eurostat."
"Let me also welcome the support expressed in your draft opinion for the Commission proposal to amend the Regulation on the Application of the Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP)."
"Let me point out that this is the very first legislative proposal of Mr Barroso's second Commission in February."
"I am glad that it will soon be adopted, I trust, and we will then have it in our arsenal."
"We needed it a long time ago, as Ms Bowles said."
"The original proposal to this effect was made in 2005, but it was then rejected by the Member States."
"Times have changed and now we have broad support for this in the Council."
"As regards this proposal, the general approach agreed upon by the Ecofin Council on 8 June last week confirms the importance of ensuring high quality statistics on government debt and deficit and acknowledges the role of the Commission and Eurostat for that purpose."
"The regulation being finalised preserves the main objective of the proposal put forward by the Commission, namely, granting more audit powers to Eurostat when a significant risk or problem with the quality of data has been identified."
"The Commission can, therefore, accept the compromise text."
"The Commission intends to take several further steps with regard to strengthening the quality of European statistics for the EDP."
"There will be an immediate reinforcement of staff resources dealing with this work, mainly by internal redeployment within Eurostat."
"Member States will be visited more regularly than at present in the so-called EDP Dialogue Visits."
"The Commission will ensure the integration of more information on source data for compiling statistics into the EDP inventories foreseen by the regulation."
"Should there arise an exceptional case where significant risks or problems with respect to the quality of the data have been clearly identified, Eurostat will use all the relevant powers at its disposal under the new rules, including, of course, the audit powers."
"Before concluding, let me say a few words about Greece on some topical issues."
"I wish to use this opportunity and maybe take a minute more of your time."
"As is well known, the Commission has undertaken in-depth work on Greek statistics over several years."
"The amended regulation should, in future, better mitigate the risk of fraud or manipulation of statistics, or of any other kind of irregularity."
"Yesterday, there was a new development concerning Greece."
"You will know that Moody's decided to downgrade Greek bonds yesterday."
"I have discussed this also with my colleague Michel Barnier and the Commission President."
"I must say that the timing of Moody's decision is both surprising and highly unfortunate, coming after the agreement on a macro-economic adjustment programme between Greece and the Commission, the ECB and the IMF."
"The measures taken by the Greek Government illustrate their commitment to implement the strategy to reform the statistical system, to stabilise their public finances and to restore long-term sustainable economic growth."
"This decision of Moody's seems inconsistent with the evolution of Greek sovereign bond deals and CDS spreads, which have narrowed significantly since the agreement on the programme."
"This again raises issues relating to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system and prudential regulation."
"These issues and others will be taken into consideration in the Commission's thinking on the future of credit rating agencies."
"In particular, the Commission will look in the coming months at the issues of the level of competition in this sector - highly concentrated for the time being - as well as at the transparency regarding methodology and the conflict of interests, since the system remains based on the payer-issuer model."
"Let me conclude by saying that it is of absolute importance that we have accurate and reliable statistical data on national accounts."
"It is one of the cornerstones of a properly and effectively functioning economic and monetary union, as was underlined for instance by Mr Karas."
"Hence, this amendment on Eurostat's powers is part and parcel of reinforcing economic governance in Europe, which is indeed a necessary objective."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I am glad that the Commission has provided legislative proposals to bolster Eurostat that are currently being scrutinised by the ECON Committee."
"The quality of statistical governance lies at the heart of the crisis in the eurozone."
"There is no doubt in my mind that Eurostat should have wider powers, in particular, to make on-site inspections in Member States."
"But such inspections should not just be with officials from the Member State's Finance Ministry or with national statistical authorities or even with state-owned corporations: they should include, if the work deems these relevant, academic economists, trade unions, NGOs, etc."
"This is something which rating agencies, or even IMF delegations, do as a matter of fact."
"Secondly, we must have a common system of accounting - used by all Member States, based on a standardised and internationally accepted method of accounting, and agreed between the Member States, Commission and Parliament."
"This should not apply just to financial reports as provided to the Commission but they should also be used in the Member States' public sectors themselves."
"Over a decade after the creation of the eurozone and the introduction of the euro, we have discovered basic flaws in the system that are causing damage."
"These flaws we ignored, ironically, because of the false sense of security created by a successful euro."
"We must ensure that in the future, markets trust governments' economic forecasts and statistics."
"We must correct these flaws, and fast."
"I therefore urge the Commission to continue to work closely with Parliament and Council to resolve these problems as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the current crisis in the euro area cannot, of course, be attributed to the shortcomings of the common statistical system."
"Nonetheless, these shortcomings have had serious consequences."
"There are the economic consequences, and we have heard a great deal about them, but there are also consequences in terms of the credibility of the European Union."
"Here we are broaching what is, in my view, one of the major problems with the way in which the Union operates today."
"Governments make promises to their citizens, and rightly so; they say that mutual undertakings will be strictly monitored, that the criteria will be examined down to the very last decimal point - in the original German, that equates to drei komma null - but these very same governments have, year after year, refused to give Eurostat the resources it needs to do its job."
"All this is to the detriment of the common good, as anything that weakens the Commission weakens us all."
"That is why we wholeheartedly support this resolution, which calls for the Commission, Eurostat, to be granted investigative powers, and common standards to be strengthened."
"Without this effort to ensure rigour in the use and compilation of data, the promises of rigour will not be kept."
"Europeans will feel increasingly at sea and it will be the European Union that loses face."
"(DE) Mr President, the debate on enhanced powers for Eurostat does not really address the problem."
"We must never again find ourselves in a situation in which a Member State plays tricks with its budget data and lives beyond its means for years at the expense of others; where there are reasons to doubt data, the data must be verified."
"However, the EU must not use Greece and the current euro crisis as an excuse to completely remove powers of budgetary sovereignty from the Member States."
"Rather, the problem must be rooted out."
"The socio-economic structures of the Member States vary greatly in some instances."
"Even Eurostat, which juggles the figures for the EU, must realise this."
"An unemployed person in London is not the same as an unemployed person in Paris, because different criteria apply."
"The differences in socio-economic realities between the traditional hard currency and soft currency countries are even more striking."
"Eurostat must not maintain this myth of comparability at any price; rather, the comparability of the euro area countries must be fundamentally rethought."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by expressing my total satisfaction about the comment you made earlier about yesterday's sudden and unwarranted decision by the Moody's credit rating agency to downgrade Greece's credit rating, a decision which you called unfortunate and erroneous, thereby confirming that our decision to proceed with a radical review of the operating framework of these firms in European territory and to seriously examine the possibility of creating a public European credit rating agency was correct."
"As regards today's debate and the proposal to review the regulation on the quality of statistical data within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure, we all know that this follows on from the so-called 'Greek affair' in terms of false statistics."
"As a Greek MEP, I obviously do not feel happy that Greece is used as an example to avoid in such a debate."
"However, I wish to remind the House - as you did Commissioner - that Greece, the current Greek Government, was the first to recognise the problem and immediately took radical decisions to deal with it, first of all by converting the National Statistics Office into a fully independent authority supervised by Parliament and, secondly, by taking steps to set up an examining committee to investigate and apportion blame to those involved in this unacceptable procedure."
"Nonetheless, we must recognise that this debate is belated at European level, as there have been adequate statistics which should have galvanised us into action since 2005."
"(BG) I wish to steer the debate in a more practical direction because last week, the Commissioner declared that there will be a special audit carried out by Eurostat on the statistical data which the Commission has received from Bulgaria."
"Unfortunately, however, it was not clear from Mr Rehn's statement why such an audit was necessary."
"This is why I wish to take this opportunity now to ask him a question."
"Which criteria singled out the most stable Member State in the Balkans when all the other Member States in the Balkans are experiencing great difficulties?"
"What were these criteria which determined that an audit should be carried out specifically in Bulgaria?"
"Is this not also a sign of some inertia on your part, coming from your previous area of responsibility, enlargement?"
"You also just said that it is highly unfortunate that Moody's has downgraded Greece's credit rating."
"However, do you realise that by bandying about such statements in the public domain, Bulgaria's credit rating too may be downgraded next?"
"You cannot then get angry at Moody's. You will only have yourself to get angry at in that case."
"(SV) Mr President, there are simple measures that need to be taken to create economic stability within the EU."
"One of the simplest but, at the same time, important measures is to increase the quality of the economic statistics."
"In this area, it is perfectly possible to achieve significant improvements relatively quickly."
"I therefore welcome the positive signals sent out by both the Commission and the Council."
"My hope is that it will be possible to quickly reach agreement on effective packages of measures that will take the quality of the statistics to a higher level."
"I believe that we need to strengthen the role and powers of Eurostat."
"Eurostat must also continue to cooperate with the national producers of statistics, but the hierarchy and levels of decision making need to be made clearer."
"Eurostat must be able to demand to see correct national data and must be able to make use of both sanctions and special inspections if the quality is not good enough."
"Greater resources are needed if the statistics are to improve."
"It is important for us to realise that higher quality requires greater investment in this regard."
"We need to establish a plan for Eurostat."
"Its capacity must be increased and we need to ensure that the budget provides room for this increase in capacity."
"I am concerned that so far, the statistics have not been a priority within this area in the ongoing decision-making discussions."
"I hope that we will see this increased investment."
"(DE) Mr President, we are all aware that the amendment of the regulation as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure is a particularly important and urgent measure in view of the present problems in most of the national budgets of the Member States."
"Without precise, clear data, it is difficult to decide on and establish further measures."
"To this extent, a control mechanism needs to be put in place that allows the data submitted by the national authorities to be verified in good time."
"In any event, we must never again find ourselves in a situation - such as we did with Greece - in which it is only in retrospect that it becomes apparent that decisions with wide-ranging implications were taken on the basis of incorrect or falsified data."
"We must also consider penalties for those states that deliberately communicate incorrect data or statistics."
"The enhancement of Eurostat and its expansion into an independent authority should therefore be considered in any event."
"This is not interfering with the budgetary sovereignty of the Member States at all, but rather is about having effective checks on data."
"(FI) Mr President, I think the Commission should be thanked for making such speedy headway with regard to these issues."
"Only a few months ago, for example, looking into a country's statistical data was felt to be an intrusion with regard to national sovereignty."
"At the time, it was considered to be virtually impossible and now we have obviously come a long way."
"It is excellent that Eurostat's powers are to be increased."
"Europe would have drifted into a sort of moral crisis, if people had, as it were, merely noticed out of the corner of their eye that the statistics were being distorted."
"I agree with my colleague, Mrs Podimata, that people should now stop ridiculing Greece in this way."
"Greece should be respected for taking some very tough decisions."
"The people there should also have better access than before to statistical data and general information on the economy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you for a very substantive debate and your support for this proposal to reinforce Eurostat's powers."
"I must say that I agree with Mrs Jaakonsaari that we have seen a sea change - a real cultural change - as regards the attitudes concerning economic policy coordination in Europe in recent months."
"The adoption of this proposal is one of the cornerstones of our efforts to reinforce our economic and monetary union."
"There were several points made concerning Greece and Bulgaria, and I would like to clarify and respond to some of the issues that were discussed today."
"On Greece, I will not go into the whole long history of this saga."
"I agree with those who say that it is not fair to continue this 'Greece bashing', because Greece is now on track and its programme is being implemented effectively."
"Greece deserves credit and support, not 'bashing'."
"As regards the statistical reforms, we are working together with the Greek authorities."
"We have made numerous visits in the course of this winter and spring and have recently agreed on an action plan which aims at enhancing the capacity of the Greek statistical system and improving Greece's public finance statistics."
"On Bulgaria, our concerns relate mostly to two aspects of the budgetary forecast."
"I trust that at least the Bulgarian Members of the European Parliament are listening to my clarifications concerning Bulgaria's excessive deficit procedure and statistical problems."
"First, the Commission was only belatedly informed by Bulgaria about the sizeable revisions in the budgetary outlook, in violation of treaty obligations."
"Secondly, we lack information on why Bulgaria revised its planned budget for 2010 from a balanced budget to a deficit of 3.8% within just a few weeks, even though the macro-economic scenario remained unchanged or even improved."
"Consequently, the Commission is currently not in a position to undertake an assessment of the Bulgarian budgetary plans for this year."
"The planned mission by Eurostat to Bulgaria foreseen for the second half of this year will not address the differences and questions concerning the 2010 outlook."
"This is not a statistical issue."
"Instead, Eurostat will focus on potential risks to past data on the excessive deficit procedure for the year 2009 relating to previously undeclared government contractual commitments."
"I am very grateful for this attention to these important issues, which may have also some implications concerning Bulgaria's standing in the markets."
"According to the information obtained from the Bulgarian authorities, the conclusion of their internal budget audits will only be completed by mid-summer."
"The outcome of such audits will be used by Eurostat in the context of the planned EDP visit to Bulgaria."
"Depending on the speed of the adoption of the revised regulation, which grants stronger powers to Eurostat, Eurostat may draw on these powers, as necessary, in its work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again, thank you for your attention and especially for your broad and strong support for our proposal, which is the very first legislative proposal of the second Barroso Commission."
"Indeed, its adoption is essential for the effective functioning of economic and monetary union."
"Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you also for your generous comments about us; we did not listen to them carefully enough."
"I find it regrettable when a person is speaking in this House and there are demonstrations, such as rounds of applause, which have nothing to do with the subject matter and the speech being made during our debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 June 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) The European Parliament must take a stand on a very important issue in today's debate, namely, the direction the statistical information system currently operating under the authority of Eurostat should take in order to avoid situations similar to the Greek scandal in the future."
"Let me remind you that the fraud perpetrated by the Greek authorities had already come to light in 2004, and around the same time, the Socialist-led Hungarian Government's finances were shady as well."
"Despite this, the EU has still not taken any steps to reform the statistical information system."
"Although I believe that the Commission's plan to grant audit rights to Eurostat is a step in the right direction, I am convinced that we will have to do more, as the future of the common currency is now at stake."
"What do I think we should do next?"
"In my opinion, in excessive deficit procedures, sanctions should not only be imposed on Member States repeatedly failing to comply with their obligation to meet the 3% Maastricht budget deficit criterion, but also on those who have provided false statistical data for years, misleading investors and the EU and jeopardising the stability of the euro area."
"I agree with the approach of making the officers of national statistical offices personally responsible for the quality of data provided to Eurostat."
"This is why I propose that, taking into account the work being done by the Council's working group under the direction of Herman Van Rompuy, we ask the Commission to work out a more stringent system of sanctions to replace the one currently in place."

"Election of a Vice-President of the European Parliament (vote)"
"We now come to the election of a Vice-President of the European Parliament pursuant to Rules 13, 15 and 18 of our Rules of Procedure."
"As you know, one of our fellow Members, who was the 11th Vice-President, has been elected to his national parliament and is serving as President of that parliament."
"I am referring to Mr Schmitt. Today, we are choosing a new Vice-President to take his place."
"I have received the following nomination: Mr László Tőkés."
"The candidate has informed me officially that he consents to the nomination."
"In view of the fact that there is only one candidate, I propose that he be elected by acclamation, pursuant to Rule 13(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to ask you if anyone is opposed to this?"
"In accordance with this Rule, I am obliged to do this."
"Mr President, today is the first time I am ashamed to be a Member of the European Parliament."
"It is the first time that a man who denies the peace treaty of Trianon signed after the First World War is promoted and voted for such a great position in Europe."
"The Romanian people ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"You do not agree with this choice, so we will take a formal vote."
"We will vote by means of the electronic system."
"(DE) Mr President, we were told that the candidate wished to make a statement first."
"Perhaps we have been misinformed, but if the candidate wishes to make a statement, then you should give him the floor."
"Mr President, I have prepared a short statement for today, which I should like to read."
"It is a great honour for me to be nominated Vice-President of the European Parliament with the support of the European People's Party."
"It was a similar honour to receive the highest state decoration of Romania, the Order of the Star, in December 2009, at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the fall of Communist dictatorship in Romania."
"Twenty years ago in Timişoara, people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs, united by understanding and courage and facing and running the same risks together, rose up against the Ceauşescu regime."
"In the same way as back then, I continue my efforts today to represent my country's interests in the spirit of the fight for human, minority and religious rights and for freedom, while remaining committed to European and Christian values."
"I am committed to furthering the European integration of former Communist countries and nations in the Eastern and Central European region, in particular, that of the Hungarian minority community in Romania that I represent as a member of the European People's Party."
"It fills me with joy to be a Member of the European Parliament in the period following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks a new beginning in the history of a United Europe. Thank you for your attention."
"(Applause)"
"We are going to vote electronically."
"After I declare the vote open, the following information will be displayed on the screen: the subject of the vote and the name of the candidate."
"To vote for the candidate, you should press the '+' button."
"Of course, you can also abstain from voting - that is the '0' button, as you know."
"So everything is straightforward."
"Pursuant to Rule 15 of the Rules of Procedure, a candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes cast shall be elected, which means that only votes in favour are taken into consideration."
"(FR) Mr President, forgive me, perhaps I am the only person in this Chamber who does not know what is going on, but I really do not know how we are supposed to vote."
"There is a zero, a number one and a cross."
"Quite frankly, I do not know how to vote in favour or against or abstain."
"It would be helpful if it could be properly explained."
"(DE) Mr President, in all modesty, I would like to ask you a question."
"You have a large number of highly paid colleagues up there who I am sure will be able to give you some assistance in answering the following question."
"On my screen, I have the name Tőkés."
"My machine then has three buttons that are to be pressed for roll-call votes."
"The first button is for 'Yes', the middle button is for 'Abstention' and the third button is for 'No'."
"Is that correct?"
"(Heckling in agreement)"
"Does that mean that those who want to vote for Mr Tőkés press the 'Yes' button, those that do not want to vote for him press the 'No' button and those who wish to abstain - such as my group - press the 'Abstention' button?"
"Is that right?"
"(Applause)"
"That is exactly what I said a moment ago."
"Those who want to vote 'yes' press the 'yes' button, those who want to vote 'no' press the 'no' button, and those who wish to abstain from voting press '0'."
"(FR) Mr President, please excuse me but I am speaking again following the question asked by Mr Schulz and your very clear reply, which, however, is contrary to what I am told by Parliament's services."
"Parliament's services have just told me that I can vote in favour or abstain, but that I cannot vote against."
"So it is not at all clear."
"I am sorry to intervene like this, but can we please try to be consistent."
"I would be grateful if you could give me a clear answer, Mr President."
"The clear answer is that in this vote, we are reacting only to votes in favour."
"Votes against and abstentions are counted together, because only the number of 'yes' votes is important."
"The matter is clear."
"If we press the 'no' button or the 'abstain' button, the effect will be the same."
"Now I will answer three more questions."
"(EL) Mr President, I believe that we have blatantly infringed the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament."
"This approach is unacceptable; it is unacceptable for no record to be taken of who voted for, who against, and who abstained."
"We can see from how the buttons operate that the votes against are not recorded."
"You must give instructions for the vote to be clearly recorded, for who voted for, who against, and who abstained to be recorded."
"Mr President, it is surely not beyond the wit of intelligent people to understand that we want to vote for, against or abstain, as we do normally."
"Can you not arrange it?"
"If you cannot, then we cannot take this vote."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to make a technical observation."
"On our machines, you have to press 'Yes' first, then when you go to 'No', it is still blue."
"If you want to display 'No', nothing is displayed."
"In other words, you can only get to 'No' via 'Yes', which is not a fitting technical solution."
"(DE) Mr President, let us approach this whole process rather more calmly."
"Usually, the Vice-Presidents of Parliament are elected in a block at the start of the legislative period or in the course of the legislative period."
"When we do that, fellow Members, we only ever find out the number of 'Yes' votes cast for a candidate - which also decides the order in which Members are elected to the Bureau."
"Now, because a Member has left, we are voting in one more Vice-President today - so the only important thing is whether he has received the number of 'Yes' votes required for election."
"Anything else makes no difference."
"It is different to other votes."
"(Applause)"
"The President of Parliament has given a perfect description of the secret ballot, and it worked beautifully for me without my having to press various buttons."
"I pressed the button that I wanted to press and the blue light appeared."
"Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"I declare the vote open."
"(By electronic vote (Members voting: 621; in favour: 334; blank papers: 287), Parliament elected László Tőkés)"
"Our Vice-President has obtained a qualified majority."
"I would like to congratulate our fellow Member, Mr Tőkés, on obtaining a result which qualifies him to be Vice-President of Parliament, and I wish him success in performing his duties."
"Mr Tőkés will hold 11th place in the order of precedence of vice-presidents."
"(RO) My card did not work."
"I am voting against."
"Mr President, I hate to have to prolong this further."
"What you said in your instructions was that people could either vote in favour or abstain."
"The final results show, however, 'in favour', 'abstentions' and 'against'."
"I understand that there may be many people who would have voted differently if they had known they had the choice of the three."
"What I would like to ask is, if indeed this is the correct way to do it, to do it one last time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will hear all your reservations about the vote in a special procedure after the vote."
"We are not going to decide this matter here and now."
"In accordance with the outcome of the vote, which we achieved by a qualified majority, we have elected Mr Tőkés."
"All your reservations will be given consideration."
"Please notify them to me by the end of today. We will make a decision on this matter tomorrow."
"I will give you a direct answer to your reservations."
"Thank you very much."
"(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to let you know that according to the previous vote, we have 789 Members in this Chamber."
"That is a bit on the high side."
"I hope that future votes will not again suggest we have 789 Members."
"If there is anything to add at the end of the vote, I will bring it to you."
"Mr President, Mr Swoboda's point is an entirely valid one."
"My good friend, Mr Malcolm Harbour, has done the sums and, if it is the case that more people have voted than are actually present - indeed 785, or maybe even 789 - then surely this vote cannot stand."
"(Applause)"
"What we must do is consider - and I urge you to take this to the Bureau immediately after you have left the Chair - that we must have another vote tomorrow, preferably either with a paper ballot or at least with the system working properly."
"As I said, I will try and get back to you before the end of this voting period."
"There does appear to be a discrepancy."
"Mr Swoboda has raised it, Sir Robert Atkins has recorded it as well."
"We will try and get some information to you as soon as possible."
"I really do not want to prolong this."
"There is an issue; it needs to be looked at, it is being looked at, and I will get back to you as soon as possible."

"European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: ES/Region of Valencia ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current context of economic crisis, one of the biggest problems that advanced economies are having to face is precisely that of unemployment, a threat that has reached the alarming level of 10% of the euro area."
"The European institutions and, above all, the European Commission, in its draft budget for 2011, have introduced a series of measures to support the economic recovery, including supplementing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for which I am rapporteur, and which is being called upon for four important mobilisation requests, on which we are about to vote."
"I therefore believe that the procedures for mobilising this fund should be streamlined, in order to respond quickly to workers whose companies have been hit by the economic crisis and who have been affected by their companies' relocation processes."
"I therefore urge my fellow Members to promote this fund within the individual Member States."

"Transparency in regional policy and its funding ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the incentive for this report on transparency in regional policy and its funding was the fact that the full disclosure of EU fund recipients enables public participation in a meaningful debate on how European public money is spent. This is necessary for the functioning of democracy at European level."
"This report, which was allocated to me by the Committee on Regional Development, contains recommendations which should be included in future regulations on the Structural Funds, such as the provision of additional information needed when publishing lists of recipients and sufficiently binding rules for partnership."
"Other proposals which can be implemented within the framework of current cohesion programmes are, for example:"
"the definition by the Commission of a more detailed and prescriptive format specifying the structure, form and content of the information to be provided;"
"also, linking the European transparency initiative with the new financial controls and auditing;"
"a tougher line by auditors on communication and information requirements, including 'naming and shaming' and the use of financial corrections in confirmed cases of fraud;"
"closer involvement of regional and local authorities and other relevant partners in all the phases of cohesion programming and implementation and full access for them to all project documentation;"
"more guidance from the Commission on how to put the partnership clause into practice under current programmes and improving transparency in respect of EU funding of major projects."
"I should like once again to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for this final text which we were able to achieve."
"7."
"EU financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010) ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I know colleagues do not like people speaking at this particular time, but I beg their indulgence for a few short minutes."
"Firstly, because this was not debated in the House, it is important that something should be said about it, particularly because of the part played by the European Union International Fund for Ireland."
"Secondly, most people in Ireland - and beyond Ireland - think this fund was largely funded by the USA."
"Of course, the USA played a huge part - and I would like to thank them for that - as did Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but it is important to point out that, in the period 2006 onwards, the European Union is actually funding 57% of the Fund."
"That is not something that is widely known and, of course, having no debate on it here in Parliament meant that we kept it a secret."
"So I would like to highlight the part played by the European Union in helping to create contact, dialogue and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, which thankfully, though still fragile as a peace process, is still holding."
"I would like to pay tribute today to all the people who contributed to peace in Northern Ireland - there are so many - and particularly, I suppose, on the extremes."
"Parties like Dr Ian Paisley's party - he was a member of this House for many years - and Gerry Adams' party, who would never have been seen to come together 20 years ago, have come together in the peace process and power sharing."
"The European Union must take credit for this - at least its due share - and I want to highlight that today."
"I would like to pay tribute to all those who have taken risks for peace in Northern Ireland, and I hope that peace will continue."
"(GA) I hope that this resolution will be passed unanimously, and I applaud each person involved for the part they played in the peace process in my own country."
"(IT) Mr President, I have noticed that, between the election of the Vice-President and these last few votes, 150 Members have disappeared."
"I do not know whether their disappearance is due to a stomach upset or a problem with the air conditioning."
"Perhaps we ought to investigate."
"No, they did not disappear."
"We will give you a very clear explanation of what happened on the vote for Pastor Tőkés, but it was not divine intervention."

"- After the vote:"
"Mr President, sorry to be a pain yet again but there is actually a fourth roll-call vote over the page."
"I am told that a new version of the voting list was issued, so that presumably was ruled out of order."
"We have therefore completed the vote on the Marinescu report."
"9."
"Adaptation of the Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon ("
"- Before the vote:"
"(FR) Mr President, I see that unlike President Buzek, you do not suffer from poor lateral vision and you were able to see me."
"Mr President, I have a very short point of order."
"Mr Martin's report is intended to sort out problems concerning adaptation to the Treaty of Lisbon, but among the different amendments that we are required to vote on, there is one that is not related in any way to the Treaty of Lisbon and, as I see it, goes against the general principles of Parliamentary procedure."
"It is the amendment that deprives non-attached Members of the power to appoint their own representatives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very serious matter regardless of your political opinions."
"To hand responsibility over to the President of Parliament, however impartial he may be, for selecting a Member to represent the non-attached Members at the Conference of Presidents, based on goodness only knows what criteria, instead of to the non-attached Members themselves, I truly think goes against the general principles of law and against the case-law of the European Court of Justice."
"For this reason, Mr President, I consider that this amendment should be withdrawn from the list of amendments we are voting on today."
"Thank you, Mr Gollnisch."
"You may recall that for several months I sat as a non-attached Member and, if I may say so, my political views are so divergent from yours that it merely proves the point that the non-attached section is not a group, and never can be."
"- At the end of the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I do not want to delay the House, but before we conclude this item, there are two technical points to be dealt with."
"As you know, this process started last November."
"We need to add a new citation to link last November's vote with this vote, and I would ask the House to agree that we add the words 'having regard to its decision of 25 November 2009 on the adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the Lisbon Treaty'."
"This is just, as I said, a technical point."
"The second such point is that we currently say that these rules should come into force on 1 December 2009."
"Clearly, that is not possible, and therefore I ask that we apply the normal Rule 212(3), which means that the rules would come into force on the first day of the next part-session."
"Mr Martin, thank you for all your work on this and other things."

"Colleagues, for those who would like to listen to the explanation about the Tőkés vote:"
"Members voting: 621 - which is votes in favour and abstentions; votes cast in favour: 334; abstentions: 287, but they are not counted as votes cast."
"The absolute majority is 168."
"Mr Tőkés obtained 334 votes, more than the absolute majority of 168."
"The electronic voting system is used as an alternative to a vote with ballot papers."
"On a ballot paper for an election, voters can only vote in favour of a candidate or a fixed number of candidates."
"There is never any possibility of voting against, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt explained."
"Voters not wishing to vote in favour leave the ballot paper blank."
"Therefore, I welcome Pastor Tőkés to the Bureau."
"Mr President, just to understand, what you are telling us is that, for the vote on a Vice-President, it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority, because, if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention, and if abstentions do not count towards the total vote, then by definition, you always get a qualified majority."
"Is that what you are saying?"
"As you recall, Mr Lambrinidis, at the beginning of this Parliament, there were in fact three ballots in order to elect all the Vice-Presidents on a qualified majority, so that was the procedure we followed on that occasion."
"On this occasion, there was only one candidate and, given that he received more than 168 votes, he got more than the qualified majority and is therefore elected on a single vote."
"This procedure is an unusual one, but we have followed the rules."
"(FR) Mr President, you may have been following the rules, but when I add 334 votes in favour, 168 abstentions and 287 people who voted against, I get 789 Members, in other words, more Members than there are in the House."
"This means that there has been ballot box stuffing, as there was in Corsica's election."
"This is clearly a rigged vote and there ought to be a re-vote."
"Mr Goebbels, the answer to your question is that there has been a misunderstanding by a number of Members that on the screen, the absolute majority was put up as if it were a score."
"It was not."
"It was an indication of the absolute majority."
"It should not be added to the total number of votes."
"I repeat. Mr Tőkés got 334 votes."
"It is more than the qualified majority."
"He therefore is elected."
"I should make it very clear that the 168 figure was not 168 votes."
"It was an indication of the number, the threshold needed, to win his position as Vice-President."
"I am sorry for the misunderstanding."
"Perhaps we could have made it clearer at the time."
"Mr President, I do not want to enter into details."
"I just want to remind you that the chairman of the meeting and the President of Parliament informed us that those who were going to abstain and those who were going to vote against were going to be doing the same thing."
"This announcement was, of course, misleading, but, nevertheless, since the announcement came from the chair of the meeting, it was a valid announcement and, therefore, I think that the vote should be repeated based on the clarification you have just given to us."
"I am convinced that if the vote was taken again, the result would be the same."
"I do believe that people understood that they were voting as in a normal electronic vote - the buttons meant the same thing; the result was clear."
"What was not clear was the placing on the board of the figure 168, which has caused some confusion."
"If there was any misunderstanding, the President himself can make clear what he was saying when he next appears before you."
"(PL) My name is Senyszyn."
"These explanations are, nevertheless, absolutely unsatisfactory, taking into account the fact that before the vote, we were told that votes against and abstentions would be counted together, which is in accordance with the requirement for a qualified majority."
"After all, what do we mean by a 'qualified majority'?"
"It means there must be more votes in favour than the sum of votes against and abstentions."
"In this case, there is no clarity at all as to what the result of the vote was."
"Mr Buzek said there were 334 votes in favour, 287 votes against and 168 abstentions."
"In relation to this, it does indeed look as if 789 people voted, and now the explanations that some votes do not count may mean that it is some of the 334 votes in favour which do not count."
"This is an absolutely unacceptable situation, in the context of the definition in most countries."
"I do not think that in our Parliament, it should happen to be different."
"'Qualified majority' or 'absolute majority' means more votes in favour than votes against and abstentions."
"In this instance this situation did not exist at all, because an erroneous number of votes were cast."
"This means the voting machine was not working properly and the vote absolutely must be taken again."
"Mr President, if you will indulge me, I actually have two points of order."
"The first is on the vice-presidential vote."
"There is no way that this can be a safe vote."
"We were misled as to the instructions."
"In this row here, we attempted to vote negatively, and the machines would not allow us to do so."
"We tried to raise points of order, which were not taken at the time, so I would call for a recall of this vote by a paper vote or a straightforward, yes/abstain/no vote with the results firmly displayed."
"From those like me who are critical of this institution: actually, thank you very much - this is an open goal for you, and we will make much criticism of this, thank you very much!"
"My second criticism is on a refusal to allow me an explanation of vote on the Tremopoulos report."
"This was a roll-call vote on transparency and I voted against this."
"Now I am not being allowed an opportunity to explain why I voted against it, but my electorate will see that I voted against transparency."
"I want to give an explanation as to why I voted against this report."
"May I please beg an explanation of vote on this."
"On the first point, the staff were here present, as was the President, who chaired the vote."
"If there are any issues that arose out of the handling of that, they will be dealt with."
"On the second point, on a simplified procedure, there are no debates, there is no explanation of vote, but, Ms Sinclaire, you can put it in writing, so please avail yourself of that opportunity."
"(FR) Mr President, I heard you and I paid close attention to what you said."
"You said that 168 was the threshold for a qualified majority."
"This is what I heard, or in any case this is what the translation said."
"I find this quite incredible because if this is the case, we would somehow be taking half the number of those who voted in favour to be the voting threshold."
"So whatever happens, there will always be a qualified majority."
"That is obvious."
"This is the first time I have heard that 168 votes is a qualified majority in this Parliament."
"Perhaps I misunderstood what you said, but this whole procedure seems to me to be utterly absurd."
"It may be suitable for an election where there are several candidates, but certainly not for renewing a Vice-President's mandate."
"The figure of 168 was calculated by the computer, on the basis of the votes actually cast, as a majority."
"Look, I never passed a maths exam in my life so I am going to stop here!"
"Mr President, it is exactly on this point that I agree with Mr Gollnisch for once, though I hope for the first and last time."
"The fact is that with 621 Members voting, the majority needed to be at least 311."
"I am very glad of the result because our candidate had 334, so he was elected in any case, but I beg you to correct this because if this program is in the computer, it is definitely mathematically wrong."
"We have noted that point."
"(DE) Mr President, it was not possible for me to vote 'No' in the vote because the voting machine only displayed something once I had pressed the 'Yes' button followed by the 'Abstention' button."
"Please would you check once again how the machine is collecting and counting the votes, because in my opinion, it was not conclusive."
"I was not the only one who found this; a number of other Members had the same experience."
"They were unable to press the 'Abstention' button or the 'No' button, but instead had to vote 'Yes' first."
"It makes this voting process rather hazardous."
"Please would you therefore check again how the votes were counted."
"Something tells me that we will never use this system again."
"We will use paper in future!"
"Mr President, I would suggest to those who are left in the House that we should refrain from further debate on this."
"It is abundantly clear that there were 621 votes."
"The Vice-President got 334."
"It is a majority; let us move on."
"If the general public throughout the 27 countries are watching, they will have very little respect for this House."
"There are bigger issues than this, such as high unemployment."
"Let us debate the issues which are important and not waste time debating this further."
"I accept your explanation, Mr President;"
"I accept the explanation of the President."
"So move on and deal with issues which are important."
"(NL) Mr President, I propose that you email the explanation you have given, which I found clear, to all MEPs, as I regret that a large number of the MEPs who are always getting worked up about transparency, clarity and democracy have sped off to lunch."
"Perhaps they will find it clear if you have it emailed it to them."
"That is a decision for the President, but I shall certainly make that suggestion to him."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, our plenary sessions are public and this gives a very poor impression."
"I would like to add my voice to what has been said."
"I am not asking for an email; instead I would actually like it to be officially presented and explained on Parliament's website, because one statement at least must be incorrect."
"168 cannot have been the threshold."
"If 621 votes were cast, then the threshold must have been 310 - if I have understood things correctly."
"I would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it."
"In view of the large number of people who were watching, we have really given an extremely poor public impression."
"(RO) Given that President Buzek's explanations about the voting procedure were confusing and contradictory and that some voting machines failed to work, I think that repeating the vote would provide transparency and a legitimate result."
"As one of my fellow Members mentioned, we are being watched by citizens from 27 countries."
"I think that we must demonstrate transparency and integrity to those who elected us."
"It is regrettable that, just as a huge number of MEPs are disputing the way in which the voting process was conducted, the proposal to repeat the vote under normal conditions has been rejected, which shows a lack of fair treatment for all MEPs."
"This is why your conviction, the President's conviction and the conviction of the fellow Members who asserted that these votes were received must be the conviction of all of us, the conviction of every member of the European Union."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I was extremely pleased, but not surprised, at the overwhelming vote in favour, which has been consistent throughout the debates on the International Fund for Ireland."
"Of course, the EU is one of the main contributors to the IFI's inception in 1986, when it was established by the London and Dublin governments to promote economic and social development in the 12 counties on both sides of the border."
"(GA) More than EUR 800 million in contributions have been paid into the fund, and when the multiplier effect is taken into account, this equates to an investment in excess of EUR 2 billion."
"I am from a border county myself and I am a representative of the border region and, as such, I have a very good understanding of the part the International Fund for Ireland played in the peace process."
"More than 40 000 direct jobs and 16 000 indirect jobs have been created with the help of the International Fund and it has created employment opportunities in an economically disadvantaged region."
"In conclusion, while a sunset strategy has been agreed to take the work of the IFI to the end of this year, I do believe that every consideration should be given to prolonging this worthwhile and effective programme. Thank you for your indulgence."
"(ES) Mr President, I voted for this initiative because its main goal is to continue supporting the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland and Ireland's border areas, in order to build bridges of reconciliation and communication between the most divided communities and to continue, as Europeans, defending values and human rights."
"We in Euskadi - the Basque country - are still suffering from terrorist violence and we are waiting for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) to hear the cry of Basque society, which is tired of suffering and is asking for it to renounce violence once and for all."
"We are awaiting a definitive ceasefire declaration."
"Under these circumstances, I expect from the European Union the same solidarity and wholehearted support for Euskadi to build the peace and reconciliation that we are longing for."
"Mr President, no country has been so disadvantaged by the bail-outs as Ireland, and no people has been so hard done by as the Irish."
"The Irish Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan, made all the right decisions."
"Every Irish public servant from the Taoiseach to the lowest civil servant, and even the recipients of unemployment benefit, have tightened their belts and taken huge cuts in income."
"Now they find that, if they had made none of those painful decisions - if they had just carried on spending - they might have qualified, like the Greeks, for a bail-out of their own and, worse than that, they discover that they are obliged to participate in rescuing Greece."
"In fact, not only that, but they discover that in per capita terms, Ireland is making a greater contribution than most of the other eurozone members."
"Every orthodox economist would suggest that what we need to do at a time like this is to allow some of the eurozone economies to print their own currencies again, to devalue, to buy themselves time to price themselves back into the market."
"Instead, we are condemning the peoples of southern Europe to years of poverty and deflation and loading the taxpayers of northern Europe with an enormous debt, all in order to save a few faces."
"Surely we have the most expensive faces since that of Helen of Troy, which launched a thousand ships!"
"Mr President, it was not my intention to make an explanation of vote on this particular issue, but during his speech, the rapporteur referred only to Dr Paisley and Mr Adams, saying that they brought the peace to Northern Ireland."
"Well, Mr Adams and Dr Paisley may have brought a lot of things but peace they never brought."
"A lot of people may claim peace in Northern Ireland but it was really David Trimble and John Hume who bore the brunt of the heavy lifting to bring the peace to Northern Ireland, and I hope the rapporteur will get his facts right in the future."
"They did all the heavy lifting in the past."
"Let me make it clear that I voted in favour of this today because I believe that in Northern Ireland today, we still need support to maintain what has been achieved."
"It is by no means sure that the peace will last as there are those on both sides - and we have seen them coming forward recently - who are still trying to de-establish what has been achieved."
"(PL) Mr President, I was among the 334 Members of the European Parliament who endorsed Pastor Tőkés for the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament."
"He is a hero of my younger days."
"As a journalist for Solidarity in 1989 and under fire from the criminal Securitate security service of Ceauşescu, I reported on the Romanian revolution, and that revolution started in Timişoara with a speech made by Mr Tőkés on 16 December 1989."
"However, it grieves me that today, he has been the victim, first of a computer error which wrongly counted 168 votes, and that then those 168 votes were added by the person chairing the proceedings to the overall total, which has been the cause of general controversy."
"Therefore, if people are going to call into question the legality of Mr Tőkés' election as Vice-President of the European Parliament, then I am in favour of taking the vote again."
"I am certain his result will be even better."
"The mandate of such a distinguished person in the European Parliament must not be questioned by anyone."
"So I think that it is in the interest of Mr Tőkés himself, if anyone is going to raise doubts, to repeat the vote."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Marinescu - whom I should like to take this opportunity to thank - because I believe that state-of-the-art, efficient freight transport is a fundamental requirement, not only for the competitiveness, but also for the very survival of European businesses."
"Moreover, I fully support the rapporteur's wish to reintroduce certain passages of the text that this Parliament itself approved at first reading."
"Mr President, when we began our votes today, we came across a procedure that we had never really encountered in this House before - one whereby only 'yes' votes were registered."
"I put it to you, Mr President, that it was only a matter of time."
"This is, of course, precisely the approach that the EU has taken in successive referendums."
"The European Constitution or Lisbon Treaty was continuously rejected in the polls, by 54% of French voters, by 62% of Dutch voters, by 53% of Irish voters, and the reaction on each occasion was to go ahead regardless, to disregard what objections people had made, to hear only 'yes' where people had voiced their opposition."
"Now we have enshrined or regularised that approach in the procedures of this House."
"We have made it impossible for people to register their dissent from the project."
"I am tempted to adapt that old slogan: what part of 'no' do you not understand?"
"Mr President, in looking at this report today about the procedure and the adaptation of procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon, it is interesting that we speak to many Members of the Parliament themselves and they do not really know what is actually in the Treaty of Lisbon and how it impacts on our voters in everyday life."
"Take, for example, the whole bail-out of Greece."
"If you look at what has been debated in Council, it is Article 122 of the Lisbon Treaty, which was supposed to be an article of solidarity: 'In the spirit of solidarity if a Member State falls into difficulties in the supply of certain products such as in the area of energy or where a Member State is in difficulty or threatened with severe difficulties due to natural disasters'."
"That is now being used as an excuse for Member States, whether they are members of the eurozone or not, to bail out a country that has got itself into a mess of its own making and not because of exceptional circumstances."
"We should be quite clear with the electorate what the Lisbon Treaty means for the voters."
"Does it mean taking taxpayers' money to bail out countries that cannot manage their own affairs?"
"(FR) Mr President, this Parliament has a particular talent when it comes to reforms of the Rules of Procedure, which are always designed to diminish the rights of the minority, or underdogs, Untermenschen, that we are to some extent."
"For the past year, we have been riding roughshod over the rule that, under the terms of Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure, allows non-attached Members to appoint their own representative."
"In a remark which was - I am sorry - one of the most stupid remarks that I have ever heard during my parliamentary career, you have just stated, Mr President, that this could not be done because you were not of the same political persuasion as me."
"It is true, I am non-attached as a matter of principle, whereas you were only non-attached because you were betrayed by your friends."
"However, at least there was one way, Mr President, of solving this dispute and that was by voting."
"A vote is the usual procedure in a democracy."
"But no, now the non-attached Members' representatives will be chosen by the President of Parliament."
"This is yet another farce."
"It was indeed Mr Martin who concocted the idea and planned this, together with the representatives of the two main groups."
"Moreover, it reminds me of the previous amendments to the Rules of Procedure that Mr Corbett was behind, though he has now faded into obscurity and was fortunately defeated in the European Parliament elections by my friend, Nick Griffin."
"(NL) Mr President, Amendment 86 in the Martin report stipulates that the representative of the non-attached Members at the Conference of Presidents be decided not by the non-attached Members themselves but by the President of Parliament."
"The reason given is a lack of consensus among the non-attached Members."
"I ask myself what the problem is."
"Likewise, there is no consensus in this House itself when the President of Parliament is elected, which is precisely why we hold a democratic election."
"The representative of the non-attached Members must be representative and therefore, the best thing is to organise an election."
"The European Parliament is starting to show itself up somewhat as a kind of Mickey Mouse parliament where the President of the House himself decides who is representative of some of his opponents."
"I also wonder about the basis for this decision."
"Is it based on representativeness?"
"Is it based on a personal liking for or friendship with a particular non-attached Member?"
"What criteria will the President be using to decide on the representative of the non-attached Members?"
"I should have liked the President to make a statement on this before the vote but, unfortunately, we were not entitled to hear one."
"(SK) Mr President, with all due respect to you and to this institution, the debate on the adaptation of the Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon should also include a mention of the shortcoming in the Rules of Procedure which has made it possible to have a vote such as this and an outcome such as the election of Mr Tőkés to the role of Vice-President."
"I cannot understand how the Presidents can issue a disputed vote, and therefore the disputed outcome of a vote, and I sympathise with all of my fellow Members who have doubts as to whether their votes were correctly counted."
"From this perspective, I believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should act transparently and clearly, and as long as some Members feel that their votes have been treated by the voting equipment differently to the way they voted, and they did not have the possibility to check it on their monitors, then the vote will continue to be controversial."
"From this perspective, I believe that it is in the interests of Mr Tőkés, and in the interests of the credibility of the European Parliament, to actually return to this vote and to vote again, so that there can be no doubt in the future concerning the election of the Vice-President of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the cancer from Greece is metastasising across the Mediterranean."
"We read this week that the European Commission is preparing to bail out Spain, and the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, frankly admits that in this event, the EUR 750 billion already set aside in the emergency bail-out fund would be wholly inadequate."
"As the tumour spreads, rather than contemplating amputation, our leaders have decided on a lengthy course of chemotherapy which will be expensive and painful and of uncertain outcome."
"What I mean by that is that they will try to create the machinery of what Mr Van Rompuy calls economic governance and what his predecessor called fiscal federalism: tax harmonisation, a levy on financial transactions, a European debt agency or a European monetary fund."
"All these machines to try and transfer money so as to keep their project around when, of course, much the easier thing would be to excuse the taxpayers the burden of this bail-out and to give the stricken economies the massive stimulus of allowing themselves to devalue and price themselves into the market."
"What a high price we expect from our people in order to humour the conceits of their elites!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of the 2000 Millennium Summit, the richest countries, including the countries of the European Union, renewed their pledge to achieve certain specific goals by 2015: to reduce hunger and poverty, to improve education and health, and to protect the environment in developing countries."
"Almost 10 years on, we believe that Europe, as the main international player in the field of development assistance, must now, more than ever, assume a leading role."
"There is no doubt that over the last few years, increases in development assistance have helped to relieve the suffering of millions of people."
"Whilst it is true that the assistance is working, much still remains to be done, not least given that the current international crisis will force many Member States to reduce their own aid budgets to these countries."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I believe that at this moment in time, we need to explore innovative financing mechanisms."
"The EU Member States must start to take strategic partnerships of a political nature with these countries seriously."
"This means that all the partners must demonstrate a renewed political will to achieve the priority objectives, which are still: policy coherence for development, tackling climate change and the global crisis, governance and rights, the right to food, and development education."
"This remains our number one challenge, Mr President."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries, in particular, the countries of Africa."
"We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved, because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, behind these percentages - let us not forget this - there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity."
"The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned."
"Public debt cancellation, together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use, is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project, the achievement of which - we have to be aware - cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Pal Schmitt, Vice-President of the European Parliament, having been recently elected as president of the newly elected Hungarian parliament, my colleagues and I had to elect a new vice-president."
"As László Tőkés, Hungarian member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), meets all the criteria needed in order to perform such a function (integrity, commitment, support for the European construct), I voted in favour of his candidature."
"The appointment of László Tőkés as Vice-President of the European Parliament is an insult to Romania, given the chauvinist tone of this fellow Member's statements."
"In fact, his election to this post gives even graver cause for concern as a result of the dubious voting procedure used."
"Such an appointment should not have taken place in the European Parliament, a forum accountable to Europe's citizens."
"However, since the deed has been done, we would have liked the vote to have been conducted in circumstances which complied fully with the standard procedure."
"As this was not the case, this election has an impact on the image of the European Parliament, especially in Romania where the general public takes a direct interest in this matter."
"Whether László Tőkés is going to do a good job in this post he now occupies matters less at this juncture."
"What is really important is that a European nation has been deeply offended."
"in writing. - Today's vote on the election of Mr Tőkés as Vice-President of the EP has been a disgrace."
"First, the President's explanations on how to vote have been both confusing and contradictory."
"As a result, nobody knew for sure how to proceed."
"Second, the voting machines of a number of Romanian MEPs - expected to vote against - were curiously not working properly."
"Third, the vote was cast anyway and the President had left the entire matter hanging, leaving the room."
"Fourth, the sensible request from the floor that the vote be repeated under normal circumstances has been rejected."
"Fifth, so was the announcement that there were more votes than Members present!"
"Sixth, instead, we were simply informed that the vote had been validated anyway!"
"Seventh, even so, nobody could explain how 168 votes could represent a 'qualified majority' in a Parliament numbering 751 members!"
"In fact, the EPP has thus forcefully imposed its will on the entire Parliament!"
"I regret this, because they can certainly do better than this, and we, the other MEPs, equally deserve better!"
"For reasons of political solidarity with my friends in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera (PPE, IT), on the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of approximately EUR 6.6 million in aid to Spain, which is facing redundancies in the non-metallic mineral products sector."
"Without fundamentally questioning the European Commission's analysis based on the data provided by the Kingdom of Spain, I find it strange that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be mobilised for what is simply a consequence of the bursting of the property bubble in Spain."
"It is, in fact, the reduction in mortgages which accounts for the fall in the number of building permits issued and, hence, the consumption of tiles and ceramics and non-metallic mineral products."
"Where are we going with this type of reasoning?"
"Can we seriously contend that this is an adjustment to globalisation?"
"I also find that administrative costs of over EUR 400 000 are disproportionate, even if a EUR 60 000 study, the cost of which seems prohibitive, appears to be the root cause of the large amount. To be continued ..."
"Increased unemployment is one of the most harmful consequences of the recent economical and financial crisis."
"Worsening market instability has contributed to exacerbating the situations of many companies which have proven less able to adjust to globalisation."
"In this case, 181 companies from the Comunidad Valenciana region suffered this impact."
"Spain has provided sufficient substantiation for their request for the fund to be mobilised, and I believe that this claim should be supported."
"I believe that special help is emphatically important for workers who have been made redundant or who have been affected by the current global economic environment, as has happened in this case, where 2 425 people have been made redundant from 181 companies in the Spanish region of Valencia."
"The implementation of aid aimed at retraining and reintegrating these workers into the work market is crucial, not only for the economy to pick up, but also for social stability."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this resolution."
"I would like to repeat the Commission's recommendation that funds should not be transferred from the European Social Fund in order to provide payments under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"These are funds with different and complementary objectives, beyond which one cannot replace the other."
"As it is an exceptional measure, the EGF must have autonomous financing, and it is a serious mistake for EGF financing, a contingency measure, to be provided to the detriment of the European Social Fund or any other structural fund."
"On 2 September 2009, Spain submitted an application to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of employees made redundant from 181 companies involved in the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products in a single NUTS II region, Comunidad Valenciana."
"I believe that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006."
"Therefore, I agreed with this report and the Commission's proposal to mobilise an amount of EUR 6 598 735, because only measures that help redundant people to integrate into the labour market are financed with money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and money from the fund creates the conditions for redundant workers to find permanent or temporary jobs, to participate in vocational training programmes and acquire the knowledge necessary to match the needs of the labour market, to acquire a business licence or become self-employed."
"Lithuania, too, has already taken advantage of support from this fund."
"I voted in favour of the reports on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) because I believe that it is crucial to underline the importance of the fund."
"This instrument was created to provide labour market support measures aimed exclusively at helping workers made redundant on account of structural changes in the main international trade patterns and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market."
"This is an extremely useful instrument which, between 2007 and the present day, has seen 55 requests by 17 Member States for support for 52 334 redundant workers, for whom funds totalling EUR 271.9 million have been earmarked."
"An analysis of the data in our possession shows, therefore, that the sum of EUR 5 195 has been mobilised from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for each worker made redundant, a sum that is actually being used to implement personalised service packages that are specifically designed to reintegrate the workers concerned into the labour market."
"Out of consideration for the Spanish workers of the Region of Valencia, who have been sacrificed to globalisation, I am abstaining."
"Given the situation that the impact of the neoliberal policies inflicted by the European Union has forced them into, one might feel justified in voting against the pittance that the European elite have seen fit to offer them."
"However, at least the little that they do receive may help to relieve their suffering."
"This does not make the approach of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any more tolerable."
"It backs the offshoring to Morocco and Algeria that is currently taking place and sanctions the profits of the wealthiest."
"A clean conscience comes cheap for the Eurocrat oligarchy."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocation due to globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights."
"The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment."
"In the past, the EGF has been used by other EU countries, and now it is able to extend the same help to Valencia, Spain, due to the recent situation there, where more than 2 400 workers have been made redundant from 181 companies in the 'Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products' sector."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - The report concerns the mobilisation of the EGF to the benefit of the Valencia region in Spain (EUR 6 598 735), following 2 425 redundancies in 181 enterprises operating in the 'Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products' sector."
"The funds will go directly to affected workers."
"The report got adopted in COBU without debate."
"In plenary, we Greens supported it too."
"For reasons of solidarity with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and Ireland, and on the basis of the report by my excellent Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of approximately EUR 2.7 million in aid to Ireland, which is facing redundancies in the crystal sector."
"Most of the 600 redundancies affect the company Waterford Crystal."
"Without questioning the European Commission's analysis, I find it strange that this company, which has been in trouble since 2005, can be the root cause of an adjustment to globalisation."
"In 2005, it announced the closure of its Dungarvan factory, in order to consolidate all operations in the main factory in the town of Waterford in Kilkenny, which employed 1 000 people."
"The move involved the disappearance of nearly 500 workers from Dungarvan."
"Following the closure of this factory on 30 January 2009, the former employees and their families organised demonstrations, which ended in March 2009, following an agreement with the workers and payment of EUR 10 million (source: Wikipedia)."
"Is this an adjustment to globalisation?"
"I sincerely welcome the compensation from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which is being distributed to former workers from Waterford Crystal and ancillary companies."
"The fund was established to help workers that are suffering due to structural changes in the global trade network and it will be very important to the local community which had the Waterford Crystal industry at its heart."
"As this industry was central to the region, as there were many skilled local workers employed by the glass sector and by the ancillary companies, and as the sector was vitally important to the identity of the Waterford region, this funding will be of great help to the workers and their families and will help provide other employment opportunities to the workers."
"Coordination measures must be put in place at the local level to ensure that this funding is distributed correctly."
"As this workforce is older than other workers, and as they were doing highly-skilled work, it must be ensured that the funding is used to provide further training and education, to encourage entrepreneurship and to improve access to employment."
"The European Union is the principal donor of the International Fund for Ireland, making up approximately 57% of its annual contributions."
"I therefore welcome the role that the European Community has played in providing economic and social aid to Ireland, with the aim of peace and reconciliation."
"The current period of operation is coming to an end, but it is important that the European Community continues to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland, working towards achieving the objectives of building bridges, integrating communities and stimulating development in the regions of the two areas of Ireland which have suffered most from instability over recent years."
"in writing. - I wholeheartedly welcome this decision to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist the Waterford Crystal workers."
"The global economic crisis, coupled with major shifts in world trade, has made many workers redundant in Ireland and across Europe."
"I urge the Irish Government to act swiftly to ensure that these resources are promptly and effectively used to meet the workers' individual retraining and educational needs."
"The timeframe for use of this fund is limited and no time must be lost in providing the services needed."
"There is a need to revise the regulation of the EGF to enable greater flexibility in the use of the resources provided, particularly with regard to the timeframe."
"The country dubbed the 'Celtic Tiger' once boasted remarkable levels of growth, but has been suffering from the impact of the crisis and the effects of globalisation over recent years."
"These have affected the Irish glass sector, and today, almost 600 workers are in a situation where they need assistance."
"I agree with the mobilisation of the fund."
"In view of the objectives of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), I am voting in favour of granting assistance to the workers made redundant from the Waterford Crystal companies in the Republic of Ireland."
"This aid amounts to more than EUR 2.5 million, which will be vital for encouraging those affected to improve their skills, as the great majority of them are over 45 years old."
"However, I would like to point out the glaring differences and inequality which have come about under the EGF."
"This is due to the Member States repeatedly failing to make use of the available funds, to the clear detriment of workers who become unemployed in these countries, as has been happening in Portugal due to the continual increase in bankruptcies and unemployment rates."
"On 7 August 2009, Ireland submitted an application to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of redundancies at the Waterford Crystal company and three of its suppliers/downstream producers."
"I believe that this application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions as laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006."
"I agreed with this report and the Commission's proposal to mobilise an amount of EUR 2 570 853, because only measures that help redundant people to integrate into the labour market are financed with money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and money from this fund creates the conditions for redundant workers to find permanent or temporary jobs, to participate in vocational training programmes and to acquire the knowledge necessary to match the needs of the labour market, to acquire a business licence or become self-employed."
"Lithuania, too, has already taken advantage of support from this fund."
"Out of consideration for the Irish Waterford Crystal workers, who have been sacrificed to globalisation, I am abstaining."
"Given the situation that the impact of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union has forced them into, one might feel justified in voting against the pittance that the European elite have seen fit to offer them."
"However, at least the little that they do receive may help to relieve their suffering."
"This does not make the approach of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any more tolerable."
"It endorses the current speculation by the banks and sanctions the profits that US funds such as KPS Capital Partners are making on the backs of European workers."
"In the kingdom of the Eurocrats, a clean conscience comes cheap."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocation due to globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights."
"The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment."
"The EGF has already been used by other EU countries, so we should now grant this aid to the Republic of Ireland, particularly to companies in the glass and crystal manufacturing sector."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - The report concerns the mobilisation of the EGF for the benefit of Irish workers (EUR 2 570 853) following redundancies at Waterford Crystal and three of its suppliers operating in the crystal sector."
"The funds will go directly to affected workers."
"The report was adopted in COBU without debate."
"No problem voting in favour."
"in writing. - I welcome the decisions to mobilise financial assistance to redundant workers who lost their jobs due to the global financial and economic crisis in three particular instances - in the Comunidad Valenciana and Castilla-La Mancha regions in Spain, as well as in the crystal production company, Waterford Crystal, in Ireland."
"The total amount of support in these cases amounts to EUR 11 million and will target 3 663 redundant workers."
"Although the assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will not solve all the problems caused by the financial and economic crisis, I urge EU institutions to perform effective and timely evaluation of applications, as well as the Member States to participate actively in this fund."
"In my home country, Lithuania, financial assistance has recently been allocated for workers who lost their jobs in the construction, furniture and clothing manufacturing industries, as well as for workers at the Snaigfactory in Alytus city."
"This support has been highly appreciated among those most severely hit by the global financial and economic crisis."
"For reasons of solidarity with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and on the basis of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera (PPE, IT), I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of approximately EUR 2 million in aid to Spain, which is facing redundancies in the timber product manufacturing sector."
"In fact, the Kingdom of Spain justifies its request on the basis of the principle that the economic and financial crisis caused a sudden collapse in the global economy, which had a serious knock-on effect on numerous sectors, especially on demand in the construction sector and, hence, on timber products."
"The truth is that the crisis caused the Spanish property bubble to burst and it is hard to see what justification there is for an adjustment to globalisation ..."
"If you look at what is being financed (for example, 57 promotions of entrepreneurship costing EUR 3 000 each, giving a total of EUR 171 000, 16 training workshops combined with work placements costing EUR 12 500 each, giving a total of EUR 200 000 and so forth), where is the adjustment to globalisation? To be continued ..."
"The large number of sectors and businesses affected by the crisis and globalisation make questions as to whether the present European economic model will be viable and sustainable inevitable."
"If the merit of granting aid to workers who have been made redundant is undisputed, the same cannot be said of the perpetuation of a state of affairs that tends to exacerbate difficult situations such as those experienced by loggers and cork harvesters in Castilla-La Mancha."
"Besides giving aid at intervals, the European Union and its Member States must be capable of promoting an economic environment that is free of unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles, and one that is favourable to entrepreneurs and rewards risk and innovation."
"I voted in favour of granting aid under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in view of the extremely negative impact of the closure of 36 timber companies in the space of nine months in the Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha, resulting in 585 people losing their jobs."
"This situation is made all the more serious by the fact that this region suffers from depopulation and a workforce that is almost entirely lacking in any other kind of training."
"I would therefore like to stress the need for special focus on the negative impact of the current economic crisis on the most rural areas."
"On 9 October 2009, Spain submitted an application to the Commission to mobilise a global amount of EUR 1 950 000 under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), in respect of the 585 workers made redundant from 36 companies involved in the manufacture of wood and timber and cork products, except furniture and the manufacture of articles containing straw and plaiting materials in the Castilla-La Mancha region in the nine month reporting period from 1 November 2008 to 31 July 2009."
"I agree with the Commission's assessment that this application fulfils the eligibility criteria set by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Regulation and the Commission's recommendation to the Budget Authority to approve the application, because only measures that help redundant people to integrate into the labour market are financed with money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and money from this fund creates the conditions for redundant workers to find permanent or temporary jobs, to participate in vocational training programmes and to acquire the knowledge necessary to match the needs of the labour market, to acquire a business licence or become self-employed."
"Lithuania, too, has already taken advantage of support from this fund."
"Out of consideration for the Spanish workers of the Castilla-La Mancha region, who have suffered at the hands of globalisation, I am abstaining."
"Given the situation that the impact of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union has forced them into, one might feel justified in voting against the pittance that the European elite have seen fit to offer them."
"However, at least the little that they do receive may help to relieve their suffering."
"This does not make the approach of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any more tolerable."
"It endorses speculation on the housing market and its collapse and sanctions the profits that the interest generates for the banks."
"A clean conscience comes easy for the Eurocrat tyrants."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocation due to globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights."
"The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment."
"In the past, the EGF has been used by other EU countries, so it should now extend the same help to Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, due to 585 redundancies at 36 companies operating in the wood and cork products industries sector, with the exception of furniture and the manufacture of straw and plaiting items."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - The report concerns the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the benefit of the Castilla-La Mancha region in Spain (EUR 1 950 000), following 585 redundancies in 36 enterprises operating in the 'manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials' sector."
"The funds will go directly to affected workers."
"The report was adopted in the Committee on Budgets without debate."
"We, the Verts/ALE Group, supported it."
"For reasons of solidarity with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and on the basis of the report by my Italian colleague, Barbara Matera, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the sum of EUR 1.1 million to finance technical assistance activities in connection with the EGF."
"Under Article 8(1) of the 2006 regulation on the EGF, 0.35% of the total amount available from the fund (EUR 500 million) remains available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission. That represents EUR 1 750 000."
"Nothing has yet been allocated to technical assistance."
"Frankly, to hold two meetings of 27 experts (1 per Member State) costing EUR 35 000 each, giving a total of EUR 70 000, and two seminars on the EGF costing EUR 100 000 each, all seems to be pointless, especially if it is to make the EGF pay not for adjustment to globalisation, but to running costs. And what can one say about the 10 studies at EUR 25 000 each? ..."
"To be continued ... but one truly does get the impression that these technical assistance activities are carried out to spend money, just because the legal basis exists."
"I agree with this report because more than half of the technical assistance resources allocated to the Commission will be used to finance studies and evaluations of ongoing European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) cases and to implement them, extracting successes and learning for the future, and part of the technical appropriations will be used to establish a database on long-term reintegration into the labour market."
"I also call for at least part of these appropriations to be used for technical measures that could contribute to shortening the application procedure that is too long in many cases of requests for assistance."
"I would like to encourage the Member States to get acquainted with, and make use of the possibilities and chances offered by the EGF for workers in situations of mass redundancies and to use the funds available in order to support redundant workers and help them return to the labour market."
"I would further encourage the Member States to exchange best practice opportunities and to learn particularly from those Member States that already have in place national information networks on the EGF involving the social partners and stakeholders at local level with a view to having a sound structure for assistance in place once mass redundancies occur."
"The European Commission is calling for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund so as to be able to offer suitable and sufficient technical assistance in response to the many requests from different countries experiencing an increase in the number of unemployed workers due to the international economic and financial crisis, and to globalisation, which are affecting the solvency of many companies."
"The unanimous vote in the parliamentary committee demonstrates the consensus on this request by the MEPs who deal most closely with this problem."
"Therefore, I believe that it is worthy of equal consideration by the House."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which promotes better implementation of aid and aid mechanisms targeted at redundant workers as I recognise the importance of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in retraining manual workers and mitigating the socio-economic impact of the global crisis."
"In addition to strengthening measures for better monitoring, auditing and evaluation of the implementation of the support plans which have been approved, I would like to point out the need to concern ourselves and make an effort to promote initiatives which lead to a greater and more widespread use of funds from the EGF by the Member States, especially Portugal."
"I agreed with this report and the Commission's proposal to mobilise an amount of EUR 1 110 000 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to finance technical assistance for the Commission."
"According to Article 8(1) of the legal basis, 0.35% of the annual maximum amount of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) can be made available each year for technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission."
"A maximum of EUR 1.75 million can be used each year in order to cover the needs indicated for the implementation of the fund."
"I agreed with the Commission's proposal that this amount should cover the following activities: activities linked to the EGF mid-term evaluation - monitoring and implementation studies, creation of a knowledge base, exchange of information and experience among Member States and Commission experts and auditors, development of networks, organisation of meetings of the Expert Group of the EGF, organisation of seminars on the implementation of the fund, as well as information and publicity activities and a further development of the EGF website and the funding of publications in all EU languages."
"The activities of the EGF play an important role and the purpose of money from this fund is to provide one-off support to employees made redundant as a result of globalisation or the global financial or economic crisis in order to facilitate their return to the labour market."
"I voted in favour of the report in question in the overwhelming belief that it is important for the procedures surrounding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be more dynamic."
"The decision of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2010 calls for the sum of EUR 1 110 000 to be mobilised to finance control and monitoring activities, but primarily to finance information activities and technical and administrative assistance in connection with the use of the resources by Member States and social partners."
"Providing clear information is fundamentally important if the timescales of the procedures are to be reduced, just as equipping the Union with instruments that bring it closer to the citizens is crucial if there is to be transparency and clarity."
"Since 1 May 2009, it has also been possible to use this fund to support workers made redundant as a result of the effects of the economic crisis and of the financial markets, which makes it even more relevant and necessary."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations due to globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights."
"The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment."
"It is therefore also necessary to assess the performance of this aid mechanism."
"In view of this, the Commission is looking to mobilise the EGF in order to meet the administrative costs related to preparing the interim evaluation on the fund's operation."
"This will include studies on the implementation of the EGF, the reintegration of workers into the labour market, and the development of networks between services provided by Member States that are competent in matters relating to the EGF and the exchange of best practice, along with the creation and implementation of the website."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is intended to provide swift assistance to those workers who have fallen victim to structural changes in international trade patterns."
"On 24 April 2010, the Commission adopted a new proposal for mobilisation of the EGF."
"The latter concerns the release of EUR 1 110 000 from the fund, a sum that would cover the EGF's primary activities, which are monitoring and implementation studies, the creation of a knowledge base, the exchange of information and experience among Member States and European experts from the EGF, the organisation of seminars, and further development of the EGF website and publications in all European languages."
"In my view, implementing the fund can only be welcomed, since it has the virtue of encouraging the Member States to make good use of the opportunities offered by the EGF, especially where workers are concerned."
"I believe that the creation of a knowledge base is very useful, since it acts as a binding force between the Member States and hence encourages them to cooperate with one another and to take inspiration from those countries that have greater experience in the area."
"Lastly, I consider it encouraging that a team of experts is leading the Member States in this process and I hope that there will be further developments in view of a future EGF project."
"in writing. - The report concerns the mobilisation of EUR 1 110 000 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to provide technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission."
"According to the Commission's proposal, this amount is intended to cover the following activities: Activities linked to the EGF mid-term evaluation (Art. 17) - monitoring and implementation studies, creation of a knowledge base, exchange of information and experience among Member States and Commission experts and auditors, development of networks, organisation of meetings of the Expert Group of Contact Persons of the EGF, organisation of seminars on the implementation of the fund, as well as information and publicity activities (Art. 9) and further development of the EGF website and publications in all EU languages."
"The report was adopted in COBU without debate."
"We Greens supported it."
"The recent financial earthquake has left many people unemployed or underemployed."
"It is good that the EU is based on the principle of solidarity."
"Since the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006, almost 30 applications have been made for amounts totalling EUR 154 million and assistance has been provided for 33 000 workers throughout Europe."
"This assistance has covered many different sectors, including the computer industry and the mobile phone and motor vehicle industry sectors."
"The Baltic States were dealt a painful blow by the financial crisis."
"Between October 2008 and July 2009, more than 1 600 workers employed by Lithuanian construction companies lost their jobs."
"Half of these failed to find another job or retired and required assistance."
"The majority of costs are covered by the EGF, the rest are covered by Lithuania's Employment Fund."
"I would like to thank the EGF for providing assistance which is selected very carefully and is socially responsible."
"One specific example: up to May 2009, 651 people employed by Lithuania's AB 'Snaigė' (refrigeration equipment manufacturer) and two of its suppliers lost their jobs over a five month period."
"That had a direct impact on workers and their families, as well as on the city of Alytus, where 'Snaigė' is based."
"Given the situation that had come about, a large part of EGF money was allocated to the workers."
"The money granted will offer workers the opportunity to find work and to study and retrain."
"in writing. - The EGF was created in order to aid those workers who have been negatively affected by globalisation."
"The Commission has adopted proposals to access the fund in order to help Ireland and Spain."
"I would like to point out that genuine cases in which these funds are needed are generally extremely urgent, and hence the procedure of allowing access to such funds should be as efficient and rapid as possible."
"In this regard, I have agreed with the conclusions that have been reached by our rapporteur and have thus voted in favour of the report."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is vital in supporting the reintegration of workers made redundant from the labour market as a result of the global economic and financial crisis."
"The European institutions have played an important role in assisting the economic recovery of the Member States that are most in need."
"Once again, I am calling for the EU institutions to act together in applying it in a rapid and flexible manner, on the basis of simplified procedures that respond rapidly to the needs of the workers most affected by the current economic downturn."
"According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little."
"If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust."
"I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member."
"Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions."
"Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions."
"Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources."
"I remind you that transparency does not merely mean making documents public: that is only the first step."
"Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control."
"I voted in favour of this report, which advocates a concerted and accessible approach towards the interregional exchange of best practice, with the aim of enabling those involved in cohesion policy to draw on the experience of others."
"I believe that the predominance of issues relating to project management by those involved in implementing cohesion policy is a crucial factor in improving and facilitating governance."
"Member States should decentralise the implementation of cohesion policy in order to ensure the proper running of multi-level governance, respecting the principles of partnership and subsidiarity."
"I welcome the creation of an Audit Reference Manual along with its simplification, particularly in matters relating to eligibility, financial engineering and financial reporting."
"I would like to point out the obstacles presented by potential candidates with respect to the use of the structural funds. They have greater bureaucratic burdens, too many complex regulations, a lack of transparency in decision-making processes and cofinancing rules, and delayed payments."
"If these obstacles are to be overcome, long-term criteria should be defined for projects that are cofinanced through the structural funds, and special measures developed along with new qualitative indicators for regions with specific geographic characteristics, such as the outermost regions."
"Mr President, I support Mr Winkler's position and I voted in favour of reviewing Community innovation policy."
"I particularly agree with the desire to provide a broad-ranging strategy that concerns not only technological innovation but also administrative, organisational and social innovation."
"To this end, I feel that the involvement of the financial world and small and medium-sized enterprises in defining measures for the promotion of innovation is crucial, as is devoting attention to political and economic goals at a regional level."
"The initial version of this own initiative report by Michail Tremopoulos was not at all to my liking."
"I therefore tabled ten amendments to reorientate it."
"Thus, I and my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) managed to reinstate French and German as communication languages alongside English, to limit the information demanded to information which is of real use, to maintain the presumption that European funds have been used properly and so forth."
"Use of the funds should indeed be more transparent, but that should not be an excuse for making the procedures for applying for European funding excessively onerous."
"Thanks to our action, additional information will be available to European citizens on the use of the European funds, yes, but this will not increase bureaucracy."
"I therefore voted for the amended version of this report."
"I voted in favour of the own initiative report by my fellow Greek Member, Michail Tremopoulos, on transparency in regional policy and its funding."
"I welcome the European Transparency Initiative (ETI) adopted by the European Commission in order to improve transparency, openness and responsibility in the governance of the European Union."
"I support the need for regulation and application methods which guarantee that procedures are transparent, offer potential beneficiaries better access to the Structural Funds and reduce the administrative burden on participants."
"The managing authorities in the Member States must present all stages of projects financed by the Structural Funds in a transparent manner."
"I vow that Members of the European Parliament will be informed and involved in the implementation of projects in their constituencies."
"in writing. - I have voted for this report."
"Effective use of the structural and cohesion funds is a pre-condition for the growth of our economies and creation of jobs."
"In order to ensure transparency of the use of funds, the European Transparency Initiative should be implemented in its fullest."
"Currently, there is insufficient information about Commission decisions on the funding of major."
"Member States as well use different levels to inform the public on the beneficiaries of the EU aid."
"I believe that transparency should be ensured at all levels as it goes hand in hand with the process of simplifying the procedures for obtaining Structural Funds and enables public participation in a debate on how public money is spent which is essential for the efficient use of the EU funds."
"At a time like this, when the economic and financial crisis is manifesting itself as a horizontal phenomenon that sweeps across all sectors indiscriminately, the sector of agriculture is no exception and requires emphatic financial support and transparency."
"Mr Tremopoulos's report follows up the Commission Communication on the European Transparency Initiative, introducing proposals designed to promote the disclosure of data on beneficiaries of funding as well as transparency in shared management and partnership."
"I will vote in favour of this report for the very reason that I believe that more information and, above all, simpler information, can bring the complex world of EU cohesion policy closer to the world of enterprise."
"The European Transparency Initiative has been in force since 2005 when it was adopted by the Commission."
"Just one year later, the Green Paper was published with the aim of improving transparency, openness and accountability of EU governance."
"The reason underlying the adoption of these documents was the European citizen's fundamental right to know who is receiving European funds."
"Every one of them makes a financial contribution to these projects to a greater or lesser extent."
"Publishing information online about major projects prior to making decisions about their funding is a common practice within international financial institutions."
"The European Commission has been an exception to this practice until now, even though there is no good reason why the Community executive should adhere to lower standards of transparency."
"In these circumstances, Parliament's request to the Commission to publish information on the Internet in good time, in order to provide direct access to the documentation about European finances, fits in perfectly with the transparency policy adopted at EU level."
"It is important that projects approved by the Commission are above any suspicion and that the general public is informed about them right from the very first stages of submitting funding requests."
"Transparency about the way in which the structural funds are allocated, particularly through ex post publication of the beneficiaries, the names of operations and the amount of public funding given to the operations, is central to the discussion on how to spend European public money."
"However, the definition of the 'beneficiaries' and the amount of public funding paid to the beneficiary (amounts allocated or effectively paid) to be published is unclear."
"I welcome the recommendations of this report in that they contribute to a culture of mutual trust between all stakeholders, which will lead to better use of the European funds."
"in writing. - There are many funds in the EU that are made available to citizens as well as other entities."
"Many complain that the procedures for gaining access to such funds are complicated and excessively bureaucratic."
"There should be clearer information regarding the procedures associated with such funds and greater transparency with regard to how these funds are spent."
"I am in agreement with the conclusions reached by the rapporteur and have hence decided to vote in favour of this report."
"I am voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report as I believe that transparency must be a key condition for achieving the general objectives of all policies, and especially cohesion policies."
"The variability of presentation and accessibility conditions of data resulting from the obvious differences between the Member States and managing authorities in interpreting the minimum requirements of the European Transparency Initiative makes a full comparison at EU level impossible."
"I therefore warmly welcome the introduction of clearer rules regarding the disclosure of information on beneficiaries of funds under shared management."
"Reducing bureaucracy, simplifying the process for obtaining funds and allowing greater control of financial management are positive steps."
"I also believe that the proposal for bilingualism in official information provided by the Member States to the public on the process for providing funds is a good idea."
"Finally, I think that the Commission should set an example by taking up practices that promote transparency."
"They should do so especially on the issue of providing funding for major EU projects, where no one understands why transparency standards continue to be lower than those of similar projects such as the European Investment Bank or the World Bank."
"I voted in favour of the report on transparency in regional policy and the funding behind it so as to ensure greater control over the way in which public funds are used."
"Apart from the current minimum requirements, it is a matter of urgency to ensure that the lists published on the Commission's website of those who have benefited from the Structural Funds include more detailed information, in the interests of greater transparency. Examples of such details might be information about the location, summaries of approved projects, types of support given and a description of the project partners."
"Regional policy and the European Union Cohesion Fund are fundamental for the principle of solidarity among Member States."
"It is crucial that the resources for them are used efficiently and in a focused manner, and that they contribute to the development of the areas to which they are awarded."
"Transparency in the use of these funds is a major responsibility for the Member States, and penalties for poor management will lead to a greater reduction in imbalances within the European Union."
"Given the size and regional diversity of Europe, along with the importance of the credibility of the European institutions, I voted in favour, as I believe that sharing public information and standardising procedures is crucial to ensure the necessary transparency in implementing and funding regional policies, with a view to economic and social cohesion and strengthening a fairer Europe."
"I would also like to emphasise that ensuring compliance with common rules and publishing objective information on public investment should not result in greater bureaucracy."
"In fact, I believe that it is important to reduce bureaucracy so as to improve the transparency and effectiveness of European policies."
"The transparency of regional policy and its funding are particularly sensitive topics and of considerable interest to the area I represent."
"Under the terms of the 2007-2013 cohesion policy, the Veneto Region and the other regions of north and central Italy fall under objective 2 'Regional Competitiveness and Employment', to which 16% of available resources are allocated."
"Most of the resources (83%) are allocated to regions whose development is lagging behind and these include the regions of southern Italy."
"I agree with the rapporteur in considering that the Commission's European Transparency Initiative (ETI) must be backed by reference parameters that are the same for all, in order to guarantee a homogeneous and effective level of transparency."
"Defining the type of documentation to be provided, guaranteeing access to that documentation, above all, in the case of 'major projects', and creating a common model to be respected will prevent waste and a lack of procedural transparency."
"Providing clear and more detailed common rules that do not, however, adversely affect administrative efficiency will reward the virtuous regions and penalise those that do not define their requirements and projects with sufficient accuracy."
"in writing. - The Tremopoulos report takes as its starting point the idea that transparency is a prerequisite to achieving the objectives of cohesion policy and I fully support calls for greater transparency in regional policy."
"The report also calls for Member States to fully involve regional and local authorities in implementing policies and I am sure that when Scotland is independent, the Scottish Government will fully involve all Scotland's regions in these matters."
"Providing public information on the recipients of EU funds is a cornerstone of the European Transparency Initiative (ETI)."
"I believe that the requirement in the Financial Regulation for Member States to provide information on how EU funds under shared management are spent, in particular, through the ex-post publication of beneficiaries, is insufficient."
"The Commission limits its role to proposing a common indicative standard for the publication of data and providing EU citizens, through its DG REGIO website, with links to Member States' electronic addresses where the requested data on European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund beneficiaries are published."
"With the aforementioned funds implemented under 'shared management', these links and their content is the sole responsibility of the Member States and is based on information provided by the managing authorities."
"The variability in the presentation and in the conditions of access to data does not allow a complete comparison at EU level."
"Therefore, I agreed with the proposals submitted by the European Parliament to make Member State databases fully searchable and compatible, so as to facilitate an EU-wide overview of the data presented and to ensure that the data collected should appear and should be managed in a structured, comparable way to ensure its full usability."
"The implementation of these proposals would contribute to the ETI."
"I have a good opinion of the work undertaken by the Commission and Parliament regarding transparency in regional policy and its funding."
"This is a sector which absorbs the lion's share of the EU budget, so taxpayers have the right to know how their money is used and should have unrestricted access to this knowledge."
"I would also like to express the hope that the measures being taken will bring about the creation of new regulations and published data which have been inspired by observation, thanks to which implementation procedures will become simpler and more transparent."
"With a view to bringing Europe's institutions and agencies closer to the citizens which they serve and highlighting the contribution they make to social and economic cohesion, as well as sustainable development in Europe, one of the European Union's fundamental concerns is how to increase its transparency."
"I voted in favour of this report as I support the Commission in promoting a standard, well-established option for providing access to information about the recipients of Community funds."
"This will allow us to eliminate the discrepancies in the way in which Member States publish this information."
"This will enable us to gain a complete overview at European level of the data submitted while, at the same time, gaining a greater degree of credibility and accountability in the eyes of Europe's citizens."
"I voted for this report as I think that the need for transparency in regional policies with a view to increasing access for potential recipients to the European Transparency Initiative (ETI) database is particularly important."
"I believe that it is vital to get local and regional authorities involved when it comes to the transparency of regional policies, as it is their duty to fulfil a dual role in this respect."
"On the one hand, they will enjoy the benefits of the ETI by facilitating the maximum possible access to this database on the funds' recipients, which could provide specific examples of good practice in regional funding."
"At the same time, local and regional authorities will play a crucial role in promoting this database via the most suitable means possible so that the information is as easily accessible as possible to citizens."
"Systems must also be put in place for measuring the level of access to the ETI database in order to provide us with the clearest possible idea of the level of access to the information contained in this database."
"If a lower level of use is identified, the authorities managing it at a lower level will have to find more effective methods for promoting its use."
"The traceability of beneficiaries, funds allocated and projects is a crucial aspect of the instruments governing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, in order to guarantee transparency of expenditure."
"A transparent system optimises investments and reduces costs."
"This level of importance means it is worthwhile increasing the penalties for infringements of the communication and publicity obligations, promoting a more modern and functional network system between the management authorities, defining a common basis for standardising the conduct of individual States and creating a link between publicity, monitoring and auditing."
"These actions should be incorporated into the package of measures to combat the crisis."
"A similar suggestion was made by Parliament at the time of the vote on 'Protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Annual Report', in view of the fact that the requirement for transparent procedures prevents improper conduct."
"Transparency in the use of Community funds and public information on the beneficiaries of the EU funds is essential to the European Transparency Initiative (ETI)."
"Such disclosure makes it possible to assess how the public funds are used, which is vital for the well-being of democracy and prudent management of ever limited resources."
"However, in this time of crisis, we need other mechanisms which allow greater transparency, particularly prior information by the Commission about decisions relating to funding large projects."
"It is therefore essential to continue to develop all the available mechanisms which lead to greater transparency regarding all the beneficiaries of the EU funds."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The publication of information concerning the financing of projects from European funds clearly enables the public in the Member States to join the debate on the better use of public finances."
"Greater transparency, in my opinion, requires the introduction of clear rules on the publication of information, which must not, however, result in an excessive administrative burden for potential recipients, who are already struggling with the complicated administrative requirements."
"I would warmly welcome it if the publication on the Internet of information concerning large projects was timely, allowing direct access to project documentation, and especially to environmental impact assessments, the importance of which is often treated lightly or even circumvented by the parties involved."
"Civil society would then have an opportunity to send opinions to the Commission's website, and thereby contribute to the democratic control and greater quality of projects."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Transparency Initiative was started years ago, but has made limited progress."
"The publication of recipients of agricultural subsidies, for example, has brought to light the fact that often, these funds go to big business, royal houses, and so on."
"If the EU is serious about transparency, then it must also be implemented consistently in decision making."
"As ever, the transparency initiative is largely empty words, which is why I abstained from voting."
"Collecting information about how public subsidies are actually being spent and who actually benefits from the money is important and it is also the right thing to do."
"However, this must not result in the Commission being given such far-reaching powers that the Member States can no longer select their own projects and partners, for example."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"Financial transparency of public institutions is a foundation of modern democracy."
"The citizens must have access to information about how each euro is spent - because each euro comes from taxes which they have paid."
"It is no secret that the European Transparency Initiative, adopted by the Commission in 2005, is having its first effects."
"I welcome this."
"On the other hand, there is still much to be done."
"It saddens me to note that standards on transparency used in the European Commission when implementing regional policy are lower than in other institutions, including principally those in use in the European Investment Bank."
"There is no reason why such a state of affairs should continue."
"I share the resolution's satisfaction with progress on social control over distribution of funds for the realisation of regional policy objectives."
"I also have high regard for the resolution's emphasis on the role of the institution of civil society in the programming system of cohesion policy."
"I am sure that the measures proposed in the resolution will contribute to an increase in the effectiveness of programmes and to the legitimisation of EU cohesion policy."
"In view of these factors, I decided to endorse the resolution."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Tremopoulos, which contains provisions aimed at improving efficiency and transparency in European Regional policy."
"If we want to provide better access to the available funds for the potential beneficiaries of the European Structural Funds, it seems to me that the administrative constraints associated with funding applications will need to be made less cumbersome and the procedures for accessing EU funding more transparent."
"By making the rules and application of the rules clearer and more straightforward, this EU funding will be made more efficient."
"I also feel it is essential for citizens to be better informed about the projects carried out by the European Union, especially those relating to the use of Structural Funds."
"I am therefore in favour of the publication by the European Commission of more information for the benefit of the general public about major projects carried out using these funds and whether the projects have been completed or are still under way."
"in writing. - I want to salute and congratulate my colleague in the Greek Greens, Michail Tremopoulos, for the adoption today of his report on transparency and regional policy and its funding."
"The result, 629 votes in favour and only 6 against, shows the great job he has done on it."
"I supported and voted for the Tremopoulos report calling on the European Commission and the national managing authorities to use greater transparency in the allocation and use of Structural Funds."
"It is important that we obtain comparable data regarding administration of the funds from across the Union, so that the project owners and citizens can be aware of what the EU's funding priorities are, which stakeholders have already received funds, how the funds have been used and what the procedures and timescales are for the various projects."
"The goal in doing this is to make potential beneficiaries more aware of these funds, and to monitor their use more effectively."
"However, it was important not to step over into excessive transparency and overload the fund managing authorities and project owners with information requirements that are irrelevant, ineffective and counterproductive."
"This is why my colleagues and I from the Presidential majority of the Committee on Regional Development amended the original text to make sure that the objective of transparency was not achieved at the expense of the cohesion policy's objective of simplification, because it is precisely these two major issues of simplicity and visibility that cohesion policy needs to address."
"in writing. - I voted against this measure not because I am against transparency, far from it; as one of only a few UK MEPs to have audited accounts, I believe in stronger transparency."
"But this vote is typical of the EU: pretending to be transparent and putting in place more bureaucracy at taxpayers' expense."
"My constituents deserve better."
"This report describes the transparency of the transversal guiding principle in the programming process and the deciding of cohesion policy, and puts forwards several technical and administrative proposals which have proved useful for greater efficiency in the development of regional policy."
"Besides issues surrounding more widespread dissemination of data about beneficiaries, the need for less bureaucracy and the acceleration of procedures, the aim of the document, which has my vote, is to effect transparency in the partnership between regions, Member States and the European Union."
"Due to this concern and based on an amendment that I have signed, a reference is included to the need for more focused, more regular and more timely information to be provided to partner organisations, particularly through greater technical assistance and training."
"This is undoubtedly useful for the partners of the most remote regions in the EU, as is the case for the outermost regions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that transparency is very important for a country like mine, Lithuania."
"EU funds like the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund have helped shape Lithuania's economic, social and environmental development and will continue to shape it for some time to come."
"Therefore, it is important for citizens to be given the opportunity to become witnesses and have an influence in allocating these resources."
"For that to happen, it is necessary for society to participate."
"The participation of society might occur in various ways in the decision-making process - allocating EU funds and implementing them."
"Greater participation by society would reduce the level of corruption and increase the effective use of funds, which is particularly important for a country like Lithuania."
"It is also important for the recipients of EU funds to be made public."
"That would encourage discussions on the use of public money in the country, which again is one of the fundamental principles of a functioning democratic state."
"I would also like to underline the need for regional and local institutions and, above all, ordinary citizens, to participate."
"The report contains a few observations on a comprehensive Internet platform that would help to review and give a better grasp of existing funds."
"That is a good start, but more should be done to include people from different layers of society - rich and poor, those from large cities and small villages."
"Civil society and non-governmental organisations could also help to promote the effectiveness of programmes and improve their accountability."
"in writing. - On behalf of the S&D Group, I want to express our general consent to this report."
"It is important that the European Parliament fights for greater transparency in regional policy, but we reject the so-called 'naming and shaming', as asked for in point 16 of this report."
"We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements, but the goal of more transparency - which we also support - should not be achieved by the wrong means."
"We are afraid of having a 'witch-hunt' when naming and shaming is carried out."
"The European Commission should not be made a moral authority which achieves group discipline by naming, shaming or blaming."
"We also reject this approach as it could lead to a more complex situation and non-implementation in the Member States."
"Despite this concern, we agree - as stated above - with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful."
"The European construct was dreamed up by the Fathers of Europe in order to guarantee peace in Europe."
"Although there is still tension in Northern Ireland, modern-day Europe must continue to provide financial aid to support reconciliation between the two communities that have been fighting for so long."
"Thus, the European Union should ensure that financing continues for specific projects which allow the links to be forged that are needed to bring about lasting peace."
"Owing to the fact that, on legal basis grounds, the Court of Justice of the European Union recently annulled Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006, which rightly allowed these financial contributions, the Members of the European Parliament had to adopt a new regulation based on the appropriate legal basis."
"I therefore voted in favour of this new regulation."
"I voted in favour of this report on the EU's ongoing contributions to the International Fund for Ireland."
"The European Union has paid EUR 15 million into the fund for the period 2007-2010."
"EU funding (which equals 57% of the total) is central to the efficacy of the fund."
"The fund had a positive impact on matters both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland, and it has helped and supported many cross-border initiatives since it was established in 1986."
"The fund supported peace and reconciliation; it promoted relationships and participation; and it helped economic and social progress."
"The fund had a clear and significant effect on the communities concerned, and it contributed greatly to efforts to achieve permanent peace, particularly as regards activities carried out in cooperation with the PEACE programme in Northern Ireland and in the border counties."
"The International Fund for Ireland is a good example of transnational and international cooperation."
"The fund, which is managed by an independent international body, is financed by several countries: the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia."
"Both in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the projects foster contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists."
"This international support will, however, be coming to an end in 2010."
"We should therefore consider how the fund's action priorities might be financed after this date, especially those relating to promoting economic and social progress and encouraging the peace dialogue."
"The projects covered by the International Fund for Ireland already complement the actions under the EU PEACE programmes."
"It would be useful to establish what will happen to these projects in the context of the forthcoming EU budget planning."
"I therefore call upon the European Commission to look into how the Structural Funds might continue the role of the International Fund for Ireland, particularly within the framework of the 'European territorial cooperation' objective."
"in writing. - Following numerous years of instability in Ireland, a fund referred to as the IFI was set up for the purpose of ensuring economic and financial stability in the region."
"We have seen that the report looks into the plans for the fund in the future and establishes some key goals that need to be tackled."
"I agree with the conclusions reached by the rapporteur and hence decided to vote in favour of this report."
"The peace process in Northern Ireland is an example of success that has deserved, and should continue to deserve, the support of the European institutions."
"As with European integration, in post-conflict situations like this one, the path to stability can be forged by establishing de facto solidarities which facilitate and increase cross-border and inter-community relations."
"I hope that other parts of the European Union plagued by the phenomenon of secessionist terrorism can look to the Irish process and learn lessons from it that will allow them to eradicate violence and construct a society in which everyone can feel that they belong, while respecting the law, traditions and human rights."
"I voted in favour of the extension of the International Fund for Ireland, as I believe that it is important to emphasise the European Union's mission of peace between peoples and communities as a key factor for economic and social development, as well as for enhancing human dignity and quality of life for citizens."
"This can be seen in the specific case of Ireland."
"The European Union should continue to play a key role in maintaining peace and eliminating regional, ethnic and cultural tension, and thus promoting conditions for social and economic progress."
"Since its institution in 1986, the International Fund for Ireland has contributed to promoting economic and social progress and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between the nationalists and the unionists throughout Ireland."
"The EU needs to continue to support the peace process in Ireland with contributions to the International Fund for Ireland, as it has done since 1989."
"Stepping up this support will serve to strengthen solidarity between the Member States and their respective citizens. That is why I voted as I did."
"This was a vote at second reading on the regulation concerning a European rail network for competitive freight."
"I voted in favour of the compromises worked out between Parliament and the Council of the EU."
"These compromises should, in fact, allow conditions to be promoted for better governance in allocating access capacities and in managing the major intra-European rail freight corridors."
"Once it has been adopted, this regulation should improve the efficacy of large rail freight flows in European corridors, thereby helping to reduce pollution from transport."
"For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the text negotiated with the Council in order to reach agreement at second reading."
"I voted in favour of the recommendation for second reading contained in the report by my Romanian friend, Marian-Jean Marinescu, on the Council position at first reading for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning a European rail network for competitive freight."
"I support the amendments made in connection with the organisation of international rail corridors with a view to creating a European rail network for competitive freight."
"I also support the idea of a one-stop shop introduced in the form of a joint body established by the management board of each freight corridor, offering applicants the opportunity to request a slot crossing at least one border in a single place and in a single operation."
"I support this regulation concerning the creation of a European rail network for competitive freight, the implementation of which, it is hoped, will have added value for the entire Community, because Europe will be linked by a common rail network."
"This will ensure the effective movement of people and freight between Europe's regions."
"With the regulation, there has also been a decision on the implementation of the rail corridor attainment deadlines."
"The longer 5 year period that is favourable to Lithuania has been adopted, during which a European track will have to be laid in Lithuania."
"Now, as Lithuania is experiencing the painful consequences of the economic crisis, this decision is particularly favourable because Lithuania, like other countries badly affected by the crisis, has limited financial opportunities to invest in rail infrastructure development projects in the near future."
"The freight sector at EU level has a huge amount of potential to offer at a time when it is enjoying steady growth."
"In these circumstances, it seems paradoxical that increasingly fewer companies are opting for rail transport."
"Just 10% of the freight transported across the European Union is carried by rail."
"In actual fact, the level of rail freight traffic has halved compared to 20 years ago."
"The European Commission has acknowledged the key role played by rail freight transport since 2001."
"The deadline for the White Paper on European policies in the transport sector was then set for 2010."
"The rail freight market must now tackle the challenges posed in improving the quality of the services provided due to the lack of compliance, which is a handicap when competing with other forms of freight transport."
"It becomes impossible to explain the decline in the rail freight sector when there are three rail legislative packages."
"They are not sufficiently harmonised with national legislation and the rail systems are not connected at cross-border level."
"Given this situation, the regulation being put forward by the European Parliament is intended to make rail freight transport more efficient by promoting harmonisation among Member States and infrastructure administrators."
"in writing. - I support efforts to make rail freight more effective, because of its environmental advantages compared to road freight."
"However, I want to make it clear that I oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the European Union, which is responsible for the fragmentation, lack of investment and ineffectiveness of rail freight today."
"This compromise with the Council is an effort to improve the situation; therefore, I vote for it."
"But it builds on the liberalisation that I strongly oppose."
"However, this vote does not concern deregulation, which is already in the treaty."
"in writing. - I support all efforts to make rail freight more effective, because of its environmental advantages compared to road freight."
"However, I want to make it clear that I oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the European Union, which is responsible for the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of rail freight today, as well as the lack of investment in this area."
"This compromise with the Council is an effort to improve the situation."
"Therefore, I am voting in favour, even though it builds on the liberalisation that I strongly oppose."
"This vote does not concern deregulation, which is already provided for in the treaty."
"The draft regulation defines corridors for rail freight, in other words, routes crossing several Member States on which managers coordinate the management and operation of the infrastructure."
"This offers real European added value, because this regulation will improve transparency in the allocation and management of slots and will promote transnational coordination at all levels: available capacities, investments, infrastructure works, operational management and so forth."
"The creation of a one-stop shop for each corridor will also allow companies to deal with a single contact."
"This symbolises rail corridor management placed in a European perspective."
"This regulation is therefore a strong signal in favour of a real European transport and infrastructure policy."
"It is an essential step towards rail freight which is quicker and more reliable and, hence, a credible and ecological alternative to long-distance road transport."
"A real European approach was all the more necessary, as it is on this scale that the rail freight market is relevant."
"I voted in favour of this report on contributing to creating a more competitive European rail freight network."
"The changeability of the transport sector in recent decades and the increasing openness of national rail markets (creating serious problems with their lack of conformity) necessitate the implementation of these measures, which will contribute to creating an efficient distribution network between the EU Member States."
"Over recent decades, the market share accounted for by rail in transporting goods has continually declined and, in 2005, represented only 10% of this kind of transport."
"In looking to address this challenge, the Commission has supported the idea of tackling the issue more effectively."
"In December 2008, it proposed a regulation on a European rail network for the competitive transportation of goods."
"In April 2009, the European Parliament adopted its first reading on the proposal, giving its support to the Commission."
"The Council also reached a political agreement on this regulation, albeit with some amendments."
"Without questioning the importance of rail transport of goods and the need for European coordination of this transport, and supporting the creation of so-called freight corridors, the fact is that, in the current economic and financial climate in EU countries, creating an integrated freight transport system necessarily presupposes very high investment from the Member States, and we cannot guarantee that they are in a position to promise or supply such investment."
"Therefore, without undermining the objectives of this regulation, if we are to approve it, we should not, however, forget that the present climate of austerity will naturally have a bearing on any other plan."
"I welcomed the vote in plenary that approved the recommendation for second reading with regard to a regulation concerning the European rail network for competitive freight."
"The report provides for the implementation of nine goods corridors between European Union Member States and the setting up of a one-stop shop for each corridor with the aim of guaranteeing all public and private rail companies the necessary information on the allocation of capacity for each corridor."
"It stresses the interoperability of freight, providing for links with seaports and navigable internal waterways."
"This regulation certainly represents a great step forward towards the coordination of European rail traffic, currently for freight only, and complements the liberalisation of the rail market, an absolute priority within this sector."
"I regret that certain MEPs attempted to sabotage the priority Stockholm-Naples corridor project by submitting an amendment excluding Brenner from the route."
"This irresponsible attempt was foiled due to the acumen of the Italian MEPs."
"For these reasons, I unhesitatingly supported the recommendation for second reading."
"It is with enthusiasm that I voted in favour of this text."
"It represents a major step forward for freight and transport in Europe, which will now be more competitive and less expensive."
"Europe is moving towards greater interconnection between European rail networks, freight corridors and sea and river ports."
"This is an important step in the sustainable development of the rail transport sector in Europe, which will thus be able, at long last, to offer a real alternative to air and road transport."
"Henceforth, international corridors linking the Member States will be managed by cross-border authorities which coordinate infrastructure management and slot allocation."
"This will all be topped by a one-stop shop for each rail corridor, the creation of which I actively defended."
"This innovation allows Europe to move forward and characterises its will to achieve better cooperation and greater integration in the transport sector."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which strengthens the bases of the large European rail freight network which I have been calling for for several years."
"in writing. - Explanation of vote on Marinescu."
"I support efforts to make rail freight more effective, because of its environmental advantages compared to road freight."
"However, I want to make it clear that I oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the European Union, which is responsible for the fragmentation, lack of investment and ineffectiveness of rail freight today."
"This compromise with the Council is an effort to improve the situation, so I voted for it, but it builds on the liberalisation that I strongly oppose."
"This vote does not, however, concern deregulation, which is already in the treaty."
"I have just voted against the amendment in the Marinescu report which aims to establish a central coordination body that will act as a one-stop shop for managing freight traffic."
"Another 162 of my fellow Members have voted in the same way, following a petition which I helped to launch."
"We are in favour of quality and competitiveness in the field of rail freight."
"We want to see flexible and efficient solutions and we also believe in promoting rail transport for environmental reasons."
"However, local and long-distance passenger transport must not be affected in any way."
"The highly complex text of the report does not include a clear statement of this kind."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament voted in favour of the recommendation by the Commission and the majority of the Council to have the allocation of train paths managed by an additional central coordinating body in future."
"This will result in a fragmentation of authority, which will have a serious impact on timetabling."
"In Germany, which is a traditional transit country, the rail network is already operating almost at full capacity."
"All of the three planned corridors pass through important population centres."
"In the Federal State of Hesse, these are the towns of Fulda and Frankfurt, which are on the path from Stockholm to Palermo."
"The European Parliament's good reputation as the main body providing protection for consumers in Europe has been damaged today."
"The Member States will lose the authority to make decisions about their own rail networks and all the citizens of Europe will be affected by the resulting train delays."
"This report goes to confirm the picture of a Europe that is the opposite of the Europe of solidarity and cooperation that our present times now call for more than ever."
"Land should be developed on the basis of the general interest of Europe's people, not according to the individual interests of private sector businesses."
"The privatisation of transport policy serves the interests of the Eurocracy to the detriment of my fellow citizens."
"I am voting against this damaging text."
"A European rail network for competitive freight transport is vital if the EU is to achieve the objectives set out in the EU strategy for employment and growth."
"In view of this, the creation of rail corridors which allow rapid and efficient links between one national network and another will allow for improvements in the conditions for using the infrastructure."
"It is vital that we approve the present regulation in order to make rail freight transport more competitive compared with what is currently in use."
"This will bring not only economic benefits but also environmental ones, as rail transport is environmentally friendly."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted against the compromise proposals for the regulation concerning a European rail network for competitive freight."
"It will take away power from the national infrastructure authorities which have worked very efficiently and effectively to date, including in the international sphere."
"The proposed measures will also result in more bureaucracy, which cannot be our aim."
"This inflation will reduce efficiency."
"Capacity will be left unused."
"In my opinion, all this will have a negative impact on rail operations throughout Europe."
"If the EU really wants to encourage more freight onto the rail network, then it should set priorities in the realisation of the trans-European transport networks."
"Complete expansion of the southern corridor by means of the so-called Koralm Tunnel, for example, would bring about an unprecedented shift onto the rail network."
"We should be promoting rail freight, not more centralisation."
"in writing. - I decided to vote in favour of the recommendation for second reading, insomuch as recent series of informal trialogue meetings with the Spanish Presidency have produced an agreement."
"I consider it is important not to lose the momentum."
"In its first reading of April 2009, my group supported the objective of a competitive rail freight network through the creation of corridors across the European Union, as set out in the Commission proposal of December 2008."
"My support for this agreement is also strengthened by the importance of the rail network in Lithuania and the economic perspective it offers my country."
"It is of paramount importance - not only to Lithuania but also to the European Union as a whole - to stop the decline of rail market share in freight transport."
"I am convinced the rail freight market will benefit from this agreement."
"It will contribute to improving its quality of service and create synergies between national rail systems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, I could not support the group of four compromise amendments, because Estonia and Latvia were left out of the rail corridor described in Annex I, point 8."
"Taking into account the future of the railway in general, as well as the Rail Baltica project, one would have expected that this corridor would also include Tallinn and Riga."
"Unfortunately, the adopted amendments restricted our options - those of Estonia and Latvia - and, as a result, we have moved no closer to linking up all the European Union Member States into a uniform railway system."
"in writing. - I support efforts to make rail freight more effective, because of its environmental advantages compared to road freight."
"However, I want to make it clear that I oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the European Union, which is responsible for the fragmentation, lack of investment and ineffectiveness of rail freight today."
"This compromise with the Council is an effort to improve the situation; therefore, I vote for it."
"But it builds on the liberalisation that I strongly oppose."
"However this vote does not concern deregulation, which is already in the treaty."
"Despite freight having been in decline for many years, of the various alternatives to road transport, it is still the one that offers the greatest level of safety and efficiency."
"This report aims to try to increase the market share of rail freight by creating corridors between at least two Member States so that the goods can be transported quickly."
"Having read the report, it is my understanding that the creation of these corridors will not establish a priority route for goods to the detriment of passenger transport, as I gather that there is no difference in treatment between the two types of rail traffic."
"The one-stop shop will be strategically important for coordination, as the management of requested routes will be realised through it."
"In the Council's vision, it has been reduced to an information booth, but I take the same view as the rapporteur, who believes that it is crucial for the desired flow of goods."
"This network of corridors will allow better synchronisation of European rail services."
"It will create interfaces between different modes of transport and provide a new impetus for investment in the sector."
"For this reason, I feel that it is worthy of my vote."
"I absolutely reject this report, albeit that unfortunately, no final vote is possible in the second reading."
"For Deutsche Bahn, the one-stop shop strategy will mean that, as the only player facing competition in a liberalised German network, it will be a measure equivalent to expropriation and will result in a competitive disadvantage that cannot be made up, since Germany has mixed passenger and freight traffic and no separate high-speed networks."
"I would urgently advise Deutsche Bahn to look into taking legal action against this decision."
"I am certain that the idea of establishing a European rail network for competitive freight is justified and necessary."
"There are, however, serious doubts over the interpretation of Article 12(2a), which provides for the establishment of one-stop shops."
"The reservations concern, in particular, powers relating to making decisions on the possibilities of using particular rail networks."
"In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that some Member States have not yet deregulated access to their railway market."
"In view of the foregoing, I voted against the second part of Amendment 83."
"I voted in favour of the decision on the adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The modifications adopted by the plenary come into force on 1 December 2010."
"It became necessary to introduce the amendments to the Rules of Procedure in order to take into account the arrival of 18 new Members, the increase in legislative powers and the new budgetary procedure which puts Parliament on an equal footing with the Council."
"The other changes are about respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of subsidiarity, taking into account the growing influence of the national parliaments; the right of Parliament to propose modifications to the treaties; the procedure for nominating the President of the Commission, given that Parliament has more powers in this matter; the possibility of a Member State of the Union withdrawing and, finally, the violation of the basic principles by a Member State."
"I regret that the new rules of procedure have not been examined by a higher legal authority in order to make sure that they are in accordance with hierarchically superior documents, in particular, the treaties and the constitutions of the Member States."
"I am voting in favour of this proposal to adapt the Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Greater powers for Parliament have to be reflected in more responsibility."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is essential, as the European Union needs it to combine enlargement with deepening."
"With this treaty, it managed to do this in a balanced, credible and fair way, improving the consistency, legitimacy, democracy, effectiveness and transparency of decision making, clarifying the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States, and contributing to greater efficiency in inter- and intra-institutional relations within the EU."
"The changes in commitment achieved with this adaptation of the Rules of Procedure for the Treaty of Lisbon are largely the result of efforts by the Group of the European People's Party (PPE) to clarify and simplify the decision-making process in Parliament and its relationship with the national parliaments."
"The European institutions' great legislative output and the participative method by which such legislation is produced, the profusion of documents which is frequently involved, and the fact that the hierarchies between sources and legal standards are not always clear, make it essential for Parliament to lessen these risks by working towards the adequacy of their statute on the recent Treaty of Lisbon."
"I believe that this is necessary for the sake of clarity in procedures and legal certainty."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament needs to show that it has adapted to the new operating conditions and shared responsibility in decision-making processes."
"I would like to point out the impact of reinforcing Parliament's powers, the new makeup of national representation and the introduction of closer relations with national parliaments."
"I agree with the changes now proposed to the Rules of Procedure, also considering the simplification and clear determination of the regulatory procedures so as to further enhance responsiveness to the needs of the public, the institutions and the Member States, while also ensuring conditions for the efficient implementation of European policies."
"in writing. - I voted against Amendment 110, which envisages this House having cooperation with Member State parliaments but not with sub-Member State parliaments."
"This ignores the constitutional realities of some Member States; for example, although Flanders has taken an historic step this week towards independence, the Belgian Federal Parliament remains for now the 'national' parliament in EU terms."
"Nevertheless, in Belgian constitutional terms, the Flemish Parliament has full competence for certain EU matters."
"The amendment also ignores the political realities of other Member States: it is ridiculous that this House cannot fully cooperate with the Scottish Parliament on matters such as fisheries, where Scotland holds the biggest UK stake."
"The approval of the Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new responsibilities, and this means that it is necessary for it to adapt its internal Rules of Procedure to the new provisions."
"This provision thus makes Parliament's internal Rules of Procedure consistent with the new challenges thrown up by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The present adaptation of the Rules of Procedure is necessitated partly by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"To this extent, it is a formal act."
"However, in the course of these amendments, the two large groups - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - are attempting to curtail the rights of Members who do not belong to one of the large groups."
"This is particularly wrong and unfair, since it would be lost in the mire of the debate on the major adaptations to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For example, it is proposed that non-attached Members could no longer decide themselves who is to represent them, as is the case at present."
"This is a unique occurrence in democratic politics that is unacceptable."
"In any democratic parliament worthy of the name, a political group is allowed to decide its own representative on certain committees."
"However, here it is proposed that the President - who is a member of one of the two large political parties - should decide which of the non-attached Members should represent them at the Conference of Presidents."
"In other words, their political opponents will be able to choose a representative whose policy is nearest to their own."
"This is scandalous."
"In my opinion, the representative of the non-attached Members can only be chosen by a vote among the full assembly of non-attached Members."
"I therefore voted against the proposed amendment."
"Natural disasters which result in people losing their livelihoods and all their possessions are becoming increasingly common."
"People whose houses are flooded are particularly hard hit because the entire contents of the house are often damaged or destroyed."
"In addition, serious damage is caused to agricultural land, which costs huge amounts of money to put right."
"The people affected often have difficulty affording this or simply cannot pay for it at all."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important to provide help for people who have been hit by disaster."
"The European Parliament has taken a decision on the adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Of the amendments to Parliament's Rules of Procedure that have been adopted by the MEPs, there are some which provide for the arrival of 18 new MEPs from 12 Member States, for the strengthening of legislative powers and for the introduction of a new budget procedure, thereby putting Parliament on an equal footing with the Council."
"The amendments made to the Rules of Procedure also take account of the rules on the budget, insofar as Parliament will take decisions on this matter in cooperation with the Council."
"In particular, the amendments relate to the three-year financial framework, which will become a legislative act requiring the approval of Parliament, to the documents made available to Members, to the examination of the draft budget, to budget reconciliation, and to the definitive adoption of the budget."
"Moreover, changes that I regard as highly important relate to abiding by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the right of MEPs to table amendments to the treaties, the procedure for electing the President of the Commission and, above all, the deletion of specific provisions relating to the appointment of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I hope that these changes will be made to the text of the treaty before long, given the fundamental innovation that they represent for the entire Union."
"I am voting in favour of the David Martin Report following a long period of negotiation involving all the members of the Group of the European People's Party (PPE) Committee on Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member."
"The report focuses on changes that are needed to Parliament's internal Rules of Procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Following an initial vote at the November session, which secured the necessary changes that were directly related to the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force, the other amendments have been postponed so as to allow for a longer period of reflection."
"The PPE, the group to which the Social Democratic Party (PSD) belongs, has signed various compromise amendments, particularly regarding question time for the President and Vice-President of the Commission or the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the President of the Eurogroup, the implementation of the Members' statute, the revision of the treaties and delegated acts."
"I would, however, like to highlight the amendments relating to interparliamentary cooperation, the relationship between Parliament and national parliaments during the legislative process and the composition of Parliament's delegation to COSAC - three issues to which, as Vice-President of the PPE in charge of relations with national parliament, I have had to devote special attention."
"Today, Parliament is voting on the necessary adaptation of its internal Rules of Procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"After the vote at the November session, the vote on further amendments which are not directly related to the treaty's entry into force was postponed to this session."
"Twelve amendments were signed as a commitment by the Group of the European People's Party, to which I belong, related to several issues: question time for the President of the Commission and the High Representative of the European Union, written questions to the Council and the Commission, regular inter-parliamentary cooperation, the implementation of a Members' statute, the delegation to the Conference of European Affairs Committees, the revision of the treaties and the delegation of legislative power."
"I am voting in favour of further changes to the document, among which I would like to highlight the introduction of a provision on subsidiarity and proportionality in assessing the legislation and on Parliament's relationship with national parliaments during the legislative process."
"This second round of amendments ends the long process of adapting the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Although the amendments voted on today concern, to a lesser extent, the fundamental changes related to the treaty which have strengthened Parliament in the decision-making process, they are an important addition to the changes to the Rules of Procedure and allow us to use the new possibilities to the full."
"As with all changes, and particularly such important changes as those made to fundamental law, very much depends on the way they are implemented."
"The devil is in the detail, which is why it is so important to watch over this process to the very end."
"One of the fundamental objectives for 2011 will be maintaining, promoting and obtaining funding for technological research and development in the EU, providing sufficient funding for the framework programme, and thus contributing to the European 2020 strategy."
"The increase in the number of requests for funding has grown in proportion to the increase in control mechanisms set out in an attempt to ensure that Community funds are used correctly."
"Internal bureaucracy and the creation of ever more rules and administrative procedures reduce public confidence in the process."
"It is particularly difficult for smaller organisations such as SMEs, high-tech start ups, smaller institutes, universities and research centres to deal with this complexity."
"I would like to call for access to research funding to be made easier."
"A culture of mutual trust needs to be developed, involving all stakeholders."
"This will stimulate research and innovation, making Europe a more attractive place to live and work."
"The European Commission's draft budget for 2011 is not up to the challenges confronting Europe."
"When we have EUR 142 billion of commitments - that is, 1.15% of Europe's GNI - the Commission proposes to finance new priorities, as well as programmes already included in the financial framework for 2007-2013, by taking from the funds of existing programmes and from a budget margin that has been reduced to virtually nothing."
"The 2020 agenda for growth and employment, which is supposed to be the Union's road map for the next ten years, and the fight against climate change cannot truly take place without financial resources."
"It is not acceptable to finance the upcoming instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries by taking money from development aid."
"It is not realistic to reduce European financial aid for the Middle East peace process by a third."
"This is not a serious approach."
"We were expecting more boldness from the Commission."
"Yet the European Parliament is still waiting for a draft mid-term review of the financial perspectives, something that there is a great need for in Europe."
"This question must have a central role in the upcoming budgetary negotiations with the Council."
"The delegation of the Democratic Movement to Parliament will be fighting in favour of this."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote in favour of the mandate on negotiations for the 2011 budget."
"We largely agree with the priorities in the report."
"For example, we believe that it is important to invest in youth, research and innovation and green technology."
"We also believe that it is important for the new Europe 2020 strategy for growth and employment to be given sufficient financial resources to enable it to succeed."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we do not think it is necessary to increase direct agricultural subsidies."
"In addition, we are opposed to the EU giving permanent market support to the milk and dairy products industry."
"Parliament's role in negotiating the EU budget has been enhanced by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In this time of economic, financial and social crisis, funds to motivate the European Union's growth and competitiveness are crucial."
"In this context, it is important for the EU Solidarity Fund to be increased, provided that it is used effectively by governments, so as to mitigate the impact of this crisis on poorer regions."
"I recall that the budgetary process for 2011 was the first of its kind since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and that it indisputably requires greater cooperation and coordination with the other arm of the budgetary authority."
"I would like to highlight the concern and efforts made to ensure sufficient funding for the EU's strategic lines of development, especially in the fields of young people and innovation, alongside energy efficiency, combating climate change, and promoting employment and gender equality."
"I also believe that it is vital to ensure the viability of mechanisms that guarantee the sustainability of the agricultural sector."
"I am making special reference to the dairy sector."
"In the current context of crisis and the great pressure on the public finances of the Member States, I would like to reiterate the need to ensure budgetary sustainability in the EU in order to pursue the central objective of social and economic cohesion."
"However, I think that it is important for the draft budget for 2011 to reflect, from the outset, the financial implications of the flagship initiatives contained in the EU 2020 strategy. These include 'Innovation union', 'Youth on the move', 'Resource-efficient Europe', 'An agenda for new skills and jobs' and 'An industrial policy for the globalisation era'."
"We voted against this report on the draft budget for 2011 as it does not correspond in the least to the needs facing the financing of the European Union today, where the creation of the euro area has exacerbated social and territorial inequalities, and it does not take the principle of economic and social cohesion properly into account."
"In this time of crisis, there is an even greater need for another EU budget which at the very least doubles the funds so that at least half of the budget (calculated on the basis of 2% of the EU's gross national product) is devoted to investment in the productive sector and to supporting the social functions of the Member States."
"This would create more jobs with rights, combat poverty and reduce regional inequality in order to promote economic and social cohesion."
"On the other hand, it is also essential to increase rates of EU cofinancing for countries with weaker economies, particularly for social programmes and productive investment."
"Lastly, it is necessary to substantially reduce the amount of money set aside for the military and to change the core objectives of the budget so as to achieve balanced development and social progress."
"The draft budget for 2011 will be the first since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in preparing it there needs to be greater cooperation and coordination between all those involved during negotiations so that an agreement on total expenditure during the process can be reached."
"The trialogue to be held in July must be unequivocal in preparing the way so that the points where there should be a greater consensus can be identified in advance."
"The main points to keep in mind are the budgetary implications of the European Stabilisation Mechanism, the EU 2020 strategy and programmes concerning young people."
"The 2011 budget contains numerous points which are open to serious criticism."
"For example, the budget for the European Refugee Fund which, among other things, is promoting the resettlement of asylum seekers in the EU, is being increased, while the funding for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) is being cut."
"Financial aid for Palestine is also being reduced, but the budget for the EU accession candidates, including Turkey, for example, is being increased significantly."
"Therefore, I have voted against the report on the 2011 budget."
"in writing. - Our Group, Greens/EFA, did not oppose the rapporteur's priorities for the trilogue negotiations."
"We tabled some more detailed AM on the 'greening' of structural funds, rural development and agricultural policy which, unsurprisingly, were all rejected, but which can be reintroduced for the more detailed 1st budgetary reading of Parliament in September."
"Green MEPs from other committees have co-signed AM in the name of their respective committees."
"Again, due to the approach of the rapporteur not to unnecessarily inflate the text, most of those got voted down."
"I support the position of my group on this document by Parliament in response to the draft budget for 2011 proposed by the European Commission."
"We believe that it is impossible to clearly define the implications of the draft budget on the strategy's flagship initiatives, and that more and better information is needed."
"I am also pleased to see the inclusion of the youth programme as one of the priorities for the coming year in the Commission's draft, but I am disappointed that there has only been a token increase in funding, when more was expected from these initiatives."
"The Members for the outermost regions and I have supported an amendment as we believe that it is unacceptable that the budget for 2011 is less than that for 2010 with regard to the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity, especially during a period when the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and Colombia and Peru will have serious repercussions on banana, sugar and rum production."
"In doing so, we also call upon the Commission to promote a study on the impact of this situation on those regions as soon as possible."
"The report on the mandate for the trialogue on the 2011 draft budget, which was adopted today at the plenary sitting of the European Parliament, mentions six priorities for the budget negotiations for 2011. One of these are the programmes for young people, such as Youth on the Move, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action and Erasmus Mundus."
"In item 12 of the general remarks, the report points out that the increase in appropriations in the draft budget for those programmes, despite the very high current implementation rate (reaching between 95-100% every year over the period 2007-2009), is insufficient."
"I welcome the fact that the text which has been accepted calls for these appropriations to be increased, so that it will be possible to put the youth programmes into effect in a way which is appropriate to their significance for civil society in Europe."
"In spite of the economic crisis, which has forced Member States to make significant savings, the European Union continues to extend the range of its activity."
"However, this must be done while providing an appropriate level of funding for programmes which already exist."
"Mrs Jędrzejewska's report draws attention to this question, which, in my opinion, has rightly been recognised as a priority for the negotiations on the budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the mandate for the trialogue is of great importance for the European Parliament, because it defines Parliament's negotiating position."
"The budget for 2011 is heavily influenced by the crisis and the recession and this is clear, among other things, from the very tight margins."
"However, there are also positive signs. One of these is the priority given to youth programmes."
"If the European Union wants to find a sustainable route out of the crisis, it is essential for it to invest in young people, because they represent our future."
"In addition, given the economic situation in Europe, we must support a mandate for a socially balanced EU budget which also takes competitiveness into account. Thank you."
"As the recent economic and financial crisis has amply demonstrated, we need to implement a better regulated and more transparent strategy on derivative product markets to prevent excessively speculative situations."
"In particular, I welcome the rapporteur's proposal that centralised control should be put in the hands of the ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority, and the call for the costs of the future market infrastructure to be met by market participants and not contributors."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"In this resolution, the European Parliament calls for stricter supervision of the derivatives market."
"I supported it, because it seems to me to be crucial for Parliament to send a clear message to the Council and the Commission so that legislative measures are taken."
"The objective is to avoid excessive speculation by introducing a standardised procedure and supervisory bodies, as well as by using a common register of transactions."
"I voted for the own initiative report by my excellent German colleague, Werner Langen, on derivatives markets, which was drafted in response to the European Commission's communication on the same subject."
"I support the Commission's initiative aimed at improving the regulatory system relating to derivatives."
"It is imperative to give the future European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) a key role in the authorisation of clearing houses in the European Union by entrusting it with their supervision."
"I voted for this report because I feel that we have to increase transparency in the derivatives market (trade in future transactions) and ensure greater regulation of this market."
"Derivative instruments can play a useful role in allowing the transfer of financial risks within an economy, but as a result of the lack of transparency and regulation, they played an exacerbating role in the financial crisis."
"I welcome the Commission's initiative for better regulation of derivatives and, in particular, over-the-counter derivatives, with a view to reducing the impact of the risks for the stability of financial markets as a whole, and for standardisation of derivatives contracts, the use of centralised data storage and organised trading venues."
"Mr Langen's report proposes a set of measures that aim to make the derivative financial product market more transparent."
"In view of the way the financial crisis of 2008 came about and the fragility that such complex products have imposed on the markets, it is undoubtedly a promising step to introduce greater stability and transparency."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Langen report."
"We should nevertheless stress another point, which is a basic principle in any discussion of finance, the economic crisis and the market."
"Quite apart from any derivatives and intricate financial engineering, the 2008 crisis, which determined negative knock-on effects that still weigh heavily on our society, came about due to the fact that we mistakenly believed for all too long that we did not have to consider the real economy."
"I therefore welcome any current measure to promote the transparency of financial markets and products offered by banks and share markets, but we must all remember that we urgently need to rethink the economic system on which the world markets rest."
"Our choice must therefore be aimed at strengthening the real economy, the only certain source of wealth and lasting stability."
"I should like first of all to congratulate my friend and colleague, Mr Langen, on the draft report put to the vote today in this House."
"In the light of the financial and economic crisis, we have observed the dangers posed by certain financial instruments that are shamelessly used by the markets without any rules or restrictions."
"Many citizens and numerous local authorities, including in Italy, have fallen victim to these high risk instruments, and are now finding themselves with alarming budget deficits."
"In order to prevent such unfortunate situations, I believe it is appropriate, indeed necessary, to regulate derivatives properly, so as to have a more stable and secure market that enables operators and consumers to take informed decisions."
"The European Union must become the champion of a radical change from the financial policy of the past and must send out strong signals to prevent instruments such as over-the-counter derivatives from being able to jeopardise the entire financial market in future."
"Lastly, I support the guidelines set out by Mr Langen in the text adopted today, not least because financial derivatives are not just the prerogative of professionals in the sector, but are instruments for mass-market use."
"For this reason, stricter legislation will guarantee greater transparency, enabling 'market participants to price risks properly'."
"Tighter regulation of the derivatives markets must take into account the particular circumstances of companies, which must continue to ensure that their financial and operative risks are covered under favourable conditions and, in some way, adapted with the help of derivatives."
"Non-financial firms use these instruments to ensure that risks related to currency, interest and raw materials are covered."
"This protection, which is not speculative, has helped to bring about stability and growth in employment and investment."
"However, the regulatory measures proposed must not lead to an obvious deterioration in the coverage of risks for companies."
"I would like to call for exemptions and lower requirements in terms of capital in the case of bilateral derivatives, especially for SMEs."
"I voted against because, although the report contains positive points and tries to introduce some minimum restrictions and rules to the derivatives market, in reality, it does not fundamentally address the issue."
"One of the basic causes of economic and financial instability is the development and increase in non-banking transactions, which include risk premiums and other financial derivatives."
"The recent collapse of the money markets and speculation against Greek bonds showed not only that the financial system needs strict regulation, but also that certain transactions, such as risk premium transactions, should be banned."
"In my opinion, it would be wrong and not enough to turn our attention merely to 'regulatory policies', such as those presented in the report, which neither put the problem into perspective nor offer adequate solutions."
"The derivatives market, as has been proven with the economic, financial and social crisis that we are currently experiencing, needs efficient regulation which allows for greater transparency in the marketing of these financial instruments."
"These products must undergo more effective supervision so that trade in them does not have adverse effects on the market."
"Due to the variety of derivatives and the need to protect investors, I also support more stringent rules relating to information."
"I welcome the deployment of the European institutions to ensure the greatest possible efficiency, security and soundness in derivatives markets, in recognition of its importance for the sustainability of economic development, along with the need to ensure the regulation and verification of procedures and negotiations related to the transaction or commercialisation of these financial instruments."
"Given the size of the derivatives market and its impact on the global economy, as has become evident in the current economic and financial crisis - and the exponential rise of the risk component in the global market - I believe that ensuring transparency is crucial."
"This is vital not only for effective supervision of the markets, but also for clear, concise and complete reporting standards."
"The 'credit default swaps' from sovereign issuers used by financial speculators have led to unjustified levels of diverse national 'spreads'."
"This highlights the need for transparency in the market and enhanced European regulations concerning the negotiation of 'credit default swaps', particularly those related to sovereign debt."
"It is to be hoped that future legislation will bring not only transparency to the derivatives markets but also sound legislation."
"I would like to stress that the cost of future market infrastructures should be borne by those involved in the market, not by taxpayers."
"Instead of proposing the end of the derivatives market, the majority in Parliament have restricted themselves to defending the ban on speculative trading of credit default swaps (CDS) of sovereign debt."
"They urge the Commission to consider maximum risk limits for derivatives, particularly CDS, and to establish an agreement on them with its international partners."
"However, from what has been stated, the Commission can only present its proposal on derivates markets in September, and Parliament will legislate upon it on an equal footing with the Council."
"All this waiting is unfortunate when you watch the dramatic rises in interest rates that are implicit in the obligations of sovereign issuers in some euro area countries to unsustainable levels, knowing the negative effect that CDS have had on the whole process."
"We cannot continue to allow speculative securities based on sovereign debt."
"It is true that Parliament has advocated a ban on CDS - which are purely speculative transactions involving bets on the debtor's breach - today, but then it limited itself to requesting longer terms of imprisonment in the case of short sales of securities and derivatives."
"As far as we are concerned, therefore, we gave our support to the positive proposals, but we are against the backward position and the huge delay in regulating capital markets."
"I voted in favour of the Langen Report on derivatives markets because, like the rapporteur, I am certain that the sector needs to be regulated and that there needs to be greater transparency in the derivatives markets."
"I am particularly in favour of the idea of compulsory introduction of counterparty clearing facilities for handling derivatives transactions between market players."
"By standardising transactions and ensuring that the clearing houses are independent, very significant progress will be made."
"However, the regulatory mechanisms that will be introduced very shortly thanks to the collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament should not completely rein in the derivatives markets, which fulfil an important role in world finance."
"It is important to distinguish, as the rapporteur indeed does, between derivatives instruments that are used to cover risks directly associated with the companies' business and those that are used solely for speculative purposes."
"It is only the latter that are liable to pose a systemic risk and that should be suitably overseen in order to avoid a repeat of the kind of crises we have recently experienced."
"In the past, derivative instruments played an important role by transferring risk in the economy."
"However, the lack of transparency and regulation in the derivatives markets had an extremely pernicious effect on the financial crisis."
"One of the instruments that most affected European economies and led to increased interest on sovereign debt was CDS (credit default swaps)."
"This regulation upholds a ban on speculative trading using this instrument, as it can lead to distortion in the sovereign debt markets."
"It is of paramount importance to distinguish between derivatives products used as a tool for managing risk to cover a real underlying risk to the subject, and derivatives solely used for speculative purposes."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - I am glad the key paragraphs of the resolution remained in the text, mainly paragraphs 33, 34, 35 and 36, as well as recitals K, S and X. This is the reason why we voted in favour."
"Otherwise, if at least one of the separate votes had been rejected, we Greens would have voted against the report."
"in writing. - The key aspects of Mr Langen's report are acceptable."
"However, during the discussion in committee, there was much made of the dangers of the industry."
"Clearly, the size of derivative activity raises questions about how to regulate the industry, so transparency and a harmonised supervisory approach are regarded as very important factors."
"At the same time, it is unnecessary to raise the costs of trading by insisting on concentrating the clearing of such trades through single bourses."
"Fortunately, Mr Langen is well aware of the limits of such an approach which could place costs at up to ten times higher in a bourse than elsewhere."
"We also need to ensure that the so-called tailor-made derivative instruments allowing companies to hedge against future rises in commodity markets are maintained."
"We should also ensure international compatibility - especially with the USA, the largest market."
"The rapid development of the Internet is leading to the proliferation of interconnected objects available and exchangeable on the Internet."
"An 'Internet of Things' is thus being created, including everything from books to cars, and also taking in electrical appliances and food."
"This own initiative report by the European Parliament is intended as a response to the European Commission's communication, which contains 14 measures to be taken in order to ensure that the EU takes the lead in the development of these new networks of interconnected objects."
"Parliament's report pays particular attention to the question of respect for privacy, the ways in which the Internet of Things can benefit the quality of life of European consumers, and the accessibility and inclusive character of the Internet of Things."
"As I am completely in agreement with these priorities, I voted in favour of this own initiative report."
"Developments in information and communications technology (ICT) have brought about a veritable revolution in the field of knowledge over the last 20 years, above all, due to the public's increasing familiarity with the Internet and the World Wide Web."
"Now we have put knowledge on the Internet and eliminated the effects of distance in the exchange of information, the latest frontier of this technology is the possibility of combining a new radio frequency identification system with products, so that products can instantly release information to consumers."
"I am in favour of implementing pilot projects to examine the ethical and social consequences of this new IT resource, which could represent a new employment sector in the future, and I therefore support Mrs Badia i Cutchet's report."
"I welcome the general thrust of the notice presented by the Commission."
"Developing new applications and the very operation of the 'Internet of Things', along with the massive impact this will have on the everyday life and habits of the European public, is very closely linked to the confidence that European customers have in the system."
"It is a matter of priority to ensure a legal and regulatory framework which, on the one hand, protects the European consumer and, on the other, promotes public and private investment in the sector of the 'Internet of Things'."
"The 'Internet of Things' represents a great opportunity in economic terms, as it will allow us to optimise production processes and energy consumption, as well as creating new jobs and new services for an increasing number of European citizens and businesses."
"If the EU really wants to have a leading position in this market, it should adopt a proactive approach in this field by stimulating research and pilot projects."
"The rapid and uninterrupted growth of the Internet has meant that now, approximately 1.5 billion people are connected through computers and mobile devices."
"The next step is moving towards a progressive transformation of a network of interconnected computers to a network of interconnected objects - the Internet of Things - from books to cars, from household appliances to food."
"For example, a fridge might be programmed to recognise expired or nearly expired products."
"These technological innovations can help to respond to the various expectations of society and the public, as well as acting as a catalyst for growth and innovation, providing benefits for the economy and public well-being."
"However, it needs to be subject to specific and far-reaching regulations which will allow this Internet of Things to respond to the challenges of trust, acceptance and security."
"It is vital to ensure full respect for private life and the protection of personal data."
"Sufficient data protection measures must be put in place to safeguard against possible misuse and other risks associated with personal data."
"For this reason, I support this proactive approach, without forgetting that the Internet of Things is aimed at benefiting people first and foremost."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The development of the Internet of Things both represents a great opportunity for growth and competitiveness and leads to major social change, with a significant impact on citizens' behaviour."
"For this reason, I welcome the Commission's intention to publish a communication in 2010 on respect for privacy and trust in the information society, since in my view, it is crucial to permanently monitor aspects relating to personal data protection."
"Equally important is the debate on the technical and legal aspects of the right to 'chip silence'."
"Furthermore, in view of the profound changes that the Internet of Things will entail, it is essential that we allow for the uniform development of technologies at regional level, so as to avoid creating divides that are even greater than those that currently exist, and that we duly involve governments in this process and pay attention to the outermost regions."
"Lastly, I believe it is important to increase European funding for the Internet of Things in the context of research projects under the Seventh Framework Programme and pilot projects under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and also to focus on the development of broadband infrastructure, the roll-out of broadband and the further reduction of data roaming costs."
"I voted for the 'Report on the Internet of Things' because I felt that adopting this report will boost the development of an innovative technology in the European Union."
"This will offer business opportunities to European companies and provide benefits in the form of combating climate change and improving energy and transport management."
"As shadow rapporteur, I tabled amendments which will help protect personal data in order to prevent it from being used for other purposes by the companies which can access it."
"Consequently, the report contains important provisions for defending citizens' fundamental rights"
"The Internet of Things is a concept of the future rooted in the present."
"Whether this 'works' for the benefit of all citizens in a harmonised, efficient manner varies according to our views."
"The new system for integrating technologies into everyday life must be implemented in strict compliance with the consumers' rights to privacy."
"The Commission must consult all the time with the Data Protection Working Group and not only when it deems it necessary."
"We are talking about devices and technologies capable of transmitting an object's position, features and identity."
"Along with the right to silence, these mechanisms must only be integrated at the individual's request and not as a standard production feature."
"At the same time, the Commission must take into account, when a decision is being made on implementing projects pertaining to the Internet of Things, which network is going to be selected for connecting these objects."
"At present, we are facing numerous cyber attacks on the Internet."
"As far as I see it, using the World Wide Web to connect to the Internet of Things may pose a security risk and place a considerable burden on the current network."
"The development of a parallel network for connecting objects may provide the solution in the current situation through sharing the digital spectrum and dividend."
"I voted in favour of the Badia i Cutchet report in support of the creation of an Internet of Things."
"I believe that new information technologies have significant benefits for our society, but it is important to ensure that the potential impacts on health and the environment are taken into account, along with aspects related to the protection of privacy."
"The Internet has become part of daily life for millions of people, and today it plays an irreplaceable role as a means of communication and as a vehicle for transmitting information and knowledge."
"The exponential increase in content on the Internet has made it a tool with many uses, and these uses are multiplying."
"Simultaneously, however, it has also become the setting for a new type of crime that benefits from the speed and dematerialisation of information flows and the massive volume of personal data made available by network users."
"I share the concerns included in the resolution on the need to address restrictions on Internet access for political reasons as well as bringing about greater security for children and adolescents in using the network."
"I agree with the view that the use and ongoing management of the network should be up to private individuals, but I believe that the Member States cannot exempt themselves from being present and active in a regulatory role. The aim of this would be primarily to prevent the abuse and violation of citizens' rights."
"The impact of new technology on the public's security and quality of life is indisputable, and this highlights both the benefits and the risks that it entails."
"In this context, the 'Internet of Things' involves a new set of advantages for people, without impeding the identification of possible risks inherent in a tool with great potential."
"I would like to emphasise the approach of stimulating research and launching pilot projects, along with making the most of opportunities that are arising, particularly in optimising energy saving, production processes, creating new jobs and challenges."
"However, it is vital that the EU has a common frame of reference to reinforce the provisions relating to overseeing the system, confidentiality, information security, ethical management, privacy, collection and storage of personal data and consumer information."
"The rapid evolution of the 'Internet of Things' calls for governance of it that is safe, transparent and multilateral."
"Given this, I share the Commission's concerns with regard to safety, personal data protection and privacy for members of the public, along with the governance of the 'Internet of Things' for the sake of respecting privacy and personal data protection."
"The Internet of Things is a project that was started in 1999 in the US."
"It is increasingly growing in popularity, and it is expected that over the next 10 to 15 years, it will revolutionise person-object and object-object interaction through the growing use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology."
"The process of developing the Internet of Things, with all the innovation and positive aspects that it can bring to our everyday lives, also has a great margin of uncertainty, both at a conceptual and technical level, which merits some concerns."
"The technology behind this step, RFID, is called a tag: an electric component made of a chip and an antenna."
"The chip, only a few millimetres wide, can contain, receive and transmit information without any cable connection."
"This raises several issues about ownership, management and privacy, among others."
"On the issue of privacy and data protection, the rapporteur points out the 'importance of ensuring that all fundamental rights - not only privacy - are protected in the process of developing the Internet of Things, which we think is a positive view."
"However, we have serious doubts about the management of this data."
"The way ahead is still unclear, and so we have abstained from voting."
"in writing. - As technology becomes ever more advanced, it is important that the EU and other policy makers keep abreast of developments."
"This report covers a number of important topics such as privacy and health issues and I fully support the rapporteur's call for the EU to be proactive in this sphere."
"So-called information and communication technologies (ICT) have played an important role in promoting social development, economic growth, research, innovation and creativity in public and private European bodies."
"The rapid changes that the Internet has undergone in recent years have led to new concerns and the need for the European Union to have a common frame of reference to reinforce the existing provisions relating to running the system, particularly concerning confidentiality, information security, ethical management, privacy, and the collection and storage of personal data and consumer information."
"Given this, it is vital that the authority in charge of the 'Internet of Things' respects the safety, data protection and the privacy of whoever uses it, as only such an approach can bring benefits to EU citizens."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"One and a half billion people are already online and use the Internet."
"The Internet represents the onslaught of a new kind of networking technology that aims to bring about some sort of communication between people and objects, as well as between objects and objects."
"Information on products is to be stored, received and sent."
"It is to be feared, however, that all the advantages of the new technology will be outweighed by the disadvantages."
"It must be ensured that the private sphere remains protected and that personal data cannot be misused."
"However, it appears that future network users will be even more vulnerable than they already are."
"I voted in favour of the report because the measures proposed by the author on the protection of the private sphere and of personal data are clearly needed."
"It is always important with new technological developments, in this case, the so-called Internet of Things, to address ethical issues alongside possible benefits and to protect personal rights."
"This report is moving in this direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"The Internet which only began to be used more widely two decades ago has become an inseparable part of society like telephone or radio."
"Today, 1.5 billion people are connected to the Internet, and in a few years, it will be twice as many."
"Soon, the latest technology will allow not just computers to be connected to the net, but also cars, or even books, food and other items."
"Once a car has been connected to the net, it would be possible to give the driver information on tyre pressure."
"Programmed refrigerators will be able to recognise products past their expiry date."
"I voted for this report because the Internet of Things will revive the economy shackled by the crisis and will help to create new jobs and new services for an increasing number of EU citizens and companies."
"This will also allow us to optimise manufacturing processes and save energy which is very important in the fight against climate change."
"in writing. - We Greens have strongly supported this report by our socialist colleague, Badia i Cutchet."
"It will be an important new application of Internet technology."
"In the next 10-15 years, it is predicted that the Internet of Things will enter our daily lives."
"It uses RFID (radio frequency identification) technology to receive and transmit information wirelessly."
"It works with a tiny chip which has the capacity to store a lot of information about the object or the person on which it has been placed."
"In the agri-food sector, for example, RFID allows better and faster product traceability, and provides information about content: chemical characteristics, gluten levels, etc."
"This new technology will revolutionise and widen person-to-thing and thing-to-thing interaction."
"The innovation lies in the thing-to-thing relationship."
"The most commonly cited practical example of this is that of fridges which, if suitably programmed, will be able to detect any product past, or approaching, its use-by date."
"Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important."
"We must use all our strength to combat the availability of child pornography in communications networks."
"The permanent and effective control of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a precept of the rule of law."
"The German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is necessary to remove such criminal content as quickly as possible."
"I voted in favour of this own initiative report, which aims to influence the upcoming forum on the governance of the Internet, to be held in Vilnius from 25 to 29 September."
"Parliament is asking the forum, while carrying out its work, to increase the participation of developing countries and, on the other hand, to coordinate its work with national and regional forums."
"It also calls on the EU to develop a strategy on the fundamental aspects of the governance of the Internet, as well as to encourage reform of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)."
"I have no alternative but to vote in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner on the need to ensure ethical and secure governance of the Internet."
"The tool that has bridged time and distance for communications offers enormous potential benefits yet is, at the same time, a daily source of risks to both personal data protection and to children."
"It is essential to ensure the free circulation of information and communication, but in the certainty that the weakest individuals and most sensitive data continue to receive proper protection."
"Only in this way can the Internet continue to be the driving force behind positive social change and respect the dignity of each individual."
"The Internet is a 'global public good', and the management and control of it exercised by a certain government has attracted a great deal of criticism."
"The European Union should develop a strategy that reflects a consensus view of the fundamental aspects of Internet governance and one which can be firmly defended on the international stage and in its bilateral relations with the US."
"I support the European Commission's favourable stance towards the current management model based on leadership in the private sector."
"I would also like to call for greater involvement from developing countries, particularly through funding for their participation."
"The Internet has had a massive impact on society and public life over the last 20 years."
"The EU is a good example of this, as it represents just over 7% of the world population, but it accounts for almost 19% of Internet users at global level."
"Governing the Internet has been a top priority in public policy, seeking to ensure that the public can enjoy the full potential of the Internet while, at the same time, seeking the best solutions to the problem of inappropriate or illegal content, along with providing sufficient protection for consumers and trying to resolve problems of jurisdictional authority in an online global sphere."
"I fully agree with the idea that the Internet is a global public good which should always protect and respect the public interest."
"It is vital that the EU develops a strategy on the fundamental aspects of governing the Internet, and I support the Spanish Presidency's initiative to draft a 'European charter on the rights of Internet users'."
"It is important to move towards an internal reform of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers so that it has a more representative structure, with greater control by the international community, as well as being more accountable and transparent."
"I voted in favour of the report on governance of the Internet, which covers sensitive issues such as the protection and safeguarding of fundamental rights and freedoms, Internet access and use, and cybercrime."
"The Spanish Presidency's proposal of the creation of a European charter on the rights of Internet users and the recognition of a fifth fundamental freedom (freedom of access to the network) could give the EU more efficient instruments that would allow it to guarantee greater protection for security-related issues, on the one hand, and widespread and non-discriminatory access to the network, on the other."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose to abstain in the vote on the wording concerning the blocking of websites."
"We believe that these measures may be justified in some situations, for example, in relation to crimes involving child pornography, but the reference in the text in question to blocking websites in the case of cybercrime was far too wide-ranging for us to be able to vote in favour of it."
"It is an indisputable fact that the Internet now has a public role, influencing not only daily life but also mass movements, political ideas and communication strategies."
"It is true to say that the Internet has taken on an irreplaceable public role, and this cannot be ignored by the Member States of the European Union."
"They should call for greater access and participation in the governance of the Internet without undermining the leading role of private use and daily management of the network in doing so, as this has proved essential for the vitality and growth of the Internet."
"The role of the Member States are becoming more important, as are issues relating to cybercrime and protecting the security of users and their privacy, along with the public's freedom of access and expression through the Internet."
"Given the ever-increasing prominence of the Internet in the daily life of the public and the institutions, and even in the running of various countries, along with its impact on economic, cultural, social and human development, the governance of the Internet is a matter of paramount importance on the world stage."
"This means that it is extremely important for the European Union to safeguard conditions for active intervention in this area and to protect the public good and its values and principles."
"In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, stressing the importance of widening representation of global diversity in the bodies that currently control the Internet market, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)."
"This report arises from the important role of the Internet, which has become an indispensable tool for promoting democratic initiatives, political debate, digital literacy and the dissemination of knowledge."
"Internet access both ensures and depends on the exercising of a number of fundamental rights, including respect for private life, data protection, freedom of expression and association, freedom of the press, non-discrimination, education and cultural and linguistic diversity."
"The report therefore points out that institutions and stakeholders at all levels have a general responsibility to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to participate in the information society."
"It also deals with the threats posed by cybercrime to societies that use information and communications technology, noting the increase in incitement to commit terrorist attacks, hate crimes and child pornography."
"This puts the public, including children, at risk, and the report states that 'the role of public bodies should be strengthened when defining overall strategy'."
"Lastly, it shows concern with the structure of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is hardly representative, and the limited control which the international community, including the EU, is able to exert on the operation of ICANN."
"in writing. - This report recognises the importance of the Internet in promoting cultural diversity and encouraging democratic citizenship."
"For democratic values to be promoted, however, it is vital that governments refrain from imposing censorship and I therefore welcome the provisions of paragraph 13."
"The debate on Internet governance is certainly of particular importance in the situation where this means of communication has become absolutely essential in many countries in both people's professional and personal life."
"It is precisely for this reason that it is, at the very least, totally lacking in imagination for us to leave the strategic decisions concerning the Internet exclusively to a private company over in the US."
"The report which we voted on today is vital for creating a governance model which also involves end consumers."
"I believe that we need to encourage cooperation between universities and the business world, including at local, regional and national level."
"At the same time, we must also get actors involved from the Asian market, bearing in mind the extremely rapid rate of development of this area."
"Furthermore, it is important for us to devote a great deal of attention to finding a balance between protecting users' privacy and recording personal data on different websites, not only because of the emergence of social networks, but also because of the development of online shopping."
"Another extremely important fact is that the Internet provides an excellent vehicle for promoting Europe's cultural heritage and values, as well as a driving force for innovation, enabling us to narrow the gap in relation to other regions in the world."
"I welcome the recitals of this report, which make the Internet a global public good that must be governed in the common interest."
"The report highlights the importance of the Internet in political debate."
"It is for the sake of these aptly mentioned principles that I voted against this text."
"Indeed, how can we advocate respect for the common interest, on the one hand, and call for shared public-private governance that does not hinder free competition, on the other?"
"Although this text has the virtue of pointing out the importance of the general interest, it achieves the opposite result."
"Euro-liberal dogmatism spells disaster for Europe."
"Today, the Internet is a global tool, so the administration of it should take account of the common interest."
"Today, the Internet is one of the main means of disseminating democratic values throughout the world, and it is an indispensable tool for promoting all kinds of ideas, political debate and the spread of knowledge."
"It is therefore crucial that the Internet is developed in such a way that everyone within the EU has more equal access to it."
"It is also vital that it is safe for all users, especially children, who are less able to protect themselves against potential dangers arising from its use."
"If we are to maintain the Internet's status as a global public good, we must avoid a scenario where it is dominated by an individual entity or group of organisations."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Where the Internet is concerned, we must, on the one hand, uphold the principle of freedom of expression, while fighting cybercrime and its abuses, on the other."
"However, we must not end up storing data in the name of fighting crime and terrorism where there is no basis for suspicion."
"The Internet has specifically given rise to new problems, such as that of data protection on social networking sites or in connection with projects such as Google Street View."
"The problems of the latest developments on the Internet were scarcely considered, which is why I abstained from voting."
"Τhe Internet is a global public commodity and should function on the criterion of public interest."
"A specific Internet governance infrastructure needs to be created, so as to safeguard its security, integrity and authenticity and reduce the possibility of cyberspace attacks."
"Open global cooperation on Internet governance is needed and we need to draft a European Charter of Internet Users' Rights and recognise the fifth fundamental freedom of the EU: access to the Internet."
"That is why I voted today in favour of the report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on Internet governance, noting that the EU should adopt a strategy that includes access to the Internet without discrimination and safeguards the neutrality of the Internet, respect for privacy, data protection, freedom of expression and protection for minors."
"Particular emphasis should be placed on the group of the population that is most vulnerable to attacks in cyberspace and the necessary restrictions should be imposed to protect minors to the greatest possible extent and to promote international cooperation in the fight against illegal and harmful Internet content."
"The Internet has now become an instrument that is crucial to the development of the internal market, which is the cornerstone of the European Union's growth and development."
"Moreover, more than 60% of the European population now has access to the world of information technology."
"It seems necessary, therefore, for the Union to spearhead the debate on Internet governance, thereby guaranteeing that a service that has become essential for social and commercial interaction duly reflects the Union's values, such as protection of consumers and minors."
"For this reason, I support the content and the proposals of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner."
"First of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur on his report and its excellent timing given the proximity of the next meeting of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), which will be taking place in the EU for the first time."
"The EU has been taking part in the IGF since its inception, but the fact that it is being held in Vilnius makes our delegation even more relevant."
"It is five years this year since the IGF was created and, in accordance with the Tunis Agenda, it will have to decide whether or not to continue."
"The EU's delegation has already expressed in Sharm-el-Sheikh its agreement that the IGF should continue in its current form because of the important role that it plays as an instrument for open dialogue between all the actors involved in Internet governance."
"This must continue to be our position in the debates that are to take place in Vilnius."
"As regards the other issues such as the development of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers that will doubtless occupy an important place in the upcoming forum's debates, Mr Sosa Wagner's report makes it very clear what agreed position we representatives of the Europeans institutions will be arguing together at the IGF."
"in writing. - I have voted against at the final vote of this report because it included the promotion of governmental interference with Internet governance, which is not exactly the Green position."
"Combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is vitally important."
"We must make every effort to prevent child pornography being made available over the Internet."
"The permanent and effective prevention of child abuse is both a political responsibility and a principle of the rule of law."
"The members of the German Free Democratic Party in the European Parliament are of the opinion that criminal content of this kind must be deleted as quickly as possible."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Sosa Wagner report as the EU should show strong leadership on all aspects of Internet governance in the international arena."
"This report maintains the EU's emphasis on the need for the security and stability of the global Internet, the respect for human rights, freedom of expression, privacy, protection of personal data and the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity."
"I voted in favour of the report on Internet governance but I abstained on the paragraph that calls for priority to be given to the protection of intellectual property rights holders by putting them on a par with consumers."
"Good Internet governance must, in fact, guarantee access for all to assets, notably cultural assets, within a digital environment, but this cannot be achieved to the detriment of the rights of creators and, in particular, of authors."
"These rights cannot be treated as mere intellectual property rights; authors should be able to choose the way in which they want people to access their works."
"Furthermore, the privacy of users and creativity must also be guaranteed."
"Therefore, it is crucially important to strike a balance between the rights of users and the rights of creators so that individuals can flourish as informed citizens, consumers and creators."
"Although I voted in favour of this resolution, I noticed the qualifications made about certain regions, particularly the outermost regions, in terms of access to innovation."
"Difficulties related to a lack of critical mass must be taken into account in order to encourage better use of the potential for areas such as research and innovation in these regions."
"The unique characteristics of the ORs in terms of geography and climate are particular advantages in terms of the development of specific activities in the areas of biodiversity, marine resources, climate change, renewable energy, water, the environment, natural resources, health and new technologies."
"In terms of natural resources and biodiversity, in particular, the ORs allow European research privileged access to tropical ecosystems endowed with a unique biodiversity and agriculture."
"This enables research to be carried out within the context of the European Research Area as 'natural laboratories'."
"They are also good places for experimentation."
"Despite the possibilities of many regions and all the effort put into them, many continue to have more difficulties than other regions in improving factors that contribute to competitiveness, growth and employment, as per the Lisbon Strategy, especially within the context of research and development."
"Mr President, I support Mr Winkler's position, for which I voted in favour, on the revision of EU policy to promote innovation."
"I particularly agree with the desire to provide a broad-ranging strategy that concerns not only technological innovation but also administrative, organisational and social innovation."
"To this end, I feel that the involvement of the financial world and small and medium-sized enterprises in defining measures for the promotion of innovation is crucial, as is the attention devoted to political and economic goals at regional level."
"This own initiative report looks at the Community measures taken in the field of innovation policy and establishes a number of priorities for defining a new innovation policy."
"Among these, Parliament expresses a wish for innovation not to be limited to technological aspects, but also to cover administrative, organisational and social innovations."
"It also emphasises the development of new innovation indicators that are better adapted to economies increasingly based on knowledge."
"Finally, and I think that this is an important point, the report is in favour of improving the effects of synergy between the framework programmes for research and innovation and the Structural Funds."
"As I fully agree on the directions advocated by this report, I supported it in the vote."
"I voted for the own initiative report by my German colleague, Hermann Winkler, which was drafted following the European Commission's communication entitled 'Reviewing Community innovation policy in a changing world'."
"Innovation is the key factor in successfully responding to the major societal and environmental challenges currently faced by the Union and in achieving its strategic political objectives."
"We will not achieve our energy and climate objectives by 2020 without speeding up the development and the general application of proper, durable and efficient energy technologies."
"I support the strengthening of dialogue between universities and businesses."
"As regards budgetary aspects, at the level of static public sector funding, we must make innovation policy more Community-based."
"I supported this report."
"Scientific research and innovation are the key to successfully meeting the EU's current grand societal and environmental challenges and realising its strategic political goals in areas including competitiveness, climate change, employment, demographic change and many others. In order to remain competitive, the EU must invest in sustainable technologies, ensuring that they receive the required funding."
"Until now, Europe has lagged far behind in the area of scientific research and innovations, because this area is very fragmented and there are differences between scientific research and innovations and market replication."
"I feel that the European Commission's future plan for innovations must resolve the issues of private sector financing of scientific research and innovations, which would allow companies to create innovative products and services and adapt them in the market."
"Whether they concern products or processes and are radical or incremental, nowadays, innovations are the driving force behind the competitiveness of up-to-date economic and business systems that strive for efficiency and sustainability."
"The research that underpins each innovative action and discovery must therefore be supported, particularly when it succeeds in bringing together small and medium-sized enterprises and the world of new technology."
"For this reason, I can only support the own initiative report drafted by Mr Winkler, which introduces a third agent to close the knowledge triangle, in other words, consumers."
"We need reference points within the constant situation of flux we experience in our lives nowadays."
"Therefore, it is important that growth and the competitiveness of the economic and social system always remain on a human scale."
"At the moment, less than 1% of the European Union's budget goes on innovation."
"This is the current state of affairs at a time when Europe has realised that its future lies within the knowledge triangle of research-innovation-education."
"The European Parliament's request to increase the resources allocated to innovation is absolutely justified in these circumstances."
"We are approaching the time for looking at the financial projections for the 2014-2020 period and must take this request into consideration."
"Transforming Europe's economy into a sustainable economy must make European companies more competitive and allow new opportunities to emerge for national economies as a result of the economic and ecological challenges facing Europe."
"Moreover, and especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, it is crucially important for companies' innovative capacity that more funding should be made available at both EU and national level and that appropriate financial instruments should be created."
"Splitting resources across a host of objectives and a series of specific EU initiatives has not produced satisfactory results so far."
"Funding must be directed at those areas where the boomerang effect is greatest."
"The key criterion here must be added value for Europe."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Winkler, on his excellent work."
"Innovation and research, like education and training, are the key elements that will enable Europe to compete positively in a more technologically competitive world."
"However, so far, only 1% of the EU's budget has been earmarked for this sector, a percentage that is not enough to address the difficult challenges that Europe is having to face."
"It is time for the European Union to invest more in the field of research and innovation."
"I do believe that we can overcome the economic crisis and making more funds available is one way of doing this."
"I also believe it is important to provide incentives for and encourage private investment in technological innovation, because only by carrying out research will we be able to have a competitive market that can withstand the increasing number of relocations."
"Lastly, I support the plans for 'instruments which are tailored to the needs of their users' and a reduction in red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises, which should foster decisive technological innovation."
"Innovation policy must address the great social problems that we are facing, bringing together all those involved."
"It is essential to invest in knowledge and in reforms that promote technological progress, research, innovation, education and training to promote prosperity, growth and employment in the medium and long term."
"The struggle against new challenges requires an innovative approach to implementing new technology, along with an innovative approach to social issues at an organisational level."
"I would like to make a call for efforts to be stepped up so that we can move from technological innovation to social innovation - innovation in public services and in the different regions."
"Intelligent growth based on the knowledge and innovation economy requires concrete measures on the part of supranational and national institutions."
"Enhanced policies to support entrepreneurs in the research sector must be accompanied by policies to encourage investment in new experiments, in an effort to ensure that among other things, there are skilled workers ready to compete in the European labour market."
"At the same time as asking countries to invest more heavily in research, we should offer them a European regulatory framework that is both general and specific, with common, coordinated development guidelines and instruments for monitoring whether the funding is producing the desired results."
"I propose and support regulation at European level of apprenticeship, training and vocational measures, which some countries have already incorporated into their educational systems, as well as the 'rights and duties' measures in the field of education."
"If, however, we are to aim for 3% of GDP to be allocated to research funding, we need the world of academia to provide more guarantees as regards, for instance, the academic productivity of lecturers, and we must prevent the piecemeal apportionment of resources, which has given rise in recent years to the improper and disproportionate use of already limited funds, with unsatisfactory results."
"I agree, lastly, on the need to work towards a single patent court system, in order to standardise rights at supranational level."
"Innovation has an especially important place in modern society."
"A society based on innovation can avert possible crises, both socio-economic and natural."
"Consequently, it is vital for an innovation policy to be able to facilitate society's progress and not make it stagnate due to the use of various bureaucratic ploys."
"As Mr Winkler specifies in his report, innovation nowadays must also take into account the social value it brings."
"I believe that the innovations of the 21st century must also consider the impact they have on the individual and society in general."
"Innovations such as the 'Internet of Things', for example, must take into account and respect the right to privacy and protection for the individual's personal data."
"European society must not become a 'Big Brother' society."
"On the contrary, the innovations made must help people communicate freely in an open society."
"The contribution made by technological and social innovations actually underlies our progress."
"This is the reason why I am asking the Commission to deal with this matter with maximum accountability and present a vision for drafting an innovation action plan for the future."
"The significance of knowledge and innovation have been gaining prominence as part of the political agenda and in political jargon, and there are few today who dare to question the importance of investment in this field and the need to link up knowledge, innovation, businesses and jobs."
"The risk of unanimity around this concept is, however, that it will become deflated, as has happened with other fads such as the environment, economic sustainability or supporting entrepreneurship."
"These topics cover pages of election manifestos and programmes and almost always end up losing any distinguishing feature that they might have had, being mere statements of fact."
"In this regard, despite serious efforts by the government on certain aspects, I must draw attention to the negative technological populism from which the Prime Minister of Portugal seems to suffer."
"It would be better to concentrate more on content and less on proclamations to do with improvements in working conditions and scientific production, and to remember that while competitive effort calls for ambition, it also requires a realistic approach."
"Today, it is universally accepted that innovation is vital for the success and sustainability of economic and social development and the success of European integration."
"The importance of innovation, which must always be coupled with research and education, has become even more obvious in the face of the increasingly rapid pace of development in global and human reality."
"In view of this, I support this report for the revision of EU innovation policy, stressing the urgent need for the EU to concentrate its efforts on leveraging resources in this area."
"I would also like to point out the importance of incentives for the private sector and a comprehensive, cross-cutting strategy for achieving European innovation policy as a priority."
"We agree with several aspects of this report, although the way in which it is formulated does not always focus on the most important issues."
"For example, we agree that innovation is only one of the elements needed to overcome the challenges that we face today, at both social and at global environmental level, and that there are other areas that are equally important for society."
"However, the priority which is given to each of the areas included in the so-called Europe 2020 strategy, such as business activity, employment, demographic change and an inclusive society, is such that the document and the analysis of necessary innovation in a changing world falls far short of what is needed to promote real economic and social cohesion, growth in productivity, job creation and wage recovery in the Member States, all of which we believe to be crucial."
"That is why we abstained."
"In the communication review of EU policy on innovation in a changing world, issued on 2 September 2009, the European Commission outlines the developments that have taken place since 2005 in the field of EU innovation policy."
"It is now to be expected that certain aspects of the proposed Action Plan for Innovation to be presented shortly will be taken up again and implemented."
"The report on the challenges facing European Union innovation policy is a very good document which has raised the most important questions related to this issue."
"Together with my colleagues from the S&D Group, I endorsed the report, including Amendment 46, which calls on the Commission and Member States to coordinate their efforts to reach agreement on a Community patent and a single patent court system."
"This matter has been dragging on for many years, and for many years the same arguments have been repeated in favour of a common patent, along with the same contentious questions (for example, how many languages should European patents be translated into?)."
"Some legal questions have been clarified since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force."
"We are going to have two regulations: one about the patent itself, and the other about the language system."
"On top of this, however, there is the matter of the patent court system, the establishment of which will require regulation of the relationship between the European Union and the European Patent Organisation in a way which is in accordance with the competences of EU institutions, including the European Parliament."
"Without going into details on the patent system, which will, no doubt, be the subject of numerous discussions, I would like to stress that this issue is one of the most important challenges of the current term of the European Parliament."
"Therefore, I think that at each step, we should call on the other institutions to start constructive cooperation in this area, which is just what Mr Winkler's report does."
"in writing. - The Winkler report deals with a number of important issues, including ecological innovation and green enterprise."
"In view of the challenges facing our planet, it is clear that innovation in these fields is of vital importance."
"My own country, Scotland, is at the forefront of many aspects of ecological innovation, particularly in the area of renewable energy."
"The Scottish Government has instituted a £10 million Saltire Prize aimed at boosting innovation in tide and wave energy and this fits nicely into wider EU efforts to have a suitable policy in a changing world."
"As a result of global competition to attract investment, not only certain production plants but also the research and development capacities associated with them are increasingly being relocated to third countries."
"This trend is a fundamental threat to Europe as a location for industry."
"It needs to be countered, through the determined promotion of innovative potential, before it becomes irreversible."
"According to the Commission, less than 1% of the EU budget is currently spent directly on innovation-related measures."
"Given the social challenges that lie ahead, this is insufficient."
"Therefore, I agree with calls for an increase in the EU budget for innovation."
"This should be reflected in the planning process in connection with the 2014-2020 financial perspective."
"Moreover, and especially against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, it is crucially important for companies' innovative capacity that more funding should be made available at both EU level and national level, and that financial instruments should be created which are tailored to the needs of their users."
"In order to make innovation policy more effective, the various support instruments need to be better coordinated and properly linked, with a leaner management structure; in other words, financial support must be better targeted."
"Without the continuous introduction of innovations, there is no chance of development."
"There is a need for innovative measures in every area of the economy and social life - from novel therapeutic methods and increasingly rapid means of communication to new ideas in industry and science and alternative methods of obtaining energy."
"This is particularly significant in the face of the global economic crisis and the problem of an ageing society."
"I would like to point out that apart from the cross-sectoral nature of innovation policy, the initiative of citizens is also important."
"The innovativeness of small and medium-sized enterprises, and also of farms, is an essential element for the creation of a competitive economy."
"While caring for the rapid development of the economy, and this includes care for the environment, we should not forget people and the lack of social equality, because these differences may become greater and could work against measures for development."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the current transformation of the European economy into a sustainable economy must make our European businesses more competitive."
"It is essential for the economic challenges to be transformed into new opportunities for the national economies."
"Combating the increase in relocations to third countries, not only of production facilities but also of their associated research and development capabilities, must become one of our objectives."
"Alongside the policy aim of competitiveness, the European Union also needs to tackle other major challenges that face our societies today, including climate change and demographic change."
"To date, less than 1% of the Union's budget is spent directly on innovation-related measures."
"Given the social challenges that lie ahead, we believe that this percentage is insufficient."
"For this reason, I supported our rapporteur's position, which calls for the forthcoming planning process in connection with the new financial perspective for the period 2014-2020 to include an increase in the EU budget for innovation."
"It will be essential for the incentives to be goal-oriented and to identify and develop coordinated links between instruments for supporting new technologies and improved coordination between the parties involved."
"Alongside support from the public purse, private sector investment in innovation will need to be encouraged and promoted."
"In conjunction with research and training, innovation is one of the most important things for building knowledge within the EU."
"A Community policy on innovation is very important for achieving the objectives set out in the EU 2020 strategy."
"However, innovation requires financial resources which, particularly among businesses, are lacking, and are not easy for businesses, especially the SMEs, to obtain."
"Approving this regulation is therefore an important step towards providing support for entrepreneurs, who are the driving force behind innovation in Europe."
"I consider it unacceptable that global economic competition has brought about a situation where not only production facilities but also the corresponding research and development resources are relocated to third countries."
"This trend must be decisively countered through a bold and painstaking industrial innovation policy, guaranteeing the competitiveness of the European Union economy and the transfer to a knowledge-based and low-carbon economy."
"For this reason, the volume of EU funding for innovation is, in my opinion, inadequate, representing less than 1% of the EU budget, and I agree with the rapporteur that this shortfall should be put right in the financial perspective for the period 2014-2020, work on which will begin by the end of this year."
"At the same time, it is necessary, in view of the fact that the financial crisis has contributed to a freezing of credit for innovative business projects, for Member States to also think seriously about a clear increase in funding for research and development, which will guarantee their competitiveness in the long term and help to save and create jobs."
"Research, innovation and education are important factors in a country's competitiveness."
"If enterprises are to remain capable of innovation, they need to invest a lot of money - which is often a problem, particularly in view of the credit crunch."
"In times when resources become scarcer, it is essential to expand and promote sustainable technologies."
"Once again, on the one hand, we need to support rural regions by driving the expansion of the broadband network into these areas while, at the same time, the infrastructure of these regions is being cut back as a result of the privatisation of the rail network, post office, and so on."
"While we talk about the importance of universities and research facilities, funding for these institutions is, in fact, being reduced."
"As ever, we highlight the importance of SMEs in this context, but it remains to be seen whether this is followed up by any real action."
"The report is essentially a rehash of old measures, which is why I abstained from voting."
"The strategy for the next ten years (EU 2020) sets as its second basic objective an increase in investments in research and development to 3% of GDP by 2020."
"This own initiative report calls on the Commission for specific and ambitious initiatives under the shadow of the failure of the Lisbon Strategy in this specific sector."
"It should be noted that spending on R&D in Europe is less than 2%, compared with 2.6% in the USA and 3.4% in Japan, mainly due to low levels of private investment."
"The change taking place on the labour market due to the current economic crisis and the changing production process make it necessary to develop the innovation sector, which will generate not only technological but also social added value."
"It is tomorrow's innovations that will enable Europe to cope with the major economic, social and environmental challenges of the coming decades."
"We need to increase our efforts to implement an ambitious policy of innovation in Europe."
"That is the logic behind the report by Mr Winkler, which I have endorsed."
"Firstly, we need to increase the financial assistance earmarked for that policy."
"The share of the European budget that is devoted to innovation must be substantially increased, and I hope that the next financial perspective for 2014-2020 will be along those lines."
"The Member States must also intensify their efforts to achieve the Barcelona objective as quickly as possible by devoting at least 3% of their GDP to research and development."
"It is also vitally important to improve the coordination of European and national policies."
"In order to be effective, innovation policy absolutely must be conceived in a comprehensive, coherent manner, and with a view to the long term."
"Furthermore, the dialogue between the research sector and the economic sector must be strengthened."
"In this respect, I welcome the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which will help boost relations between these two worlds."
"in writing. - I am sorry the split vote requested by the Greens to take out the call for a European Patent Court did not work, so this is regrettably included."
"However, this report calls for the use of common patent tools, patent platforms and full right licences, and it stresses the importance of the quality of patents."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that eradicating poverty is a matter of the greatest importance."
"The elimination of poverty is the main objective set by the Treaty of Lisbon for EU cooperation and development policies, and given that this is a moral duty whose long-term usefulness for EU interests is vital, I believe that prioritising this objective within our foreign policy is crucial."
"It is also worth noting that despite the profound economic crisis which Europe and the rest of the world are experiencing, we cannot and should not neglect foreign aid, as this is essential for creating a world of greater justice and solidarity."
"Given that the objectives outlined at the Millennium Summit in 2000, where we committed ourselves to improving our contribution to fighting poverty, are still a long way from being achieved, and that the year 2015 - the target year for achieving those goals - is drawing ever closer, we should examine different factors which are aimed at maximising the results of the MDGs as a matter of the utmost urgency."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for this document and take this opportunity to voice my support for this project."
"Nearly eight million children die each year before the age of five."
"Three and a half million die immediately after birth due to complications during pregnancy."
"Some four million die in five countries alone: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and China."
"Many of these deaths could be easily prevented by simple acts such as breast-feeding, using mosquito nets treated with insecticide and administering vaccines, primarily against pneumonia and malaria."
"Many mothers are unaware of the importance of vaccines or, if they are aware of them, they are so poor that they do not have the money to pay for transport to the surgery or hospital."
"Huge investments are not necessary in order to give these children a future; all that is required is to provide these countries with medicines that cost very little and which, for us, are part of everyday preventive medicine, to build wells for drinking water, to provide simple mosquito nets and to ensure that supplies reach their intended destination."
"Above all, therefore, we need the political determination to take action to save many human lives, to stop this silent slaughter of innocent children whose only crime is to have been born in a poor country."
"I voted in favour of the report submitted by Mr Cashman because it seems to me that Parliament had to take a clear position in favour of realising the Millennium Development Goals."
"The present economic crisis must not be allowed to bring these into question."
"These objectives, adopted during the Millennium Summit in 2000, are still far from being achieved."
"This is about reducing extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring primary education for all, promoting sexual equality, reducing infant mortality, improving maternal hygiene, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, conserving the environment in a sustainable manner and introducing a global partnership for development."
"In September 2010, all the Member States of the United Nations met to determine the procedure and to improve the results."
"By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament is demonstrating to the Heads of State or Government that it is committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"I support this report."
"Reducing poverty is one of the EU's primary development policy objectives."
"However, the negative consequences of the economic and financial recession have slowed the progress of developing and the least developed countries even more."
"Therefore, the EU Member States should make an exceptional effort to ensure that concrete development aid measures are established as soon as possible covering the areas of trade, development cooperation and the common agricultural policy."
"We must also strive to facilitate the integration of developing countries into the global economy and stimulate the development of trade in these countries."
"The Commission should ensure effective administration of aid measures for developing and the least developed countries and transparency and efficiency in the distribution of financial aid."
"in writing. - UKIP do not support cancellation of debt on the basis that it is economically unsound on the following points: 1."
"A creditor nation is usually a debtor nation."
"For example, the UK is a significant donor of overseas aid."
"Yet the UK, and therefore its tax payers, are usually unwilling donors to aid recipients whilst debt mountains pile up for UK plc. 2."
"Debt cancellation impairs Third World debtor countries from raising further international finance."
"Therefore, it is not in the debtor nation's interest."
"3."
"Debt cancellation introduces moral hazard."
"What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations, of which there are many? 4."
"Cancellation implicitly condones fraud, corruption and the misappropriation of loans so endemic in African debtor countries."
"5."
"Given the massive debt now of most international economies, who arbitrates where cancellation is appropriate?"
"Further moral hazard."
"I voted for Mr Cashman's report concerning the extent to which the Millennium Development Goals set out in the year 2000 have been realised."
"Everything seems to indicate that these objectives will not be achieved."
"The EU has an immense responsibility in that it is the primary source of aid to poor countries and, in this respect, it is listened to on the international stage when it comes to questions of development."
"The Cashman report makes a very fair assessment of the state of the Millennium Development Goals, with the emphasis being on extreme poverty, the situation of women, health, education and the environment."
"This report reminds us that the European Union has to make sure that there is consistency in development policies."
"A country's agricultural, fishing and business activities must not run counter to its development."
"Throughout this report, Parliament shows itself to be proactive by supporting new forms of financing which need to be introduced more generally."
"The report drafted during the Millennium Summit in 2000 is more relevant than ever."
"It is the duty of our leaders to bring these realistic and achievable objectives to fruition as quickly as possible."
"Above all, this is a question of will."
"I voted for this report because achieving the Millennium Development Goals must remain a key objective for the European Union."
"Achieving the MDGs, against all the odds, is a very important challenge and an urgent one both at EU and international level."
"The EU and international community should focus their efforts and take concrete action to enhance the chances of MDG success."
"I would like to underline that now is not the time for savings on the backs of the sick and starving."
"Therefore, we must devote particular attention to such areas as health, women and children and the fight against poverty and devote greater attention to employment and decent work."
"I would like to point out that poverty reduction through the achievement of the MDGs must be recognised as the overall goal of EU policy and Europe must lead the world in a concerted effort to keep the EU's promises to the planet's poorest."
"I agree with the European Parliament's call for a majority of EU financial aid to be granted to the neediest people, focusing especially on women, children and people with disabilities and all those who need that aid most."
"Particular attention must also be paid to gender equality, minority rights and combating discrimination."
"I welcome the role that Europe has played as the largest provider of development aid in the world."
"Development aid has helped to alleviate poverty for millions of people in the developing world."
"The number of people having to endure extreme poverty has fallen from 1.8 billion to 1.4 billion. Almost 90% of poor children now attend school."
"Great steps have been made in combating malaria and tuberculosis, and the infant mortality rate is falling dramatically."
"However, the recent food and fuel crises and the global economic recession have cancelled out much of the progress made over the last decade."
"The rich countries are responsible for the current financial, economic and climate crises, but the developing countries are the most affected by global warming."
"This means that it is vital for us to step up all our measures for combating climate change, such as providing appropriate technology."
"I would like to call for additional funds to be earmarked for developing countries."
"These should be sustainable in the medium and long term and come from the private sector, the carbon market, and the public sector of industrialised countries or the most economically advanced developing countries."
"in writing. - I voted against this report due to the controversial wording of paragraph 42 concerning abortion."
"I am morally opposed to abortion and cannot accept such a clause."
"Nevertheless, I must also state that I feel that the rapporteur has done an excellent job on all other issues."
"It is very sad that for years now, the European Parliament has been unable to resolve a tragic contradiction."
"In every document in which measures to combat poverty, hunger and violence in the world are admirably proposed, some manage to include the declaration, whether direct or indirect, of the so-called right to abortion as a vehicle for the health and development of populations."
"The initiative of some is met, on the one hand, with the virtual indifference of the majority and, on the other, with a certain diffidence of the minority."
"Yet the contradiction and the tragedy are obvious."
"The principle of equal dignity for all human beings and that of special, rightful solidarity towards the youngest members of society are being abandoned at the very time when we are supposed to be pursuing the objective of combating discrimination and protecting health."
"This has also happened today in the case of the Cashman report, paragraph 42 of which, in contradicting the entire document, has forced myself and a number of MEPs to ultimately reject the report as a whole."
"When balanced against one another, in fact, the bad points that are being promoted unfortunately outweigh the good points present in other parts of the text."
"Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a priority in development policy."
"Only a few months from the high-level UN meeting, despite significant progress having been made on some of the MDGs, the truth is that we are a long way from what we had hoped."
"More needs to be done."
"The Member States should respect the commitment that they made to Official Development Assistance (ODA)."
"New financing mechanisms which do not translate into higher taxes at this time of crisis need to be explored."
"Above all, it is crucial to bring about consistency in development policies (along the route of the resolution approved in May this year on consistency in EU development policies and the concept of greater public development aid)."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament has set the priority goals for the MDGs as health, education, the most vulnerable groups in society and the eradication of poverty through concrete measures in business, agriculture and fisheries policies."
"They have also done this with the call for a new global governance that gives greater voice to developing countries and which promotes democracy, peace, and the rule of law in developing countries."
"However, I oppose the view of abortion as a means of contraception."
"Scott McKenzie once sang, 'If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair, If you're going to San Francisco, you're gonna meet some gentle people there'."
"However, the world is not like that, and this message cannot be applied to the complex economic and social reality of the world today."
"For that reason, I voted against this report, although obviously without doubting the goodwill behind their objectives."
"'Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do, nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too."
"Imagine all the people living life in peace'."
"Yet it was John Lennon himself who added, 'You may say I'm a dreamer'."
"Unfortunately, real life is not like that."
"It is up to us, however, to make the world a fairer and safer place where everyone can live with a modicum of dignity."
"The proposals set out in this report seek to pursue multiple objectives, without focusing or defining effective priorities."
"Firing in all directions means that none of these objectives are practicable."
"Lastly, it seems to me that they are too statist and focused on central government."
"I disagree with this approach."
"I believe rather that Millennium Development Goal investment should be given to Union-based projects such as the Millennium Villages, with strong involvement from all EU institutions."
"in writing. - I strongly support this report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU is 20 billion euro short of its funding commitments, at a time when states are cutting back their aid budgets."
"The EU Member States must not falter when it comes to fulfilling their commitments in the framework of the European Consensus on Development."
"Moreover, the MDGs have to be seen from a development-enabling perspective, while at the same time facing and tackling the root causes of poverty."
"Member States must commit 0.7% of GNI to aid by 2015, as promised, rather than decrease that share, which is doubly alarming in times of crisis, as GNI itself diminishes."
"Besides, it is not acceptable for the EU to broaden the definition of Official Development Aid to include other financial flows such as remittances or debt cancellation measures."
"To address underdevelopment, the developed world needs to vigorously fight tax havens and illicit capital flows which deprive developing countries of resources they desperately need."
"I believe that responsibility for development has to remain within the remit of the Development Commissioner, who needs to push for better policy coherence, especially as regards trade, common agriculture and fisheries policies."
"Parliament is sending a strong message by adopting a resolution on the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"This shows the importance that Europe attaches to eliminating poverty, hunger, disease and infant and maternal mortality between now and 2015."
"On the eve of the European Council, the message is clear."
"The Heads of State or Government of the EU must stick to their financial commitments, including - perhaps even more than ever - in this period of global economic and financial crisis."
"What is needed is a contribution of 0.7% of the GNP of the Member States."
"In order to catch up with respect to its financial commitments, Europe must create new mechanisms of financing, such as a tax of 0.05% on financial transactions."
"Given how much these transactions currently amount to - recently, this was 70 times the global GNP - such a tax could free up EUR 10 billion per year."
"In addition, it would have the advantage of making the financial sector contribute."
"This would seem fair, given that this sector has benefited from enormous amounts of State aid in order to survive the unprecedented crisis that it itself caused."
"A unilateral EU initiative could act as a catalyst at a global level."
"I welcome the vote on the Cashman report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: mid-term review in preparation of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010."
"It simply had to be adopted!"
"Only five years away from the 2015 deadline set for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it offers a unique opportunity for the international community to redouble its efforts to achieve those goals."
"The situation is critical and requires urgent action."
"There must be renewed efforts to write off the debts of the least developed countries and to embark on a course that will reduce the burden of debt on developing countries."
"I am also in favour of the introduction of enhanced measures to monitor fulfilment of the commitment made to devote 0.7% of GNI to official development assistance (ODA) by 2015."
"Financing of the MDGs must begin at national level, and developing countries must generate and allocate own resources to achieve those goals, but the donor community must keep its promise to substantially increase its ODA."
"The commitments made must absolutely be honoured at the meeting in September."
"Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community."
"However, it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment."
"Two-thirds of the way through, it is clear that many least developed countries (LDCs) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty, of providing access to education and health care, and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too."
"Europe is the world's leading donor but, with 0.4% of GNI, it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56% to official development assistance (ODA) in 2010, a target that it set itself."
"The fact is, the aid requirements are greater than ever, especially in the areas of food security, the fight against climate change, education, health - in particular for HIV sufferers - and maternal and reproductive health."
"With the Cashman report, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05% tax on international financial transactions, which would yield EUR 10 billion, and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63% of European GNI in 2012, with a view to increasing it to 0.7%."
"As shadow rapporteur on this report, I voted firmly in favour of this report whose objective is to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are successfully achieved."
"I fully support the efforts of my fellow Members to ensure that the European Union's voice on this issue is united and progressive."
"However, I was unable to endorse the two amendments submitted, whose provisions I find unacceptable as a liberal."
"Therefore, I voted against the calls for the EU unilaterally to introduce a tax on currency and derivatives transactions in order to fund global public goods, including the MDGs."
"The European Union should not place an additional tax burden on its citizens, in particular taxes whose mechanisms and impact have not yet been fully examined."
"I also do not agree that development aid measures should be legally binding."
"It is important for the Member States to fulfil their obligations to increase the amount of Official Development Aid (ODA), but the European Union should not legally penalise its Member States because of a partial failure to fulfil obligations in the changed context of the financial crisis."
"Not all Member States were affected by the crisis in the same way and not all will be able to achieve the goal of 0.7%."
"The European Parliament should encourage them with softer and more acceptable means than strict legal measures."
"It is alarming that so many Members of this House voted against giving women in developing countries the right to control their own bodies and reproductive health by attempting to have paragraph 42 of the report deleted."
"This is an indication of a very disturbing trend among opponents of abortion in Europe who are using the aid programme to make their views public. The availability of family planning is an important factor in enabling women in developing countries to take control over their own lives and, as a result, to lift themselves out of poverty."
"I voted in favour of the Cashman report because there is still a long way to go before we can achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"It is necessary to strengthen existing measures so that they can be achieved by 2015, particularly through the implementation of the responsibilities assumed by the Member States on aid to developing countries."
"I welcome the adoption of paragraph 42, which 'calls on all the Member States and the Commission to reverse the worrying decline in funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights in developing countries, and to support policies on voluntary family planning, safe abortion, treatment of sexually transmitted infections and the provision of reproductive health supplies consisting of life-saving drugs and contraceptives, including condoms'."
"Eradicating poverty and reducing the gap between rich and poor are important objectives, and all governments should give attention and allocate resources to them."
"The UN adopted them at the Millennium Summit in 2000, while the European Union, as the largest donor, has a major share in the results of this collective effort."
"Despite all the efforts made by the developing countries, many of which are facing crises that may jeopardise their commitment, responsibility lies with the states benefiting from the aid if they are to assume their responsibility for good governance, rule of law and essential civil liberties."
"I cannot help but be disappointed that under the guise of his stated good intentions, the rapporteur is seeking to have this House adopt a resolution which, in blatant violation of the powers of the Member States and third states in these matters, advocates the promotion of abortion as a means to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"This is not a new tactic, but it is no less furtive or reprehensible for that."
"The international community has made a fundamental commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"Europe is the largest provider of aid in the world."
"This funding for developing countries has helped to alleviate poverty, reduce the mortality rate and improve the skills of millions of people."
"In fact, extreme poverty has decreased, almost 90% of poor children attend school and infant mortality is falling dramatically."
"Much still remains to be done, and much support must be given if less developed countries are to achieve the MDGs of eradicating poverty and providing access to education and health care services."
"Europe, as a champion of fundamental human rights, with solidarity as its basic principle, and as the world's largest contributor of development aid, must take a leading role in this matter, particularly at the next UN debriefing, which is to take place in September."
"I am, however, disappointed that this report has mixed noble objectives with sensitive issues relating to individual conscience, such as abortion."
"Promoting policies in support of abortion does not help to achieve the MDGs."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The initial objective of the Millennium Declaration in 2000 was to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, provide clean water and education for all, and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS."
"The report acknowledges that we are a long way from achieving these goals, which in themselves were limited."
"The EU as a whole has been reducing its aid budget, while its countries have recently spent thousands of millions of dollars on saving their banks, passing on the bill to the people while leaving the economic and financial groups that control them unscathed."
"However, the text contains some contradictions which we think are worth pointing out, not least when it criticises the liberalisation of trade while simultaneously supporting the opening up of trade through the conclusion of the Doha Round, within the context of the World Trade Organisation, and accepting the Economic Partnership agreements and Free Trade Areas."
"Trade liberalisation exacerbates inequality, creating greater exploitation of workers and natural resources, more poverty and more social exclusion, and it increases dependency relationships between countries."
"Sacrificing development aid to these objectives, as the EU and the USA have done, means that the Millennium Goals will not be achieved by 2015."
"I voted in favour of this report, because I support the pursuit of a major objective of development policy, namely the reduction of poverty."
"The Member States have an important responsibility and must stick to their commitments here; we need to remind them of this again."
"Even though the progress made up to now is encouraging, especially the increased school attendance of poor children or the fight against malaria and tuberculosis, considerable effort still needs to be made so that everyone's commitments between now and 2015 can be honoured, and this is despite the current context of the crisis."
"I also support the introduction of a tax on currency transactions and transactions in derivatives, as well as the reduction of the burden of debt on developing countries and the cancellation of the debt burden of the least advanced countries."
"Finally, I also voted in favour of several amendments that aim to develop measures in the field of sexual and reproductive health, because they are essential in the fight against AIDS and the reduction of maternal mortality."
"These are measures that must not be ignored."
"in writing. - The Cashman report makes important calls for the EU and its Member States to implement a number of policies in the field of international development and I wholeheartedly endorse these calls."
"It should also be added that action can be taken other than at the EU or Member State level."
"Scotland, for example has a distinctive contribution to make in its work with developing countries and the Scottish Government has also published an International Development Policy aimed at contributing towards Millennium Development Goals."
"I would like to refer to point 14 in the report on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which calls on the EU to provide significant funding to try and help poor nations fight the effects of climate change and, moreover, insists that these funds be additional to existing development aid commitments."
"Climate change is a fact, and we must learn to live with it. One of the significant errors that the environmental movement has made in its assessment of the situation is that, for a long time, it refused to discuss adaptation."
"This was something of a luxury in the West, because measures to adapt and the funding needed to accomplish this were not an option for the world's poor."
"Copenhagen can take the credit for the establishment of the climate fund for the developing countries."
"The significance of climate change among the problems that the developing countries face should not, however, be exaggerated."
"It would seem that climate change is cannibalising all the other problems in our imaginations."
"People have got it into their heads that if we cut emissions, all the other problems will just melt away."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"We need to make sure that we do not prevent hundreds of millions of children from receiving vaccinations and education or jeopardise the fight against erosion or other solvable environmental problems all in the name of climate change."
"The best way to help the climate is to help people out of poverty, because poverty, if anything, prompts people to resort to environmentally harmful solutions."
"For this reason, I believe it is very important that the report should expressly state that money earmarked for fighting and adapting to climate change should not come out of the EU's other development aid commitments."
"This report contains some positive points. They include the emphasis placed on the environmental debt of the countries of the North in relation to those of the South and the request for additional aid in this area."
"I also support the request for the write-off of sovereign debt to no longer be regarded as an integral part of official development assistance."
"The same applies to the demand to establish a fair distribution of wealth, support for local smallholdings and measures to foster access to land, water and other biodiversity resources."
"However, it is regrettable that, having put forward such proposals, the report should support Economic Partnership agreements, the Doha Round and all the World Trade Organisation agreements; in other words, that it should support the opposite of the principles it promotes."
"I shall therefore abstain."
"The EU remains the main driving force towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and it is also the world's largest provider of aid."
"This means that it must take on its responsibilities and play a leading role in the high-level meeting of the UN which is to take place in September 2010."
"Fulfilling the MDGs, especially the eradication of poverty, is crucial in bringing an end to the suffering of millions of people all over the world."
"However, it is important to note that once again, slyly using the fight against poverty as a pretext, there is an attempt to surreptitiously include references to issues that are fundamentally divisive, particularly abortion policies in developing countries, and which are not given the visibility that they merit."
"Reducing poverty has been one of the main aims of development policy since time immemorial."
"Little has been achieved in recent decades, however; rather, development policy initiatives have often moved in the opposite direction."
"It is particularly concerning that in many states, funds from industrial nations have been used to keep dictators or ruling classes in power and to suppress the poor masses."
"Even programmes to combat famine have apparently merely allowed explosive growth in population numbers."
"In any event, if we are to combat poverty, it is necessary to prevent food speculation and to revise development policy."
"Micro-loans are clearly a good approach for providing self-help."
"We should also be able to expect, however, that states which receive development aid take back migrants who have entered our countries illegally."
"We are unlikely to achieve the aims set until development aid is comprehensively revised."
"I therefore rejected the report."
"I think it is important to remove from point 22 the statement calling on the EU to put an end to agricultural export subsidies."
"The report's author and fellow Members who support this idea are very well aware that it is not the export subsidies - which are supporting agricultural production in Europe during the current crisis - that are the real problem."
"However, I abstained from the final vote because I believe that this report must be rooted more in reality and be more pragmatic and less ideological."
"This report does not take into account the fact that the EU can only provide aid to others if it has reasonably solid economic foundations itself."
"The sooner the EU overcomes the consequences of the crisis, the quicker it will be able to put in place long-term and sustainable development aid."
"The report on the Millennium Development Goals fails to give this sufficient consideration, which is why I have voted against it."
"In view of the obligations of EU Member States and the need for compliance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, I decided to endorse the report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: mid-term review in preparation of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010."
"The European Union, which is the world's biggest donor of development aid, should take action to realise its priorities, such as reducing and eliminating poverty."
"In relation to this, we expect the European Council to adopt a united position on the matter when it meets at the summit in June 2010, several months before the UN high-level meeting on assessment of the progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals."
"For problems in developing countries, such as poverty, hunger, health care and education, must be combated consistently."
"in writing. - I am glad we adopted today the Cashman report on the MDG."
"As long as we guarantee effective aid, lives will be saved and poverty will be eradicated."
"In September 2010, all United Nations Member States will come together in New York to discuss the progress made towards the MDGs and agree on actions to be taken to ensure that the goals are met."
"The report we adopted today is an extremely important document in terms of helping to define an ambitious EU position on this issue ahead of the September summit and putting political pressure on EU Member States."
"The endorsement of this report by an overwhelming majority of MEPs sends a clear and cross-party political message to the EU Heads of State or Government, before they meet on 17 June in Brussels, that the EU should remain strong and fully committed to the achievement of the MDGs, especially at a time of financial crisis."
"This report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has developed into something that I was unable to support: I considered it was important to vote against the Cashman report as a whole, following the adoption of the second point of paragraph 42 of Mr Cashman's draft report, which was put to the vote."
"The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression 'safe abortion' was impossible to ignore."
"Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception."
"What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk."
"We must not trivialise it."
"Development depends first and foremost on respect for life."
"It is gradually becoming clear that greater efforts are needed if the world wants to attain the Millennium Development Goals."
"Therefore, I support the resolution on the Union's commitment to a more efficient, more coherent policy in order to halve poverty and hunger, provide universal primary education, eliminate gender inequality and improve the health situation for many people."
"I want to see Europe shouldering its responsibility, starting with the 0.7% target."
"A more coherent development policy is also required."
"The agricultural subsidies we give to European farmers mean that farmers in developing countries cannot obtain a good price for their products."
"Making poverty history begins with fair trade."
"I also want to see a tax on currency and derivatives transactions, and I want the G20 and United Nations to be a framework for putting an end, at long last, to tax havens, tax evasion and illicit financial flows."
"It is high time there was greater transparency and that profit made and tax paid were automatically disclosed."
"I am a long-standing advocate of a country-by-country reporting system to enable developing countries to keep their own resources for their own development."
"The objective presented in the Millennium Development Goal programme is very noble and I think that we must make every effort to achieve it."
"Lithuania is a small country with a limited bilateral development budget."
"Global aims are complex and sometimes unattainable for us."
"Most of our bilateral aid (around 50%) is directed towards countries which are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"That is not because we are any less concerned about populations in Africa or the Caribbean than we are about people closer to home."
"For Lithuania and countries in a similar situation, the important thing is not the small allocation of funds but its effectiveness."
"As far as possible, we need to achieve better results with relatively few resources and that is not always possible to achieve in far off countries."
"It is important for us to help where we can, if not through the funds, then by sharing our experience of integration and other research that could be useful."
"Poverty reduction, whether in Lithuania or the furthest corner of Africa, should be one of our greatest priorities."
"The fight against corruption and aid for the poorest - that is our moral duty and a long-term interest of the EU."
"There has been a rise in the number of people who are underemployed or whose jobs are insecure and therefore, it is important for us to direct all of our efforts towards protecting, above all, the interests of the most vulnerable groups."
"CARIFORUM-EU, which represents a partnership between the countries of Europe and certain Caribbean states, is obviously something that we should support."
"Development, combating poverty, democracy, human rights, stopping the global threats to peace, security and stability are basic pillars upon which to bring about a strengthening of the Caribbean region."
"However, I do not consider it helpful to have a Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee established specifically for this purpose, especially if it is to include no non-attached Members."
"I therefore voted against this proposal."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in its session today, the Commission approved the new SWIFT agreement, and did so by a large majority or even unanimously."
"I would like to ask the President of the Commission - since I am sure he is aware that many of our citizens are concerned about data being passed on - where he sees substantial progress and how we can convince our citizens of the necessity of this agreement."
"President of the Commission. - It is true that the revised draft agreement was today adopted unanimously by the Commission."
"We believe it is subject to strict compliance with safeguards on privacy and the protection of personal data."
"It ensures the principle of necessity and proportionality and its purpose is strictly limited to the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of terrorism and terrorist financing."
"The agreement, as it stands now, respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The agreement secures significant safeguards for the data when processed by the provider."
"It provides also for transparency of the use of data and the availability of a process for seeking judicial redress."
"The Commission therefore considers that this draft is compatible with respect for fundamental rights and will give appropriate answers to Parliament concerns, as expressed when the resolution on the interim fifth agreement was voted in March 2010."
"Mr President, I just have a brief supplementary question."
"It concerns the content of the agreement that you have presented."
"I would like to repeat my previous question."
"What are the implications of this agreement for transatlantic relations?"
"How important is it for the other topics that we need to discuss with the US?"
"If you could give us an idea of this, I would be very grateful."
"President of the Commission. - It is extremely important, in fact."
"I can tell you that our American partners consider this to be probably one of the first priorities, if not the first priority, in the current discussions with the European Union."
"This agreement is crucial for European Union relations with the US."
"Since 1 January 2010, significant volumes of data which were previously received by the US Administration have not been available, and this is creating problems in their programme."
"That is why we believe we should also solve this, bearing in mind the importance of transatlantic relations."
"Of course, these transatlantic relations are critically important, but this does not mean that we should not stick to our principles of privacy and data protection."
"At the same time, I think we have reached a very, very good agreement now and Commissioner Malmström has done very important work."
"So I also believe that from a broader political point of view, it is important that we come to an agreement on this matter with our American partners."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, following on from the questions put by my fellow Member, Mr Weber, did Commissioner Malmström inform the College that there are great concerns in this House regarding the current state of negotiations?"
"Is the Commission aware that what it has resolved today is undoubtedly not what Parliament considers to be sufficient progress?"
"Do you realise, Mr President, that you have adopted something today that, if implemented in this way, will result in people employed by private companies such as Swift having greater rights of control than officials of the European Union?"
"Did Mrs Malmström explain this to you?"
"If so, how could you have decided this?"
"If not, why did Mrs Malmström not make you aware of it?"
"President of the Commission. - Of course, the College was permanently informed by the Commissioner responsible about the negotiation process."
"Just today, Commissioner Malmström informed us about the final outcome of those negotiations."
"More than that, she told us that she has maintained a very intensive dialogue with many of you in the European Parliament."
"We are well aware of the concerns expressed by this Parliament and she told me that she has kept Parliament regularly informed in terms of the negotiation process."
"The Commission has fulfilled its role in negotiating; it is now up to Parliament to accept or not to accept the deal."
"I strongly recommend you do because it is important for the security of European citizens as well."
"We believe that we have achieved the necessary level of protection in terms of fundamental rights and data protection, but of course, this is a very sensitive matter."
"We believe that the rights of this Parliament have been fully taken on board but we had to negotiate on behalf of the European Union and, as I told you, today's decision of the Commission was taken unanimously."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, thank you for your kind descriptions of your debate."
"It did not answer my question, however."
"I will therefore try to be more precise this time, and I would ask you to be very precise in your answer."
"Did Mrs Malmström tell you during the debate in the Commission before the College made its decision that there was a risk that Parliament would reject the text that you are now presenting as an agreement?"
"Or did Mrs Malmström say to you: 'We will get a parliamentary majority with this text'?"
"Let me repeat my question very precisely."
"Did Mrs Malmström say: 'We will get a parliamentary majority for this text' or did she say: 'With this text it is uncertain whether we will get a parliamentary majority'?"
"I would be grateful if you could answer precisely."
"President of the Commission. - Commissioner Malmström cannot prejudge what Parliament's vote will be."
"She is perfectly aware of that."
"Your question was if Mrs Malmström had told me or the College about what the vote or the reaction of Parliament would be: if it was going to vote 'yes' or 'no'."
"Of course, she hopes it will be in favour."
"If not, she would not have completed the negotiations on behalf of the Commission."
"After Parliament's 'no' vote some months ago, we had a very important discussion in the Commission."
"I also spoke with Commissioner Malmström several times."
"We are aware, and she personally is very well aware because she has invested a lot of time in contacts with Parliament, about some questions that may be raised regarding this agreement, but we are not anticipating now how Parliament will vote."
"I can tell you this now."
"She could not tell me, but she told me that she is still in consultation with Parliament."
"There is not yet an agreement when a vote will take place on that proposed agreement."
"This is what I can tell you, to the best of my knowledge, about the information that the Commissioner responsible gave to me and to the College."
"Mr President, rest assured that I am not going to ask questions about Swift - we will speak about that later - but, yesterday, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy had their summit."
"They decided on an economic governance approach in the Union and not in the euro area."
"Personally, I do not believe that this is a very pertinent decision, because it is not a matter of pitting the euro area against the European Union."
"We need economic governance in the European Union and we need economic governance in the euro area - we need it in both."
"Moreover, we need it even more strongly in the euro area than in the European Union since we have the single currency."
"My question to Mr Barroso is as follows: what do you think about this?"
"Do you agree with us that we need economic governance as much in the euro area as in the European Union?"
"Secondly, we believe that the Commission must be the one to oversee this economic governance."
"It is impossible for a Council that meets four times a year to ensure that economic governance takes place in Europe with all the problems that we are having."
"It is now up to the Commission to move into the driving seat."
"I would also like to know the Commission's position on this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, of course, when it comes to the powers that are already granted to the Union, the Commission is the economic government of Europe."
"That is the only solution that is compatible with the treaty."
"When it comes to trade, competition, and a very substantial share of the budgetary surveillance powers, it is the Commission, and I believe that it is sometimes necessary to remind those of our governments that have not read the treaties properly of this point."
"Having said that, the Commission alone cannot fulfil this task."
"We must work in concert with the Council, which has some very important powers, and also with the European Council, which gives general direction and impetus to the work of the Union."
"I also agree with your first statement."
"In fact, we have the solution for the euro area and for the whole of the European Union."
"Just read Article 136."
"Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon now offers us far greater opportunities to come up with proposals for the euro area, because it actually has special meaning within the euro area; more duties also means more rights, not only for those who share a currency, but also for the Union as a whole."
"Therefore, I hope that the economic governance of the European Union will be strengthened, but always in accordance with the spirit of the treaty and of the Community method."
"Mr President, the first test will come, of course, on Thursday, when we are also going to decide on Europe 2020."
"I hope in any case, Mr Barroso, that it will not be the Council that monitors and manages Europe 2020."
"The Commission must be the one to take charge of it, because I have never seen Heads of State or Government punish and criticise one another."
"That does not happen between peers, and that is why I believe that the Commission must defend its position in the context of Europe 2020 and within the working group that Mr Van Rompuy is currently heading up."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt, you yourself have been a Member of the European Council; you know the European Council well."
"Indeed, the European Council is a very important institution, but it cannot micromanage economic policy."
"That would be a fundamental mistake."
"Not only would it go against the spirit of the treaties, but it would be a fundamental mistake."
"The European Council does, of course, give direction and impetus - this is laid down in Article 16 of the treaty - but, afterwards, it is up to the various institutions, to the Commission, within the scope of its powers, and also to the Council, within its various groups, to verify the implementation of policies."
"I am anxious to tell you that the Commission is determined to play a full part in monitoring the entire process of the 2020 strategy."
"We now expect our Member States to support this strategy."
"I am encouraged by the discussions that have taken place so far."
"I also expect the support of the European Parliament."
"I am very encouraged by the positions adopted by this Parliament, and I can tell you that the Commission is ready to play its part in full."
"To conclude, Mr President, I should like to thank you most sincerely for the very clear position that the four main political groups in this House adopted in the press conference, which was one of defending the Community method and respect for the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, to change the subject: the Gulf of Mexico."
"Deepwater Horizon, I believe, is a name that is currently making people around the world confront the idea of the limits of growth, the limits of the wasteful use of oil and the limits of man and technology."
"In this connection, I would like to know, Mr Barroso, how the Commission intends to ban - on a precautionary basis - the planned oil and gas production in the northern North Sea and the Arctic in the areas where the European Union has responsibility."
"That is something that can still be decided."
"Secondly, I would like to know whether you actually believe that the rules that we have in the European Union on oil and gas production will protect us from any repeat of such catastrophes in areas where we have responsibility."
"President of the Commission. - We do not know yet the reasons for the accident in the US as the investigation is still under way."
"It is important to know whether the causes were mainly of a technical nature or linked to shortcomings in the regulatory framework or in compliance by industry."
"Therefore, it is too early to provide evidence of what might or could happen in Europe."
"While oil exploration in Europe is not taking place in the same extreme conditions as those in the Gulf of Mexico, we must also deal with the possibility of an accident near our shores."
"Drilling techniques have similarities, even if the waters are much shallower in the North Sea."
"The Commission is following developments closely."
"Commissioner Oettinger had already convened a meeting in May with major oil companies active in EU waters in order to get a precise picture of the situation in Europe and to obtain assurances from the industry on the current levels of safety."
"The Commission works with the Member States to ensure robust prevention and emergency response systems in order to protect European citizens and the environment."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you to say once again whether you believe that the directive on environmental liability for sub sea oil and gas production is sufficient."
"I would like to know whether you believe that the non-uniform, relatively low upper limits on liability are really what we need in the light of the catastrophe in the Gulf."
"I would also like to know whether you are debating urgent improvements to technical inspections on platforms."
"Do you really believe that the environmental and climatic conditions in the Arctic are friendly enough to humans and technology for us to enter into the risks of sub sea oil production there too?"
"It may not be quite as deep as in the Gulf of Mexico, but the conditions are tough."
"President of the Commission. - Yes, you are right."
"Firstly, we have legislation."
"We have binding new standards and requirements applicable to offshore drilling and oil production facilities as regards equipment standards, worker safety, environmental sustainability, emergency prevention and preparedness."
"In addition, the Member States have enacted extensive national legislation to maintain a high level of safety of offshore operations in Europe."
"Secondly, we have an information response system ready to fight disasters caused by oil spills from tankers or drilling and production facilities."
"This system includes a set of tools managed by the European Maritime Agency, focusing on prevention of pollution and response to pollution."
"Thirdly, there is a Community civil protection mechanism that can give a response to any major crisis situation."
"Regarding the concrete point you made on liability, most European legislation on safety and the environment does not target particular industries, but we can see that this legislation is applicable to all relevant economic sectors."
"EU legislation sets minimum safety standards which individual Member States must strive to meet through their legislation."
"This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - May I return to EU-US relations just for a moment to say how pleased that I and my group - my group being a major group in this context - are to hear about the SWIFT agreement progress which we have been very much involved with."
"Can I ask President Barroso to perhaps tell us what useful lessons have been learned by the Commission in relation to the SWIFT agreement which may be successfully and usefully employed when we deal with the very important PNR agreements that await our attention, now with the United States in the first place, but also with Canada and Australia?"
"President of the Commission. - It is probably too soon to draw all the lessons because we have not yet completed the process."
"I am very much looking forward to the completion of the process in good harmony with the European Parliament because we cannot deliver without your support."
"That is, frankly, important."
"There are two basic issues here."
"One is about security with respect to fundamental rights and data protection."
"We are attached to this and we believe that this agreement, as it stands now, responds to the concerns expressed by Parliament after its first vote."
"There is also another more general point that you, Mr Kirkhope, highlighted, and I thank you for that."
"That is the importance of relations with the United States of America."
"The USA is one of our most important partners, if not the most important, so I believe that we should also try politically to come to an agreement."
"Vice President Biden came here and made a very, let us say, passionate case for the importance of transatlantic relations, also in this field."
"The Commission will not recommend the vote if we are not convinced that it is for the benefit of European citizens."
"I want to underline that point."
"It is for our security as well."
"At the same time, we would like to have it also as a signal of our commitment to what is a very important relationship with our most important partner."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - I agree entirely with that."
"I think the European Parliament's behaviour on this, particularly latterly, has been a good democratic example for everybody."
"My supplementary deals with the question of sharing the burden on counter-terrorism between the United States and the European Union."
"Does the President believe that the agreements which we have been discussing place too much of a burden on the United States as opposed to allowing us to adopt the burden or be subject to the burden of sharing responsibilities and resources in respect of counter-terrorism?"
"President of the Commission. - I think this is an important point."
"In fact, during our conversation with the Americans, they told us that they are ready to support us if we want to establish a similar system at European level."
"That is a decision that we have to take here in Europe."
"What we are accepting by this agreement is to provide some data, subject to strict conditions, to the American authorities, but we could also think about what we could do better among ourselves."
"The Americans told us they were ready to help us technically because they have more investment in that area than we have."
"I think that could be something for the future because I believe that we must all contribute to the fight against terrorism."
"It would be a great mistake to think that the fight against terrorism is an American responsibility and that we are just supporting them."
"It is a joint responsibility to fight against terrorism and to protect the security of all our citizens."
"Mr President, today, the European Parliament adopted Mr Cashman's report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals."
"One of our main messages to the Commission, to you, is that naturally we want to do everything we can to combine all the EU's resources in order to implement the Millennium Development Goals by 2015."
"So far, however, the EU and its Member States have not met their obligations."
"There is currently a deficit of EUR 20 billion in the commitments made for achieving the Millennium Development Goals alone."
"I would therefore like to know what you are going to do - and specifically as regards the forthcoming Council meeting - to remind the Member States in particular of their commitments and to exert pressure on the EU to provide a clear, final picture at the UN conference in September and not to allow the individual Member States to repeatedly shirk their responsibilities in view of the growing crisis, when 1 billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I fully agree with the concern that your question raises."
"In fact, there is now a risk that, because of the budgetary constraints in some Member States, some commitments are not respected."
"The Commission had a meeting some days ago in Addis Ababa with the African Union Commission, and one of the points raised by our partners in Africa was that sometimes they feel that commitments are not respected."
"So it is question of credibility and accountability, also on our side."
"So, certainly, the Commission will defend the fact that we should keep our commitments."
"For instance, the commitments taken in terms of fast-start financing for the fight against climate change."
"I intend to go to the high-level event in New York."
"Just today, I received a letter from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon highlighting the importance of this agenda, and we fully share his concerns."
"I will raise the issue not only in the European Council this week, but also in the G20 and G8 outreach meetings the week afterwards in Canada."
"So, we remain very much committed to this."
"I participated in the Gleneagles G8 summit several years ago and, in fact, the reality is that the most developed countries have not yet fulfilled all that they committed to do."
"Mr President, I do not doubt in the least that in the intervening years, the Commission has repeatedly come up with initiatives relating precisely to these tasks of development policy."
"For me, the question is what has been done within the Commission to create the structures, the resources and the conditions to implement, for example, the Twelve Point Plan drawn up by the Commission, and particularly by Commissioner Piebalgs."
"In other words, what is the Commission itself doing to create the conditions for policy coherence?"
"Why, for example, do such serious matters as the struggle to implement the Millennium Development Goals play no part in the Europe 2020 strategy?"
"President of the Commission. - The Commission is doing its part through the Community budget."
"In fact, on several occasions, we proposed additional funding to the Member States."
"I remember, for instance, in the G8 in Japan, I proposed an additional EUR 1 billion for helping rural development in Africa and in other developing parts of the world, to come from the unspent money."
"Now, to fulfil all the commitments on the European side, most of it has to come from the national budgets."
"In the current framework, with the current financial perspectives, we cannot be much more flexible."
"So that is what we are doing - speaking with our Member States so that we can, in fact, deliver on our previous commitments."
"Mr President, I will continue with a question on growth, in light of the Council summit on Thursday."
"The present economic crisis and the threatened slump in Europe must be addressed mainly by increasing investments."
"A basic concern, therefore, is to safeguard financing resources."
"My question is this: are you considering, as the political leader of economic development in Europe and the Commission as a body, that the possibility should be examined of issuing European bonds to finance major European development investments, such as pan-European high-speed motorways, European research into climate change, e-health, a pan-European navigation system or major investments in energy, such as LNG terminals in the Euro-Mediterranean, in other words, major pan-European investment projects that will be funded by issuing bonds?"
"President of the Commission. - We hope these issues will be addressed in the next financial perspectives."
"Indeed, already in the EU 2020, we are making everything to do with these interconnections a priority for future financing at European level, be this in energy, in transport, or in other forms of immaterial connections, such as the digital agenda."
"This is very much one of the sectors where we believe there is value added, where a euro spent at European level makes more sense than one spent at national level, because there is a European rationale for this kind of investment."
"How to finance that does, of course, have to be discussed with the Member States."
"This is a very difficult time to discuss budgets with our Member States, but we believe we can make a strong case for stronger interconnections at European level."
"Mr President, I do not think that I received a reply to my question."
"Do you believe that we can address the risk of recession with immediate, pan-European, coordinated action by issuing European bonds?"
"Do not forget that we have to deal with a huge competitive global market in India, China and the USA."
"Will Europe respond with major investments on a pan-European scale?"
"Will Eurobonds play a role by funding these investments?"
"What do you have in mind?"
"President of the Commission. - Frankly speaking, I do not believe that there is now openness among all Member States to consider Eurobonds for this kind of expenditure."
"Just recently, we adopted a very important, ambitious programme in terms of a mechanism or a facility for helping countries with problems of debt."
"It is, in fact, some kind of obligation which Member States take to the financial markets, so I believe it will be extremely difficult to now get from the Member States the agreement with the Eurobonds principle for this kind of projects."
"Nevertheless, I think there are some possibilities of using other mechanisms."
"In my programme, I spoke, for instance, about having some public/private partnerships;"
"I spoke about involving the European Investment Bank in a better way; we are looking very openly at all the possibilities of financing for those very important projects."
"But if you want my honest answer, it is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, now to get Eurobonds for that specific purpose."
"President Barroso, you have been a supporter of Northern Ireland and the important progress that has been achieved in creating a stable and peaceful future for our people."
"In your task force report, you indicated your support and that of the Commission for the local devolved administration and the work that it is doing in securing a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Northern Ireland."
"In this time of economic turbulence, the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland is one of the most important sectors of the economy."
"This very important work could suffer from the proposed penalties for alleged breaches of the single farm payment scheme identified by Commission auditors."
"Mr Barroso, would you agree that the proposed penalties on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland for breaches of the SFP scheme between 2004 and 2006 are disproportionate in relation to the actual risk to the scheme?"
"Will you and DG AGRI agree to look again at the suggestion of a five per cent flat-rate disallowance, given that the department in Northern Ireland is taking remedial steps to ensure that systems are accurate and that money has already been recovered in relation to the original claims?"
"President of the Commission. - Thank you for the comments regarding the support that the Commission has been giving to Northern Ireland."
"Indeed, we are very pleased about, and supportive of, the developments in Northern Ireland."
"The Commission has invested heavily in this process."
"I remember also my visit to Northern Ireland and will continue to do so."
"I am aware of the issue you have raised of the single farm payment scheme."
"Commissioner Cioloş has outlined our position on this, but let me state very clearly that the clearance of accounts procedure is an administrative one."
"The Member State concerned is given a full opportunity to express its view, but the independence of the process is vital."
"The Commission does not enjoy any discretion in the level of corrections, which follows established principles to ensure equal treatment to all Member States."
"I am sure that you all agree in this Parliament about the need to respect fully our regulations in terms of accountability."
"It is critically important."
"Just yesterday, I had a very interesting meeting lasting several hours with the Commission and the Court of Auditors and I want to tell you that, while supporting Northern Ireland very much, we have to respect strictly all the rules in terms of accountability."
"I will just take up your time for one supplementary question in relation to that."
"There is some concern in Northern Ireland that the actual disallowance rate has been levied on a very small level of sporadic inspections."
"I would be grateful if the President would ensure that the Commission undertake proper evaluation of the procedures that are now in place to ensure that the scheme is properly administered."
"President of the Commission. - Of course, I can give you all the guarantees on the part of the Commission that we will try to ensure that the scheme is properly administered."
"But once again, the clearance of accounts procedure is an initiative procedure which includes several steps ensuring the Member States' right of defence, as well as the opportunity for conciliation by an independent body."
"And now we have to engage with this in a serious, objective manner."
"(NL) Mr President."
"President Barroso, you have just made a clear statement."
"The European Commission is the economic government of Europe."
"At a time when we are seeking to strengthen economic governance, however, we need to see more of the Community method."
"We stand shoulder to shoulder with you, but in Council circles there are ideas of moving more towards the intergovernmental method, including with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What are the crucial elements relating to the task force and its outcome that you believe should be included in these conclusions in order to achieve stronger economic governance and a stronger Stability and Growth Pact using the Community method?"
"Could you specify some of these elements?"
"That would also be very helpful in terms of the public debate."
"President of the Commission. - The task force was created in the specific context of support for Greece and, as you know, the Commission is participating in the task force in a fully constructive and loyal way."
"In fact, the task force was established by the President of the European Council in cooperation with the Commission."
"The Commission is participating in the task force and I am happy with the way that work is progressing in the task force."
"There is a consensus emerging on steps towards economic coordination in Europe, and most of those steps are completely in line with the proposals made by our communication of 12 May."
"So may I say that this task force is performing an important task, because they have addressed important points like the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Semester."
"I am looking forward to the report of the President of the European Council to the European Council on Thursday."
"The Commission will, of course, not abdicate from its right of initiative and will present further proposals, building also on the consensus emerging in that task force."
"(PL) We know how difficult the economic situation is for some Member States, and what effect this is having on the emotions of the residents, and not only of these countries, and on the decisions being made by individual governments."
"You spoke not long ago, Mr Barroso, about the necessity of defending the unity of the European Union and of maintaining EU integration within a framework of 27 Member States."
"I would like to ask, and to find out, how you intend to defend this objective in a situation in which the pressure to come up with new methods is increasing, such as the idea to set up a European Office for the Economy, which would lead to closer economic coordination in the euro area."
"What guarantees can you give us that countries which, with significant efforts, are bridging the gap in terms of development, will not be relegated to the second division of the European Union?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, I have stated several times in this Parliament and on other occasions that we are against any kind of competing or parallel divisions of institutions in the European Union."
"We have one Union, the European Union, with our institutions, with the 27 Member States today, and of course we fully respect the treaties."
"We can, in the current framework, do more for economic coordination and clearance."
"We have, namely, Article 121 of the treaty that is clear in stating that Member States' economic policies are a matter of common concern."
"What a Member State does has implications in the other Member States."
"Article 121 is an implicit call for coordination by Member States."
"We have Article 126 that deals specifically with budgetary policies, and Article 136 allows the Commission to take initiatives to reinforce coordination, also within the euro area but within the general Community framework."
"This is the important point to understand."
"We can make some proposals for the euro area, but always within the framework of the European Union, and not having the euro area as something separate from the rest of the European Union."
"I believe this is critically important for the success of a Union that is really based on the principle of solidarity."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion of the work of the Commission and of the task force itself over the last few months actually differs somewhat from that of President Barroso."
"I have the very distinct feeling - and I would like you to prove me wrong - that the idea of the recovery process and of the necessary austerity measures, which I too believe to be essential, has very clearly gained ground, including in the media, but that the idea of growth and development, on the other hand, has greatly diminished."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is in danger of becoming a stability pact only, if not in its intentions, then at least in the actions announced."
"I believe it is essential instead to implement measures that are capable of supporting growth, starting with the creation of Eurobonds."
"I should like to know from you whether the concern for growth really is a fundamental concern of the task force but even more so whether it is a fundamental concern of the Commission."
"President of the Commission. - The task force was for economic governance and, when I was expressing my overall satisfaction with the work so far, I was referring to that."
"Of course, growth is a separate issue now."
"Growth is the most important point for the European Union economy."
"Without growth, we will not be able to deliver to our citizens what they expect."
"We will not be able to keep our social market economy."
"Our citizens will not be able to realise their full potential."
"That is precisely the goal of EU 2020 - growth, growth and growth."
"Not just any kind of growth, but intelligent growth, sustainable growth and inclusive growth."
"Of course, we believe that to have growth, we need confidence, and unless confidence comes back to the financial markets in Europe, we will not be able to achieve that higher level of growth and restore the growth potential before the crisis."
"That is why fiscal consolidation is so important and reforms are so important, not as an end in themselves, but as a means to achieve greater levels of growth to increase the growth potential in Europe."
"I think we all agree on the need for sound economic governance."
"But let us be honest about what is happening."
"What we have seen is blatant flouting of the Stability and Growth Pact rules and engagement in what we would call, probably rather euphemistically, off-balance-sheet activities and financial engineering."
"Now I am sure we can all agree that the EU Member States must adhere to the principles of sound monetary policy, fiscal responsibility and honest accounting, but do you see this as an opportunity for the EU to gain power over Member State budgets, or will you tackle the real problem of countries that have cooked the books and amassed massive budget deficits, rather than focusing on increasing power over Member State budgets?"
"President of the Commission. - Speaking frankly, I am not looking at this point in terms of a fight for competence or grabbing power."
"That is not the problem."
"What we have now, and it is clear - Article 120 of the treaty - is a situation in which the economic policy of a Member State is not just a matter of national concern."
"We have seen during this crisis that the decisions taken by one country have a very direct spill-over effect on the other countries."
"So it makes sense, for instance, that the Member States, when they are preparing their budget, know what others are doing as well, because the decisions of others will have an impact on their own decisions."
"We do not want at all - and I want to make this clear - to interfere in the sovereign powers of our national parliaments."
"It is very important for this to be respected, but it makes sense that when we are discussing the economic policy for Europe - and we have seen how interdependent we are - we should be aware of what the main intentions of the other economies are."
"This is the right point."
"What is the added value of being together?"
"This is the sensible line the Commission is proposing, and we believe that now a consensus is emerging along these lines."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, the ongoing crisis has made it clear that the Union has no more time to lose."
"Immediate action is needed in terms of economic policy issues."
"We need concerted action in three areas: economic governance, long-term growth strategy and the reform of financial services."
"Moreover, this should be done in such a way that we do not forget to integrate the tried and tested common policies, such as the common agricultural policy or the cohesion policy. This is because Europe can hardly be successful in the world if it lacks internal cohesion and safe food production."
"I am therefore asking the President of the Commission whether he is dedicated to harmonising the Europe 2020 strategy with the existing common policies."
"I would like to ask you, the custodian of the Community approach, which is something I greatly respect you for, whether you wish to preserve in the three areas of EU policy mentioned above the principle that any changes should only be implemented by treating the EU as a single entity and taking into account the interests of non-euro area states, making sure that the EU's internal cohesion is not affected."
"President of the Commission. - You are completely right when you underline what I have been calling the holistic approach to economic policy."
"It is a mistake and I think now Member States are well aware of it."
"When we speak about economic policy in Europe, just to consider the Stability and Growth Pact or just to consider the financial services reform, it all comes down to growth."
"To have sustainable growth, we need of course to have sound economic governance in Europe, we have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, and we need the credibility of sound public finances, but we also need new regulatory supervision for the financial market and we need to invest in our potential for growth."
"This is precisely what EU 2020 is about."
"It is about reform."
"That is why I am insisting that we need fiscal consolidation and structural reform."
"And, of course, we need to pursue the economic policies that are so important for us in Europe, namely in terms of economic and social cohesion - not only for 16 - or 17, because I hope that Estonia will join the euro area very soon - but for all the 27 Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr van Rompuy - the President of the Council - wants to use the task force to rapidly create new rules on the euro in order to manoeuvre the EU out of the current euro crisis."
"Commission President, you have already cited Article 121 several times."
"You speak quite rightly of mutual dependence and of the fact that economic policy naturally does not only concern the individual Member State."
"My specific question to you, Mr Barroso, is as follows: to what extent is the task force preparing possible sanctions against states that repeatedly infringe budgetary rules?"
"Can the Commission imagine withdrawing EU subsidies or withdrawing structural funds?"
"What does the Commission think of the idea of the temporary withdrawal of voting rights as a possible sanction?"
"Finally, what is the Commission's position on demands for a uniform insolvency rule for insolvent Member States?"
"President of the Commission. - You have raised many questions."
"First of all, what we are doing now in the task force and indeed in the Commission - a communication on 12 May already mentioned this - is examining the possibility of reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, including by broadening the arsenal of incentives for compliance, as I prefer to call it."
"I believe it makes sense to have these incentives for compliance - some people speak of sanctions - because we need the credibility of those instruments to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is respected."
"As we have seen, the problem was that some Member States did not respect the treaty that they themselves had adopted and ratified."
"How can we do this?"
"We want to do it in a fair manner, not just penalising those countries that are in the Cohesion Fund."
"That is why we are looking for ways of implementing those incentives for compliance, irrespective of whether or not the countries are cohesion countries."
"Those incentives for compliance can be reinforced in several ways, for instance, more upstream, including using them in the preventive part of the Pact, or more consequently, for instance with an increased degree of automaticity."
"We are looking at several ways and the Commission will put forward some legislative proposals on this."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to hear you talk about unemployment when detailing the objectives of the task force on economic governance, because you have referred on numerous occasions to the strategy as a strategy for intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Moreover, it should be inclusive, above all, for the more than 20 million Europeans who feel excluded because they have been shut out of the labour market by the brutal crisis."
"There are more than 20 million unemployed people who want clarification when we tell them that economic governance, stability and supervision - the economic and financial supervision package - will be reflected in a strategy that is directly aimed at getting all those people who have been personally affected by the outbreak of the crisis back to work, with ambitions of increased productivity and, hence, competitiveness."
"In particular, I would like to hear you say how it will be reflected in the participation of those EU Member States that will be involved in this opportunity, which must not be squandered, and which must be relevant to the defining of new rules for global economic governance at the upcoming G20 meeting in Toronto."
"I believe that what Mr López Aguilar said is absolutely key."
"We have to take a holistic view of all this."
"We cannot look only at certain rules of governance relating to the Stability and Growth Pact; we have to also look at what we can do for growth within Europe, especially in order to ensure that growth is sustainable and inclusive."
"We have said on numerous occasions that we do not want the costs of this amendment, of this adjustment, to be borne by the weakest."
"They were not the ones who caused the crisis."
"For that reason, we think that there must be better redistribution of the sacrifice, and also, as Mr López Aguilar has said, that there needs to be an external dimension."
"That is why we are going to the G20 determined to propose mechanisms for the financial sector's contribution to the response to the crisis, while also seeking to strengthen a common European position on the world stage, especially within the G20."
"(RO) With regard to the Europe 2020 strategy, a new European strategy promoting employment and economic growth, its main objectives approved by the European Council on 25 and 26 March this year also include those relating to improving the conditions for research and development, especially so that the combined levels of public and private investment in this sector can reach 3% of GDP."
"It is also mentioned that the Commission will devise an indicator intended to reflect the intensity of research, development and innovation."
"My question is:"
"Which method are you going to use to devise this indicator and has a consultation schedule for this already been established?"
"President of the Commission. - You are right."
"We have made reference to the 3%, but we have not just mentioned research and development but also the concept of innovation, since this is not only a question of basic research but how research is translated into economic activity."
"What can research do to produce more growth and more employment?"
"As you know, there is not a well-established indicator for innovation, which is a technical issue dividing some experts."
"I personally have been discussing this with the OECD for instance."
"The Secretary-General of the OECD and some of his experts came to Brussels recently, and we are working with them and others to have an indicator of innovation that could be agreed upon by the academic community and the policy-making community."
"That is what we are doing, and we certainly want to do so in open consultation, so we very much welcome all contributions to this."
"It is a highly technical point, but I believe that it is critically important that we develop better indicators for innovation."
"(PT) Mr President, we know that the escalation of the economic and social situation is a matter of concern for many of the EU Member States."
"Economic growth remains very weak and is insufficient to reduce unemployment and create the jobs that the EU needs."
"On the other hand, the measures that are being taken, especially austerity policies in the name of compliance with the Stability Pact and its criteria, not only run counter to the need for job creation and economic growth, but they are also exacerbating inequality and poverty."
"Thus, in the European Year for Combating Poverty itself, we see a situation where exclusion, poverty and unemployment are on the increase."
"So I wonder, Mr President, do you not think that there is a pressing need to give priority in these macro-economic policies to social sustainability, rather than continuing to insist on financial sustainability, which undermines social sustainability itself?"
"Do you not think that it is time to revisit the Stability and Growth Pact and its irrational criteria, and to give priority to employment and the fight for social inclusion?"
"I believe that we cannot have social sustainability without financial sustainability."
"Without financial sustainability, there is no confidence; without confidence, there is no investment; without investment, there are no jobs."
"That is why you should not set yourself up in opposition to stable and sound macro-economic policies, and concern for poverty and the most vulnerable."
"In relation to poverty, we ourselves made combating poverty and the fight for social inclusion one of the objectives of the 2020 strategy, along with some concrete goals, and I agree that nowadays there is a greater risk of poverty in our societies."
"We are seeing new poverty phenomena which are extremely worrying."
"That is why governments must examine how they can respond to this issue as part of their priorities, but the solution - I must reiterate - cannot be found in budgetary indiscipline, because if this is the solution, we will probably see the situation deteriorate in some countries and, by extension, the situation for the most vulnerable within those countries."
"I wonder, can you please tell me who is really profiting from the Greek bail-out package?"
"Is it the people of Greece, or Greece's richest private banker, Spiro Latsis, who holds a 40% stake in the third-biggest bank in Greece, Eurobank EFG Group?"
"Could your friendship, sir, with Mr Latsis possibly be a conflict of interest?"
"President of the Commission. - The package put forward by Greece and the European institutions is for the benefit of the Greek people and the European economy overall."
"If this were not the case, it would not have been approved by the 27 Member States."
"Regarding the insinuation you make, I really believe that it does not deserve any kind of answer."
"(EL) Mr President, it would appear that the German and French Governments agree that the European Union does not need new institutions."
"At least that is what Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy appeared to be saying last week."
"However, it would appear - as we have already heard - that we are moving towards a new amendment to the Stability Pact, in which sanctions will be imposed, such as the withdrawal of voting rights, on Member States which do not apply discipline in the financial sector."
"My question is very simple: do you believe that the problem of governance in Europe can be dealt with by and restricted to disciplinary issues in terms of financial adjustment?"
"Or that, in the midst of a crisis, with the monetary tool at Community level and the financial tool at national level, we shall end up in an impasse?"
"Problems exist which we have repeatedly highlighted."
"Just yesterday, Moody's again downgraded Greece's credit reason for no good reason."
"Will the truce you referred to bring about specific, tangible results for the future?"
"President of the Commission. - The European institutions, together with Member States, will do their best to have something that is more credible in terms of the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is quite obvious that there were problems in terms of implementation and non-compliance by some of the Member States with the rules that they themselves had agreed."
"Already now, some limitations and even sanctions are possible under the current treaties and without new reforms."
"In the future, we want to have that in an objective manner."
"We are looking for ways of improving the credibility of the pact in a fair way, so that the measures can be implemented objectively, irrespective of the country's status as one the richest or poorest Member States."
"I believe it is in the interests of all of us to have a more credible way of implementing the Stability and Growth Pact."
"That concludes Question Hour with the President of the European Commission."
"Credit rating agencies (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission by Nikolaos Chountis and Jürgen Klute, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0302/2010),"
"the oral question to the Commission by Udo Bullmann, on behalf of the S&D Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0309/2010),"
"the oral question to the Commission by Jean-Paul Gauzès, on behalf of the PPE Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0312/2010), and"
"the oral question to the Commission by Sylvie Goulard, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on credit rating agencies - B7-0313/2010)."
"Mr President, today's debate in the European Parliament concerns the activities of credit rating agencies and the impact they have on the global and European economy."
"The European Union and the European Central Bank have issued regulations granting credit rating agencies, such as Moody's, SnP and Fitch, the right to evaluate not only businesses but also the Member States of the European Union themselves."
"When the crisis broke, the same institutions of the European Union recognised the very negative role played by credit rating agencies."
"Whereas one would have expected the European Commission to limit the role of these agencies, on the contrary, their role was upgraded and formalised in a new regulation in November 2009."
"Credit rating agencies had already started to downgrade Greece's credit rating at the beginning of 2009 and, as a result, it pays double the interest rate it paid before and has entered a vicious circle of depreciation and speculative borrowing."
"We all know what the final results were."
"Just yesterday, Moody's tried yet again to generate a negative climate for the Greek economy and the euro with a blatant speculative intervention, by downgrading the state of the Greek economy by 4 points for no good reason."
"Moody's is one of the three private US companies which the European Union officially recognises for the purpose of rating the Member States' economies, despite the fact that it is being accused by every economist, politician and institutional player in Europe and the USA of bearing huge responsibility for the recent crisis."
"To be precise, it was this agency that was accused by former analysts in the US Congress of being forced by their superiors to give toxic securities a positive rating."
"It was this agency that is being accused by dozens of businesses of being coerced through ratings into paying fees."
"It was this agency which, together with the rest of the 'Holy Trinity', namely SnP and Fitch, received dozens of complaints from municipalities, regions and states in the United States which were mislead into undertaking investments and lost millions of dollars."
"It was this agency that is being accused by numerous insurance funds that lost their investments due to erroneous ratings."
"The insurance fund of the State of Ohio alone lost USD 450 million."
"As we know all this, as it is unacceptable for European economies to be rated by self-seeking private US agencies, this job should be undertaken by a public, democratically controlled agency which has no connection to private interests."
"However, instead of this, Mr Barnier, we see the Commission filibustering even today, with the result that the speculation mafia continue to coerce and direct economic policy at the expense of the workers and citizens of the Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that the European Parliament should, at long last, accept its responsibilities, intervene and demand that the European Commission and the Council, having consulted the European Parliament, legislate directly to put an end to this unacceptable situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is seeking to draw attention with this oral question to the problems concerning credit rating agencies."
"Our aim is to find out from the European Commission what the next steps will be, starting with the possibility of creating a European credit rating agency which we support and feel is taking shape, partly in the light of what President Barroso himself has said on this issue."
"We must give praise where praise is due and acknowledge that credit rating agencies have achieved virtually the impossible: they have managed to play a decisive role both in the very early stages of the 2008 financial crisis, during the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and now at this second stage, which began with the debt crisis in Greece."
"In 2008, they disregarded - and, in some cases, even promoted - the risks of toxic products, and now they have decided to do their bit for the stability of the markets by slashing the ratings of Greece, Portugal and Spain, just when the negotiations between the European Union, the IMF and the Greek Government were under way."
"President Buzek, there are no two ways about it: these people are evil!"
"Now, it is not that I want to put all the blame for what has happened in the world and in Europe on credit rating agencies."
"However, the fact that they are always present at the scene of the crime - and I am referring to the Parmalat case, the Enron case, the Lehman Brothers case - ought to make us react in a more appropriate and practical manner than we are at present, since we are doing nothing."
"Commissioner, when will an inquiry be carried out into this affair and into this sector?"
"We worked on this with Mr Gauzès a while ago, when we drafted the regulation on credit rating agencies."
"A sectoral inquiry is now required in order to shed some light on the scandalous, unacceptable situation in which a concentration and oligopoly are being created in this sector."
"Let us get a grip on the situation before things get even worse and let us turn our words into deeds."
"As well as the need to create a European public agency, we should also reflect on the role that independent courts of auditors can play in providing an assessment of sovereign debts, thus absolving private agencies of the responsibility for them."
"President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel - and I shall conclude here - have officially asked the European Commission to draft some proposals to strengthen competition in the credit rating market."
"It is a pity that in the European Council, in which President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel sit, it is, in fact, the governments that are delaying the approval of the financial supervision package and thus preventing ESMA, the European authority that will be responsible for monitoring, from being set up."
"Therefore, President Sarkozy, Chancellor Merkel, you should put your own house in order before telling President Barroso what to do."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies."
"Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis."
"They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head."
"Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking."
"Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good."
"Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments."
"From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies."
"Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do?"
"I believe that the texts that you will propose - I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation - must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies."
"From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems."
"If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use."
"More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings."
"There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt."
"I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt."
"The authority which, at Parliament's request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority."
"I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings."
"We cannot allow a situation - and such situations have indeed arisen - in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences."
"In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt."
"The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently."
"That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent."
"That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions."
"How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, you come from a country in which ratings always tend to cause a stir - I am talking about the Michelin Guide's best restaurant ratings."
"Therefore, we are not going to say that we are against ratings, since, after all, they also make for healthy competition and enable different standards of performance to be rewarded."
"Consequently, I fully agree with what Mr Gauzès said just now."
"It is not a question of demonising rating agencies."
"It is really about looking at the conditions in which they operate."
"In the case in point, these are institutions that have really quite considerable powers, and that is why we must look closely at the way in which they work."
"Mr Gauzès just pre-empted me by saying that there is a difference between the rating of private businesses and that of sovereign debt."
"In both cases, however, the problem is the same; in other words, is the methodology right?"
"Are the right criteria being used to assess what a business is doing or how a State is managing its debt?"
"Secondly, are the potential links between the rating agency and the subject of the rating transparent enough?"
"All of that in fact merits close examination and supervision, and we are grateful to you for forging ahead with the proposals that Parliament itself made during the last parliamentary term, with regard to Mr Gauzès's report."
"In this regard, I believe that it is very important that we continue the work that Parliament has already embarked on."
"I share the view that a European rating agency is not necessarily the top priority today."
"What is important is that we ensure that the supervisory work, as it stands today, as it is being performed, is monitored."
"On that note, I should like to say a word about ESMA, this authority that is due to be established shortly."
"I am one of the rapporteurs for the financial supervision package, as is Mr Giegold, who is in this Chamber and who is the rapporteur for ESMA."
"I should like to launch an appeal to the Member States - the Presidency is not here, but I know how capable you are of transmitting messages to it, Commissioner, and also how appreciative we are of your efforts to make progress on this matter."
"I believe that the Member States must adopt a serious approach."
"One cannot, on the one hand, make fine statements to the media because one is justifiably upset about the consequences of certain decisions taken by the agencies and, on the other, throw a spanner in the works when it comes to the creation of this new authority, ESMA."
"We really want this authority to be clearly identified, to be equipped with strong powers at European level, and, in particular, to be able to supervise rating agencies."
"This will be one of its tasks, and an important one at that."
"This also reflects our desire to see, for example, market infrastructure and clearing houses supervised by a European authority."
"There is a lack of transparency on the market that worries us."
"We are not hostile to competition, far from it."
"We are not hostile to competition among stakeholders, far from it."
"To put it simply, the way in which their services are assessed must comply with the rules of transparency and serious conduct, which characterise markets worthy of the name."
"Therefore, once again, we encourage you to forge ahead and we call on the States not to hinder the process of getting ESMA off the ground, not to empty the supervision package of all content, because, if vetoes are applied, we could ultimately find ourselves being unable to supervise that which each and every one of us, in this House and in the capitals, wants to subject to more rigorous supervision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank most sincerely the political groups that are responsible for this series of questions on an extremely important matter."
"I am grateful to Mr Chountis, Mr Pittella, Mr Gauzès, Mrs Goulard - who spoke just now - and other Members who are due to take the floor."
"I should like you to hear my honest opinion and to fully appreciate my determination on this matter, as on others that concern the lessons learnt from the crisis and the transparency to which citizens and businesses are entitled."
"I also had the opportunity, on 20 April, to speak to you about this issue of credit rating agencies and their importance for the functioning of the economy and of the financial markets."
"When it comes to checking whether a product, a business, and, if necessary, a State - I refer here to sovereign risk, and I shall come back to this subject - is in good health or has a fever, you will agree with me, Mrs Goulard, ladies and gentlemen, that breaking the thermometer does not cure the fever."
"The question is whether the thermometer works properly and, if necessary, whether we can use several thermometers to perform the validations and checks."
"I feel that there is plenty to say about the functioning of the thermometer and, hence, about the functioning of credit rating agencies, which play a major role in assessing the risks associated with the situation of businesses and States alike."
"The crisis has shown, and continues to show, Mr Chountis - you are right - that they have not always functioned in an exemplary manner, with very serious consequences at times."
"This is an area, ladies and gentlemen, in which the G20 has taken strong decisions - as it has on other matters - and the decisions in this case have involved the introduction of supervision and rules of governance."
"I would remind you that, at the time of the crisis - many of you have mentioned this, including Mr Gauzès and Mrs Goulard - the Commission quickly assumed its responsibilities, and it has made the regulation of the activities of credit rating agencies a priority over the last two years."
"In September 2009 - in other words, one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers - the regulation on credit rating agencies was adopted with the very strong support, help and improvements of Parliament - and I am grateful once again to Mr Gauzès - in order to address the problems that the operating methods of these agencies were causing and which contributed, in a way, to the financial crisis."
"The regulation introduced a system of mandatory registration for all agencies established in the Union and imposed a set of stringent requirements to ensure, as far as possible, that there are no more potential conflicts of interest, to improve the quality of ratings and the methodology used, and, finally, to ensure that agencies operate in a more transparent way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that these new rules will noticeably improve the independence and integrity of the rating process, will make these rating activities more transparent, and will improve the quality of ratings themselves, including ratings of the sovereign debt of the countries of the European Union and of the financial institutions of the Union."
"Two weeks ago, on 2 June - this is the second stage - the Commission, at my instigation, adopted a proposed amendment to the regulation on credit rating agencies in order to entrust the future European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with sole responsibility for the ongoing registration and supervision of credit rating agencies."
"However, ESMA still needs to be set up, and I fully agree with what was said a moment ago by Mrs Goulard and which you all believe: as we discussed recently with the rapporteurs for the supervision package, for the de Larosière package, a dynamic, credible compromise must be reached between Parliament and the Council in order to implement what has been proposed, which is the creation of these three independent authorities on 1 January."
"We are not there yet."
"We must make an effort, and here I call once again on this House, on the Council and Parliament, to come closer to agreement."
"I repeat, Mr President, the Commission's willingness, and my willingness in particular, to help bring about this dynamic compromise."
"Moreover, in order to increase the benefits of transparency and to boost competition among credit rating agencies, a provision has been introduced to facilitate access to information on the structured financial products of any credit rating agencies interested in publishing an unsolicited credit rating."
"In other words, when an agency receives information enabling it to work out its credit rating on structured products, the other agencies will have the right to use that information to work out their own rating."
"This is the stage we are at."
"It is not enough."
"It is becoming ever more widely accepted, in Europe and throughout the world, that the current failings in credit rating procedures, which have been brought to light by the crisis, have not been sufficiently addressed, and I wish to voice my agreement with Mr Chountis on this matter."
"That is why I have asked my services to undertake a new assessment of the entire architecture and role of credit rating agencies."
"It is within this framework, Mr Pittella, that, in the coming months, we will carry out what you called an inquiry, but in any case an objective, very precise analysis and examination of the operating methods of these agencies in the light of and in accordance with the new legislation, even though it is not yet fully implemented; we will have to wait until early December for that."
"I, like all of you, ladies and gentlemen, believe that there is a problem, and it is quite simply to do with the diversity of this market."
"This market is too concentrated; it is in too few hands."
"There is not enough competition in this sector, and that worries us."
"Without singling out one particular option for the moment, Mr Pittella, the Commission is looking at structural measures, including the creation of an independent European credit rating agency, which for some of us - I am speaking for myself here - is a welcome thing, particularly when it comes to sovereign risk ratings, which were mentioned just now by Mr Gauzès, as well as by Mrs Goulard and Mr Pittella."
"Another structural measure that we are considering is the increased participation of independent public bodies in the credit rating process."
"Particular attention must be paid to sovereign debt - since that is what we are referring to when we talk about Greece and possibly about other States too - in order to ensure that the methods employed are indeed the right ones and that they are appropriate."
"The lack of due diligence on the part of the banks and the other financial establishments, and the lack of alternative criteria for assessing the reliability of an investment also merit special attention."
"The current financial regulations, which expressly provide for the use of credit ratings, also need to be thoroughly re-examined."
"Those are all the issues, and we will not sidestep any of the difficult matters on which the Commission is working."
"We will be able to present our initial guidelines in September and, at the same time, we will address other important matters relating to transparency and monitoring in the context of the regulation of derivative products and short selling."
"In addition, we will table some legislative proposals at the end of this year or at the very start of 2011, not only to continue - I am echoing what you said, Mrs Goulard - what was begun by my predecessor with your support, which is being implemented but which is not enough, but also to achieve a greater degree of transparency so as to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure that these ratings are greater in number, more diverse and, when it comes to sovereign risk, above reproach."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the credit rating agencies were not able to anticipate the subprime mortgage crisis, the risk of structured financial products, or the collapse of Lehman Brothers."
