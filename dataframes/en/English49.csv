"However, we do not share your judgement regarding the new fleet management tools, which were determined as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy: you seem to believe that these new tools will not bring a reduction in the overcapacity of the Community fleet."
"I would like to comment briefly on the two main advances of this new management policy."
"The first is the system for the entry and exit of fishing vessels – which is an innovation that neither the industry nor the Member States were too happy to accept – and this system will be combined with the ban on replacing fishing capacities that have been withdrawn with public, national or Community financing."
"That will result in a gradual reduction of our fleet."
"The second measure involves the systems to limit catches."
"This is obviously an essential component of the plans for the recovery of fish stocks and by limiting catches we will strengthen the efforts to reduce overcapacity."
"Our analysis is therefore very much in line with your own and is based on the weaknesses of the past. We believe that the measures adopted during the recent reform of the fisheries policy will allow us to respond, to a large extent, to the concerns you have expressed in your report."
". – Mr President, this report deals with the Commission's review of the multi-annual guidance programmes."
"Technically it covers the period up to 30 June 2002, but since Parliament is not going to do a report on the final situation as at 31 December, I will make some comments on the situation up to that date."
"This was the fourth generation multi-annual guidance programme, a series of programmes dating back to 1983."
"They tried to exert some control over the size and distribution of EU fleets."
"They have lasted for 20 years altogether."
"Considering that their objective was to achieve a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation, and in the light of the advice coming from ICES over the past few days, it can be safely concluded that they have been a resounding failure."
"To its credit, the Commission has proposed a far more comprehensive and important cut in fleet capacity than the Council was ever able to accept."
"For example, the agreed objectives for the Member States' combined fleets were so modest that the Community fleet as a whole was already smaller than the overall objectives, even before the MAGP IV entered into force."
"Some fleets required no reductions at all."
"Yet at the end of the programme in December 2002 only five of the 13 countries had met the objectives for all the different fleet segments."
"Spain, often criticised this House, was one of them."
"Clearly the Member States did not have their heart in the exercise."
"Now the MAGPs themselves are being scrapped."
"While we recognise that they were ineffective and cumbersome to administer, at least they had the goal of reducing fleet capacity."
"What has been put in place in the so-called reform does not even do that."
"Each Member State has been allocated a certain capacity for fishing vessels in tonnage and kilowatts, but there is no requirement for that capacity to be reduced."
"As the Commissioner himself said, only if public money is used is there any requirement to reduce capacity."
"As fish stocks are decreasing in abundance faster than the fishing fleets chasing them, the future does not look bright for either the fish or the coastal communities and the people depending on the fishing industry for a living."
"This is going to cause a major socio-economic crisis."
"It is looming on the horizon."
"As Mr Stevenson has said, they are going to suffer endless hardship."
"But that is going to be the case if we do not realise what the problem is and how to address it."
"As Mr Lamy is Commissioner for trade, he may be interested in knowing how the EU engages in free trade with fishing vessels."
"During the period 1998 to 2001, at least 746 vessels were exported to third countries."
"The number could be many times greater but since most of the vessels had left the fleet, the Commission has no idea what happened to them."
"They were simply decommissioned."
"Of those 746 vessels, at least 38 were directly exported to known flag of convenience countries."
"There are even examples of shipowners being funded by the FIFG to export to flag of convenience countries."
"Even Mr Lamy would have to admit that it is difficult to have a more liberalised trade than that!"
"Another problem with the management of the MAGPs by the Commission relates to the waters beyond the European Union."
"A couple of years ago, the Commission allowed a rather large vessel, the to join the Irish fleet, with the consequence that another vessel, the , was exported to a flag of convenience country, Panama."
"This was supposedly because the fish of Mauritania are or were plentiful."
"Earlier this year the Commission did a similar favour for the Dutch."
"This time they allowed the equivalent of three ' into the Dutch register to fish the same fish off Mauritania."
"But the Commission's own scientific advice says that there should be no increase in fishing effort there, so I cannot see how this can be justified."
"There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers."
"In the case of the that vessel was illegal."
"What did the Commission do?"
"It helped make it legal."
"It has made an illegal situation legal."
"It has done the same with the Dutch."
"It has now legalised an illegal situation."
"It sends out a clear signal to anyone else who wants to do this: basically break the law, ignore it, and the Commission will help you at the end of the day."
"That is the wrong signal to send out."
"It is clear that the Commission bends over backwards to accommodate shipowners of these huge supertrawlers."
"These are not the little coastal communities that will be affected, these are the huge business ventures."
"I am appalled at Commissioner Byrne who also bent over backwards to help the owner of the , the world's biggest pelagic trawler, to get that fishing licence."
"I believe it was a breach of his duty as a Commissioner to act in the interests of an individual businessman from his own country."
"That should also be investigated."
"I would like to know how many more Commissioners are bending over backwards to facilitate specific business interests against the interests of the Community as a whole."
"– Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the end report which is on the table, and which has also been well amended."
"I should like to make a somewhat political remark: she belongs to a group that regularly calls for civil disobedience in a great number of spheres, but I notice that she is now very law-abiding."
"As soon as an entrepreneur does something wrong – something that is not quite compatible with the rules – a punishment must be imposed immediately."
"I think that that is a good discussion in itself: it is possible to discuss even with the European left on which issues we should or should not follow the government."
"I digress."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is right that the multi-annual guidance programmes be laid to rest."
"Four generations of MAGPs have failed to produce anything; this is not the way to approach the common fisheries policy."
"Indeed, I have opposed this approach ever since I joined Parliament, and I am pleased that the Commission recognises that, and also the rapporteur."
"In addition, we must not stand still."
"It is clear that there is an excess in capacity, and something must be done about it."
"There are more means than just reducing the size of a fleet, however."
"By this I mean the use of ‘days at sea’: we can limit the number of days spent at sea."
"In addition, quotas can be better monitored by means of the joint management of these by producer organisations."
"There are a good few possibilities, and, indeed, I wish to ask in this regard that the Commission maximise the use of the existing possibilities in its policy before resorting to further new ones."
"At the same time, however, I should like to pledge my support for the Commission’s policy in this matter, as it is important that we establish a better grip on fleet size, possibly even with regard to going over from smaller to larger vessels in our fleets."
"With larger vessels it is often possible to put out to sea on more days, and sometimes that does not result in greater tonnage, but does lead to more actual fishing."
"In this regard, that very instrument – days at sea – coupled with a reduction in the capacity of fleets, could indeed be a very effective instrument for achieving a very productive approach, and also sustainable fishing."
"Once again, our group can endorse the general thrust of this report, including after the amendments, and I await the Commissioner’s response with interest."
"Mr President, again the comments we have just heard confirm my analysis of the history of these people and the need, which I believe was correctly recognised in the fisheries reform last year, to move to other systems."
"That is what we have done with, in my view, a desire that was clearly expressed by the Commission and the Member States, which, after many discussions, finally agreed to this new direction."
"As regards Mrs McKenna’s comment regarding the additional authorisation granted to the Netherlands for 2003, I would respond that the Commission did indeed accept an increase in their pelagic segments, subject to the condition, however, that they respect the commitments we have all made in this non-Atlantic zone, with a view to ensuring that the quotas laid down are not exceeded."
"It is only under this condition that the authorisation to which she refers was accepted."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debate on points under Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure."
"MAGPs are essential to achieving the level of resources needed to ensure that fishing can be a sustainable activity with a future within the European Union and any infringement of their provisions must be punished."
"We call on the Commission to demand full compliance with MAGPs by all Member States."
"Condoning anything less would amount to rewarding those who infringe Community legislation."
"We fail to understand how the behaviour of certain Fisheries Ministers continues to be tolerated. I refer to those Fisheries Ministers who agree to provisions in Council but then fail to comply with them or refuse to make data on compliance available."
"Fisheries resources, the Community’s fisheries sector and the regions that depend on fishing would all be better off if the CFP pursued a long-term socio-economic approach that was not full of contradictions."
"There is no point in awarding subsidies for ships to be built only then to pay to have them scrapped."
"It would make more sense to allow them to be exported to third countries, in the context of cooperation between the Community fisheries sector and those of developing countries."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is committed to a long-term policy that combines adapting the fleet to resources with maintaining a sustainable level of fishing."
"We want a future both for fish and for fishermen."
"The next item is the oral question (O-0065/2003 – B5-0280/2003) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the reform of the CMOs in tobacco, cotton and olive oil."
"Mr President, I think it is important to point out first that the Commission metes out different treatment to the various sectors dealt with in its communication."
"Three options are provided for sugar, but only one for olive oil, tobacco and cotton."
"These three crops are cultivated in the same geographical area. They also have in common that they are labour-intensive and dependent on other associated economic activities."
"Furthermore, many of the holdings on which tobacco and cotton are cultivated cover only a small area."
"Consequently, the impact on the cultivation of these three crops is likely to be significant. Serious consequences can be anticipated regarding the area under cultivation, the number of holdings, employment and economic activity in producer areas."
"In the case of cotton, the Commission has already recognised the danger of the crop ceasing to be grown altogether. It has therefore proposed partial decoupling of aid."
"The circumstances surrounding olive oil and tobacco are similar, yet no such proposal has been made for these crops."
"I would be interested to know what alternatives the Commission is contemplating for the area concerned should cultivation be reduced or cease altogether. I am particularly anxious about tobacco-producing areas."
"Doing away with tobacco growing seems to be part of some hidden agenda. I would also be interested to know from the Commission what it envisages the impact on tobacco imports will be, and whether it is of the opinion that consumption will decrease when the crop is no longer grown."
"The Commission’s communication also raises a number of major legal difficulties."
"In the case of oil, Council Regulation (EC) 1638/98 amending the common organisation of the market in fats and oils provided that: ‘no aid may be paid to olive growers in respect of additional olive trees or the relevant areas planted after 1 May 1998’"
"Nonetheless, the Commission’s communication suggests that all aid to olive oil would be calculated on the basis of aid received in the period 2000-2002."
"It should be borne in mind that an olive grove only starts to come into production five years after it is planted. It only comes into full production ten years after it is planted."
"According to the proposal in the Commission’s communication, olive trees planted between 1990 and 1 May 1998 would be entitled to aid, but the implication is that such aid would be less than the aid awarded to trees in other groves."
"This raises serious doubts as to whether the guidelines outlined by the Commission are compatible with the principle of legal certainty."
"Similarly, the 1998 Council Regulation provided for guaranteed national quantities. Exceeding these quantities would incur penalties, and entitlement to aid would be reduced."
"Furthermore, aid to olive trees planted between 1988 and 1 May 1998 would also be reduced if the approach outlined in the Commission’s communication were adopted."
"In this case too, there could potentially be a conflict with the principles of legal certainly and equal treatment of workers."
"Commissioner, I would be interested to learn the Commission’s views on this subject. I wonder if it is aware of the danger of one of the affected producers challenging the regulation in the Court of Justice and rendering it ineffective."
"The common market organisation for cotton is based on Protocol 4 annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece. It therefore has the force of a treaty."
"Paragraph 2 provides for the establishment of a Community regime with a view to maintaining the production of cotton in those regions of the Community where it represents a significant part of the agricultural economy. The aim was to enable producers to have a fair income and to stabilise the market, so as to improve structures as far as supply and demand are concerned."
"Paragraph 2.1 provided for the establishment of a Community regime aimed principally at maintaining cotton production in those areas of the Community where it is important for the agricultural economy. In addition, paragraph 3 provides for the granting of aid to production under the regime envisaged."
"The aid outlined by the Commission will not make it possible to maintain production in parts of the Union where the whole social situation is very finely balanced."
"Furthermore, the consequences of decoupling aid run counter to those sections of the Act of Accession of Greece I quoted earlier. They also run counter to what was agreed in 1979, ratified in 1986, and enshrined in texts that are a primary source of Community legislation."
"Commissioner, I do wonder whether the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, really does believe that its proposals comply with those Treaties."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to voice my astonishment at the fact that the European Parliament has not seen fit to express its opinion on the Commission’s communication by means of a resolution."
"If the Commission forwards a communication to the European Parliament, the latter should at the very least produce a response to the contents."
"Furthermore, this is an unprecedented decision."
"To date, the European Parliament had always responded with a report or a resolution to communications prior to reform of the CMOs."
"Mr President, as Mr Jové Peres as has just said, we have placed on the table a new stage in the process of the reform of our agricultural policy concerning cotton, olive oil and tobacco, with a view to bringing these areas into line with the general system, which is now that of the common agricultural policy, with the same objectives: no longer supporting production but supporting producers’ incomes by transferring a significant proportion of the current expenditure on production to a single farm payment scheme."
"As has just been said, it is true that the cotton, olive oil and tobacco sectors have very specific characteristics and that their production is concentrated in regions which, in general, are less developed. That is why the Commission has taken account of the economic, social and environmental effects of total decoupling in these sectors."
"As regards cotton, we calculated the proportion to be transferred to the new single decoupled payment, which totals 60%, with a view to allowing cotton production to continue, whilst enabling producers to achieve margins similar to those of competing crops."
"However, in order to reduce the negative effects on the environment, we are also proposing maximum area limits, which are in fact below the areas planted during the reference period for the allocation of the new area payment."
"We must therefore expect a decrease in cotton production and we are aware that this reform will require adjustments on the part of the sector."
"That is why we have also proposed that it should be accompanied by rural development measures."
"Thus, there will be an impact, and that impact will have to be accompanied by rural development measures."
"With regard to olive oil, at present we are also seeking to achieve better market orientation and greater stability of farmers’ incomes on the one hand and the preservation of olive groves where they offer a clear social and environmental advantage on the other hand."
"We have therefore proposed that the Member States should retain 40% of their current aid for payments linked to production in order to finance, in the form of national envelopes, aid for the preservation of olive grove that offer these advantages."
"This aid is intended to cover the costs of maintaining the olive trees, independent of any support for production or harvests."
"Because we are aware of the diversity of regional situations, we feel that the Member States should have the capacity to establish the levels of the payments so that they can adapt the amount of aid according to the local situation in order to ensure that it reaches the areas where it is most needed."
"Finally, as regards tobacco, our proposals are also based on an extended impact assessment."
"We analysed all of the direct and indirect implications of the current market organisation, from the point of view of production and from the point of view of the impact of various options on agricultural incomes and on employment in the different regions where tobacco is produced."
"We consulted producers, we consulted local representatives in producing regions during a forum which brought together all of the interested parties, and we reached the conclusion that the reorientation of tobacco production was essential."
"We must not forget that even now the revenue of many farms does not cover the variable production costs."
"Our study also shows that this reorientation of production may, of course, have a negative impact on employment in the sectors at both ends that are linked to the tobacco economy, even though we do not have any precise assessment of the global and local impact."
"There is no doubt that tobacco production is important for the economy of certain regions today and there is no doubt that its disappearance will have consequences from that point of view, which we hope to limit."
"Therefore, unlike the proposals for cotton and olive oil, we have adopted a specific approach which first and foremost involves entirely decoupling small farms – those where production is below 3.5 tonnes – in order to ensure immediately that these small structures continue to receive the full income support they currently receive."
"As far as restructuring is concerned, we are proposing additional financing, by transferring a proportion of the funds currently used for direct aid for production to a restructuring envelope, which would bolster the existing rural development funds of producing regions, thus helping them to support diversification."
"This form of redeployment, which involves using existing money to benefit restructuring, forms part of the Commission’s proposals, on the understanding that it would be up to producers and those involved in the regions concerned to lay down the most apt measures from among the array of “rural development” measures available."
"Consequently, our proposals in these three sectors take account both of the general rules, which we hope are now those of the common agricultural policy, and specific characteristics."
"These three sectors differ a great deal from the other major crops, they differ a great deal from each other, and our proposals seek to reflect this diversity, whilst remaining faithful to our general principles."
"Mr President, in this debate I shall focus exclusively on the alarm raised by the Commission amongst European tobacco growers further to its hare-brained proposal for reform of the sector."
"One might well wonder if it really is so difficult to understand the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers."
"I refer to Mr Alemanno, the Italian Minister. He spoke eloquently about the social importance of retaining this crop, notably in Spain, Greece and Italy."
"Tobacco imports into the European Union are bound to increase. The President of the Agriculture Council has argued along these lines."
"So too are the authorities in my constituency, Extremadura. It is one of the regions set to suffer most if this body blow to rural society is actually delivered."
"I would point out yet again that the move could have devastating consequences for the region. Some 20 000 families would be affected."
"Loss of income would be of the order of EUR 200 million. I must also state that no alternative use of the land has yet been identified, other than leaving it uncultivated."
"It should therefore be in a position to provide figures for the drop in tobacco consumption in the Union following reform. It should also be able to provide information on the tariffs to be imposed in order to restrict imports of tobacco into the Union."
"I trust the Commission took careful note of events in the House this morning during the vote on the budget."
"Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 723 and 338. The amendments would have resulted in drastic reductions of tobacco premiums."
"Once again, Parliament has demonstrated its understanding of the social damage a cut in premiums would inflict on so many rural European families. I must reiterate that there is nothing else they can grow."
"I know the Commissioner for Agriculture has feelings. I would like to hope he has taken this political message on board."
"It is that yet again this debate has been characterised by blatant discrimination against traditional Mediterranean crops as regards reform of their production. Mr Jove Peres highlighted this earlier."
"By contrast, the only chance of debating the implications of the communication for the other three Mediterranean crops will be following an oral question today. This will not even lead to a resolution in plenary."
"There does not appear to be any justification for such differences in formal procedures. Furthermore, discrimination and variable treatment are evident in the substance, not just in the formalities."
"Price support mechanisms are being phased out and replaced with others designed to support income. The Commission itself is on record as stating that this concludes the 1992 decoupling."
"Nonetheless, immediate changes are demanded in these three sectors. This means that for cotton, olive oil and tobacco, there is to be a sudden change from aid linked directly to production to totally decoupled aid."
"There can be no justification for failure to provide an opportunity for us to discuss a suitable transitional period with the Commission."
"The employment generated in the sectors in question is of crucial importance. I refer not only to the jobs linked to cultivation of the crops, but also to jobs dependent on the processing industry, jobs in the service industries and in general to the wealth created in rural areas."
"Loss of production and winding up production in these sectors will have dramatic economic consequences. The result will be large-scale rural exodus."
"I would remind the Commissioner that no impact assessment has yet been undertaken for the cotton sector. I also appeal to the Commission to be flexible when it comes to discussion of transitional adjustment periods appropriate for these sectors."
"Before I conclude, I should like to call on the Commissioner to provide a clear explanation of the importance of Community cotton production in the global market. I do so in my capacity as rapporteur for the cotton sector and in the wake of Cancun."
"The Union accounts for 0.5% of global cotton production. It does not grant any export refunds whatsoever."
"Mr President, I hereby state from the outset that, if the Commission's new proposals are implemented, they will be the for Mediterranean products."
"The Greek countryside and three of the country's basic products, which are grown by 75% of farmers, will receive a mortal blow so as to serve the new plans and commitments of the CAP, the WTO and the enlargement of the European Union, in other words the instructions of big business and the multinationals, which are ordering that tobacco farming be wiped out, cotton farming be cut back, olive oil farming be abandoned, products in which the European Union is highly deficient."
"They are indifferent to the consequences, which will be painful not just for the farmers, but also for workers in processing, warehouses and so on, as well as for anyone with professional connections with these products and numerous small- and medium-sized businesses active in these sectors."
"The Commission is cruelly proposing with no turning back to abolish tobacco farming and subsidies by 2013."
"The chronicle of a death announced before Gothenburg."
"On the pretext of protecting health, it is wiping out European tobacco farming, tobacco farmers and, for Greece, all the activity surrounding the farming, trading and processing of tobacco which, as you know, is concentrated mainly on small lots in problematic mountain areas."
"The highest hypocrisy and cynicism, given that it does not at the same time propose to abolish the European tobacco industries which, of course, will continue to import raw tobacco unimpeded from third countries and to speculate by making and exporting cigarettes."
"The European Union of 370 million citizens is being called on to stop financing 347 000 tonnes of tobacco, while the USA of 263 million citizens continue to increase their production of 586 000 tonnes, a large proportion of which is imported into the European Union."
"What is clear is that tobacco farmers will receive less money, referred to in future as decoupling subsidies but in practice they will be scant unemployment benefits and pseudo-compensation for abolishing tobacco farming from the European Union."
"As far as cotton is concerned, so that the cotton farmers do not delude themselves, the Commission clearly states in its introductory report that the new reform of the COM is being carried out because the objective of reducing the price and reducing the cultivated areas and production, for which provision was made in the 2001 reform, has not yet been achieved."
"In two years, cotton farming in Greece has been reduced by 70 000 hectares, with a significant reduction in the price of cotton and in producers' incomes, due to the increase in coresponsibility levies and all the absurd measures for prohibiting and limiting the number of hectares cultivated and the return per hectare."
"250 000 tonnes of two years' Greek production did not receive any subsidies and only obtained the international price which, as we know, is fixed by the multinationals."
"The same prices are obtained by the developing countries, which the European Union is supposedly doing its utmost for."
"However, the Commission is demanding even greater reductions under a new disastrous reform."
"With a 'because I say so', it has set a low ceiling of 34 000 hectares for Greece and similar cutbacks for Spain and Portugal in a bid to lower the ceiling even further with the measures it is taking."
"The Commission proposals for cotton even overturn Protocol ΙV, as Mr Jové Peres mentioned, of the 1981 Act of Accession of Greece to the EEC on the basis of which the guarantee of a minimum price for producers is laid down."
"Nor does a proven healthy product, such as olive oil, escape the European Union's eternal anti-farming policy."
"Hypocritical and groundless arguments are being used to wipe out olive oil farming."
"A spirit of hypocrisy and mockery at the expense of olive farmers prevails in the proposals in the Commission's report on oil."
"Having stated that there is a serious risk of cutting care for olive trees on a broad scale, while those who wrote and inspired the proposals are obviously conscious of what will happen with them, measures are being proposed which will achieve what, theoretically, they do not wish to happen, in other words 60% decoupling."
"These three Mediterranean products are victims of the mid-term reform of the CAP which is strangling farming."
"The catastrophic CAP is turning into an even more efficient mechanism for wiping out farmers, especially small- and medium-sized farmers."
"The constant reference to environmental protection is being used as an alibi to reduce farm production."
"The hypocrisy becomes crystal clear from the anti-tobacco rather than the anti-smoking campaign, at a time when the cultivation of modified crops is being promoted."
"These proposals are not open to amendment or improvement."
"That is why, if they are not withdrawn as they stand, they will come up against the combative, fighting opposition of the agricultural world in order to avert their implementation."
"When you expressed your position, Mr Lamy, you said that you had also come to an agreement with the producers."
"The only thing you did not do was to come to an agreement with the producers, the real producers."
"You came to an agreement with those who have nothing to do with production, nothing to do with the products and, mainly, you came to an agreement with the multinationals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, all those present here today seem to agree that the products under discussion are of significant social importance."
"That much is obvious to Parliament, the Commission and to those affected."
"When all is said and done, the fundamental objective of agricultural aid is to provide people in rural areas with a reasonable income."
"They will then be deterred from leaving their land and flocking to the cities or to richer parts of Europe."
"It should be borne in mind that we are striving to attain two of the Union’s fundamental ambitions."
"These are to achieve territorial balance within Europe and to prevent the depopulation and desertification of rural areas. Sadly, there is considerable experience of the latter in Aragon, the region I represent."
"Commissioner, this is what the common agricultural policy should be aiming at, especially in the case of crops with such social importance."
"It is essential to encourage people in rural areas to remain on the land in their regions in order to prevent the desertification of parts of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, I have long been endeavouring to extract from the Commission figures relating to the number of jobs to be lost in the leaf tobacco production sector, the related manufacturing industry and in associated sectors. So far, my efforts have been in vain."
"I put a specific question to the Commission yesterday and received a reply today. This reiterated that the reform will not have a negative impact on the income of the holdings."
"The Commission has also reiterated here and now that the reform will not have a negative impact on producers’ incomes either. To date, however, the Commission has failed to respond to the question concerning the effect of the reform on employment."
"You are yourself on record as stating that no specific assessment exists, Commissioner."
"I have received similar information in written answers, despite indications that 14 Directorates-General have been exercised on the subject."
"Commissioner Lamy, I feel it is irresponsible to undertake such a far-reaching reform without any information on the implications for jobs. Some 100 000 directly related jobs are at risk in the sector, together with 500 000 indirectly related ones."
"I believe the Commission does actually know this. I suggest it is withholding the figures because it is fully aware of their alarming proportions."
"I suggest too that the Commission is fully aware of the devastating consequences of the reform for employment and the regions affected. I can certainly forecast them myself, and so can all those who understand the sector and work in it."
"Commissioner, producers are up in arms in Extremadura, the region I represent."
"They rightly believe the reform to be brutal, radical and unjustified. They feel they are about to be sacrificed in the interests of a cause ridden with misinterpretations."
"They find themselves in an unbearable situation. They are angry because they have been at the receiving end of hypocritical and misleading statements."
"Allow me to remind you, Commissioner, that in June the Commission gave assurances that reform would be undertaken taking account of the social situation in the least-favoured regions."
"Allow me to recall also that in June Parliament and the Council were instrumental in obtaining a political compromise. This entailed Mr Fischler abandoning the maximalist approach of total decoupling."
"Despite all of this, there is now a proposal for total decoupling of the most labour-intensive CMO."
"Commissioner, I join with previous speakers in urging the Commission to reflect. Before adopting these regulations, I beg you to spare a thought for the anguish of those families and the future of the regions concerned."
"Commissioner Lamy, you have heard here the concerns of my fellow Members and now I would simply like to make an observation."
"The age-old imbalance between Mediterranean crop production and crop production in the rest of Europe needed a different approach, whereas we are faced with the reform of Mediterranean crop production after the failure of Cancun and with a view to enlargement."
"Our concern is growing, with the fear that these two processes may exert further, unendurable pressure on our Mediterranean crops."
"Our concerns are, indeed, extremely serious regarding tobacco, even though everyone has to take on board the European Union’s principle of protecting health: these measures will cause extreme economic and social upheaval and result in foreign tobacco imports being increased to 100 %, so I certainly feel that greater caution would be in order."
"I would like to focus my remarks on one of the three crops that we are discussing because I feel that it is a case of enforced coupling."
"Each of these products is, indeed, special and deserved to be treated separately rather than them all being placed under the same umbrella."
"I am referring, in particular, to olive oil."
"Of course, there is a desire to reduce the requirement for support based on the amount produced."
"I would take the liberty of emphasising, however, that this condiment enhances food consumption across the world and, since it is a product which is good for health, there is increasing demand for it."
"I therefore feel that we have two major problems: guaranteeing a safety net for income and boosting quality policies."
"We will discuss these proposals after the legislative proposal."
"You quite rightly refer us to the decisions of the individual states, but we must also consider a number of general criteria such as employment."
"I put it to you: how can you reconcile the provision of incentives for the quality of this crop with the ongoing possibility of mixing olive oil with other fats?"
"It is this possibility of mixing that causes a vertical drop in prices and is a blow to farmers."
". Mr President, allow me to say a few words to respond to the comments that have been made."
"I note that the choice of speakers means that only Members with reservations concerning these reforms have spoken."
"I will begin with tobacco."
"It has already been discussed, and I have some memories of my own from just over 10 years ago in this very House."
"Given the tensions that could be noted here and there between the agricultural policy and the health policy, one wondered whether we should review our options."
"So this debate has not come about all of a sudden: it has not just landed in our laps, we have been considering it for years, and you, in Parliament, have been discussing it for years."
"I believe that the Commission would indeed have been Tartuffe had it not drawn conclusions from these debates that have been held over the years and I believe that we are drawing the conclusions in a very clear manner."
"In this case, we are proposing a redeployment, a restructuring of this crop towards alternative crops."
"A clear option is being taken."
"We know that this will require considerable efforts on the part of a number of tobacco producers today, at both ends of the scale, but we are putting proposals, including financial proposals, on the table that allow this restructuring to take place due to the necessity that we have again discussed over the past years."
"The same does not apply, however, to olive oil and to cotton, where the aim is not to restructure nor to convert or guide production or producers to other products."
"We want to maintain a number of cotton crops and many olive groves in the European Union by avoiding the depopulation or desertification of the zones in question, but also by correcting the effects of the current aid systems from the point of view of production, the environment and the finances of the European Union."
"That is why the Commission has presented an option, somewhere in the middle, that does not take decoupling as far as the measures adopted in Luxembourg this year for other products."
"It is, in fact, in order to take account of the particular sensitivity of a number of these regions that we have not gone as far as we could have gone in theory, and I can guarantee this, to have participated in the Commission’s discussions on the proposals by our friend Mr Fischler on this subject."
"My third point relates to the difference in the treatment of sugar."
"Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, be assured that the reform of the CMO in sugar has begun as we have put forward three options. This is an initial discussion phase that must take place because, it must be said, it is the first time that the substance is being discussed, which is not the case for tobacco, cotton or olive oil."
"The Commission’s formal proposals will be presented next year, once the debate on the three options has been held with the main parties concerned."
"Finally, to Mr Jové Peres, who was worried about the impact regarding aid to olive trees depending on the year of planting, I will say that as far as I can tell, this is not a real problem since the maximum guaranteed quantities have already been exceeded, which means that this does not have any impact on the amount of the aid in question."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50)."
"The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution (B5-0434/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on human rights violations and failure to show respect for the rule of law in Burundi."
"I think it is useful to recall the background to the current situation in that country. It is now ten years since the murder of Mr Ndadaye, its first democratically elected President."
"Since then, Burundi has been ravaged by civil war. The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups."
"Initially, this was led by the President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, and later by Mr Mandela. The terms of the process provide for a cessation of armed conflict."
"This was to be followed by the various stages of an electoral process and transition to democracy. An equitable power sharing system was to be established, together with a rotating Presidency passing from Hutus to Tutsis every 18 months."
"All these arrangements are contained in the August 2000 Arusha Peace Agreement which resulted in the present transitional government."
"A delegation from the Committee on Development and Cooperation visited Burundi between 22 and 27 June of last year."
"On 9 July 2003 the President of Burundi appeared before the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"On 8 October an agreement on effective implementation of the cease-fire was reached between the Government and the main faction of the so-called Forces for the Defence of Democracy led by Pierre Nkurunziza. Unfortunately, armed confrontations between groups such as the FDD and the FNL have continued."
"The African Union has dispatched the African Mission In Burundi peace-keeping force known as the AMIB. It consists of 3 000 soldiers from Ethiopia, South Africa and Mozambique."
"The force is tasked with assisting in the disarmament and demobilisation of rebel soldiers and with their reintegration back into society. In addition, if peace is maintained, it should be easier to for humanitarian aid supplies to reach displaced persons and the population in war-torn areas."
"The last of the AMIB soldiers arrived in Burundi last Sunday."
"The force is financed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Mozambique."
"Nonetheless, there appear to be financial difficulties over keeping it in the field."
"At the same time, the problems in the south of Kivu are ongoing. Confrontations are still taking place and they represent a threat to peace in the region."
"Aid was reinstated, however, following the response to the peace negotiations. EUR 48 million was granted for a rehabilitation programme aimed mainly at supporting the return of displaced persons and demobilisation."
"The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation."
"In addition, institutional support amounting to EUR 2 million was awarded to the Ministry of Economy."
"A further EUR 150 million was allocated at the Paris Conference in 2001. This included an ECHO programme for the return of Burundian refugees from Tanzania supported by UNHCR."
"European Union funds amounting to EUR 285 million are currently available to Burundi. Additional funds will be allocated under the ninth EDF."
"We would like this resolution to serve as a reminder to the authorities in Burundi that they need to involve women in the peace process. We believe women have an important part to play in the latter."
"We also encourage neighbouring countries to support the peace process in Burundi. Finally, we hope to be able to rejoice that peace has come about in this small country in central Africa."
"– Mr President, although our group supports this resolution – a very balanced one despite the many amendments, which we all accept – we do believe that what is needed, above all, to resolve this problem properly, is a realistic long-term process."
"For a long time, in this region, the land of the great lakes, we have seen very violent conflicts, even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions, which, if we merely apply short-term remedies, will only keep on recurring."
"That is why it matters that we should start by clarifying terminology, for the words that we use here are often not the same ones that are used in the region itself."
"We talk in terms of armies, parties, or refugees, but these are, as a rule, ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army, a party or as refugees."
"What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups, with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces, in the administration and, as the amendment so rightly puts it, in the justice system above all."
"This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity, rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role, for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans, too, to spend centuries smashing each others’ skulls in, and such things are still going on in Europe today."
"We really do, then, have to approach this task with the proper sensitivity and humility; we cannot expect people who were doing terrible things to each other only a few years or months ago to be able, within only a few months, to behave as if nothing had happened."
"That is why we need this process; although we must waste no time in getting on with it, we need sensitivity, we need time, and we need to be present."
"That is why we need civil servants, lawyers and also officers from the armed services to act as advisors to both sides."
"Mr President, the unfortunate people of Burundi are continuing to pay through periodic killings, through arbitrary arrests and through torture. The ethnic opposition is constantly intensified by the leaders of armed gangs, official or unofficial, that were created and supported, it must be remembered, for decades by the former Belgian colonising power and by the French tutelary power."
"The resolution provides a great deal of moralistic and paternalistic advice for the Burundi leadership, the leaders of the factions and its neighbours."
"Yet more than advice is needed, as the European powers have an overwhelming responsibility for what has happened and what is happening in Burundi, just as they have a more general responsibility for all of Africa, of which Rwanda and Burundi are to some extent the sad symbols."
"They have an overwhelming responsibility for having ruined Africa through the trafficking of slaves, through colonialist pillaging and then through another form of pillaging, which continues today."
"While Parliament provides moralising advice, the major British, French and Belgian capitalist groups and many others continue to take their stipend, even from the poorest countries, and the little information that filters through from many parts of Africa where ethnic conflicts and mining riches go side by side show that it is very rare to find a situation where behind the local warlords there are no capitalist groups trying to get their hands on the riches the land has to offer."
"Rather than improving the fate of the local population, these riches are the cause of its misfortune."
"I am well aware that material aid, even a great deal of it, would not be enough to overcome all of the problems that are an extension of the past."
"However, if Europe wanted to, it could provide sufficient aid to allow the refugees to return, provide the Burundi people with acceptable housing and living conditions, and enable them to build infrastructures, hospitals and schools, thus creating jobs."
"The resolution does allude to aid, in particular for the economic reconstruction of the country, but it gives much more attention to the financing of African forces working to restore and maintain peace and the despatch of a mission of European senior military officials to meet their counterparts in the Burundi regular army."
"Yet in neighbouring Rwanda some years ago, the presence of French senior military officials not only did not prevent the genocide but actually encouraged it and perhaps even armed the butchers."
"Thus, even if this resolution had some effect, it would certainly not wipe away the traces of blood that the presence of major European capital has left in Burundi and more generally in the African continent."
"Mr President, when we consider the historic, colonial interference of many European countries in various places around the world, for example Burundi, it is very important that we have this discussion here today on Burundi where government forces have been responsible for extra-judicial killings, disappearances, torture and other serious violations."
"Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill, maim, abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims."
"Moreover, armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit, at times forcibly, child combatants."
"As was agreed last December, and has already been mentioned here, it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace."
"We in the Green EFA group have also called for judicial and army reform, as provided for in the Arusha accords of 2000, and an end to impunity for those who continue to perpetrate human rights abuses."
"We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission, as has been called for by so many in civil society."
"We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court."
"We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community, especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country, for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government."
"This is a challenge that the EU must rise to."
"But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses – not just in Burundi, but in so many other parts of the world."
"This is something that must be a priority for the EU, we cannot allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses."
"We should not be involved with arms in the first place, to be honest."
"Mr President, the Pretoria Protocol brings new hope for the peace process in Burundi, and the EU along with the international community needs to support strongly the transitional government in its efforts to restore stability and law."
"To rebuild national unity and reconciliation after those long years of civil war, it is vital to ensure that people, individuals and communities who suffered gross human rights abuses are acknowledged and provided with reparation."
"This is why I support the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission, of the kind set up in South Africa or Sierra Leone for instance."
"It will allow cases of extreme violations of human rights committed by all parties to be identified and investigated."
"It also provides victims with support to ensure that their dignity is restored and that healing and rehabilitation can occur."
"Bringing the accused to trial under the legal, judicial process strengthens the rule of law and is vital in breaking the cycle of vengeance created by widespread rapes and killings committed with impunity."
"A truth and reconciliation commission would also raise awareness of human rights and provide the basis for peace-building and sustainable reconciliation of the communities of Burundi."
". Mr President, like Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, it is with a certain degree of optimism that we welcomed news of the conclusion of the Pretoria Protocol between the transitional government and the armed Hutu group, the FDD."
"This Protocol is in our eyes an important step towards consolidating the peace process in Burundi."
"It shows that many of the local actors are prepared to respect the Arusha Agreement as a framework for the peace process."
"Like the author of the resolution we are discussing this afternoon, we are also concerned about the exclusion from the process of the last rebel group, the FNL, and we feel that it is important to continue to encourage all initiatives to launch the negotiations between the FNL and the transitional government in Burundi."
"What have we done so far?"
"For the most part, we have supported the peace process as far as possible, deploying a number of instruments to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation, including food aid, financial contributions and the despatch of observers from the African Union. Pending the establishment of the facility to support peace, we are preparing, in collaboration with the African Union, an emergency project to maintain peace in Burundi, which totals around EUR 25 million."
"Naturally, we hope that the entire donor community will stand alongside us."
"We are working towards the economic reconstruction of Burundi with a rehabilitation programme, totalling just under EUR 50 million, which is designed to ensure the physical rehabilitation of the economic and social infrastructures that have unfortunately been destroyed by the civil war, as in other parts of Africa."
"In August, we signed an indicative national programme with Burundi, as part of the ninth EDF, which amounts to around EUR 70 million, part of which is naturally allocated to the restoration of the political institutions in the transitional phase."
"Therefore, in our view, support for the peace process and a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the country are the two objectives that the Union must continue to strive towards in order to support the little progress being made as regards the peace process in that country, which sadly continues to be troubled."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Turkmenistan, including Central Asia:"
"– B5-436/2003 tabled by Max van den Berg and Richard Corbett on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"– B5-0440/03 tabled by Ole Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"– B5-0445/03 tabled by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group;"
"– B5-0446/03 tabled by Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"– B5-0449/03 tabled by Pernille Frahm and Luigi Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"– B5-0450/03 tabled by John Bowis and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"– B5-0452/03 tabled by Bart Staes and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group."
"Mr President, it is not without reason that the resolution at hand calls President Niyazov’s Turkmenistan ‘one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world’."
"As a Member of this House, I then rub my eyes in astonishment when I see President Chirac of France referring to the figure known as Turkmenbashi as ‘Father of all Turkmen’ and ‘my best and great friend’."
"He did this on 13 October on the occasion of the presentation of the new French Ambassador’s letters of credence in Ashkabad."
"In his letter to President Niyazov, President Chirac also expressed the desire to consolidate and deepen the warm relations between France and Turkmenistan."
"Apparently, in Paris, oil and natural gas interests take priority over everything."
"Just compare that with our resolution."
"What was that we were saying about a single European voice?"
"Whilst the Member States of the European Union are discussing the undeniable fact of the Christian tradition of the Occident, sincere Christians in Turkmenistan are having to fear for their lives daily."
"It is their certain knowledge and solace that God is watching over His church everywhere."
"That does not alter the fact, however, that we have a political responsibility towards their oppressors."
"Council and Commission, please, understand your calling."
"Mr President, today in Europe and every part of the civilised world it is Thursday, but in Turkmenistan ironically it is 'the day of justice'."
"Well, there is nothing just about life in Turkmenistan, but justice for the Turkmen people is what this debate is all about."
"President Niyazov renamed himself."
"He renamed the days of the week."
"He named the months of the year after his national heroes, starting with himself and his mother."
"He has built lavish palaces; he has erected statues of himself while his people remain impoverished."
"From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant."
"Since 1999 he has been president for life."
"In November last year the worst repression of all followed an attack on him."
"Turkmenistan has become a land of torture and imprisonment, of death in custody, of intolerance towards political and religious views."
"The press is muzzled, human rights organisations are barred and opposition is driven abroad."
"Our resolution lists names, and we demand the release of those names, the end of ill-treatment in those cases where they are actually still alive, and access to them for the Red Cross."
"But they are the tip of an iceberg that needs to be exposed."
"I trust that the Commission will do just that."
"Our delegation on Central Asia covers all the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia."
"Last May we were in Uzbekistan, the beautiful and historic country of Tamburlaine."
"We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors."
"But two days after we left Mr Ruslan Sharipov was arrested."
"Ruslan Sharipov is a journalist who wrote about police and government corruption."
"He was arrested on charges of homosexual conduct, criminalised in that country under Article 120 of the criminal code, in contradiction with the provisions of the ICCPR ratified by Uzbekistan."
"On 28 August masked men kidnapped and severely beat his public defender, Surat Ikramov."
"In September Mr Sharipov got out by letter allegations of his ill-treatment and of how he was threatened in prison by police and prison officers."
"In September the charge was reduced, but only reduced."
"He should never have been charged."
"He should be released now, and I ask the Commission to intervene in this case."
"While we were in Uzbekistan, we also met the British Ambassador, Craig Murray."
"He is a fearless diplomat who told us the truth as he saw it."
"Perhaps he was unwise to do so, but he was right to do so."
"At a meeting in Tashkent on 17 October he said: 'I believe that people are born with an instinct for liberty and that freedom and democracy come naturally to people everywhere once they are given the chance'."
"Well, the British Government did not endorse or commend him."
"It summoned him home for treatment."
"I ask the Commission to issue a diplomatic 'habeus corpus' challenge to the British Foreign Secretary: restore a good man to his post and the gainers will be the Uzbek people and their leaders, but also the good name of British diplomacy."
"Mr President, the clarity of the resolution on which we are now voting leaves nothing to be desired."
"As has already been quoted by other fellow Members, Turkmenistan is ‘one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world’."
"The situation in other Central Asian countries is perhaps a little better, but there, too, the human rights situation is abominable."
"Does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia?"
"My answer is ‘no’, and for two reasons."
"The first is the strategic goals."
"Ignoring that region will not do."
"It is not in Europe’s interests to let those countries, which export corruption and instability as well as oil and gas, remain ‘rogue states’."
"There is a second reason, too, which is the necessity – already mentioned by some fellow Members – of doing business regarding the large quantities of oil and gas in that region."
"To some politicians, however, and sadly also some fellow MEPs, that means that we have to do business first and foremost, and that we should just mention human rights, but on no account focus attention on them too much."
"Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, when, on account of our need for oil from the Middle East, we kept quiet about the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia."
"It is true that Europe needs oil and gas, including from that region, but that also means that those countries need us, and this provides us with the opportunity of giving priority to the human rights situation – to improving it, in particular – in our dealings with those countries, and only then speaking about oil."
"Referring to EU policy in Kosovo I would say: ‘standards before oil’."
"– Mr President, what I have to say supplements what my colleague Mr Bowis said."
"We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia, and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda."
"I should like to begin with Turkmenistan."
"I am still rapporteur for a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan."
"Parliament, along with the Commission, has stated that it does not actually want to conclude that agreement, nor does it want to discuss it."
"There is every reason for this."
"As Mr Bowis and other fellow Members have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable."
"At the same time, however, we have to think about what we can do for the people of Turkmenistan."
"We believe that Parliament must make an urgent appeal for the Red Cross to be able to visit the prisoners again in any event, for us to be able to resume good contact with the NGOs, and for those NGOs to have some freedom once again in those countries."
"We must stand up for the people – including politicians and human rights activists – who are currently incarcerated."
"We must stand up for freedom of belief."
"It is too absurd for words that only a certain form of Islam, and only the Orthodox Church, still have some degree of freedom, or in any event still enjoy a measure of protection, while all the other groups, both Christian and non-Christian, lack that protection."
"This is unacceptable, because people and religion belong together."
"With regard to a number of the other countries mentioned, I should like to point out that, in spring of this year, we also discussed a resolution on Kazakhstan."
"That led to intensive talks between our delegation and parliamentary delegations from Kazakhstan, and improvements were introduced on a number of items."
"We are still finding ourselves disappointed on many counts, however: legal procedures, freedom of the press, and also freedom of organisation."
"I hope that these first steps that Kazakhstan has made in the right direction are not the last, but instead that further pressure, including on the part of the European Union, will lead to improvements in the situation in that country."
"I wish to make a passionate plea for a new cooperation agreement with Tajikistan."
"Fortunately, the Commission is currently preparing an agreement for that country, too, which is an extremely good thing, because we must keep close to these countries."
"Mr Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan, and I have nothing to add."
"That leaves Kyrgyzstan."
"The present resolution rightly levels a number of criticisms, but, at the same time, we have here a country that deserves our warm support, because it is trying, with ups and downs, to build a democracy, despite having no resources and no oil."
"There should be criticism where criticism is due, but, even more importantly, support where support is due."
"I also wish to express to the Commission my hope that, in coming years, when it comes to Central Asia, the European Union will perhaps give a little extra support to a country such as this, in particular, which has no oil and no resources."
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns that have just been expressed by the Members as regards Turkmenistan’s lack of respect for its human rights and democratic obligations, be it the obviously unfair trials of political prisoners, the ill-treatment of these prisoners, which is common knowledge, or the serious attacks on religious freedom, for example, regarding which we have the same information as you."
"Our analysis is therefore the same: the situation is serious in relation to respect for human rights."
"In spite of this situation, however, it is important to maintain dialogue with Turkmenistan in order to avoid totally isolating the country, which in our opinion and in the current circumstances would probably be even worse from the point of view of respect for human rights, which we promote."
"As regards the other countries of Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan – which you have just mentioned, at both EU level and Member State level, we continue to stress that the international commitments concerning human rights must be respected, and we do this within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreements."
"With regard to the bilateral relations between the Union and these countries, we do the same, and we have done so publicly for all of these democracy problems in Central Asia by cooperating with other international bodies working with us on this issue, be it the United Nations, the OSCE or the Commission on Human Rights."
"Therefore, we fully and completely share the concerns that have just been expressed and are set out in the motion for a resolution."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Nepal:"
"– B5-0435/03 tabled by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"– B5-0437/03 tabled by Hannes Swoboda and Maria Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"– B5-0439/03 tabled by Astrid Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"– B5-0448/03 by Pedro Marset Campos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"– B5-0451/2003 by Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"- B5-0453/2003 by Reinhold Messner and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group."
"Mr President, the recent breakdown of the ceasefire in Nepal and the ensuing violence have led to a huge loss of life and injury."
"To achieve lasting peace in Nepal, an open and democratic society, and progress and prosperity for all, all sides must honour the armistice of 19 January as well as the code of conduct which was signed by both the Maoist insurgents and the government on 13 March 2003."
"The announcement yesterday that the Maoist rebels will no longer carry out political killings, or destroy public utilities or infrastructure is just a crumb of comfort."
"Sadly, since the breakdown of the ceasefire, 211 people have lost their lives."
"We must ensure that we support and promote democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Nepal."
"The recent opening of an EC delegation office in Katmandu is a welcome boost to EU-Nepal relations and cooperation."
"We must ensure that we do all we can on the ground to help those suffering directly and indirectly from the unrest."
"We should increase our financial assistance in Nepal and we must ensure that the main goal is the eradication of poverty and provision of universal health and education services."
"These underlying causes of conflict must remain the target of all EU cooperation assistance to the country."
"The Commission must work in Nepal through all stages of the conflict, from supplying humanitarian aid for those suffering, to ensuring that conflict resolution and prevention programmes are launched to prevent further violence."
"I welcome the call in the resolution for the appointment of an EU special representative for Nepal."
"Such a representative could work to ensure that assistance is provided to the Bhutanese refugee camps."
"The UNHCR decision to phase out assistance for these camps is worrying and comes at a time when Nepal needs continuing rather than diminishing support."
"Although Nepal has sheltered many Tibetan and Bhutanese refugees over the years, the deportation of 18 Tibetans to Tibet a few months ago is a worrying development."
"The well being of all refugees needs to be guaranteed."
"Peace will only be achieved in Nepal through the democratic process."
"The EU should help this process and help the Nepalese to build a better future."
"– Mr President, the ceasefire agreed on 29 January of this year in Nepal between the government and the Maoists lasted only seven months."
"As long ago as March, both sides were given a code of conduct, whereupon rebel leaders were released from prison."
"Three rounds of negotiations resulted in the Maoists abandoning their demand for the abolition of the monarchy."
"The government produced a framework for reform of the state; I have its road map and objectives in my hand as I speak."
"It provides for round table conferences involving all parties, as well as prompt elections to the national parliament, new structures featuring regional self-government, the introduction of the market economy and education and employment rights for ethnic groups and people with disabilities, all of which adds up to a substantial package."
"In August 2003, though, the Maoists ended the ceasefire, since which time three hundred people have been killed, twenty-five of them last weekend alone, and acts of intimidation, extortion, serious fighting and murders have become daily occurrences in Nepal."
"For the first time, foreigners have been abducted and shots fired at tourists."
"In this country, so heavily dependent on tourism, the situation is becoming more tragic."
"The Group of the European People’s Party calls on the Maoists to renew the ceasefire once and for all and to return to the negotiating table."
"Should the two sides need a mediator from outside, the EU is eminently capable of performing that role, we Europeans enjoying a high degree of acceptance throughout South-East Asia."
"We therefore call on the Council to appoint a special ambassador to Nepal, with which, Commissioner Lamy, the Commission must build up the EU’s relations."
"One first and important step would be for the staff complement in the new office in Katmandu to be increased."
"Although putting an end to the civil war is the first priority, at no time must respect for human rights be neglected."
"Democracy must be extended, reforms acceptable to people at the grass roots must be implemented, and minorities must be treated with respect, particularly the Bhutanese refugees in the camps that Parliament’s delegation to SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) visited, the funding of which by the UNHCR is evidently no longer certain."
"The minorities also include refugees from Tibet, who have been obliged to leave their homeland in fear of their lives, and who pass through Nepal on their way to India."
"According to the information I have received, the handing over to the Chinese of eighteen Tibetans was an exceptional occurrence – let us hope that it remains one."
"The Nepalese government must guarantee that deportations will be prevented, and all refugees from Bhutan and Tibet must be guaranteed protection under international human rights agreements."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the population of Nepal has known poverty and a ruthless caste system for centuries, and a government that has not been able to offer any solutions."
"This formed a fertile breeding ground for a Maoist insurgency, which claimed 7 000 lives."
"In January of this year, a ceasefire was agreed, which came to an end in August, but the negotiations then ended immediately."
"Since then, again according to the sources available to me, there have been more than 800 deaths, mainly Maoists and poor farmers and villagers."
"The deaths, on 13 October, of four students caught in the crossfire between Maoists and the army are the latest outrage."
"The government of Nepal receives supplies of arms from the United States on a massive scale, aid from India, military aid from the United Kingdom and other countries, and supplies of arms from Belgium, which even amended its Arms Act in order to be able to supply those arms."
"More than half of the revenues on which the country survives are now derived from foreign aid."
"The government lacks any democratic legitimacy; power rests with the King and the army."
"Thanks to those supplies of arms, the government has evidently chosen to halt the dialogue and to opt for what is known as the military solution: stamping out the rebels and so-called rebels – poor villagers – by force of arms."
"Human rights are trampled on with impunity in the process, as the British representative, Sir Jeffrey James, found on the scene."
"Every possible means must be employed in an attempt to get the parties back around the negotiating table."
"Supplies of arms must cease, and those who think that arms can effect a solution here will see nothing but the total destruction of the country."
"Even more children will be tricked into leaving their homes and recruited as child soldiers; even more farmers will be shot dead in their fields; there will be even more killing in general."
"In the meanwhile, this people has become so weary."
"We now have a delegation there."
"Will we now take genuine action there, and also harness our efforts to bring about a return to peace?"
"Or will we continue to give aid with one hand and supply weapons with the other, whilst closing our eyes to the fact that the government is, of course, using that money to pay for those weapons?"
"I wonder what kind of hypocritical game we are playing."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes and appreciates Parliament’s initiative to publish a resolution almost two months after the sudden breakdown of the peace talks in Nepal, which, as Mrs Maes has just said, had begun following the truce in January of this year."
"Unfortunately, as we know, no consensus has been reached on a lasting solution and we believe that the role of the political parties and civil society must be better integrated into the peace process; otherwise, there can be no serious chance of restoring confidence."
"This would appear to be a necessary precondition for any popular foundation for peace negotiations and we are willing to support the request for a round table bringing together a broad spectrum of representatives of the parties and civil society that would make it possible to move forward in the search for a solution to this crisis."
"However, at this stage we do not believe that any additional measures, such as direct mediation in the peace process, are appropriate while they are not based on a broad consensus between the various parties concerned."
"In your comments, you mentioned the situation of the refugees: we estimate that there are around 100 000 refugees and we regret that the progress made in verifying them has been slow."
"In order to assist their repatriation and settlement, we are going to continue to supply provisions for the camps and to support the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees."
"Several of you highlighted the need to provide our office in Kathmandu with additional resources and we are willing to do this within the limits, of course, of our budget resources, which to a large extent are determined by this House, as you will be aware."
"Finally, as regards the question of arms sales, it is clear to us that there is no hope of an armed or military solution to this conflict."
"We will continue to be particularly vigilant with regard to the issue of respect for the Code of Conduct for Arms Exports, which, as you know, implies specific obligations, which also extend to our Member States."
"– Mr President, I was glad to hear Mrs Stihler speak, and also that a number of Socialist Members have rejoined us, as we covered two important human rights issues without the second strongest group in this House saying anything about them."
"I was already worried that the group had ceased to exist or had abandoned human rights policy."
"I would just like to ask, in the event of their no longer needing their speaking time, whether the Rules of Procedure would allow it to be transferred to us in future."
"We would be very grateful for that."
"There is no danger of us not noticing your presence, Mr Posselt."
"The joint debate is closed.(1)"
"The next item is the vote.(1)"
"That concludes the vote."
"We do not agree with the report for the following reasons:"
"First, because the proposed measures aim to protect and strengthen the common fisheries policy of the ΕU, with which we disagree due to the restrictions which it places on production, directed mainly at small- and medium-sized fisheries, especially in countries such as Greece."
"In addition, we are being called on to support an absurd control system in which the controller and the controlled are one and the same."
"Secondly, because the short-term action plan and, more importantly, the creation of a Joint Inspection and Control Structure are measures for the further integration of the ΕU in the fisheries sector, meaning greater restrictions on national fisheries policies and national measures which take account of national peculiarities and requirements."
"At the same time, the proposed Joint Inspection Structure also raises numerous questions, in that issues of national sovereignty in the territorial waters of the Member States also arise."
". We abstained on this report, as on the other two fisheries reports."
"Of course we are in favour of the recovery of fish stocks, and particularly cod stocks, which are threatened, as highlighted by another report debated at this sitting."
"However, we do not trust either the European institutions or the states themselves to do this."
"Sometimes this translates into weak-willed measures, and one report confirms that these have been scuppered by various Member States of the European Union, resulting in the continual dramatic decline of the stocks of some fish species."
"Other times, it results in measures presented as being essential to save nature, while the main, if not the only, effect they have is to persecute the people, in this case those for whom fishing is their livelihood."
"We should remember that this takes place without any of the big guns having anything to fear."
"The contrary is shown to be true by the assessment of the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets, presented at this sitting."
"What sense would it make to have a preserved environment if the price was the misfortune of men, or at least the majority of them, those who live off their job?"
". If the Commission wishes to group together all national inspection and surveillance resources into one Community Fisheries Control Agency so as to submit them to a single monitoring procedure, in the interests of establishing a Joint Inspection Structure, it should also define clearly which powers pertain to the Community and which pertain to the Member States, as the rapporteur emphasises."
"Such definitions are all the more important given that, until now, the accepted principle has been that the Member States are responsible for monitoring fisheries activity."
"Bearing in mind the far-reaching legal implications of the Commission’s proposals – remember that surveillance and monitoring of aspects of the common fisheries policy are in some cases ensured by military means as well – and their very high costs, the rapporteur’s suggestion that a feasibility study be carried out in relation to this proposal, in coordination with the Member States, is equally sensible."
"As various Member States, experts and organisations maintain, this study should examine alternative models for Community cooperation in this field."
"The rapporteur’s concern that representatives of the sector should participate in the various phases of the decision-making process must also be given priority."
"Finally, I reiterate the absolute need for a legally independent common fisheries policy (CFP) to be established once and for all, since, for no apparent reason, the CFP has up to now only been mentioned in the Treaties in connection with ‘agricultural products’, and in the context of the common agricultural policy."
"Even if we accept that the objectives of reducing the fishing fleet have not in fact been achieved, which does not apply in Greece, for example, where we have had both a reduction in the fleet and a reduction in fisheries for the benefit of imports and aquaculture, we have no reason to regret the failure of the multi-annual guidance programmes."
"That is because these programmes started the restrictions on small- and medium-sized fisheries production, as in Greece, resulting in a reduction in fisheries, the deterioration in the fisheries balance of trade and unfortunate repercussions for the populations of the shore areas."
"We do not disagree with controls on the fishing capacity of the fleet; however, we do not agree that they should be carried out by the common fisheries policy as expressed under the multi-annual guidance programmes."
"On the contrary, we feel that the necessary arrangements should be made on the responsibility of each Member State, taking compliance measures in accordance with the actual scientific data of other agencies, such as the FAO, in relation to the state of fish stocks and so on."
"Under no circumstances do we agree to the cession of this responsibility to supranational bodies such as the ΕU, because its policy tends to further strengthen big business in the fisheries sector also, striking small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises with withdrawals and the scrapping of vessels, measures in favour of aquaculture and so on."
". Overfishing in European waters has led to scientists now proposing a total ban on cod fishing and strict limits for other species of fish such as plaice."
"Up to now, scientists’ warnings have fallen on deaf ears at the December annual meetings of the 15 Fisheries Ministers."
"As a result, we are threatened with the same situation as happened ten years ago off the coast of Canada (Newfoundland)."
"Those waters were fished down to the very last cod, and, even ten years later, there are still no cod to be found."
"The fishing communities in eastern Canada did not survive that."
"The EU has been trying for years to reduce the fleet capacity of European fishermen."
"That reduction has taken place in practice, however."
"Europe’s overfishing problems are being shifted on to the rest of the world in that increasing numbers of European fishermen are depleting fish stocks in the waters of other continents."
"It all began in Ireland a couple of years ago, when a supertrawler, the , had to be decommissioned."
"Instead, this supertrawler is now sailing under the Panamanian flag for exactly the same Irish firm in the waters of the Developing World."
"There are now as many as three supertrawlers that have not been decommissioned by the Netherlands; these vessels are now depleting fish stocks in the waters off the West African coast, under the Dutch flag."
"Thousands of small-scale African fishermen are missing out, and shortly yields off the West African coast will also decrease."
"The response of the Dutch Government will then probably be to send these supertrawlers even further away."
"Scientists’ warnings of worldwide overfishing are not being taken seriously: not by the Dutch Government and not by the European Commission."
"A year ago, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg (September 2002), the Dutch and European authorities hypocritically signed declarations that there must be an end to worldwide overfishing by 2010, but in reality the Dutch and European authorities are shifting the problems caused by overfishing in European waters on to the countries of the Developing World."
"Fishing the world’s oceans dry with our heads in the sand: I can think of no other way of summing it up."
"– Mr President, I do not want to prolong the proceedings, but you will have become aware that the cry of ‘Check 16’ has become a running gag in the House."
"Because of an event that you will probably be able to follow up – although you are again the wrong person for me to be telling about this – I asked, during the last part-session, for the House secretariat to pay attention to the circumstances under which a vote is re-examined when one or more Members ask for this to be done."
"Neither then nor now have I received any notification from the secretariat."
"We often talk about the dignity of Parliament, but that also involves us being given an answer to this question by the secretariat."
"Clearly, Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure already covers this matter."
"However, I will ask the Conference of Presidents to give you a response.(2)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 October 2003."
"I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the official gallery a number of distinguished visitors here with us today."
"Mr Mejdahl, speaker of the Danish Folketing, is very welcome here this afternoon."
"We are also joined by colleagues from the Committee on European Affairs of the Swedish Riksdag, and I should like to welcome them to our Chamber."
"As you know, this afternoon we shall have our exchange of views with Commissioner Verheugen on the Commission monitoring reports on the Accession States."
"I know that a number of distinguished guests, including ambassadors, have joined us for that today."
"They are very welcome."
"I note in particular that the Romanian chief negotiator and acting minister for European integration is in the gallery, as is Mr Theodor Stolojan, the leader of the Romanian opposition: they too are very welcome.(1)"
"A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 5 and 6 November has been distributed."
"The following changes have been proposed:"
"I have received two competing requests, pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, to refer back to committee the report by Mr Wuermeling on consumer credit (A5-0310/2003): from the PSE Group, asking for referral back before the debate, and from the ELDR Group, asking for referral back at the beginning of the vote."
"Unless there is a consensus in terms of a joint request from the groups I am not in a position to make a proposal to the House other than that we would vote on these requests at the appropriate time."
"Mr President, I think it is a good principle to try to avoid unnecessary work and unnecessary confusion."
"I believe that those present in the House are representative."
"I therefore propose that we immediately vote on referral back to committee."
"Mr President, that was an astute proposal by Mrs Thors."
"If she now joins us straight away in voting for immediate referral back to committee, that will sort the whole thing out brilliantly."
"I gather, from the round of applause, that this is what the House would like, in which case the House needs to change the Rules, because they do not permit me to do this."
"The vote must take place at the time I indicated earlier."
"So please be here at the beginning of the debate to ensure your view is taken into account.(1)"
"Mr President, I should like to refer to some very unpleasant, untruthful and personal remarks made by Mr Balfe following the budget vote in Strasbourg last month."
"Mr Balfe had demanded an extension of the medical insurance to former Members, which was refused by the Committee on Budgets."
"As one of the budget rapporteurs for 2004 I see myself as a servant of this Parliament whose main responsibility is to defend the decisions taken by this House and, in this case, also those of the Budgets Committee."
"My primary objective has been to ensure that there is value for money for the European taxpayer and a desire to maintain the reputation and the dignity of this House in the eyes of the European public."
"First, the accusation by Mr Balfe against me that I have entirely frustrated the decision taken by the Bureau is an accusation against the entire Budgets Committee, because all of his demands were put to the vote."
"Second, Mr Balfe made a reference to, and I quote 'the comparatively inexpensive scheme'."
"This is an astonishing statement given than the initial estimates are far over EUR 1 000 000 and it is costing us EUR 60 000 just for a study to establish the actual figures: hardly peanuts."
"Third, with respect to the use by existing Members of current schemes, I have to say that I am completely baffled."
"Is Mr Balfe suggesting transparency for all Members in the Budgets Committee, or does he want to establish a register for everybody?"
"Is he proposing to amend the current scheme?"
"Surely he is not concerned about the cost!"
"I suggest he puts forward proposals for next year's budget so that we can make whatever amendments are needed."
"Finally, in the name of all of my colleagues on the Budgets Committee who I believe take their responsibilities extremely seriously, I would like to say that these allegations are not worthy of someone holding a senior position in this House such as a Quaestor and I believe he brings this House and that office into disrepute."
"Mr President, I should like to make it clear that the Bureau asked the Committee on Budgets to take a certain action, which Mrs Gill, as Budget rapporteur, could have done."
"She declined to do so."
"The Bureau requested that Members who were over 60 when they retired, had served at least two terms in the European Parliament and were prepared to pay on the same basis as all the staff one third of the costs of the scheme, would as is the case for every member of staff of this institution be admitted to a sickness scheme if they did not have adequate national insurance."
"The Bureau, which was unanimous in its view, put forward a very humane request."
"I do not think that Mrs Gill, as budget rapporteur, reacted in a friendly, humane or reasonable way to that request."
"A study will now be produced, and I hope that when it is finished the Budgets Committee, which spends millions of pounds on very dubious projects ..."
"... will realise that it also owes a duty to senior and often ill Members of this House who have given a lot of service, and that those Members are prepared to pay to be in an insurance scheme which is more than any of us, as present Members, are prepared to do."
"I hope that this matter will be looked at again by the Budgets Committee but I restate that all Mrs Gill had to do was take the recommendation of the Bureau not of this Quaestor and place it before this House for a vote."
"If she thinks the Budgets Committee is superior to the House I suggest she go back to constitutional school."
"Happily, the Members present today are healthy, rather than ill."
"Let us thus proceed with a healthy respect for our agenda."
"Mr President, I too, want to be brief."
"Tomorrow’s agenda includes a vote on a resolution on the liberal professions."
"The fact that Parliament was not sitting last week meant that it has not been possible to put together a compromise in good time, so I ask that the vote be postponed to the next Strasbourg part-session."
"Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Rothley have also agreed to this."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Lehne’s proposal since we have not in fact reached an agreement on the text of the joint motion for a resolution amongst the different political groups."
"If there is a consensus on that then let us proceed on that basis."
"Mr President, I want to return to the question of the agenda and of Mr Wuermeling’s report."
"We have given some thought to how we might resolve this problem at once without changing the agenda and have come to a conclusion that I think even Mrs Thors would agree to."
"I hereby move that the Wuermeling report be moved up to the first item on the agenda;"
"I would ask you to announce it now, and notify you here and now that I will then move that it be referred back to the committee straight away."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that I definitely support the proposal that we should vote right now on the motion for referral."
"Members cannot be expected to come to this Chamber half an hour before midnight tonight just to decide whether or not a debate is to take place."
"Any majority would be quite fortuitous."
"Such a thing is not commensurate with the importance of this proposal."
"At the same time, though, I would ask you to give me the floor, so that I may oppose this referral without debate."
"This reflects precisely the dilemma in which the groups have placed me."
"If I follow the logic of Mr Schulz and he is defeated, and the Wuermeling report thus becomes the first item on the agenda, that would completely upset the rhythm of the work planned for today."
"I shall not follow that suggestion."
"However, if, as we proceed with our agenda, colleagues can come to a consensus and can come to me at the end of the first item with an agreed proposal, I shall then put that to the House, and we can act on it accordingly."
"If no consensus can be reached we shall proceed as indicated earlier."
"Mr President, yesterday you were in Berlin as was I. You were on an official visit to the German Parliament."
"You were accompanied by representatives of the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups."
"Have you forgotten, Mr President, that there are other Groups in this Parliament who could also have accompanied you?"
"Why did you take only the two largest groups?"
"I do not understand this and I would like you to give me an answer."
"Yesterday and on Monday I made an official visit to Berlin and to the Bundestag on behalf of this Parliament."
"Yesterday afternoon I addressed every political group in the German Parliament, including the Greens and the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the CDU-CSU."
"I invited no group from here to accompany me, but the protocol office of the Bundestag kindly informed colleagues here of my visit."
"Those German colleagues who wished to attend any part of the visit were free to do so."
"Of course, Mr Cohn-Bendit, like you, they were not obliged to do so."
"It was a matter of choice for you and for others, not for me."
"I made a visit as President, but it was open to those who wished to associate themselves with it."
"Those colleagues who attended parts of the visit or the various political group meetings were very welcome."
"They were not under obligation to be there, and they were not accompanying the President on the visit."
"Mr President, I would like to call upon the Commission to explain the Eurobarometer survey that has just been published and that places Israel at the top of the list of states that are threats to world peace, above Iran, North Korea and the United States, all three in equal place."
"First of all, how is it possible to put together a questionnaire presenting a list of threats to peace which includes Israel and the United States and ignores international terrorism, Palestinian or otherwise?"
"Above all, however, how is it possible to mix rogue and democratic states on a list of states that allegedly threaten the peace?"
"What frightens me is that the mental confusion of the pollster is equalled only by that of those polled who did not differentiate and who seem to condemn the use of force in all situations, whether it be a case of aggression by a rogue state, international terrorism, or legitimate defence by a democratic state."
"This moral disarmament is the worst possible news for the future of the Europe that emerges from this opinion poll."
"Mr President, I, too, uphold the concerns, expressed by many Members in this House and elsewhere regarding the survey itself and how it was organised."
"I hope that the political groups and the Commission are able to give us further explanations because, if Europe is to have any influence, if Europe is to be a leader in international affairs, then, without a doubt, it needs to act with greater caution."
"When questions are asked, it is good to know how they are asked and why they are asked and, above all, once there are results, it would be right and proper to not let the press – and certain papers – know about them first but to inform Parliament and the public as a whole about them."
"In addition to that, Mr President, I would briefly like to condemn what happened yesterday in my country, where there was a serious attack on a barracks The trail is one of insurrection and anarchy and is also linked to the event in Spain, where some Italian terrorists or pseudo terrorists were arrested."
"I believe that all we Europeans should take action because we must not underestimate this threat of terrorism, although the results of police action, such as the measures of the Italian police that arrested some dangerous murderers – or, at least, those accused of murdering Marco Biagi and Massimo D’Antona – can be seen as positive signals."
"The action which I am calling upon Parliament to take part in should be a united endeavour to combat this disturbing phenomenon across Europe."
"Mr President, I will take the liberty of returning for a moment to the issue of the Eurobarometer survey."
"I think that it is right that Parliament should listen to what the Commission has to say and it should not hear of it from the press-room or from journalists; it is right that, as is our prerogative, the Commission – in the person of Mr Prodi or another Commissioner – should come and explain to us the reasons behind this survey, which was – quite rightly – reported in all the papers and which certainly portrayed a negative, if not pessimistic, image of our European Union."
"Mr President, I do not wish to go into the content of this particular opinion poll, although it certainly would have been wise for the poll to have asked what people thought of the Palestinian State and of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation."
"It is not a bad thing, however, that people know what Europe thinks."
"I would, in general, encourage the Commission to publish information of this or any other nature on the views of Europeans, to show the importance of opinion on our continent."
"Mr President, I wish to speak to the same topic."
"My group has of course discussed the effects that these publications and figures have had."
"Speaking on its behalf, though, I want generally to welcome your desire to put the issue of the handling of such an opinion poll, and the manner in which the questions were arrived at, on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents."
"I think that is where it belongs in the first place, as it is very difficult to have a wide-ranging discussion in plenary on an opinion poll, the overall basis and background of which I have at present only fragmentary knowledge, derived from references in the press."
"Before I venture to pass judgment, I would say that it is right and proper that we should consider it in its entirety."
"I would also warn against our approving of opinion polls only when we find their results agreeable."
"As a long-suffering German social democrat, I, in particular, can say that this is always a problematic venture for any politician."
"Opinion polls, whatever questions are put, can sometimes tend to make you feel queasy."
"We cannot discuss, here in this plenary, whether or not the questions have this sort of suggestive effect or whether or not the answers that have been given are to our liking."
"After all, who knows what would have come out if other questions had been put?"
"I would therefore counsel against us taking premature decisions or carrying out premature assessments; instead, let us just put this on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents and have discussions with the Commission on Eurobarometer’s operations as a whole."
"Mr President, to echo the speeches of some of my colleagues, Mr Berthu and Mr Dell Alba in particular, I would say that it could perhaps be useful to put an end to surveys and not to ask people for their opinion because, if they are asked for it, there is a risk that they will give it and, clearly, if this runs counter to the overriding attitude and if it is politically incorrect, then it is very unpleasant for the European political establishment."
"In a democracy, moreover, there is also a formality to be gone through in this area, that is to say elections, and I would point out to you that these are extremely dangerous."
"In any case, they could, for example, lead, as from June, to greater interest in the political sympathies I represent."
"I wonder if elections too should not also be abolished and then perhaps the people of Europe also changed as soon as they begin to have negative thoughts or as soon as they apparently hinder the progress of European democracy."
"Mr President, I have recently returned from Sri Lanka, where I was continuing my engagement with the peace process at the invitation of those involved."
"As colleagues may know, the peace talks have been suspended since April."
"I found it particularly encouraging, during my visit, that the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers, as they are more popularly known published their proposals for an interim self-governing administration."
"This is, indeed, a very significant move on their part."
"It is the first time that they have submitted comprehensive proposals."
"What made it all the more noteworthy is that the LTTE's chief spokesman, Mr Tamilchelvan, stated that this interim administration was not a precursor to a separate state."
"This opened the way for negotiations with the government to start once again, even though there is a wide gulf between the two sides."
"Unfortunately, over the last 48 hours, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who belongs to the opposition party, has sacked four key ministers, suspended the Parliament and declared a state of emergency."
"I believe that this threatens the peace process."
"Bearing in mind that we in this House support the peace process, and that together with our international partners we have committed four and half billion dollars to underpin it, and also remembering the importance of bi-partisanship in the Irish peace process, I would ask you, Mr President, to urge the two main parties in Sri Lanka, together with the Tamil Tigers, to support the re-opening of negotiations to ensure that permanent peace is brought to that troubled country."
"Mr President, I should like to refer to the recent crisis in Sri Lanka."
"Mr Cushnahan cogently pointed out that, at a time where it is now possible, after 23 years of civil war, to bring peace to the country, the President declared a state of emergency once the proposals for peace had been put forward by the rebel Tamil Tiger groups."
"You, Mr President, Mr Poettering and other Members of this House have met the Prime Minister, who as we speak is with Mr Bush in Washington."
"Parliament ought to be recalled back in Colombo."
"There is no justification for the prorogation of Parliament, nor for the declaration of a state of emergency, nor for sending troops out onto the streets."
"The European Parliament might well ask that democracy, the rule of law, parliament and government be reinstituted in Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, I was surprised and horrified yesterday to read the charges by Amnesty International against Sudan, where a special court has sentenced a sixteen-year-old boy accused of armed robbery to so-called ‘cross amputation’; in other words his right hand and his left foot are to be cut off."
"Amnesty International is denouncing the Sudanese judicial system and penal legislation, which contains this sort of punishment, such as amputation and death by stoning, and has called on the international community in a bid to prevent the punishment of the sixteen-year-old youth from being executed."
"I think, Mr President, that both our Parliament and you personally need to take an initiative and remind Sudan that it has signed the Cotonou Agreement on respect for human rights."
"Our direct intervention is needed."
"Mr President, I rise on the same point which has just been made."
"I sincerely hope that you would write to the Sudanese Government and suggest that these barbaric punishments be stopped immediately: not just for this crime, but for all crimes."
"They cannot continue to use Sharia law and these dreadful, horrendous punishments."
"Mr President, there is a serious humanitarian issue on which you need to and, I believe, will intervene."
"On 27 July 2003 a tanker, the , with a local pilot at the helm, ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi. There was a serious ecological disaster."
"A great deal of oil leaked into the port. Since then, the authorities in Pakistan have prevented the seven members of the crew from leaving Pakistan."
"In the case of the , the Spanish authorities sought out those responsible on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle, in other words the master of the ship, but not the rest of the crew."
"The cook is not to blame, nor is the cleaner. Nonetheless, in the case of the , seven seamen are being held, most of whom are Greek."
"What is more, on 17 August, once the whole disaster had occurred, a team from a salvage company arrived in Pakistan, the head of which, Mr Nikos Papas, is also being held by the authorities in Pakistan, even though he is not a member of the crew."
"They merely went to salvage the ship and limit the disaster."
"I should like you to intervene."
"We have a hostage here."
"The minister from Pakistan is in Brussels today, he is to dine with Mr Solana and Mr Patten."
"We need to intervene in this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the Rosia Montana Gold Corporation project."
"This project, which relates to the development of a gold mine in the centre of Romania, raises three types of problem."
"There is a social and humanitarian problem because this project, which is under way, means that a population of 2 000 people has to be resettled and 900 houses demolished; and there is an environmental problem because this project will, in particular, involve the installation of a 400-hectare settling tank containing cyanide residue, necessary for the intensive treatment of ore."
"An Australian company has already been using this technique in Baia Mare for almost two years, causing an ecological disaster in the Danube."
"This is a problem that also affects the historical heritage: after about 15 years of exploitation, the valley, which also contains archaeological remains dating from the Roman occupation, will have disappeared and, with it, many churches, cemeteries and historic monuments."
"Implementation of the project is subject to the environmental agreement to be given by the Romanian Government. In the knowledge that Romania is bound by its commitments as a candidate for accession to the European Union, is it acceptable that recourse to methods of extraction that endanger people and the environment, methods that are now only used in the developing world, should be tolerated in a country that is about to be integrated into the European Union?"
"I would appreciate it if those of my fellow Members who are going to the area at the beginning of December would assess the precise extent of the irreparable damage that would be caused by implementing such a project."
"Parliament will indeed attend to the matter through a delegation."
"That visit has been approved by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 12 August, the date of his abduction, there has been no news from Dr Arjan Erkel and we do not know what has happened to him."
"He was kidnapped in Mukala in Dagestan and nothing has been done to free him."
"I feel that the European Parliament and the European Union should take action with a view not only to getting information and calling for his release but also to protecting the institutions that provide voluntary services in territories where the health situation is absolutely disgraceful."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that, on 2 July 2003, the Italian Presidency made a commitment before Parliament to present the moratorium on the death penalty to the United Nations General Assembly."
"This undertaking was supported on 23 October by a resolution adopted unanimously by Parliament."
"Today, we learn from the press that the Italian Government has decided not to present the resolution to the UN."
"I urge you, Mr President, to convey our disappointment to the Presidency and to keep point 3 of our resolution, which provided for the results and assessment to be discussed in any case."
"Although these are, I feel, very important, a debate is still called for."
"Indeed, the Italian Presidency is here, listened to your comments and hopes that it can take note of the resolution."
"That concludes the item."
". Mr President, as regards my report, the arrangement is meant to be that we all agree the report being referred back to the committee without further debate and without a vote."
"I am, though, able to take this opportunity to give a brief explanation of what the report contains and what it aims to do."
"This is one of the few proposals that will directly affect every citizen in the European Union in his or her daily life, and will do so in a very sensitive area, that being money."
"The directive will affect you if you pay by credit card, if you hire a car, if you buy a television set on credit or if your bank account is overdrawn."
"At this moment, in the European Union, the consumer credit agreements currently in force account for something like a billion euros."
"That is why it is of the utmost importance that Parliament should handle this issue with all possible care and with a great sense of responsibility."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we get the impression that the Commission’s proposal does not do justice to the importance of this issue."
"There has been no scrutiny of to what extent the proposal will, in effect, prevent the socially disadvantaged from getting any access whatever to loans, as substantially tighter conditions apply to checks on creditworthiness, which could result in those who particularly need credit no longer being given any."
"It has not been considered, either, to what extent this proposal might result in an increase in consumer credit interest rates."
"The Chemicals Directive, for example, is contentious enough, but at least we know what it is going to cost, which we do not with this one."
"Nor has there been any examination of what effects the intended restriction of consumer credit will have on consumption in the European Union, considering that consumer credit funds 13% of it."
"That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has decided on an admittedly extraordinary course of action and recommended to the Commission that it withdraw the proposal, revise it in the light of all these points – there are another thirty of them in my report – and rethink the whole thing before it again comes up for debate."
"I can understand why some Members are saying, after the Commission has stated its unwillingness to withdraw the proposal – Mr Prodi has done so in a letter, Mr Byrne has said it time out of number – that there is little point in having another plenary vote on the whole thing."
"The question in fact arises as to whether there is any sense, under these circumstances, in again entrusting the Commission with the drafting of a proposal."
"Speaking personally, I have little confidence in its responsible departments coming up with something that we would find more manageable."
"I hope you do not mind me speaking in such personal terms."
"In view of the Commission’s refusal, in any case, to revise the proposal, I agree that we should get down to the task of rewriting the whole of the directive."
"I do not actually regard this as one of this House’s functions – we are meant to take policy decisions rather than to formulate individual articles – but if the Commission is proving to be so obtuse on this point, it is for us a constitutional duty, a duty that we will discharge, and, having done so, we will see to it that European consumer credit law is modern, flexible and promotes competitiveness."
"Thank you very much."
"The proposal is thus to refer this report back to committee without debate."
"I should like to thank you, Mr Wuermeling, and all colleagues, for helping to resolve that matter."
"The next item is the Commission communication on a comprehensive monitoring report and strategy paper of the Commission on the progress towards accession by the candidate countries."
"As I remarked earlier, there are many distinguished guests in the gallery today to follow this item."
"They are very welcome."
"I am pleased that we are joined today by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and by Commissioner Verheugen."
"I know from my extensive contacts in preparing this debate that Commissioner Verheugen is determined to have these reports adopted by the college of Commissioners after he has presented them to this House."
"I regret that as a result of a failure by those other than Commissioner Verheugen to observe the correct procedures, you will, over recent days, have already read in the newspapers much of what you are to hear today."
"Indeed, it was reported extensively in some French newspapers yesterday."
"This is not a criticism of Commissioner Verheugen, because I know he was determined to follow the procedures as agreed between this House and the Commission."
"I regret that this afternoon we will not be hearing for the first time what should be a major communication between our institutions from one year to the next."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the acceding countries, the top priority of my Commission, the absolute top priority is about to become a reality."
"Less than six months from now we will see the biggest enlargement in the Union’s history."
"The presence in this House of the representatives of the countries that are going to join the Union next year is a tangible sign of how important that event is."
"First, let me say how much I admire the governments and peoples you represent."
"Over the past few years, you have moved heaven and earth to bring your legal and administrative systems into line with the These reforms demonstrate your strong desire for freedom and democracy."
"Indeed, you have carried out a quiet revolution that is taking you into the European Union with your heads held high, proud of your achievements."
"Before the membership negotiations closed last year, I announced that the Commission would be presenting a report on the preparedness of the acceding Member States about six months before they actually joined."
"Today, I am here, together with Commissioner Verheugen whom I would like to thank for his remarkable work to present that report to you."
"The Comprehensive Monitoring Report adopted by the College this morning is the fruit of lengthy, painstaking efforts by the Commission, which has been monitoring and supporting the acceding countries' preparations for years."
"It is based on the 10 reports prepared by the Commission, one on each country, which are also available to you."
"These reports draw on all the Commission's expertise in the various areas of the ."
"They will also be the last such reports the Commission will prepare on the acceding countries, although we will continue to follow up the issues still outstanding over the coming months."
"This means we are no longer in the pre-accession phase."
"As from today, the Commission is starting to exercise its customary institutional role as guardian of the Treaties with regard to the new Member States too."
"I will shortly ask Commissioner Verheugen to outline in detail the Commission’s findings in the Comprehensive Monitoring Report, but let me first make some general remarks."
"The official accession date for the ten new Member States is 1 May 2004, but the prospect of enlargement has already had positive effects."
"The European Union is increasingly becoming a reference in many countries for the development of civil society and political life."
"No other and I repeat, no other player on the world stage can boast the same drawing power."
"The reason is clear."
"The Union has succeeded in putting the highest ideals into practice: peace, on which we have founded our Union; democracy, which we defend through all our policies; greater opportunities for economic prosperity and solidarity towards the least-favoured regions and groups."
"Why our model is so successful today is also clear."
"On its own, each country would be at the mercy of greater and more powerful political and economic entities, but, united, we can direct the process with due regard for democracy and the human dimension."
"I am convinced that the accession of the new Member States next year will bring no great problems in terms of implementing the where either the single market or the other Community policies are concerned."
"Of course, there are still issues to resolve clearly outlined, moreover, in the report including some very important ones, but I am confident that all these countries will overcome these last remaining obstacles."
"The 10 governments are perfectly aware that any shortcoming in any area would deprive them of the benefits of accession in that sector, in terms of both financial transfers and market access."
"If problems still remain after accession, the Commission will do its duty, as it always has, and will take the necessary steps."
"In any case – I must stress – I do not envisage any major obstacles to the conclusion of this process."
"Indeed, all the issues we have identified are manageable and we have the instruments for the purpose."
"Moreover, it is in everyone's interest for the Union to absorb this enlargement as quickly and smoothly as possible because there are many other issues facing the Union and many other goals we must achieve, including the Intergovernmental Conference and the smooth functioning of our institutions in an enlarged Union, the Lisbon strategy, the new Financial Perspective, the completion of the enlargement process and the ring of friends policy the Wider Europe policy."
"These will be the real challenges for the enlarged Union of 25 Member States."
"One of our tasks will thus be the continuation of the enlargement process."
"As I have often said, this is a continuous, inclusive, irreversible process."
"Our common target is to carry through the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007."
"Considerable progress has been recorded in these two countries as well this year, and Commissioner Verheugen is going to say a few words on this too."
"The accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania have moved forward significantly and it is time to think about a framework for finalising them."
"These negotiations must be based on the same criteria as those observed by all the other countries, and, of course, in particular, what is known as the principle of own merit."
"At the beginning of next year, the Commission will point the way to finalising the negotiations by presenting a proposal for a financial offer for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Everyone agrees that these negotiations must not depend on the outcome of the debate on the new Financial Perspective or the debate on future reforms – we have always kept these issues separate – and, to prevent this happening, we need to take as a benchmark the financial framework worked out for the ten acceding countries."
"On this I am counting on Parliament's support, and I intend to involve Parliament fully in this next phase in the process."
"Next year will be decisive for Turkey."
"Indeed, this will be one of the last big decisions that it will fall to my Commission to take in this term of office."
"It will involve assessing Turkey's progress in meeting the Copenhagen political criteria and issuing a recommendation as regards the opening of accession negotiations."
"Let me make one point very clear in this respect: it is this Commission that will present the Regular Report on Turkey and the recommendation in autumn 2004."
"That was the undertaking I gave at Copenhagen last year and we will keep our promise."
"We have followed developments in Turkey very carefully over the past year."
"There has been considerable progress that shows the determination of the Turkish Government to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to meet the political criteria for membership."
"We will be watching further developments closely in the areas where progress is still needed, as regards both legislation and the actual implementation of the new rights and freedoms to which the Turkish people are entitled thanks to the reforms undertaken."
"Lastly, let me reiterate the Union’s desire to see Cyprus accede as a unified country."
"We continue to hope this will happen."
"Clearly, it is in Turkey’s interest, too, to reach a settlement quickly, because this would prevent the Cyprus issue from becoming an obstacle to its own aspirations."
"The issue can still be settled before 1 May next year on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal."
"All parties concerned must contribute to this process and the Commission stands ready to assist in every possible way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before closing, I would like to mention the Balkan region."
"Croatia has already presented its membership application and the Commission is now looking at Zagreb's replies a huge number of replies to the questionnaire sent to it at the beginning of the summer."
"Other countries in the region intend to follow Croatia's example shortly."
"Our response to these countries needs to be discerning and far-sighted and we must make it clear that the prospects of membership are genuine and that we commit ourselves to accompanying them along this common road, even though the stringent criteria we have always adopted still stand."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history has vindicated the vision of Europe's founding fathers: the original Six that had just emerged from the war are now 25 free, strong countries and they will, no doubt, number more than 30 in the future."
"In a few months, our family will have 10 new members."
"With their enthusiasm, we will be able to enhance our Union and give it new horizons."
"We must extend it too and, together, all working together, we can uphold and assert more firmly the values on which it is founded."
"Mr President, with your permission, I will now give the floor to Commissioner Verheugen, whom I would like to thank once again for his extraordinarily astute work and his remarkable commitment to this project."
". Mr President, honourable Members, when we concluded negotiations with the ten candidate countries a year ago, we did so on the basis of a prognosis that these ten countries would be fully prepared by the date set for accession, that is to say that they would have discharged all the obligations into which they had entered in the course of negotiations."
"That is the reason behind monitoring; it is there to determine whether or not this prognosis was accurate."
"The concluding monitoring report that the Commission adopted today is the last one."
"There have already been two previous reports, which have had very positive effects, and I can tell you that we of course have to expect the media, following the debate in this House, to focus on those points where we say there is something not yet right."
"It therefore seems to me to be necessary to start by putting this into perspective."
"In the first place, we did not have to re-examine most of the , as it had already become apparent during the negotiation process that all the requirements had been met."
"We did not even give it a second look."
"We only revisited the areas in which issues had remained open during the course of negotiations and in which commitments had been entered into."
"We divided up this part of the into 140 sectors of widely varying importance, some of them comprising several hundred legal acts, others only one – and that is just an illustration of the volume involved."
"The fact that we had, all in all, 1 400 such sectors to monitor made that an immense task; it is a communal effort by the Commission as a whole, one that, in recent months, had required many hundreds of staff, but I will also claim that this work is very substantial and that the sort of overview we have was never possible at the time of any previous enlargements."
"I have to tell you that such a thing has never been done in the history of the EU, and it is important that we should know that if we are to properly evaluate what the outcome has been."
"It turned out that, in the 1 400 sectors that we monitored, preparations are running perfectly according to the timetable in 70% of all cases and that no comments are called for. In a further 27% of cases, we have noted that some individual points remain to be dealt with, but there are, generally speaking, no grounds for concern."
"This process is in motion, and, according to our prognosis, everything will be in place on 1 May 2004."
"That leaves 3% – precisely 39 instances out of 1 400 – in which we have observed serious omissions and delays that can be compensated for only with difficulty."
"In these instances, we are telling the future Member States that decisive action has to be taken as a matter of absolute urgency in order to fulfil the conditions in time for 1 May 2004, so that everything in this area, too, can be in good order."
"The thirty-nine problem areas are spread out over ten countries."
"I would advise against attempting to rank them in order; the fact that Poland has ten such areas does not mean that Poland is worse than others."
"The simple explanation is that a large part of the problems are present only in Poland, as the size of the other countries means that certain of the problems are not found in them."
"I regard the overall outcome as very balanced."
"It relates to only a few chapters of the and we estimate that the problems will be able to be resolved everywhere even before 1 May 2004."
"If they are not – and it is this point that is crucial – then the Commission will, in good time before 1 May, take the necessary actions, and we have a whole range of options to choose from."
"We can apply the safety measures that are in any case already contained in the Treaty."
"We can apply the specific safety measures provided for in the Treaty of Accession; we can institute normal infringement proceedings; we can make use of administrative interventions."
"We have, then, a wide range of options, and agreement has today been reached within the Commission that each Commissioner, within his or her own area of responsibility, shall oversee the ongoing handling of these still unresolved issues and shall, if necessary, propose the necessary measures in good time before 1 May."
"Speaking for myself, I do not expect this to be necessary, as, in most instances, the adverse consequences resulting from these problems being left unresolved would not affect the Community as such, but only the new Member States themselves."
"For example, the question was raised of whether the structures were in place to enable agricultural support grants to be paid in full."
"If administrative structures are inadequate for this purpose, the result will be that the money will not flow, which means that the government that makes itself guilty of such negligence will end up under considerable domestic pressure, because their farmers are not getting their direct support payments."
"I therefore predict that all these cases will be resolved as a matter of course before 1 May 2004."
"Knowing that this House pays particular attention to the area of food safety, I can tell you that there are still a number of problems in this area too, and our position remains unchanged, namely that no food not conforming to our standards – by which I mean our hygiene rules – must be allowed onto the internal market."
"For that reason, the necessary measures relating to food safety will be taken by February at the latest in order to ensure that no products not complying with the standards get onto the internal market."
"There are, however, relatively few of them, and people must not get the idea that a country has performed badly in a particular area just because a few firms in a few countries fail to reach the standards."
"To sum up, then, we come to the conclusion that institutions and policies will continue to function after 1 May 2004, that no appreciable disruptions are to be expected and that, while the possibility of problems cannot of course be excluded, they will be manageable in every respect."
"All this, then, adds up to a good outcome."
"I unreservedly endorse, and associate myself with, the Commission’s expressions of appreciation for that and President Prodi’s recent underlining of the especial achievements of these countries’ governments, parliaments and peoples."
"With which, let me turn to Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey."
"I can keep this relatively brief."
"Both Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress."
"I would in particular like to stress that Bulgaria has now at last managed to promote reform of the judicial system, which had been a major problem in assessing it."
"I would like to highlight the more positive valuation given to Romania in terms of the market economy criterion."
"The Commission is now stating that Romania can be regarded as a market economy, provided that the reform process continues without change, which we assume it will."
"This amounts to an appreciation of the significant economic reforms that Romania has already achieved and of the remarkable macroeconomic stability that it manifests."
"Turning to how we take matters further in relation to Romania and Bulgaria, the Commission counsels against decoupling these processes from each other."
"We are sticking to the target of bringing both countries, together, into the European Union in 2007, although the principle still holds that no country should have to wait for another."
"If, then, it turns out in the course of the ongoing process that they are progressing at different speeds, we will also be able to conclude the negotiations on different dates."
"Although we can regard it as a sort of compliment that both countries are very keen to complete negotiations before the present Commission leaves office, we are very cautious when it comes to making a statement about this."
"I would also appreciate it if Parliament could follow us in not, at the present moment, specifying any dates, but could limit itself to confirming 2007 as the accession date."
"For that to be the case, work on the accession treaty needs to be completed before the end of 2005."
"That means that the time window for completing the negotiations is between now and somewhere around the summer of 2005, when, if the country in question really has done everything, it will be possible to conclude them."
"As a whole, I regard this picture as a favourable one."
"I want, though, to again strongly encourage these countries to make determined efforts towards improving political and economic governance;"
"I am referring particularly to corruption and to the fight against economic crime."
"This is also important in terms of the investment climate in both countries and of making them attractive to investors."
"We have tried hard not to prejudge anything where Turkey is concerned, and it can be speculated whether or not the report that the Commission has presented today makes a statement about the decision that is to be taken next year."
"We have tried hard not to do that, but, instead, to give Turkey fair and objective treatment, and that means that we have to attest and acknowledge the remarkable fact that reforms have been better implemented, and at increasing speed, in both the political and economic spheres."
"It also means, though, that we have to tell the truth and say that a very great deal still does not meet our standards or conform to our requirements, and that these things have to be addressed."
"It makes no sense to keep any of this quiet."
"I noticed that Turkey reacted with a degree of surprise, for one of the consequences of the leak – which is regrettable and, from my point of view, absolutely so – is that I know the candidate countries’ reactions even before the reports are adopted, and the Turkish reaction tends towards astonishment."
"No doubt they had reckoned on a rather more favourable assessment."
"So I want to reiterate very clearly that, although we entirely acknowledge what has been achieved in Turkey, we have to point out to the Turks that there are still problems with a number of issues to do with fundamental rights, that Turkey’s willingness to be bound by the rulings of the Court of Human Rights is still problematic, and that there are, in particular, major problems when it comes to implementing the reforms that have already been decided on."
"There is a considerable implementation deficit here, and the government recognises this and wants to do something about it."
"President Prodi has just made reference to the problem of Cyprus."
"I must, again, do likewise, because I want to inform you that the Commission has today taken a new step, one that is new and may well lead to controversy."
"In our strategy paper, we have linked Turkey’s desire for accession to the Cyprus issue."
"In order that there may be no misunderstanding, and also with Turkish reactions in mind, let me explain – as I must – that this is not a condition."
"We have to adhere strictly to the Helsinki conclusions, which state that this is not a condition."
"It is a statement of fact."
"We are simply stating the fact that failure to resolve the Cyprus issue would represent a major obstacle to Turkey’s European ambitions."
"To say that is no more than to state a fact, but I do not, of course, deny that such a statement of such a fact acquires political significance when contained in a strategy document of this sort, and I can also tell you that this political message, this political significance is deliberate."
"The Commission wanted to make it clear that it can see such a political connection and wanted, in so doing, to encourage Turkey to be even more pro-active in order to resolve the Cyprus question on the basis of the UN’s plan."
"I am firmly convinced that the elections in the Turkish part of Cyprus will open a window of opportunity, and that, in their immediate aftermath, greater pressure must be exerted on all parties in order to introduce some impetus into a situation that has been bogged down for some time."
"I do indeed think that a message of this sort from Europe helps the present Turkish Government, in that it gives it a strong argument against those elements in Turkey that have been standing in the way of further progress, particularly on the Cyprus issue."
"That is something I wanted to explain to you, as the coming days will certainly see wide-ranging international discussion of this question."
"We have always said that the accession process is intended to be a catalyst for resolving the Cyprus issue, and we must, I think, use every available opportunity to deal with the anachronistic situation of a future Member State of the European Union with a barbed wire fence and UN troops deployed there in order to protect the two ethnic groups from each other."
"For us as Europeans, that is simply not acceptable, it is unworthy of us …"
"… and that is why the Commission has decided to take this step."
"As this is the last occasion on which the Commission will be able to put such comprehensive reports before Parliament, let me conclude by again thanking you very, very warmly for your cooperation, which has always been constructive, fruitful and trusting."
"I thank the Commission for those reports."
"I should like to remind colleagues that we are not having a debate in substance now."
"These reports will go to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, rapporteurs will prepare their own reports, and the debate comes later."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all rejoice that we have got as far as we have, and for that I want to extend warm thanks to the Commission, to its President Mr Prodi, and to Commissioner Verheugen."
"Having said that, I intend to keep it brief."
"You mentioned the material that has been published."
"I find it intolerable that certain things should get into the press without Parliament having the documents in question."
"Commissioner Verheugen, to what do you attribute this state of affairs?"
"Now for my second question."
"Whilst I would encourage you to work towards the candidate countries actually implementing what has been agreed, I would also ask you whether it is not the case that we have to set them a good example, for example in matters of stability policy?"
"Do we not also, for our part, have to do everything possible to adhere to the Treaties, in order to give a good example to our future partners in the European Union?"
"My third point has to do with Turkey."
"We are all very glad that Turkey has chosen this particular way forward."
"The Turks are our friends and partners, but do we not also have to distinguish between that which is theoretical and what is put into practice?"
"Where Turkey’s membership is concerned, I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship, for example by way of a privileged partnership."
"The majority in our group favours good, strong and neighbourly relations founded upon a privileged partnership."
". Mr Poettering, you cannot be more irate than I am myself about these leaks of information."
"Let me just say in all seriousness that it is perhaps a weakness in the Community’s procedures that the Commission has to be sent too many sensitive documents before it can take a decision."
"Leaks are a regular occurrence as soon as papers leave my office."
"I knew that this would happen."
"When, at 6 p.m. last Friday evening, in accordance with Commission rules, we had to dispatch the papers, I was in no doubt whatever that my weekend was, so to speak, done for – and so it was!"
"I told the Commission this morning that I had no wish to tell them how much political interference I had endured in the last few days, on the part of Heads of Government and foreign ministers from every quarter, because I do not wish to give the impression that the Commission gives in to such pressure."
"The real problem with these leaks is that they limit the Commission’s capacity to act."
"We have been unable to make any amendments today, because all and sundry would have been able to draw comparisons between what happened today and what we originally wanted."
"That is profoundly sad, Mr Poettering, and I cannot give you an explanation."
"We are dealing here with derelictions of duty by individuals."
"Past attempts to discover who was responsible have failed time and time again, and I no longer have any confidence that such attempts will prove successful."
"What I can do is ask Parliament to forgive this manifest untoward conduct by members of staff whom I do not know by name, but which I hope you will excuse."
"I also agree with you as regards the second question."
"If we were to set the number of problems that have been identified with the new Member States against the number of infringement proceedings brought against long-standing Member States in any given year, you would discover a startling discrepancy."
"The fact is that the number of infringements of the Treaties about which we have to complain to the present Member States every year is many times higher than the number of problem areas that we have now identified."
"I entirely share your view that, if we were to be able to measure the present Member States against the same benchmarks that we apply to the candidates for membership, we would, in one area or another, get some perhaps surprising results, whether in the area to which you referred – that of macro-economic discipline – or, perhaps in others as well."
"What you said on the subject of Turkey is nothing new to me; it is a point of view that I respect."
"You will be aware that this is an area in which the Commission has a clear mandate from the Council, and that it must act accordingly."
"I would like to use this opportunity to make just one comment."
"A discussion of the principles behind Turkey acceding or not acceding is necessary and has to be conducted. Where, then, if not in this House?"
"Where if not among the people of Europe?"
"I am in full agreement with that. I simply ask that, in this discussion, we should never lose sight of the fact that we in Europe have a direct interest in Turkey being a fully-developed democracy, a fully developed state under the rule of law, with respect for human rights and protection for minorities."
"If we constantly keep that in mind, then I do not actually have any fear that this necessary and unavoidable discussion might do any damage."
"Mr President, I should just like to observe that the leaks do not help the Commission's cause to be involved in foreign and security policy decisions."
"I welcome what the Commission has said today."
"It is remarkable progress and I also welcome Commissioner Verheugen's assurance that the Commission will take action if progress is not forthcoming in those 39 areas."
"First, the Commissioner sent out warning letters earlier this year to the candidate countries."
"What was their response and does their response indicate that they will also respond to these proposals he has put before us?"
"Second, in relation to Romania, where there was a slight hesitancy in his language, to what extent does Romania's previous track record, where it promised a lot and delivered little, count against it despite the progress that has been made in the last two or three years?"
"Finally, I should like to ask the Commissioner about the hidden negotiations that nobody talks about anymore, the parallel negotiations to extend the European Economic Area to the accession countries."
"How exactly are the EEA negotiations progressing?"
". Mr Titley, the two monitoring reports that we delivered in the first half of this year have indeed resulted in positive outcomes."
"At the same time, we also identified problem areas and then sent out what we called ‘early warning letters’, the sort of thing that in my schooldays in Germany was called a ‘blue letter’ – I believe that, in English, they are called ‘red letters’ – which always contained the threat that if you did not buckle down to work at once, then you risked having to repeat a year."
"The results were very interesting."
"Almost half the cases that we identified have, in the interim, already been sorted out, so that they do not appear in the concluding monitoring report."
"We will now also be writing to the governments, and I know that, in every case, the Commission’s insights will be accepted – nobody disputes that – and that all the governments will be cooperative, so I believe that we will be able to sort the problems out."
"Some of the governments, for example, have told me that the relevant legislation is already on track."
"Monitoring has undoubtedly proven its worth as a method that helps us to make progress."
"The only thing I can say in response to your comment on Romania is that the encouraging political and economic stability that we have seen in Romania over the past two years is continuing, and that, in view of this stability, Romania is actually in a very good position to achieve the objective it seeks."
"Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner on having brought the accession countries to a stage where fewer than 40 serious concerns were raised out of the 140 elements of the ."
"Most of those concerns are in the area of health and food legislation, or of public administration."
"Without making light of the concerns, is the Commissioner confident that the obstacles can be overcome by next May?"
"Moreover, on Bulgaria and Romania, a clear difference is emerging."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he will give the clear signal that Sofia has asked for on the Union's final requirements, and whether he will be tough with the Romanians on the very substantial progress that Romania still has to make."
"I welcomed the Commissioner's remarks on Turkey."
"The reforms of Prime Minister Erdogan's government are real and must be welcomed."
"They must be fully implemented;"
"Commissioner, you are right to demand more, particularly regarding political rights and Cyprus."
"But let us acknowledge Turkey's very strident steps forward and I hope that the Commission will commit itself to finding all of the resources possible for working with Turkey to help it towards membership."
"Mr Watson, I am – shall we say – moderately optimistic that everything will be sorted out."
"I am entirely optimistic that far and away the greater part of it will be."
"Although we cannot exclude the possibility of mishaps in one instance or another, I will reiterate that all the problems that might crop up are capable of being isolated and will not result in any overall danger to the internal market, the Agricultural Policy, or the food market as a whole."
"If I may turn to Romania and Bulgaria, it is certainly the case that Romania still has a long way to go, but there is no doubt that it has, over the last two years, caught up to a significant degree."
"Bulgaria and Romania were given their financial signal when we undertook to present the financial package in the first half of next year, that is, during the Irish Presidency, and, moreover, very early on in the year."
"I have already discussed in depth with the Irish finance minister how this can be handled."
"I regard the political and technical difficulties involved in the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania as being manageable, for the reason that we intend to use the same methods, the same principles and the same rules as we did for the Ten."
"We are not putting together a new package for Romania and Bulgaria; instead, we are, so to speak, extrapolating what we have already done for the Ten."
"That is also the only option available to us if our orders are that the financial package for Romania and Bulgaria is not to prejudice the next Financial Perspective, which, in its turn, should not prejudice the conclusion of negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria."
"That is why we can do no other than choose the same methodology that we have already chosen for the Ten."
"So I do not think that is so terribly difficult and do not want to exclude the possibility of our being able to make perceptible progress in this area in the first six months of 2004."
"Mr President, the Commissioner did not answer my third question about the accession of these 10 countries to the European Economic Area."
"It may be that he has chosen not to answer, but maybe he forgot."
"I would like an answer."
"The Commissioner will answer that in his next reply."
"– Mr President, I should first of all like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Verheugen."
"In Germany, there is a ‘Chancellor of Unity’ and now also a ‘Commissioner for the Unification of Europe’."
"My sincere congratulations on this."
"I am particularly glad that, in your report, you have quite clearly given priority to the political criteria in respect of Turkey."
"This is an important point."
"It is evident that the progress made is significant to the Turkish public."
"I think we should note this with a sense of gratitude."
"Secondly, I have to conclude from your report that you are fairly disappointed with what has actually happened."
"So am I, to say the least."
"I thought that more would have been done than has actually been the case, especially with regards to the position of the army; this at any rate, is evident from your report."
"These are matters with major implications."
"Your optimism concerning the ten countries that will be joining the EU on 1 May relates to minor aspects that can still be ironed out."
"I think that the big step towards the democratic constitutional state – which still has to be taken in practice – is of such a scale that we can hardly expect this to be completed in a year from now."
"Correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner, but is the date of December 2004 either the date on which we will no longer take our political community of values as such seriously, or as the date on which the guillotine comes down on Turkey's membership?"
"In that sense, I think that this date is causing us increasing anxiety."
"Would it therefore not be preferable, in respect of Turkey, if we were to focus on programme-based progress, or guidance, on the road to a democratic constitutional state?"
"Mr President, on the subject of the European Economic Area, Mr Titley, I appeal to Liechtenstein, in the interests of the functioning of the European Economic Area, to not associate signing the Treaty with problems stemming from Europe’s past, but rather to seek dialogue with the Czech Republic concerning these difficulties."
"At present we are working extremely hard to show the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic a possible way out of this problem."
"I cannot yet predict how successful we will be, but we are trying, and we are doing our best, but obviously, you never know."
"I agree with you, Mr Oostlander, that it is precisely in the area of the military that we had hoped for more progress in Turkey."
"There are two issues that give me particular cause for concern."
"The first is that Turkish military personnel are still in supervisory authorities controlling important areas of civilian life, such as the National Council of Education or the National Council of Radio and Television."
"The military have lost nothing there."
"It is also the case that large portions of the Turkish defence budget are not subject to the control of parliament, and when a budget is outside parliament’s control, then that clearly indicates a lack of democracy."
"There is no question about that."
"I do not think that we need new benchmarks for Turkey or a new deadline or anything else."
"Turkey itself will decide whether or not the end assessment will be favourable."
"It is up to them to press ahead with reforms and, as Mr Poettering quite rightly said, to put these into practice, so that we can make an assessment."
"The political conditions governing accession have been met."
"The roadmap is clear: a decision at the end of next year."
"The Commission will accomplish this task seriously, fairly and objectively and will not shy away from this responsibility."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group, it is with pleasure that I echo the congratulations to the Commissioner and everyone who has been of assistance to him, but one issue is still causing us concern."
"In various accession countries, there are a number of sectors, and it is often these very areas of policy which require increased efforts."
"I am, for example, referring to discrimination in the area of social policy and employment, the right to asylum, and justice."
"Specific problems spring to mind; they are particularly shocking to our EU citizens, and I assume also to the citizens of those countries."
"I am talking here about such things as the discrimination against the Roma, child prostitution and human trafficking."
"If these points do not receive priority attention in the sense that they need to be sorted out prior to accession, what means do we have of exerting influence after it?"
"In this connection, I would quote to you your own words: these countries will then have joined and, as you stated in your introduction, you will have very little influence on these new Member States."
"Mrs Maes, you have raised some very sore points, and I will give you a very clear reply."
"Firstly, as regards the political, economic and social integration of minorities, Europe has problems not only with Roma."
"I could name groups in a number of Member States for whom discrimination is similarly prevalent, just to put the record straight."
"It is not, therefore, just the south eastern Europeans that have problems with the integration of the Roma minority, but also well-established old Member States that have problems integrating national minorities."
"As regards the Roma, they were and are, as you know, the main focus of our pre-accession efforts, and we will not declare any country ready for accession that has not devised and implemented a viable strategy for their integration."
"I have, however, said many times in this House that it would be a complete illusion to believe that the problem of discrimination and the Roma could be solved before accession in the sense of there being no more discrimination; that is a challenge for at least a whole generation."
"What we can reasonably achieve is, precisely, to see a policy drawn up and implemented that reduces discrimination, and I think that we have achieved just that."
"As regards the other issues such as prostitution and trafficking in women and girls, we repeatedly and emphatically point out these are, of course, prohibited in all of these countries."
"We cannot say that there is a shortfall in the legislation but we can say that there is a shortfall in its enforcement."
"Allow me to say something else, though, since, recently in particular, the issues of which I am all too aware have become apparent at Czech/German and Czech/Austrian border patrols."
"When we talk about prostitution and even child prostitution, then there are always two sides."
"There are those who offer their services or are forced to offer their services, but there are also those who ask."
"I have always been in favour and have always said that the issue needs to be tackled from both sides."
"I do not believe that we can solve it if we only tackle it from the angle of these unfortunate women, girls and children, who are abused for the purpose of sexual adventures, or whatever else."
"It must also be tackled from the angle of those who feature as customers, who create the demand and also an offer."
"– Mr Verheugen, I understand your anger with the media."
"I have three questions."
"Firstly, it was announced in the media in Poland that fifty-one complaints have been lodged, and in Parliament it is said that an iron fist is needed."
"Perhaps you should also use the iron fist in your area, but when the iron fist is directed against people, then it will be difficult and not just the officials will be affected."
"I have the impression that the social burdens in Poland will increase; the wind is blowing in the government’s face."
"The second question is what do you think about the regional processes in the candidate countries?"
"In Prague there is 3% unemployment, in the industrialised area of Northern Moravia there is approximately 30%."
"My third point is that we want good partnerships."
"We have just spoken about the Roma and if we want to have a good partnership with Russia then the issue of Russian minorities in the Baltic States must be tackled with greater consistency and seriousness, without political reservation and discrimination, but rather in a way that really leads to a solution."
"Mr President, Mr Modrow, I am sorry that I did not understand your first question or your first accusation."
"I do not know what you mean by fifty-one cases and an iron hand."
"I am familiar with neither the number nor the choice of words."
"As regards Poland, I believe that it has proved itself capable of fulfilling the conditions governing accession and of implementing the , and the Polish Government is working hard at dealing with the problems that have been identified, but there are nine of them rather than fifty-one."
"As regards regional differences in development, this is an issue that the Commission takes very seriously and on which we report regularly, and we are including these regional differences in development into the strategy for the structural funds that will be introduced in all of these countries from next year and which should significantly help to reduce these regional discrepancies."
"In the case of the Russian minority in the Baltic States, Mr Modrow, I do not agree with you that the issue is being dealt with in an inconsistent manner."
"On the contrary, I think that the Commission is handling the issue extremely well, but that there are nationalistic forces in the Russian Duma that are irresponsible in their approach to it."
"I can go into further detail if you so wish."
"As far as the situation of the Russian minority is concerned, we have been rigorous in ensuring that Estonia and Latvia meet the corresponding standard, and they are doing so."
"That does not mean there is no room for improvement."
"I also mentioned, in talks last week in Moscow with President Putin and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and other leading representatives, that we are able and willing to bring about improvement, but that overall the standards that exist in Europe regarding minorities have been met in both countries."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the great work that has been carried out."
"Having said that, I have a specific question relating to Cyprus and Turkey."
"I greatly welcome the clarification in the progress report of the fact that the non-resolution of the Cyprus issue is an obstacle."
"I think that it is also extremely difficult to imagine beginning negotiations with a country that is, at the same time – as will be the situation under international law from May next year – occupying part of the EU territory."
"This leads me to ask a specific question: at present Turkish citizens in their masses are being given passports for the illegal North Cypriot state, which is intended, on the one hand, to change the demographic situation and, on the other, to prevent an opposition victory."
"That is the current situation."
"Even if we do not recognise this election, we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next."
"I think that it will also be extremely important for Turkey."
"My specific question to you is, therefore: do you think that it is possible to influence Turkey in this area and to make it clear that we want to put an end to this?"
"Mr President, Mrs Rothe, this is, in actual fact, about elections to a parliament in a country that we do not recognise."
"Nevertheless, these elections are politically important, especially this year."
"I have noted with satisfaction the assurances given to me by my Turkish partners in dialogue that Turkey would not allow a shadow to fall over these elections."
"What we, and many sides, are describing means, however, that one already has."
"That is clearly an attempt to manipulate electoral lists so that the desired election result is achieved."
"The possibilities of influencing it are extremely limited."
"I am aware that these elections are being monitored by both independent media and independent non-governmental organisations, which will regularly report on them so that a European public opinion can emerge and exert pressure."
"This, Mr President, is one of the cases where Parliament can do more than the Commission and I should be grateful if it would avail itself of this opportunity."
"I know that you yourself have already done this."
"Mr President, as the Commissioner said, because Poland is the largest accession country, it obviously has the most problems and the most serious concerns."
"Would it be fair to say, as many people in Poland say, that in some cases at least part of the problem concerning the integrated administration and control system lies with Brussels delaying the spending on the final requirements for the system?"
"Would it be fair to say that?"
"Mr President,you are asking too much of me since I cannot of course give any information as to how the technical support worked in individual cases, the more so because this is a very specific procedure."
"What I know about this system is that we have been aware of the issue for about a year and a half and that initially the Polish agricultural administration responded very hesitantly and then decided on a change of strategy, which led to a considerable time delay."
"If you have evidence that Commission staff gave wrong advice or false information, then I ask you to let me know, as I would like to look into the issue."
"I am not aware of this having happened."
"One thing, though, I am willing to concede: what we have experienced here is further proof that our administrative structures are so unbelievably complicated in some areas that an accession country cannot, even if it wants to, fulfil these demands in a relatively short space of time."
"This is especially true for the area of agriculture."
"It has also been our experience that the Sapard programme has proven to be the most difficult of all pre-accession programmes, because it makes the greatest demands of the new Members and because, of all the systems, it is the most complicated and carries the most obligations."
"I will readily concede that we are dealing with an extremely complicated system but that, if you want to discuss who is responsible for the fact that we have or must have such complicated structures in this area, then that is quite a different matter."
"– Mr President, I am going to use this speech to refer specifically to Hungary, a country I have observed in my capacity as rapporteur for this House."
"I would like to provide a few complementary clarifications on the conclusions I have already had a chance to read, whilst first highlighting the high degree of alignment of Hungarian legislation and national institutions with the , a fact which, of course, I note with pleasure."
"The first question I would like to ask concerns the so-called ‘status law’, the law applying to Hungarians residing in neighbouring countries: what do you make of the current situation, Commissioner?"
"Do you really think that the commitment to consult neighbouring countries before amending that law has been respected?"
"The second question relates to the fight against corruption and organised crime, which you have already had occasion to mention elsewhere, Commissioner: what do you make of the behaviour of the Hungarian authorities during their investigations into and prosecution of high-profile financial scandals, of which you are aware, Commissioner, and which have been uncovered recently in that country?"
"Specifically, what comments do you have on the Hungarian Government’s criticism of the Financial Supervisory Authority, which is, of course, independent of the government of that country?"
"Mr Queiró, I do not think that it would be sensible for the Commission to reopen the issues associated with Hungarian Status Law."
"For a long time, I have endeavoured, with the utmost discretion, to help all countries concerned avoid any conflicts that might result from it."
"In the meantime we have reached the point where there is agreement between Romania and Hungary and the discussion process between the Slovak Republic and Hungary has not yet been concluded."
"I urgently advise against us interfering there, as this is more of an opportunity for the two states to talk and act in a neighbourly fashion."
"If our help is required, then it is available."
"At the moment, however, the two countries are talking to each other and I think that they will reach an outcome sooner or later."
"Even if they do not, European Community law will apply in this matter from 1 May 2004, and this will, in any case, rule out any differences in treatment on the grounds of nationality."
"The other question is a very complicated issue in the light of the domestic disputes in Hungary."
"I do not think that we are dealing with a systematic problem here, that is, with a problem that could be said to show that Hungary has not met the conditions for accession."
"Rather, we are dealing with massive, extremely weighty and very emotional domestic disputes."
"I do not think that it is for me to get involved in such a conflict and give my opinion on it."
"Just as little as I would get involved in domestic disputes in current Member States, we should now understand that our new Member States have left behind the phase where, as it were, they were under some kind of surveillance."
"I do not feel in any way responsible any more for domestic events in these countries."
"To observe and judge them is now a matter for Parliament, a matter for the Council, but it is certainly not a matter for the executive power to judge what a freely elected government and a freely elected parliament do."
"I urge you to understand that I do not want the Commission to start getting involved in a future Member State’s internal politics."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, I think that the reports are very well balanced and very accurate."
"As regards Romania, I would like to add that even recently we have seen visible measures against corruption, and this should be seen as a good thing."
"There is one issue that I ask you to consider closely, Commissioner, namely the spread of some aspects of petty crime to neighbouring countries."
"This causes great problems and I ask you, Commissioner, to really urge Romania to do something to counter this; it would be in their own interests."
"As regards Turkey, I find your report very well balanced, and the issue of Cyprus was also handled well."
"I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you would join with me and perhaps also urge all parties in this House not to make Turkey a campaign issue for the next European elections, since I fear that there are some forces that see ‘For or against Turkey’ as the election campaign issue for 2004."
"I hope that you agree with me that this should not be the case."
"Thank you."
"Commissioner, do you want to talk about the next European Parliament elections?"
"Mr President, I am in danger of being tripped up here."
"You know, Mr Swoboda, that all parties in this Parliament must be completely at liberty to pick out any European problem as a central issue."
"I have said so many times: I cannot and will not prevent any one from also raising in elections an issue of such fundamental importance to the future of Europe as the possible accession of Turkey."
"Indeed, where else are they to do so if not with the electorate in the run-up to an election?"
"As I understand the basics of democracy, citizens have the right to have such issues discussed with them."
"That is completely clear to me and I will not, therefore, criticise anyone."
"I can only repeat what I have already said, namely that the discussion should be conducted in such a way that no harm is done and that in doing so the common European interest is always taken into consideration and that the public are told that we want something from Turkey."
"What we want from Turkey is that in its political, strategic and geographical situation they take on security functions from us, both politically and economically, which no one else in the world is in a position to take on."
"We need Turkey on our side."
"The public also needs to be told this."
"Mr President, first of all, on the question of the availability of its reports, perhaps the Commission could show courtesy to this House by providing advance copy to the rapporteurs of this House rather than to the media."
"I speak as rapporteur for Bulgaria, a country on course for joining the European Union in 2007."
"I hope that all possible steps are going to be taken to complete negotiations in 2004, ideally by May 2004."
"This would send a very powerful message to the people of Bulgaria."
"While the Commission correctly states that the accession process for Bulgaria is based on the ‘own merits’ principle, nevertheless it has also said that it is committed to a common accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania together, by the end of 2005."
"Bulgaria should have no difficulty with that and I hope that Romania will meet that target as well, but I would not like to think that Bulgaria’s aspirations would in any way be held back by slower progress on the part of her northern neighbour."
"Finally, with regard to Cyprus, I agree there are strong possibilities for the two communities to reach a comprehensive settlement, but this requires goodwill and flexibility on sides and indeed pressure from the Commission on both sides."
"Mr van Orden, I would just like to repeat what I have already said."
"I must apologise for the irregularities and derelictions of duty that have been blamed on staff unknown to me, but I cannot allow the fact that duties were neglected anywhere to lead me to also violate my own and to disregard the Commission rules."
"I ask for your understanding."
"We sent the document to all rapporteurs – and to you – a few minutes after it was adopted by the Commission."
"I would, however, urge you to evaluate the progress in regular personal dialogue with me as we often did last year."
"As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I agree with you."
"The one country should not wait for the other, and we have also guaranteed this, but at present there is no need and no reason to contemplate decoupling the one country from the other in this accession process."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for those reports, and all colleagues who contributed today."
"That concludes the item."
"The Commission report on the progress towards accession by the candidate countries assembles an impressive list of ‘warnings’, which will no doubt give these countries a foretaste of Europe at its most disciplinary."
"This outcome was, however, inevitable once we did not opt for the most sensible accession method, that which we were advocating as early as 1992 and which consisted in creating a large political confederation and in then having the Eastern European countries subscribe to each Community policy as their interests or capacities progressively dictated."
"The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, preferred a one-phase accession formula to a unified system, leading implicitly to a super state, and we are now going to suffer the consequences, because it is neither technically nor politically viable."
"It is also striking that the candidate country that comes in for the most criticism, often for trivial reasons, is Poland, in fact the freest and most pugnacious country at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As regards Cyprus, the Commission is beginning to ask itself questions about the Turkish occupation."
"It is not too early."
"We need to demand that Turkey withdraw its troops immediately."
"– I lament the fact that the press were given precise details the day before yesterday of the contents of the report that you are presenting this afternoon to the Members: this order of things does not seem to me to correspond exactly to what should be the democratic functioning of the institutions."
"You have told us that this wayward trend is difficult to control, and that worries me."
"Then I note that the report on accession preparations treats Turkey in the same way as the other candidates, the ten plus two, in that way seeming, contrary to what you said, to anticipate the decision to be taken by the Council at the end of 2004 on this issue."
"Finally, I notice that, before the ten countries have even entered the European Union, they are already being threatened by safeguard clauses and being severely rebuked by the Commission, which is, furthermore, adopting a schizophrenic stance, systematically alarming the candidate countries and, at the same time, getting them to believe in themselves."
"Should the candidate countries really be put on trial in such a way?"
"Or, does this awkwardness on the part of the Commission not reveal a fundamental methodological error which has not allowed the specific characteristics of each country to be properly taken into consideration in the enlargement process and which is in danger of having long-term consequences?"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to present this House with a progress report on the process of constitutional reform of the European Union."
"The Italian Presidency firmly believes that only with the support of the European Parliament can the numerous problems facing us be resolved, and political agreement be achieved by December."
"For this reason, in keeping with Italy’s traditional position, we have striven to maximise the participation of the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Convention on the future of Europe was an innovation that set the current process of treaty reform in motion."
"The draft Treaty drawn up by the Convention is the result of more than just intergovernmental negotiation."
"Indeed, it takes its shape from a series of constructive contributions and a structured, global, public, transparent debate on the future of Europe."
"For the first time in the history of European integration, the process has actively engaged national parliaments and representatives of civil society too."
"The political value of the success achieved must not, therefore, be dispersed or watered down by the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"For its part, the IGC is responsible for enhancing and supplementing those sections of the Treaty where full agreement has yet to be reached."
"Any other solution would be seen as an attempt to downgrade the democratic and transparent method that was launched with the European Convention’s work."
"If this were to happen, it would be a backward step that our citizens would find difficult to understand or justify."
"This is the belief underpinning the Italian Presidency’s chief aim, which is to reach global political agreement on the Constitution’s text by December."
"This will open the way to the signing of the future Constitutional Treaty - a Constitution for Europe as President Giscard d'Estaing has called it - in the period between 1 May 2004, which is the date set for the accession of the 10 new Member States, and the European Parliament elections."
"The extension of the constitutional debate beyond these dates would cause two serious problems of legitimacy and transparency."
"On the one hand, the constituent legacy of the Convention would be lost; on the other, the European citizens would find themselves voting in European elections without any idea of the future constitutional shape of the Union."
"The Italian Presidency will certainly not allow itself to be steered into negotiating a watered-down compromise that would represent a retreat from the Convention’s proposals just to achieve consensus on controversial issues."
"Our aim is to achieve a high-quality result in keeping with the expectations of the European public and capable of guaranteeing effective, democratic functioning of the Union well into the future."
"Endowing the European Union with a Constitution is a challenge not only for some countries or for the Italian Presidency, which has the honour of steering the Council through this particular stage, but for all of us."
"We owe it to our citizens."
"If we fail to meet the challenge, the reunified Europe also fails and, with it, the European Union as a force for stability and prosperity in the world."
"Failure would make losers of us all."
"After the opening ceremony on 4 October, the real work of the IGC began."
"As was only to be expected, by far the most complex issues were those relating to institutional affairs."
"The principal questions concerned the composition of the Commission, election procedures and the competences of the President of the European Council, the status of the Foreign Affairs Minister and the calculation of qualified majorities."
"These issues were examined at the IGC meetings which took place in the first half of October."
"The Ministerial Meeting of 27 October expanded the range of the discussion to include matters not addressed, or addressed only marginally, at previous meetings."
"In particular, the meeting considered the following themes: the presidency of the Council configurations, the extension of qualified-majority voting, and non-institutional matters, with particular reference to economic and financial provisions."
"The debate confirmed that Member States have differing positions and that the proposals in the draft Constitutional Treaty approved by the Convention are essentially well-balanced."
"It also became apparent that reopening debate on specific aspects of the draft treaty leads only to the reiteration of conflicting positions, and not to the emergence of new consensus."
"The following conclusions may be drawn from the outcome of the meeting. Firstly, views are gradually converging regarding the future presidency of council formations, although the matter has to be reviewed in the context of a comprehensive proposal covering all the institutional structures of the future enlarged European Union."
"The vast majority of the Member States oppose the establishment of a Legislative Council."
"The Italian Presidency has taken due note of this opposition, but will to do everything in its power to ensure that the Legislative Council is preserved in the Treaty, at least as an option for the future and thus as a possible development of the Council system."
"Secondly, it confirms that Member States still have divergent positions in respect of the scope of qualified majority voting."
"In light of this, the Presidency will consider what tools it should adopt to achieve consensus particularly in sensitive, crucial areas such as taxation, own resources, cooperation on criminal justice and police cooperation."
"In any event, the Convention’s draft will remain the main basis on which to build a balanced, ambitious agreement."
"Thirdly, the obviously excessive number of non-institutional matters raised by Member States was clearly incompatible with the time constraints of the IGC schedule established in Thessaloniki and confirmed in Brussels by the Heads of State or Government."
"Accordingly, the Presidency will examine this set of issues using a selective approach, and identify those areas around which a consensus seems to be forming which is different from the line taken in the Convention’s draft, and the areas which require technical and editorial clarification."
"It will then be up to Member States to decide whether to insist on specific, minority points, and, if necessary, to bring them to the attention of Heads of State or Government."
"On the basis of the Convention’s draft and on the work of the Foreign Ministers, the Presidency will draw up a comprehensive proposal centred on the institutional package and the question of defence."
"The proposal will attempt to consider the demands of both acceding and candidate states."
"The point of departure for the proposal, however, will still be the Convention’s draft, and it will seek to achieve compromises that are at least as ambitious and worthy as those put forward by the Convention."
"We are willing to consider possible adjustments but remain resolutely opposed to undermining and retreat."
"In all probability, the future of the European Constitution depends on the outcome of these negotiations."
"Therefore, and in view of the high stakes, all parties should adopt a flexible approach to the task of laying the foundations for the European Union of the twenty-first century."
"We must abandon parochial concerns and move away from the idea of getting a fair return, whereby every single concession must be matched by a gain of equal import."
"This approach is or rather, would be contrary to the very concept of European integration, and, if applied systematically, would be in danger of undermining the foundations of the Union."
"Although fairness is a prerequisite for any constitutional agreement, no one must stop the current process of integration."
"Those who decide to act in this way will have to be prepared to be judged by history, by their European partners and, above all, by their citizens."
"The approval of the new Constitution will be a success for everyone or a failure for the Union."
"There can be no substantial conflict between national and European interests."
". Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate entitled ‘progress report’ on the Intergovernmental Conference – with the emphasis on the word ‘progress’ – I have to say, quite frankly, that the Commission is concerned."
"On 24 September 2003, I expressed the hope before this House that the Conference would bring progress, that it would be able to adjust and enhance some points, clarify others and evaluate the draft Constitution on which we have all worked – and worked well, I feel – in the context of the Convention."
"I want to tell you that the evaluation process is making headway under the guidance of Mr Jean-Claude Piris in the Council, with the participation of Parliament’s and the Commission’s legal services."
"On the political side of things, quite frankly, the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference have not, however, to date brought any progress at all."
"On the contrary, today, my impression, the impression of my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, and, doubtless, the impression of your own representatives, Mr Hänsch and Mr Mendez de Vigo, is that this Intergovernmental Conference could lead to climbdowns."
"Ladies and gentlemen, henceforth, we must put a stop to the excuses some countries are already starting to produce."
"There is no question mark over the method: it was necessary to give the national governments the time to debate the outcome of the Convention together."
"After that, the time comes for them to decide."
"There is no suggestion that the Italian Presidency is to blame."
"I can witness to the fact that it has unceasingly and tirelessly endeavoured to generate debate and encourage convergence."
"It has consistently and firmly taken the result of the Convention as a basis."
"MrAntonione made a point just now relating to the Legislative Council, on which we have noticed a general climbdown."
"On this point, you have all, like me, heard the proof of what I said about the Italian Presidency - its determination to preserve the outcome of the Convention, to enhance it and to prevent it falling apart, as far as is humanly possible."
"I would, therefore, like to pay tribute, in particular, to the presidency of the Council of Ministers, in the person of Mr Frattini, and its dedicated efforts."
"There is no question mark over the Convention’s work."
"As we know, not only has it been useful but it is also fully usable."
"The Convention has discharged its mandate and even gone beyond it, providing the Heads of Government with a complete, coherent text on the table."
"Lastly, there is no question mark over the roles played by the Commission and Parliament."
"In the Intergovernmental Conference today, as in the Convention yesterday, we are working together and, very often, more often than not, there is agreement."
"In any case, there has always been genuine dialogue between us."
"I will be frank, then: what is to be called into question in the current situation of stasis in the Intergovernmental Conference is the approach of certain governments which want to act as if there had been no 18-month long Convention, which want to reopen all the Pandora’s boxes, one after the other, which refuse now to agree to what they often endorsed, themselves, yesterday in the Convention, as regards economic governance, for example, or as regards the role of the European Parliament in the Union’s budgetary procedure."
"If this approach were to continue, it would lead to a deadlock."
"I will give you just two examples."
"Firstly, qualified majority voting."
"All the cards are on the table."
"All the positions are known."
"We all know that if the unanimity requirement is preserved for a subject, we are, without a doubt, all condemned to collective impotence."
"There is only one solution to this situation given that there are so many of us round the table – there will soon be 25 of us and, one day, 30 – and that is a shift to qualified majority voting for the majority of subjects."
"We have to decide here and now and certainly not – on no account – go back on the not inconsiderable progress made with the Convention’s text."
"The second example is the updating of the common policies in the third part of the Constitution."
"It is inconceivable that we should manage to produce a perfect, definitive text that will never need to be changed in a few more weeks of Intergovernmental Conference."
"The important thing – for times are going to change, for European and world society are going to change – is the ability to adapt these policies to the Union’s needs, to the needs of society as they change."
"The important thing, therefore, is to make the mechanism for revising the third part rather more flexible, at least in some areas."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to reiterate here, on behalf of the Commission, that the only way we will have any chance of a short, decisive Intergovernmental Conference is if the governments observe the broad balance of the Constitution drawn up by the Convention."
"As for the rest, we expect the national governments to shoulder their responsibilities: the responsibility to resolve without delay, as you said, Minister, a small number of issues which have been debated at length; the responsibility to build in the flexibility and safeguards which will allow the Constitution to move with the times."
"We have reached the point where all the cards are on the table."
"Now we need to have a discussion and take a decision, which is different from aligning national positions."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it is ready to do that, under the same conditions as I outlined a month ago: to enhance the draft Constitution with regard to a limited number of points, without jeopardising its overall balance; to make all the provisions clearer in order to avoid misunderstandings or confusion when the text is ratified; to carry out what I would call the legal fine-tuning exercise entrusted to it by the Convention."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the credibility of this Intergovernmental Conference method is on the line for the last time."
"I say this because I have already taken part in three Intergovernmental Conferences since Amsterdam."
"Each year, the method proves less capable of taking the Union forward."
"The Maastricht Conference revealed a shared goal."
"The Amsterdam Conference produced a useful but incomplete result."
"After laborious negotiations, the Nice Conference managed, in the end, to reach a complex temporary compromise on the leftovers of Amsterdam."
"Then here we are today with the danger of a deadlock in this Intergovernmental Conference, despite the fact that the Convention is well on the way to a major, high-quality achievement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when the draft Constitution was adopted, some people waxed lyrical on the subject of what they called the ‘spirit of the Convention’."
"In actual fact, for those who took part in the Convention and continue to be proud of having done so – including many of you – the spirit presiding over the work was, quite simply, European rather than international."
"All I want at this juncture is to see some of this European spirit hovering once again over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Speaking of a conquered people, Cicero said ’. Literally, that means, ‘They acted wisely but too late’."
"There will, and would be, absolutely no point in the governments of a finally reunified Europe acting wisely after this Intergovernmental Conference is over."
"Mr President, I believe it is highly symbolic that after the debate on enlargement, on the political reunification of the continent, we should hold this debate on the political reorganisation of the continent, which must end with the approval of the European Constitution;"
"I believe that the two things are united and, as the Italian Presidency has quite rightly said, this must be the case so that we can go into the 2004 elections on the basis of a European Constitution."
"I said the other day, Mr President, that I believed that so far the debates in the Intergovernmental Conference have produced a degree of frustration, and I explained this, like Klaus Hänsch, by saying that the debates we were seeing were a repetition of those we had held during the Convention."
"There was nothing new and as Michel Barnier has already said very correctly all that was being produced was a reduction of what had been obtained."
"I must also say that we should find cause for satisfaction in it, because it ultimately means that the Convention did good work and if the governments present back to us what they presented to us then, that means that what we supported then was the solution which achieved the greatest consensus."
"I would like to refer to an issue which has been the subject of the last meeting at ministerial level and which has been the cause of great concern to the representatives of Parliament."
"I am referring to the intention of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers to make a series of proposals which, at the end of the day, meant entirely undoing the compromise achieved by the Convention on Title VII of the Constitution on the Union's finances."
"This was a compromise which was mulled over at length, involving four working groups chaired by Mr Amato, Mr Hänsch, Mr Christophersen and Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"This compromise was based on three key ideas, which have been this Parliament’s banner over the last ten years: achieving greater democracy, achieving greater efficiency and achieving greater transparency."
"That compromise was also based on two ideas: the first was that, with regard to revenue, the governments should have the final word, since, at the end of the day, it is provided by the citizens of the Union; and secondly, with regard to spending, the European Parliament should have the final word, since it represents those same Union citizens."
"Consequently, on the basis of the work of these four working groups, we proposed this compromise with three legs; the first one relates to own resources: own resources will be decided by the governments and subject to ratification by national parliaments; the second is the financial perspectives: the Inter-institutional Agreement is incorporated into the Constitution and they will be approved as from those of 2006 by a qualified majority in the Council and with the approval of the European Parliament; and, thirdly, the budget: Parliament will have the final word with regard to the spending chapter, the distinction, which has always seemed to us to be bizarre, between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure having disappeared, but this is an approval subject to brakes and obstacles, since in order to have the final word, this Parliament must have a majority of 3/5."
"By all this I mean, Mr President, that we are dealing with an agreement on three legs, and this Parliament as my fellow Members well know naturally believes that ratification by national parliaments of own resources is something which belongs to the past and also that the multi-annual financial framework should be something subject to the ordinary legislative procedure."
"This means that we, for the sake of compromise, have given ground because we believed that the principle according to which ‘the governments have the final word on revenue and Parliament has the final word on spending’ makes sense."
"I would like to make it very clear that this Parliament has given ground for the sake of compromise and, therefore, I believe that at the moment the fact that this compromise, which is one of the key elements of the constitutional text, should be called into question and there should be an attempt to blur some of the elements of these three legs, makes no sense."
"So much so that I believe that, from this Parliament’s political point of view, and I would like to make this very clear, it will be totally unacceptable."
"It will be a red line for us."
"And we said this at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it has been accepted by the Italian Presidency as well and, while I was preparing this speech, Mr President, I received a note from the Ansa agency in which Mr Tremonti, President-in-Office of ECOFIN, says, and I will read in Italian: [We believe it is essential that the text prepared by the Convention should be approved just as it is]."
"Well, let us take notice of Mr Tremonti and let us maintain the compromise on the issue of finances."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the statements of the President-in-Office of the Council, which outlined general approaches which I feel I can support, but I would prefer to focus on a number of practical issues, not least because Mr Antonione called for the European Parliament’s support."
"To obtain this support, which we are, moreover, quite willing to give, he must enter into dialogue with the positions of the European Parliament."
"On 21 October, there was a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in which the Italian Foreign Minister took part, representing the President-in-Office."
"I would like to draw the attention of Mr Antonione and the House to two points once again."
"We are firmly in favour of keeping the reference to the Legislative Council, the concentration of the European Parliament’s legislative function in the Council, which is an important point, a major innovation of the draft Convention."
"Now, Mr Antonione tells us that he has taken note of the fact that the majority is opposed to this."
"I would express my doubts once again regarding this approach: one cannot take decisions just by counting the numbers for and against."
"Sometimes, I even have the impression that the views of 28 governments are part of the equation, whereas only 25 are entitled to give an opinion, for three are mere observers."
"In the Convention, there were analyses, exchange of opinions, a search for solutions, a debate on the points for and against each solution, and, lastly, compromise."
"We cannot accept that the Intergovernmental Conference should do no more than tot up the fors and againsts."
"Mr Antonione has made a commitment – and I appreciate the significance of this – to keep the matter open."
"I do not know exactly what the outcome of this will be, but we call strongly for this point not to be deleted."
"The second point concerns the procedure for revising the Treaties."
"Mr Antonione did not mention it today, but Mr Frattini undertook before our committee to look into drawing up an Italian proposal to go beyond the text, which was not agreed in the Convention and is not, therefore, binding for any party."
"We are in danger of creating an absurd situation where we go back to square one on issues already resolved in the Convention with a compromise but we are unable to discuss issues which were not the subject of an agreement in the Convention, such as, precisely, the revision procedure."
"I do not know whether the Italian Presidency intends to include this matter in the comprehensive proposal planned for the third week in November too, but we reiterate our firm commitment to fight for this to be included."
"Lastly, Mr Antonione did not mention the issue raised by Mr Méndez de Vigo: it is unacceptable for sectoral configurations of the Council of Ministers to produce amendments to the Convention’s text."
"Mr President, the performance of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers causes me great concern too."
"Yesterday, one of its principal members, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, attacked the proposals from the Convention as threatening to bring about a federal state with centralised fiscal policy."
"This is a grossly false accusation displaying a regrettable prejudice against the work of the Convention."
"Then Ecofin tries to subvert the package on the financial system."
"Its reactionary proposals appear to want to move away from QMV to permanent unanimity on the financial perspectives, and also to remove Parliament’s right of assent."
"They want to retreat from the ordinary law towards Council law and to remove Parliament’s last word on the budget."
"One certain consequence of this would be an increase in the overall expenditure of the budget."
"Without being able to out-vote troublesome and perhaps greedy Member States, the Union will be obliged to have protracted and public rows ending in costly concessions."
"In effect, the Finance Ministers are seeking to suppress this Parliament’s role as a partner in the budgetary authority."
"They are imposing treasury autocracy upon parliamentary democracy."
"The power of the purse is a core function, a most central and long-standing power of the parliaments in all our Member States."
"Should the proposals of the Ecofin Council be allowed to prosper at the IGC, this Parliament will be reduced to a pale mockery."
"The autocrats will have won out over the democrats."
"– Mr President, as a former member of the Convention I must say that I am extremely surprised at what is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"You only need to pick up the note from the Presidency, document 37."
"What you read is – I find – unbelievable."
"Just the list of desired amendments to the Convention text is 20 pages long."
"When I see that, then I cannot help having the impression that some governments clearly did not take the Convention seriously, since what else would explain why these same governments that supported the Convention consensus are now calling for this plethora of amendments?"
"I am sorry to say that only the contentious issues regarding institutional matters are widely reported to the public: the number of Commissioners or the issue of Council majorities."
"These are, without a doubt, important issues – in this respect we must not, I believe, go back to Nice."
"Furthermore I would also like to clearly state that I expect the Intergovernmental Conference to follow the Convention in rejecting any attempts to include a reference to God in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights fully guarantees everyone’s right to freedom of religion."
"That is right and proper, but to divide the people of the European Union into religious and irreligious by way of the Constitution – no, that cannot be allowed to happen under any circumstances."
"Any retrograde steps regarding the rights of Parliament would also be unacceptable, in particular given the budgetary powers of this House."
"I believe that those who want to wield the axe here are demonstrating a certain degree of disconnection from a democratic Europe."
"In the Convention, I endeavoured to make the EU more social, since a social Europe is what the public rightly expect."
"It is precisely in this respect that I think that the EU still has a long way to go."
"I am amazed when important politicians in my country claim that the Convention’s draft is dangerous from a regulatory point of view or when it is announced by those at the Deutsche Bank that the predominance of social objectives in the Convention’s draft threatens the EU’s economic structure."
"I ask myself what the Intergovernmental Conference is actually doing in this area."
"Will it reject such attacks on the draft’s progress?"
"How will the discrepancies between Part III and Part I be dealt with?"
"Politically and legally speaking it is imperative that the provisions on economic and monetary policy of Part III are aligned with the basic provisions of Part I. I guarantee that no one will understand and certainly not approve if there are two economic philosophies in the Constitution text: social market economy, balanced economic growth and full employment on the one hand and an open market economy with free competition and merely a high level of employment on the other hand."
"Parliament has to pay considerably more attention to all these issues."
"In saying this, I am also addressing my comments to my own government."
"Instead of abstaining on amendments, it should stand up in the Intergovernmental Conference so that the social objectives set down in Part I clearly and unmistakably also apply to Part III of the Constitution Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference, having only just been opened, paints a picture of a bundle of banknotes being thrown into the crowd in a pedestrian zone."
"Everyone is jostling to get hold of a note; the Convention draft is being dealt with as if a piece of game were being hunted to death so that everyone can pull out a piece for themselves."
"At this point I wonder who is actually the source of Europe’s constitution."
"The citizens?"
"Their directly elected representatives – the parliaments – or even the cabinet offices and national governments?"
"One day we will have to answer this question before history and the people of Europe."
"The Intergovernmental Conference gives its own answer, that they are the source of Europe’s constitution."
"In Thessaloniki they claimed that they would not open Pandora’s box."
"Pandora’s box is open and you can see how the old diseases of Europe are spreading, national egoism and aspirations of unilateralism in the individual institutions."
"From where else might they come, these diseases and this evil that we are seeing?"
"In its first meeting, the Legislative Council thus removed the separation of powers element and the public nature of legislation, without debate."
"The Finance Ministers agree: fewer rights for Parliament, less publicity, fewer rights for the Commission."
"They are the sole legislators."
"They – they alone – have budget sovereignty behind closed doors."
"Qualified majority voting – a considerable step in the draft Constitution – is being challenged in many areas."
"Dual majority in the Council, one of the Convention’s best principles: a law is passed with the majority of the States and the majority of the citizens."
"That is understandable, that is legitimate."
"It is attacked for not fitting in with their power game."
"Another step forward: Euratom."
"A great opening towards reform of this obsolete treaty will be blocked."
"The European Central Bank, which is bound by the Convention on European values and objectives, will be exempt from these values because of solidarity."
"I could go on."
"The attacks are fierce."
"The principle is: more power to governments, less democracy, fewer rights for citizens, and less knowledge for the public."
"We need to respond to this, and if the parliaments do not do so, then Europe’s Constitution will be a bad one."
"– Mr President, Mr Antonione, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the news from the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) paints a picture of disagreements and difficulties. To any disinterested, objective observer, that comes as no surprise."
"Only those who promote the false idea that a supposed consensus was obtained within the Convention can feign astonishment."
"We all know that the results of the Convention would not be accepted as a democratic consensus anywhere where the principles of democracy are known and respected, where votes are taken."
"We now have harsh proof of the contrary, found in the character of the IGC itself, the only institution complying with the Treaties and wielding the democratic and legal legitimacy to make decisions."
"Those who sought to diminish the IGC, who still insist on doing so, are therefore on the wrong track."
"I salute the Italian Presidency and the dedicated fashion in which it has performed its work."
"It is crystal clear here today that the blame for any potential failures will lie not with this Presidency but with those who persist in forcing the issue, in riding roughshod over the legitimate rights of the Member States and in weakening democracy and the Rule of Law."
"Of all of these, I would point to Jacques Chirac’s most unfortunate opening speech, which was followed inauspiciously by Gerhard Schroeder, attempting to use financial blackmail to stifle debates in the IGC and using Community funds to threaten some Member States."
"That was the worst possible start to the conference, as it set a highly negative tone, far indeed from the positive efforts and goodwill of the Italian Presidency."
"I do not know if anyone felt intimidated, but the whole thing deserves to be roundly condemned."
"This is not the way!"
"On the other hand, the German Chancellor appears to be softening his dogmatic initial positions, having indicated during a visit to Bratislava some days ago that he might be prepared to accept the loud calls for the Commission to be appointed on the basis of one Commissioner per Member State, with equal rights."
"I welcome these signals – they are sparks of hope and promising gestures."
"That is the way."
"I hope that these signals will prove genuine and will extend to other items on our agenda: respect for the principle of subsidiarity, express guarantees of respect for the primacy of national constitutional law, transparency in the Council’s legislative operations, recognition in the preamble of our Christian heritage, retaining the rotating Presidency or finding a satisfactory solution to the various problems caused by the unsuitable duration of each term, the elimination of terminological flights of fancy such as ‘Minister for Foreign Affairs’ or ‘Constitution for Europe’, the deletion or strict rationing of flexibility or clauses so as not to cheat the system for revising the Treaties, and so on."
"The further away we move from the dictates of a Cabinet, even if it calls itself a Praesidium,the more successful the IGC will be."
"The IGC will only fail if the inflexibility of certain so-called ‘big guns’ makes them ‘small’, makes them want to overturn equilibriums that are essential to the unselfish quest for European integration."
"The more the IGC respects and pushes forward with the sacred founding principle of equality between Member States, the more it attends prudently and realistically to the actual state of public opinion on national identity and European identity, the broader the support it will garner."
"It would help to remind the French President that the result of his diplomacy, of his European Presidency, was the Treaty of Nice itself. That fact may help him and others to calm the excessive nerves they so often display."
"Nice is the Treaty in force. More than that, it is a Treaty which is not even completely in force yet."
"There is no hurry, therefore, no drama, no cause for despair or distress."
"Nice is that alternative consensus which so many people invoke; it is also, for now, the only real consensus, the Treaty we prepared in readiness for the main challenge facing us now: enlargement."
"Let us not, therefore, put the timetable ahead of the crux of the matter."
"The reform of the Treaties must be a good reform, a lasting reform, one which allows everybody time to speak and be heard, to form real consensuses, to build and entrench authentic, lasting unanimity."
"This must not be a reform done in a hurry, destined to fall at the first hurdle, as the text of the Convention is currently doing."
"We believe that the European Union cannot fail."
"The European Union must not fail."
"Mr President, the results of the EU Convention have now been printed in a number of splendid, blue-backed books, but they are completely unreadable."
"There is no glossary."
"Who in the Council is responsible for sending out thick books in all the languages without glossaries which would have enabled people to locate those places in which they were particularly interested?"
"As taxpaying citizens, we pay billions to the EU’s numerous information offices which then, however, use the money for propaganda rather than for providing genuine information."
"It is bizarre that it is in my office, rather than in the institutions, that we are to produce the reader-friendly editions of the draft Constitution which people, including politicians, have a chance of being able to understand."
"We have annotated the margins with many cross-references so that there is no need to jump backwards and forwards to see whether unanimity or a qualified majority is required."
"We have underlined all the key words so that the draft Constitution might quickly be skimmed through, and we have prepared a comprehensive alphabetical glossary so that words such as ‘subsidiarity’, ‘religion’ and ‘defence’ can be looked up and the places quickly found where they are mentioned."
"We have, moreover, made our work available on the Internet free of charge in all the languages."
"Not everything is ready in all the languages, but the most important parts are there and can be downloaded quite freely from my homepage with the address ‘bonde.com’."
"We have also prepared approximately 1 000 definitions with relevant links to the website ‘euabc.com’, and anyone can freely download them to their own computer and have future changes sent to them completely automatically via e-mail."
"This is a task that the Council should have carried out."
"Instead, they have broken an agreement made with us in Democracy Forum and printed the draft Constitution without attaching the minority statement."
"We had a crystal-clear agreement with Giscard d'Estaing and John Kerr."
"We signed the document describing the overall outcome in return for having the minority statement printed, so that EU citizens might be able freely to choose between the majority’s and the minority’s visions of Europe."
"I wish now to call upon the Council to ensure that the minority statement is printed together with the draft Constitution, and I am pleased to make our reader-friendly editions available to the Council free of charge."
"It is strange that we who are opposed to the draft Constitution are to pay for its publication so that it can also be read."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier has painted a bleak picture of the situation, expressing the Commission’s concern, shared by many, at the way the work is proceeding."
"He told us that it is not the Commission’s fault, it is certainly not the Italian Presidency’s fault, it is certainly not the fault of the Convention, still less the fault of Parliament."
"Well then, I would like to know whose fault it is."
"Is it Estonia’s fault?"
"Poland’s?"
"The fault of Mr Aznar, who would rather have the Nice method than that proposed by the Convention?"
"Commissioner Barnier, might it not be that we are all a little to blame for having approached this issue with so little drive that, of course, once the gates were opened, once it became possible to say that the Convention had got this or that wrong – starting with the Commission – everyone rushed to follow the Commission’s example with regard to a text which, in all probability, being the lowest common denominator, was certainly going to be in danger, once the gates had been opened, of everyone rushing to try and amend it for the worse?"
"The truth is that we missed our chance at Nice, we missed our chance at Amsterdam and, in my view, we missed our chance at Maastricht; we missed the chance – which Parliament had once demanded but then forgot about – to stress that we needed, first, to go deeper – do you remember the famous concept of going deeper before enlarging? – and today’s debate shows how far we are from achieving the intentions expressed at the start of the Italian Presidency, which Parliament was still expressing in September."
"I now wonder whether, given the way things are progressing, it might not be appropriate for the Italian Presidency to take stock of the situation properly."
"It is true that you have made a number of commitments, but one of them was to take the moratorium to the United Nations, whereas we were told yesterday that no such thing is going to happen."
"You undertook to round off the six months with the commitment on the Convention, but the Italian Presidency – Italy, a founder country – has a duty to itself, to its history."
"If it were to come to a watered-down text, in my opinion, the least that the Italian Presidency should do is avoid concluding with a hotpotch text, a text that would do more harm to the Union’s interests than failing to come to a conclusion."
"Since this is the way things are, since we do not have a worthy, powerful draft capable of withstanding great resistance, a federalist draft along the lines of that proposed to this House by Altiero Spinelli almost 20 years ago, since we do not have a powerful vision to inspire us, then it is no surprise that everyone is digging in their heels over minor issues."
"We Radicals are going to hold a convention on 13 and 14 November 2003 on this subject, in the hope that, on the basis of a reflection in which many can take part, both here and elsewhere, we might be able to achieve a position to the effect that Parliament can reject a text if the negotiations should really go very badly."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only look at the Intergovernmental Conference’s work so far with disquiet and concern."
"Imagine, a Convention that makes people smile – at any rate one that is not taken very seriously – manages, despite all political and geographical boundaries and the most disparate institutions from which it is drawn, to produce a convincing, well rounded draft constitution without having to take a vote on even one thing, and now we find that the Intergovernmental Conference tears that very same draft to shreds, unpicks it without giving the slightest hint about how it intends to reach a positive outcome."
"It is quite remarkable that none of the proposals discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference mark any step forward, but are all retrograde when compared with the Convention’s draft."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is in reverse gear."
"The Heads of State or Government are in the brakeman’s cab of the European Union."
"We are back in Nice again!"
"The most astonishing statement came in fact from the finance ministers."
"They simply want to ‘governmentalise’ this Parliament’s budgetary powers."
"They want to deny Parliament any part in budget decisions."
"To which school did they go to learn the basics of democracy?"
"Do they not know that parliamentarianism is the pillar of democracy and that Parliament’s budgetary powers are the pillar of parliamentarianism?"
"Not for the sake of its members’ powers, but for the sake of the democratic control that Parliament clearly must exercise."
"In making this proposal, the finance ministers are betraying a pre-democratic understanding of parliamentarianism."
"Incidentally, in this European Union the most costly favours have always been dispensed in ministerial meetings behind closed doors, not in this Parliament’s public budget debate."
"That is why Parliament must keep its budgetary powers."
"I want to set out just a few expectations that we have of the Intergovernmental Conference and address them to the Council Presidency, whose work up until now, which has certainly been very positive, we want to endorse."
"Firstly, we expect agreement to be reached by the end of this year."
"That is technically possible."
"There are not a vast number of articles to argue about, only a few key institutional issues."
"Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference must put Nice behind it."
"The Heads of State or Government who took this Union down the blind alley of Nice must now bring it out again."
"Thirdly, a balance must be achieved between sometimes small-minded but basically legitimate national interests and the well-being of the European Community; in other words the Heads of State or Government must not only seek the good of their Member States, but they must also have and demonstrate a sense of responsibility for the unification of Europe, because what the Council devised in Nice is not only indefensible in democratic terms, but incomprehensible by any rational person."
"A new Treaty must be easy to understand; that is the only way to achieve the transparency and proximity to the citizens for which we are striving."
"Mr President, this Parliament has warned time and time again against the danger of unravelling the Treaty by taking away one bit, then another, then another."
"We warned even the Commission against putting forward its quite reasonable proposals, on the grounds that if you start to undo one bit of the draft Constitution, then another bit will unravel and that will be the excuse for somebody else to come up with another proposal, and so on."
"At the last debate, we warned against the Spanish and Polish Governments’ proposal to revert to the Nice formula for voting in the Council quite a selfish proposal if I might say so."
"And now we see that things have gone a stage further, when a sectoral council suddenly wakes up after months of negotiations and discussions on these very subjects and after the Convention has finished and halfway through the IGC wants to wade in and rewrite the draft Constitution."
"And it wants to revert, not even to what is currently in the Treaty, but to something that is worse than the current Treaties as regards the powers of the European Parliament."
"Frankly, that is unacceptable."
"Furthermore, I would submit that the points they have raised are ones that in many cases have not even been flagged up by their own governments at the start of the IGC as issues on which they wished to have some discussion in that forum."
"They are new points, and therefore we have a problem in that our governments would appear - at least in some cases - to be divided on this issue."
"In those circumstances I would invite the presidency to resist the demands of this sectoral council."
"I would invite all colleagues in this House to engage, back home with their own governments, in the debates that are no doubt taking place as we speak on these subjects."
"I would encourage them to bring some sense to the positions of their own governments and to bring us back to the more sensible negotiating line that most governments at least those of the original six Member States and the United Kingdom seem to be taking at the beginning of the IGC, in allowing this draft Constitution go through intact, albeit with a few technical adjustments."
"That is what we should aim for."
"Mr President, neither the celebrations nor the word 'constitution' can conceal the anti-grass roots essence of the new Treaty, which adds yet another link to the chain binding the peoples post Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice."
"A new Treaty, which comes to safeguard the anti-grass roots, pro-monopoly, imperialist policy of the European Union, which redistributes power in favour of those who are already strong, which intensifies the inequalities between the Member States, which institutionalises neo-liberalism and subjugation to the market, which supplements repressive mechanisms and which promotes the militarisation of the European Union, to the point at which it adopts the doctrine of preventive military action on the pretext of terrorism."
"Any opposing views expounded at the Intergovernmental Conference are secondary, in that no one disputes militarisation or repression or the handover of sovereignty."
"The disagreements are confined to about how exactly to redistribute the power."
"The people do not need a European constitution."
"They hardly even need a European Union."
"We are certain that they will react both through referenda, where they are held, because the Greek people have never been asked, nor will they be asked now, and in their daily fight."
"Mr President, I share the opinion already expressed by many in this House."
"I have to say that during the Convention, in which I was proud to take part as an alternate member, I respected - though I did not always agree with - the positions taken by the United Kingdom Government representatives."
"They made their position clear, they sometimes took an unpopular stand, but on the whole they stood on a given ground and we reached a conclusion and compromises."
"Sometimes I would have liked them to have taken a different line, for example, a stronger line in relation to the unsatisfactorily readjusted sections on fisheries in parts I and III."
"As Mr Corbett bravely pointed out, although governments could have voiced reservations or come forward with different views on matters that were central to the discussion at the Convention, nothing was said."
"Both Mr Duff and Mr Méndez de Vigo made the point that these matters were extensively, not inadequately, discussed at the Convention."
"Now, suddenly, on the core issue of the budget, the ECOFIN Council and, I am afraid, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer with it, says that the Convention's entire proposal makes no sense and that a completely new order needs to be brought about."
"That, surely, is about the most unsatisfactory way of conducting things that can be imagined."
"I criticise the UK Government it is not the only government at fault but we should all be calling upon all governments involved to get their acts together and get this thing finished reasonably quickly and on the basis of the Convention."
"Mr President, we all agree that decision-making procedures within the EU institutions need to be streamlined to take account of the ten new countries which are joining the Union next May."
"We need to reform the way in which we take decisions in a broader European Community, but we also need to ensure that, in the context of putting in place a new European Union Treaty, vital national interests are protected."
"For example, from an Irish perspective, I have some concerns relating to a number of issues."
"First, the retention of effective national control over taxation policy is a matter to which the Irish Government and other European governments have consistently attached the highest importance."
"Negotiations which took place at the Nice Summit with regard to this issue guaranteed that unanimity was retained for decisions on all taxation questions at EU level."
"I believe that taxation issues are best controlled by national governments and local authorities as opposed to a centralised European Union."
"Second, while enhancing the effectiveness of the fight against cross-border crime, I am concerned at a proposal to extend qualified majority voting to issues relating to criminal law."
"I believe that this is an ineffective proposal because it does not take account of the different legal traditions in the various Member States."
"Third, in the area of security and defence, it is important that no new obligations are imposed on Ireland which threaten our traditional policy of military neutrality."
"The Irish Government and other EU governments must also retain discretion at a national level over the participation in any future military operations."
"And last but not least, I would strongly request that smaller Member States should retain the right to appoint one Member to the European Commission."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council began his speech just now by saying that the Convention’s proposals must not be weakened by the IGC, because they had been achieved by a democratic method."
"I do not know what kind of democracy that could be, because the Convention did not have a democratic mandate to draft a Constitution, it was not representative of the various shades of public opinion and, what is more, it did not hold any votes."
"It must be a new kind of democracy served up in a European sauce."
"In actual fact, the latest meetings of the IGC have shown that a certain number of national delegations are starting to ask themselves some legitimate questions."
"First of all, the extension of majority voting to cover essential matters such as border controls, taxation, financial perspectives, criminal law, services of general economic interest etc. ought not to be possible, or at least should only be possible in exchange for a safety net, for example a right of veto for each national democracy, exercised by its national parliament or by a referendum."
"I am talking here about a feasible right of veto, and not a disproportionate right, such as the right to secede, which is obviously not feasible in the day-to-day debates of the Union."
"Moreover, we cannot allow, as they stand, bridging clauses which make it possible to turn procedures requiring a unanimous decision into procedures requiring a majority decision without going through the process of an official revision, in other words without the need to ask for solemn ratification at national level."
"That sort of provision is tailor-made to encourage the introduction of a Europe governed by self-styled elites who grow fat on the backs of the nations."
"If these bridging clauses were to be adopted – and there are a great many of them in the draft Convention – then the next revision of the Treaties would probably be the last."
"After that the only thing that would be needed would be the opinion of the European Council, and not the opinion of the nations."
"That is definitely unacceptable."
"– Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference has not just been a forum for rubber-stamping the Convention, as was feared among governments at the start and was very much hoped for here in Parliament, and this IGC seems to have developed into a real IGC."
"It is nevertheless important that the Convention’s fundamental ideas are not discarded during the work of the IGC."
"What is most important about the IGC is how good the results are and not at all whether the timetable is adhered to."
"At present it is obvious that there are practical problems with the timetable."
"The IGC only has approximately five weeks more to go and things have not been moving along at the required pace."
"The issues on which consensus has been achieved are mainly inferior versions of the balanced proposals put forward by the Convention."
"I am referring here, for example, to the Legislative Council getting buried."
"The Convention’s proposal regarding the weighting of votes must be held on to."
"It is, to my mind, a fair compromise for both the big and the small countries."
"It is necessary to abandon the complicated system regarding the weighting of votes under the Treaty of Nice so that decision-making in the EU does not become immobilised."
"We have to remember that the Member States that are big in terms of their population were met halfway at the Convention with the agreement that a decision needed the backing of three fifths of the citizens of the EU."
"At the same time, however, there was a guarantee that the qualified minority needed to block decisions could not be achieved by a few big Member States, such as the Mediterranean bloc, by forming an alliance."
"It is imperative that the proposals by Spain and Poland to alter the balance of power between the governments of the Member States should be rejected."
"If a compromise over a Convention proposal has to made in some direction, this should be done by going in another direction, which is to say the 50-50 model, where half the Member States and half the population are needed for a decision to be supported."
"In the future it will probably come about that every Member State will be guaranteed its own Commissioner with voting rights."
"Horrifying images and theories about an overly large and stagnant Commission and idle Commissioners were greatly exaggerated."
"I am sure jobs and meaningful subject areas can be found for 25 Commissioners."
"Besides, organising work and tasks rationally and making possible a hierarchy of different ranks based on a rotating system organised fairly will have an effect on the practical way in which things get done, if that is required."
". Mr President, Mr Méndez de Vigo telephoned me last week to inform me of Ecofin’s proposals, and Mr Hänsch came to our committee on Monday of this week."
"On both occasions, I was absolutely dumbfounded as to what they told us."
"I cannot believe that the Council is taking on board the proposals from Ecofin in the budgetary area."
"As a Brit, I can say that, on the issue of own resources, I understand why it is doing this."
"Whether it is right is a different issue."
"On the other two issues of the financial perspectives and the budgetary procedure, it really is a step too far."
"To take such action would neuter this Parliament."
"There would be no need for a Budgets Committee if this were agreed at the IGC."
"Quite frankly, we would be castrated with a pair of rusty scissors."
"We do not need this type of so-called 'dominance' from the Council."
"Parliament has given a lot in trying to get an agreement at the Convention and the Council also claims that it has done the same."
"But the one thing we have given is the acceptance of the financial perspectives enshrined in the Treaty."
"Right now, if we break the Interinstitutional Agreement, we go back to the Treaty, which gives Parliament a lot more power and a lot more authority."
"We have sacrificed this in order to get an agreement, which is a more cooperative approach and would mean that we work together in cooperation."
"However, what we have here is not cooperation but coercion from the Council."
"This cannot be allowed to go ahead and every effort must be made to ensure that it is prevented."
"– Mr President, allow me to say first of all that, as a citizen of the Spanish State, I am utterly opposed to all the positions adopted by José María Aznar during the voting in the Council."
"Secondly, allow me to mention three concrete problems. Solving them would help improve the text of the draft Constitution, emphasising important aspects of the Union’s political, cultural and institutional nature, without altering the basic orientation of the Convention’s work."
"The first problem is the need explicitly to reinstate the actual circumstances of our peoples into the definition of the Union, defining it as a union of states, peoples and citizens."
"At the end of the draft text, the destiny and well-being of the peoples of Europe are mentioned as objectives of the European Union."
"The second problem is recognition in the Constitution of the existence within the Union of constitutional nationalities, federated states, and so on, with executive and legislative powers: state powers, in fact."
"The third problem is to affirm clearly and precisely that the Union is a social union."
"In any case, I hope that the Constitution of the Union will some day come to recognise the stateless nations of Europe, such as Galicia, Scotland and others, so that they are not forced to fight in order to lay claim to their own states, that being the only practical way for them to be represented as nations in the European Union."
"– Mr President, the draft constitution rightly contains the constitutionalisation of the Lisbon process, and it really was an achievement for this European Parliament to try and give the European Union a profile that combines economic reform, growth, full employment and social cohesion, and the draft treaty’s underlying values are also evidence of this objective."
"Regrettably, however, the instruments for achieving these objectives of the European Union are extremely weak."
"Coordination is mentioned, and rightly so, but precisely because ours is not only a monetary union but also an economic union and a political union, we have given far too little thought to the need to keep in mind not only the interdependence of national economies, but also the social circumstances of our citizens."
"I very much regret that we find very little in all these areas about how political decisions are to be given democratic legitimacy or that treats this as a priority."
"That itself is something of a failing in the Convention treaty."
"But when I hear that the finance ministers are calling on the Intergovernmental Conference to do even less than is contained in the draft, then that is a retrograde step that we in this House cannot allow."
"And there is something else we must not allow."
"As the European Parliament, we are quite willing to grant that Parliament does not need to have a say in every technological innovation in areas covered by the codecision procedure, and we are prepared to allow secondary legislation, but only on condition that in this Union committees of experts are not able to cover up and change everything behind closed doors, and for that reason the whole of Article 35 must also be included in the constitutional treaty as it comes out of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"That is also part of the democratisation of economic and monetary policy."
"Commissioner, permit me to put your comments in a context less formal than this one."
"You have told us that it is not necessary to ask the turkey to prepare for Christmas, and that is what we are in the process of verifying."
"The IGC has reached the limits of its powers."
"For this Parliament, the essential thing now is to preserve the balance that has been achieved within the Convention."
"I prefer the word ‘balance’ rather than ‘compromise’."
"It seems to me that if there is a Convention spirit, a European spirit reigning over this IGC, I would hope that it is that spirit which enables us to identify the listening phase that we are passing through now as being the phase that allows us to confirm the fact that, if we all pursue our individual arguments to their logical conclusion, our collective decision-making process will reach an impasse."
"If that is the case, and if this listening phase is simply there so that we can all pursue our arguments to their logical conclusion in order to confirm the fact that we are moving towards an impasse, then there is still some hope for us."
"On the other hand, I am afraid that, if we do not manage to take that step, we shall risk slipping backwards."
"You know that in my country the debate is becoming heated."
"In my party, some people have already decided to say yes, while others have already decided to say no, and some people prefer to wait and see."
"In the final analysis there could be a move away, not just from the text of the Convention, but also from the Treaty of Nice, as regards qualified majority voting, the powers of Parliament on budgetary matters or the introduction of a threshold of 66% of the population as the definition of a qualified majority."
"Quite frankly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what we want is for this IGC to concentrate on the issues that really are on the agenda, and those subjects, as Mr Napolitano has reminded us, are the subjects which the Convention has not dealt with, in other words the fourth part."
"On this point, I am very fearful of the status quo."
"There seems to be a certain degree of audacity, and it lies precisely in the balance of the proposed Convention. That audacity is to use the bridging clause as a revision clause."
"What I would suggest to both of you is that you should examine the option of inserting a third subparagraph into Article IV-7.3, which would be worded – at least in spirit, though the legal form would have to be confirmed – as follows, ‘The European Council, on its own initiative or at the request of the European Parliament, may decide unanimously to authorise the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the amendments to be made to the Treaty establishing the Constitution by a super-qualified majority and to make provision for its ratification under the same conditions’."
"– Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference is destroying the Convention’s success."
"That was almost to be expected because this method of national and sectoral egotisms is in fact something quite different from the work of the Convention, which has tried to find the European interest."
"It is now very striking that the governments are starting to attack the European Parliament and its rights."
"The loss of the legislative council is the loss of a partner for this Parliament in making legislation. Law making will be weakened as a result."
"The reduction in this Parliament’s budgetary powers is an attack on the very legitimacy of parliaments."
"Parliaments were created to exercise democratic control over public finances, and anyone who disputes those rights, the European Parliament’s budgetary rights, is attacking democracy in the European Union, and not only the European Parliament but all our colleagues in the national parliaments, too, should make a stand against that."
"The sectoral councils actually have no part to play in the Intergovernmental Conference, and the Ecofin Council’s attempt is directed not only against the Convention but also against the Thessaloniki summit."
"In Thessaloniki it was said that the heads and the foreign ministers negotiate, not the sectoral councils, and I can only call on the Italian Presidency to resist these attempts."
"They should not allow it and should really pay no more attention to the sectoral councils than they do to political proposals made by the legal services."
"Technical proposals, yes, but I see political proposals being made here, even in the area of defence policy, for example to throw out the mutual assistance clause, to throw out structured cooperation."
"That is all a change in the substance."
"The Convention created a good atmosphere."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is spreading a bad atmosphere and we can do without that in such an important year as 2004."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, only with a sense of irony or with a sense of humour – since, as Rabelais said that what distinguishes man is his capacity to laugh – can we talk about progress in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It would be more accurate to talk about steps backward than progress."
"Nevertheless, the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference to give the European Union a Constitution worthy of the name would certainly be a major disappointment for Europe’s citizens, who would clearly feel let down."
"In fact, the overwhelming majority of Europeans have accepted the idea of the Constitution because of its symbolic importance and because of its capacity to mobilise people."
"By way of example, a recent survey conducted in Portugal shows that 69% of the Portuguese people are in favour of the Constitution and only 9% are against and the view from other European countries is more or less the same."
"The Constitution is nevertheless within reach and can easily be approved by 5 December and signed in Rome, the Eternal City."
"All the Member States have to do is simply accept the project that came out of the Convention and give up on the damaging idea of rewriting it or of pulling it apart."
"Some States actually appear to want to be negative about Europe; countries that are obsessed with the fact that they are big or, conversely, that they are small."
"Some countries appear to demand only rights and make no mention of duties and others are more concerned about creating blocking minorities than working majorities."
"If this happens and if national self-interest prevails, what will be the fate of the European spirit and of the historical idealism associated with European integration?"
"This would sound their death-knell and would scupper them for good."
"I, like many European citizens, also wish to have a Constitution that is more federal, more socially minded, and which encompasses a genuine common foreign and defence policy. This Constitution must then be given legitimacy, as a constitutional text must be, by the citizens, by means of a referendum."
"I do, however, accept and support the current text, which represents enormous progress, in both form and content, and which heralds a new era of European constitutionalism."
"I therefore say ‘Long live the Constitution’!"
". Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the Members who have spoken for their valuable contribution to the process of drawing up the new Constitutional Treaty."
"It is quite clear that we who, as the Presidency in office, are presiding over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can only be helped in our task by these contributions, however critical."
"However, I would like to attempt to reassure you over what may appear to be a deadlock, to be problems between the IGC and the European Parliament."
"I am not trying to say that there are no problems – I highlighted some in my introductory speech - but we also have to realise that, in this phase of debate in the IGC, the countries are, of necessity, trying to stick to certain positions in the negotiations, not least for strategic reasons."
"Quite frankly, I believe that each one of us, and we have some small experience of negotiations, knows that this bargaining, typical of negotiations, means that positions can often appear to be far apart right up to the last moment."
"I am sure that even the esteemed Members of the European Parliament who are attending the IGC can confirm that everyone has expressed the intention in the IGC at least to succeed in finding a solution which observes the time frames laid down by the Thessaloniki European Council, allowing the new Constitutional Treaty to be signed before the forthcoming European Parliament elections, and they all want it genuinely not to be a watered-down solution."
"In this sense, I can confirm the Italian Presidency’s commitment to ensuring that situations do not actually develop which could ultimately lead to an unsatisfactory result."
"Moreover, in the democratic process which, although questionable – in the sense that many have called it into question – will be subject to scrutiny in that, as we all know, the end product of the Intergovernmental Conference will be assessed by the national parliaments, the European Parliament and, in some cases, even by the citizens in referendums, that will be the real, definitive assessment of the work of the IGC."
"Therefore, to predict failure at this stage, saying that no progress is being made and that things are essentially at a standstill, would be both inaccurate and, quite frankly, unhelpful."
"It would be inaccurate for the reasons I have just given: these are times of strategic manoeuvres which must be seen as such and could not, I feel, be seen any differently, for the simple reason that the idea is not to resolve one point at a time – for then we would be able to say at each stage: ‘This has been discussed and resolved’ – the idea is to realise that, when such a complex undertaking is embarked upon, we can only look at the overall picture, and therefore, at the end of the proceedings, we will be able to balance out the proposal we are going to make as Presidents-in-Office, which we hope will be accepted as widely as possible and to the greatest possible extent."
"I would still, very briefly, like to focus on a number of points, those which have received most attention, for I do not have time to respond to everyone, of course."
"As regards the Legislative Council, which was one of the issues most frequently raised by the speakers, as Presidents-in-Office, at the request of the European Parliament, with the commitment given by Mr Frattini, as Mr Napolitano pointed out, at the hearing of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we brought it to the attention of the initial meeting in Rome on 4 October, and then proposed it again at the last IGC meeting of Foreign Ministers despite the fact that we had identified clear, widespread political opposition."
"We were not rewarded by success, but we have kept the debate open on this matter, considering that the work of the Convention, on the one hand, and the demands of the European Parliament, on the other, are sufficient for the issue to be given a place in the final proposal."
"It is a commitment which Mr Frattini made at the very end of the proceedings of the last Intergovernmental Conference meeting."
"As regards the procedures for revising the Constitutional Treaty – a point which was not addressed by the Convention – those taking part in the IGC are quite aware that the Italian Presidency has proposed to open a debate on this issue too, that, in this case too, there are times when conducting the work is a difficult task, as regards both form – because the item was not originally on the agenda – and content, for an in-depth analysis has been launched which is of no mean importance: it opens a debate on whether what we are working on is genuinely a Constitution."
"Some countries have started to say that, if it is a Constitution, then that is a completely different question and that they have never given anyone a mandate to discuss a Constitution."
"You understand, therefore, that all this is not exactly the simplest of processes to manage, but Mr Frattini, who is presiding over the work of the IGC, has kept the debate on this issue open too, saying that he hopes there can be a reflection on the matter across the board in an attempt to understand that the more effective the process we use to find a solution, the easier it will be to amend the agreements signed when the time comes."
"We have undertaken to return to this matter too."
"Lastly, as regards the matter you have said may be a priority, which is certainly extremely important, the Ecofin contribution, I can only reiterate what Mr Frattini said, to the effect that the Italian Presidency does not accept any kind of proposal made by any Council configuration, not even Ecofin."
"It does not accept such proposals because they are unacceptable in substance, and I therefore support all the Members who have agreed that they are unacceptable on the basis that we have fully espoused this principle."
"In this regard, of course, if, as happened in the context of the Convention’s proceedings, someone proposes points which are also mentioned in the press as having been discussed by Ecofin, we are under obligation to address them and discuss them."
"However, I can assure you that, as far as the Italian Presidency is concerned, it is our express intention to safeguard the rights of parliaments, and not just the European Parliament but parliaments in general."
"We are talking about the new Constitution or Constitutional Treaty – call it what you will but that is the spirit in which we are presiding over the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference – and it is quite clear that, if the part played by the European Parliament and the national parliaments is lacking or even just diminished, not only would we be doing a disservice to the future Constitutional Treaty but we would also be doing a disservice to the citizens of Europe."
"Therefore, on this, I feel I can commit the Italian Presidency to endeavouring to safeguard rights which we believe must be upheld at all costs, while taking into account the wishes of others at the same time."
"That concludes the debate."
"The next item is the report (A5-0312/2003) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning Community cooperation with Asian and Latin American countries and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2258/96 (COM(2002) 340 – C5-0368/2002 – 2002/0139(COD))."
". – There are certain parts of the world where the fact that this House is a co-legislator is sometimes forgotten."
"The current ALA Regulation was adopted ten years ago as a regulation for the Asian and Latin American countries."
"Since then, although Parliament has expressly requested two separate regulations for two very different regions, the Commission has yet again tabled one proposal by means of which it wants to update the existing regulation and intends, at the same, to incorporate the regulation on aid to uprooted populations, which will lapse at the end of next year."
"Anyone would think that this parliamentary resolution had never existed."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore proposes, via amendments, to split the regulation into two separate regulations, and, as rapporteur, I set great store by passing on to you its message."
"Needless to say, although there will have to be extensive consultation with the Council on this matter, it is clear to everyone that a distinction must be drawn."
"I should now like to focus on content."
"The Commission wants a 'lightweight legislative framework' for its actions in the area of development cooperation in both regions."
"As it happens, it has become a very lightweight framework indeed."
"As the Millennium Development Goals, in fact, stated, the key goal of development cooperation is the fight against poverty and its ultimate eradication."
"I fail to find this spelled out clearly in the Commission proposal, and nor does it contain other objectives, such as education, health care, environment and democratisation."
"My first point, therefore, is that 35% of expenditure should be set aside for social infrastructure, something we have included in the budget on a regular basis since 2001."
"At least 20% of this should be spent on basic health care and basic education, for these Millennium Goals have had a very raw deal to date."
"Secondly, education, in particular, is a very important instrument in the fight against poverty."
"Everyone is entitled to it and must have access to all forms of education, irrespective of their origin, gender or age."
"A disproportionately large number of the poor in developing countries are women, but they are often the very people who are denied this right."
"They are the water carriers."
"I would therefore emphatically call for gender mainstreaming, and even for extra attention for women and girls, not only in education and health care, but also in social, economic and especially political spheres."
"As full members of society, they should be able to play a part in the way it functions."
"Another important point is participation."
"The abortive negotiations of the WTO in Cancún clearly underlined once again that the developing countries demand full participation."
"They do not have it, either at governmental level, or at the levels below."
"It is therefore of crucial importance that all interested parties be consulted when the strategic documents, the annual indicative programmes and the annual action plans for development cooperation are drafted."
"By this I mean not only the government bodies at national, regional and local level, but also the members of parliament in those countries, the NGOs, the private sector and also all other actors involved in civil society."
"They know their own requirements like no other and can therefore give a clear indication of what is needed."
"This was also a key request made to us by people in the field."
"Only in this way can a form of ownership be established of the different areas of policy and actions in development cooperation for people at every level."
"It is important that this House should be, both now and in the future, involved as co-legislator in European development policy."
"The Commission must therefore put before Parliament the strategic documents to which I have referred."
"It seems obvious to me that, in this context, not only should a description be given of the sectoral and inter-sectoral priorities, as well as the specific objectives, but also of the expected results on the basis of adequate performance indicators."
"As a Dutchwoman and a Liberal, I attach great value to the useful and effective spending of taxpayers' money."
"This can only be verified if clear objectives and performance indicators are established."
"Finally, I should like to underline here once again that the European Union's cooperation with Asia and Latin America requires a modern legislative framework, in which both the fight against poverty and that against inequality have their own dynamism."
"I should like to warmly thank my fellow MEPs for their cooperation."
"We have had excellent discussions, and, while these have not always led to agreement, I think that the discussion on this subject should be regarded as of exceptionally great value in the light of our common goal."
". Mr President, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on cooperation with the countries of Asia and Latin America."
"The duration is for an indefinite period, although the Financial Framework is defined for the period 2003-2006."
"This proposal provides for a general increase in cooperation with these regions and emphasises common rules and procedures to be followed, such as implementing procedures and decision-making processes."
"This is a text that gives the Commission a high degree of flexibility because it does not contain political or operational guidelines."
"As regards available funds, the Commission suggests a financial framework for 2003 to 2006, which would be divided up at a ratio of 60% for Asia and 40% for Latin America, totalling EUR 3.793 billion."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I tabled some amendments that I believe are crucial."
"Despite the fact that the budget’s heading IV ‘External and Development Policy’ faces great financial constraint, I believe that the sums put forward by the Commission are compatible with the financial limit."
"I nevertheless made a point of insisting on the necessary improvement in implementing cooperation, specifically in translating the promised appropriations into actual payments for these regions. For these two regions, the problem of outstanding commitments (RAL) stands at EUR 3.45 billion."
"I also proposed rounding up the total amount to EUR 3.8 billion in order to take account of the fact that the 2003 budget was in the meantime adopted at a level higher than that proposed by the Commission."
"Lastly, I suggested that, from the budgetary point of view, it would be preferable not to introduce sub-limits for the two regions, which limits flexibility. Instead, the regulation should have an overall financial framework."
"It is, therefore, crucial that the European Union contributes to eradicating poverty, to promoting sustainable development and to ensuring respect for human rights, minority rights and the rights of indigenous people, and contributes to democracy, good governance and to combating inequalities."
"I also wish to state that the Committee on Budgets voted in favour of setting up a solidarity fund for this region, which I believe will prove to be an extremely positive initiative."
"Mr President, the rules which regulate cooperation between the Union and the countries of Asia and Latin America date from ten years ago."
"In ten years, there have been certain changes in the world."
"In Asia, certain countries have made progress in terms of consolidating their democracies and their development has been given momentum."
"Unfortunately, in other Asian countries, the situation has deteriorated in all areas of political, economic and social activity."
"In Latin America, following a decade of democratic progress, the 1980s, and another decade of economic reforms, the societies of all countries, with certain notable exceptions, are experiencing a profound economic and social crisis."
"In both regions the fight against poverty has not only failed to achieve any notable success, but rather, on the contrary, in Bangladesh and in Haiti, in Afghanistan and in Bolivia, poverty is engulfing more and more social groups."
"In some cities now tragically renowned for their precariousness, such as Calcutta, there is no room for optimism, but in others, such as in Tucumán, in Argentina no less, poverty and hunger chronic hunger amongst children are things we have never seen until now."
"We therefore believe to be timely, and we welcome, the proposal the Commission is making with this Regulation, which amends and updates those which have been in force up until now."
"This Parliament, in paragraph 61 of its resolution of 15 November 2001, declared itself in favour of a separation of the Commission’s initial proposal, one applicable to Asia and another to Latin America."
"This our only objection to the proposal we are debating today, which is no small objective certainly, but I would like to stress that in terms of the fundamentals of the issue we support the Commission’s proposal."
"We agree with the objectives which take up our commitment to the fight to eradicate poverty, not only in terms of the financing and co-financing of projects to promote development, but prioritising education, health and strengthening civil society in order to strengthen democracy, transparency and good governance, without which democracy will not be strengthened and the desired development will not achieve its objectives."
"We agree with the financial framework, with the increasingly prominent role given to the countries receiving our cooperation, as well as the steps being taken in the process of decoupling aid in the manner intended by recently approved directives."
"All of this is what we wish to achieve through our amendments."
"We disagree on a formal question which we cannot abandon out of coherence with our philosophy and our view of a European policy for such priority areas as Asia and Latin America."
"It is not a question of political prestige, Mr Patten, nor of prioritising one region over another, as one of our fellow Members has said during this sitting."
"Throughout these long months of parliamentary negotiation we have held talks with numerous governments involved, with their ambassadors here in Brussels, and with many, many NGOs which work both in Asia and Latin America."
"All of them, I repeat, all of them, without exception, without a single exception, have said that they prefer two regulations: one for Asia and another for Latin America."
"If we say, and the Commission also says, that we want to adopt the principle of co-participation in our cooperation from the moment programmes are established and not just in the management and implementation phase of a project, it does not appear coherent now to do the opposite."
"Today, tomorrow with the vote, a codecision procedure can begin in which Parliament does not wish to, and cannot, renounce its prerogatives and in which we believe there is margin for negotiation with the Council."
"I will end by congratulating the rapporteur, my colleague and friend Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, who has worked very well, who has tried everything, who has done so very well and I thank you, Mr Patten, for your willingness to hold the dialogue in which I hope we will be able to continue to make progress in the coming months."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when in 1988 the European Parliament, acting as a budgetary authority, managed to have the funds intended for cooperation with Latin American and Asia allocated to separate budget lines, a decisive step was taken in the regionalisation of Community external relations; an approach which has been consolidated as the one most in line with the idea of functionality and specificity which governs Community policy and as the most effective in terms of development."
"Now, in accordance with its legislative competences, it falls to this Parliament to gives its opinion on the modification of the ALA Regulation which covers cooperation with both regions jointly."
"In accordance with this approach, an example of which is Parliament's unanimous vote for the Salafranca report on a global partnership with Latin America, in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and in the delegations for Central America and Mercosur, we have given our support by a huge majority in favour of the existence of two differentiated regulations: one for Asia and another for Latin America."
"Tomorrow there will be a vote which is as historic and significant to both regions and Europe as the one which led to the division of the budget lines."
"The Socialist Group supports the existence of two differentiated regulations out of coherence with a long journey which is now culminating; because we believe that Latin America and Asia deserve to be treated at least equally with the other developing regions and, in this regard, both political representatives and representatives of civil society of the two regions have demonstrated to us their desire for their own regulations and programmes; because we are convinced that the benefits for the populations of both regions, the ultimate objective of the regulations, will be much greater than the administrative difficulties the Commission is afraid of at the end of the day, these difficulties will be limited to a healthy division into two of the current ALA Committee and a reallocation of staff; and finally, because we profoundly respect our own legislative capacity."
"The political message we are sending to the populations of Asia and Latin America by means of these two regulations is particularly encouraging at this time of enlargement, of European expansion towards the East and of reduction of cooperation funds in order to deal with other situations, which are perhaps more urgent but no more necessary."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to point out that the amendments to the content of the regulations, on which I warmly congratulate Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and the secretariat of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, will considerably improve the quality of our contribution to the fight against poverty and will consolidate the political messages sent in regions between the European Union and Latin America and the importance of strengthening the European Union's actions on the continent of Asia."
"Mr President, the revision of this regulation has given us plenty to think about."
"First of all, we had the proposed cooperation agreement which, it has to be said, looked more like a free-trade agreement than a development programme."
"That did not surprise us unduly, because it formed part of the current European policy which is leading to a change in the thinking behind the Community’s development policy."
"Within that regulation, however, we succeeded in reinserting sustainable development, accompanied by social and environmental objectives."
"In particular, 10% of the budget for this programme is to be allocated to the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, and 35% to social and health infrastructures."
"Human rights, and especially women’s rights, the rights of minorities and of indigenous peoples and the removal of inequalities are also the guiding principles of European cooperation policy in these regions."
"Finally, we have ensured that civil society will participate in the definition of the multi-annual development plans."
"Reducing poverty will therefore have to be the first goal of the national programmes which will be negotiated between each country and the Commission."
"Since Parliament will not be consulted, it was necessary to insert some guidelines at an early stage, and that is what we did in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I beg you, ladies and gentlemen, not to call into question, for institutional reasons, a text which has finally been given a political content."
"Why ask for two regulations, one for Asia and the other for Latin America, rather than a single regulation divided into several chapters?"
"We would do better to campaign for an overall increase in aid rather than wanting to know which continent will get most."
"As far as I am concerned, it is irrelevant whether the money is allocated to Asia or to Latin America, provided that it goes to the poorest people."
"It is for that reason that we want to have parliamentary control."
"Unfortunately we have used up a great deal of energy and wasted a great deal of time on a dispute which seems to me to be trivial, given the size of the challenges we have to meet in Asia and in Latin America."
"I believe that the essential thing is to fight for the content of these regulations, the content of these chapters, the content that we are giving them today, because that is what the people of both Asia and Latin America expect of us today."
"– Although I applaud the way in which the rapporteur has clarified the goal of the regulation for Asia and Latin America, the question concerning the fight against poverty is this: where is the added value compared to national development cooperation?"
"In the fight against poverty, there is the risk of Member States duplicating their efforts."
"The regulation's purpose could therefore be indicated more clearly."
"In terms of developing trading capacity, the complementary aspect is clear."
"It is complementary to development cooperation and related to European trade policy."
"Secondly, the Biregional Solidarity Fund proposed in the report is undesirable."
"A fund must have well-defined objectives."
"Solidarity suggests a sense of involvement among people that takes shape within social contexts, close to the citizen and based on an internal conscience: think of the charity taught by Christ."
"However, in an inter-continental context, this charitableness finds expression via specific policy actions and co-financing organisations."
"A solidarity fund is not appropriate here."
"I would, by the way, thank the rapporteur, my compatriot, for her efforts for a good cause."
"Mr President, I believe that Commissioner Patten is aware of the commitment and support I have always tried to bring into my actions in favour of the Commission."
"I am not one of those Members who believe that the Commission is a gathering of stateless bureaucrats, but quite the contrary, I believe it is a key institution in the project of European construction."
"The Commission is also aware, however, that that support and that commitment cannot be seen as a blank cheque."
"Parliament has the right to its opinion, and I believe that it would not be a Parliament worthy of that name if it did not exercise, responsibly of course, its competences, democratically controlling the Commission, investing it and acting as a Parliament which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and rectifies."
"That is precisely the exercise we are involved in at the moment, an exercise in which Parliament carries out its duties confidently within the framework of the competences attributed to it by the Treaties and, above all, in a field in which we are acting in accordance with the principle of codecision."
"It is difficult, Mr President, to think of a report on which there has been greater consensus in this House, a consensus which is expressed through a proposal which calls for one regulation for Asia and another for Latin America, in the belief that the specific characteristics of these two regions would be better addressed by means of a separate regulation for each one."
"As Mrs Sauquillo said, in order to be coherent with the existing budgetary requirements and also in order to give Latin America and Asia the same treatment as other regions and, therefore, to prevent any form of discrimination."
"I have said that there has been a consensus which will be difficult to reproduce in this Parliament, because this opinion has been issued by the plenum of Parliament, it has been issued by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it has been issued by the competent delegations and it has been issued, in the same way, by the committee responsible, which is the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and not by a tight margin, but by 26 in favour and two abstentions, one of them by the rapporteur."
"I would like to say that the other aspect which the rapporteur’s group calls into question – by means of the amendments – is the creation of a bi-regional solidarity fund."
"And it is surprising, Mr President, because it is an initiative which has already been endorsed in plenary by all the political groups, including the rapporteur's group; an initiative, Mr President, which has been endorsed from a regulatory point of view, which does not imply any additional money, which has been approved by the Committee on Budgets in the 2004 budget, which is an initiative which falls within the context of the priorities of the next European Union-Latin America summit, to be held in Mexico next year, for which we have no great proposals to put on the table."
"Above all, Mr President, it is surprising because it is an initiative which is intended to prevent the progress that has been made in the fields of co-existence and democratisation being jeopardised as a result of social fragility, as the case of Bolivia recently demonstrated."
"What is most surprising, Mr President, is that one of the arguments used and which is used as an authority to reject this proposal is the position of the Council of Ministers, as if the European Commission had to respond to the Council of Ministers and take its positions more seriously than those of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, we are dealing with a very significant case in which this Parliament is gambling some of its credibility, some of its prestige and some of its reputation as an institution."
"Therefore, Commissioner, if the House ratifies the proposal as approved by the Committee on Development, I would urge the Commission to accept it, not as a demonstration of high-handedness, but as a demonstration of coherence, nor as a way of undermining the Commission’s authority, but simply in the normal exercise of the competences attributed to this Parliament in accordance with the institutional balance laid down in the Treaties."
"– Mr President, I would like to add my voice to the many congratulations addressed to the rapporteur."
"She has presented a very good and a very clear report today."
"I think the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation shapes the content of the regulation – or, as we would all prefer, regulations – better."
"Mrs Sanders-ten Holte’s report clearly shows that the issue is not simply to incorporate trade into the development strategies for future cooperation with these two parts of the world, but that it must be clearly stated that the aim is to combat extreme poverty and if we are serious about these development strategies we must include civil society in the countries concerned."
"The measures called for by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, whatever distinction is drawn as regards whether they are intended for Asia or Latin America, make it quite clear that it is necessary to have two regulations here in the future."
"You do not have to be an expert on the countries listed in the Annexes, which will benefit from these regulations or the projects that are supported, to see the enormous, the tremendous differences between the two regions and therefore the need for two regulations."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who has actually always shared this opinion, for taking such a clear stance here."
"From my experience in other areas and other negotiations with the Commission, I believe that if we get a convincing majority for two regulations here in Parliament tomorrow, that will be a good starting point for negotiations with the Commission and the Commission will move on this important question."
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to say that I think there are a number of good points about the Commission’s proposal."
"At the same time, I want to emphasise that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has done a very good job."
"Under her leadership, we have been able, during the committee reading, to agree upon a number of additions and changes that make the legislation both more focused and concentrated more upon poverty issues."
"I am especially pleased about the target of approximately ten per cent for efforts within the environmental area."
"Environmental issues are all too often hidden away in development work."
"We have a long list of problems, especially in Asia, that have to be tackled when it comes both to pollution and to safeguarding basic natural resources."
"A majority of the poor in rural areas are in actual fact more dependent upon what we might call the ‘gross biomass product’, that is to say what is produced by nature, than upon the ‘gross domestic product’,that is to say what is produced by the economy."
"We then have the controversy as to whether there should be one or two regulations for Asia and Latin America."
"I am conscious of the fact that Parliament wanted two regulations, but I think that the Commission has very strong arguments in favour of its proposal."
"In recent years, a number of measures have been implemented to make the organisation of development cooperation more efficient, and it would be strange if we were now to complicate this with two regulations and, as it were, to obstruct the simplification of the procedures otherwise under way."
"I think Mrs Sanders-ten Holte had an excellent proposal for a regulation divided into two separate chapters."
"I am not convinced by the argument that the countries are, apparently, so different."
"We have a single framework for ACP cooperation, and it operates quite admirably."
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra may talk about his 26 votes in favour compared with zero votes against but, if he were to listen in the corridors, he would hear that a very great many of his fellow MEPs are now deeply concerned about our getting into a conflict over this."
"I should therefore like to urge my fellow MEPs, irrespective of what is said by the leaders of the political groups, to vote against the amendments aimed at our having two different regulations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission and, again, the rapporteur for the excellent and often very difficult task that she has undertaken."
"I believe that it has to be the task of this Parliament to be in favour of simpler rules and procedures and also to ensure that we have an understanding of the need for timely and effective decision-making in programming."
"That has to be at the heart of the whole reform process that we keep challenging and asking for."
"And yet, in this debate, we hear over and over again calls for us to complicate and make more difficult the procedures, programmes and issues the Commission has to deal with."
"In addition, as far as I am concerned, it makes absolutely no sense, when we are dealing with a technical and legal regulation, to be suggesting that it should be doing the work of country strategy papers in the countries that we work with or the work of the national indicative programmes that we work with."
"That, again, is a total contradiction of what a regulation that has a financial and a legal basis is meant to be doing."
"In my opinion, to create two separate regulations simply does not make sense and would undermine the efforts that we are making to streamline and clarify our programmes."
"Mr Salafranca talked about credibility, and our credibility as a Parliament is at stake here if we do not understand the issues that we are dealing with."
"Our strategy has to be to work well with Latin America and with Asia and apply the same principles which are at the heart of our development programme."
"There is no justification either for any argument in favour of transferring funds from Asia to Latin America, especially when we know about the desperate poverty of 800 million people in Asia."
"The Commission's communication on development policy in 2000 called for us to refocus on poverty eradication."
"Therefore, it is totally inappropriate for us now, in 2003, to call for a regulation which will just separate two parts which work very well together and we will duplicate, replicate and complicate our efforts to eradicate poverty."
"I urge Parliament to be realistic and constructive so that our essential work in both these regions can continue and can grow."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my Spanish colleagues of all political persuasions on their enthusiasm for the subjects of their former colonies."
"However, I wish my country would sometimes stand up for its national interests in the way my Spanish colleagues seem to, irrespective of politics."
"Having said that, we heard Mr Rod ask why we should not have two regulations so that we can send the money where the poor are."
"Well, they are in Asia. And there are 800 million of them."
"If the two regulations are supposed to send the money where the poor are, why are we sending EUR 247 million from Asia to Latin America?"
"I know that the European Parliament is famous for standing on its head but it is an extraordinary example of how we have done so again."
"We need simple legislation that we can understand, that our voters can understand, so that we can connect with our electorate."
"Creating two duplicate regulations, going through the entire process, the enormous amount of bureaucracy and, at the same time asking the Commission to simplify its procedures, to decentralise and so on, is such a contradiction. Why are we even considering this?"
"Forgive me for saying this, but are we considering this to be nice to the Spanish?"
"I have to say that I am very nice to the Spanish most of the time but on this occasion I shall not be."
". Mr President, the Commission proposal, as the House knows, aims at replacing the current Asia and Latin America Regulation with a new, simple and modern legal framework, consistent with the principles underpinning the reform of external aid."
"This has already been done for other regions."
"It is now time for our partner countries in Asia and Latin America to benefit from the advantages of this reform."
"From the beginning, it has been clear that some misgivings were developing in Parliament with regard to the premise and to the very nature of the new regulation."
"I have spent more time discussing those misgivings and this piece of legislation than any other for which I have been responsible since I have been a Commissioner."
"I do not think I have had more meetings, more discussions in the Commission or more conversations in Parliament."
"I very much respect those of my interlocutors who have not agreed with me."
"The honourable gentleman Mr Salafranca knows a huge amount about the subject, but my sympathies and my intellect on this occasion are with some of those who spoke in the later stages of the debate, who also know a huge amount about development assistance: the honourable lady Mrs Kinnock, the honourable gentleman Mr Whitehead, and the honourable gentleman and my honourable friend, Mr Deva."
"Let me just touch on some of the principal arguments."
"First, there has been a strong call in certain quarters of this House for two regulations instead of one."
"Second, as the many amendments which have been tabled illustrate, there is also a strong wish for a more detailed regulation."
"I should like to respond to both these issues, and to reiterate the Commission’s position on the form of the regulation."
"The Commission attaches great importance to having a and a regulation."
"Why a simple regulation?"
"So as to comply with the basic principles of the reform of external assistance, which requires flexibility in order to adapt cooperation to the specific needs of our partners by means of country strategy papers."
"That is the policy which Parliament has enthusiastically endorsed."
"Why a single regulation?"
"So as to avoid the proliferation of legal instruments and the multiplication of procedures and committees; in short, to be more effective."
"Also, to comply with the Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking which calls for simplifying and reducing the volume of legislation."
"I have yet to hear a single argument as to why the rules and the objectives being the same for both regions two separate regulations would be better than one."
"As I have said on a number of occasions, I find it difficult to believe that if we were to follow the views of some in this Parliament and support two regulations, there would be dancing in the streets in La Paz or dancing in the streets even around the Latin American embassies in Brussels."
"References to other regions with their ‘own’ regulation Tacis and CARDS, for example are, in my judgment, hardly convincing, since the objectives of these regulations are not those of development policy as set out in Article 177 of the Treaty and which apply equally to Asia and Latin America."
"Nor do the differences between the two regions justify two regulations, as the similarity, and even uniformity, of the amendments proposed for each region tend to prove."
"But let us now turn to the substance of the amendments, and to the four most important issues on which, in my view, our further discussions should focus."
"First, there is the overall objective of poverty reduction and eradication."
"Some of the amendments aim at stressing poverty alleviation and eradication as an overriding objective."
"I could not agree more."
"However, there must also be room for the broad support for overall Community relations with Asia and Latin America, including support for capacity-building to help our partners in their fight against terrorism, illegal migration, trafficking in human beings and international crime."
"Second, a subject which has been touched on in, for example, technical terms by my honourable friend, Mr Deva: the question of allocation of financial resources between Latin America and Asia The Commission proposal seeks to respect, for the period 2000-2006, the broad 60/40 balance of appropriations for Asia and Latin America which has prevailed during the previous financial perspectives."
"This balance was slightly disrupted by events in Afghanistan and international pledges made there by the European Union."
"However, it must be borne in mind that Asia still has by far the largest amount of poverty in the world - around 800 million people, or about two thirds of the world’s poor, live on less than one dollar a day."
"It is also important to bear in mind that assistance from the Community budget per capita in Asia amounts to EUR 0.15, compared to EUR 0.45 for Latin America."
"On this basis, I would find shifting resources from Asia to Latin America hard to defend."
"Of course, if the budgetary authority was to give us more money for external assistance for Asia and Latin America, I would be delighted to propose to Parliament ways of spending it, but I do not think that Christmas is going to come early this year."
"Third, there is the question of a Solidarity Fund for Latin America."
"Supporting sectoral programmes linked to health, education and poverty alleviation in Latin America’s poorest countries and regions could be achieved by means of the programming and implementation instruments which we have at our disposal."
"Setting up a fund, seeking the participation of other financial institutions and agreeing on the rules governing the fund and its management would not only be wasteful but would also be a complicated and cumbersome process."
"The Commission does not have the human resources for this task."
"Fourth, and finally, is the question of sectoral targets and benchmarks."
"Parliament proposes to introduce a number of sectoral targets in the regulation: 35% for social infrastructure and, within this figure, 20% for basic education and health; another 10% for the environment and up to 15% for Civil Society."
"All this adds up to nearly 60% of appropriations which would be 'pre-programmed'."
"As members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation know, the current agreement on a benchmark of 35% for social infrastructure was reached two years ago after long discussions, in which I myself took part, between representatives of the Commission and the Development Committee."
"I do not intend to re-open those discussions, and indeed it is the Commission’s intention to remain absolutely faithful to that agreement."
"However, I would like to stress that it will not be in line with this agreement to add new conditions, in particular the 20% for basic education."
"Furthermore, this contradicts the principle of country ownership and the very essence of the reform which entails that programming cannot be pre-defined by means of a regulation."
"The problem – at least that of the proposed 35% for social infrastructure is rather theoretical, since in current country strategy papers for Asia and Latin America, 50% and 46% respectively have already been earmarked for social infrastructure."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank very warmly the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for her very valiant efforts to bridge gaps."
"She has made a really wonderful effort, and there must have been times when she wished she had been reporting on a different regulation."
"I would like to invite Parliament to support the Commission proposals."
"Informal discussions with the Council I just throw this in for information have shown firm support for the Commission proposal, and a great willingness to move ahead along those lines."
"Above all, the interests of populations in need in Asia and Latin America should encourage us to do our utmost for the speedy adoption of a high-quality new legal framework for cooperation."
"Mr President, I have requested the floor as a result of personal comments in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I wanted to refer to the comment made by Mr Wijkman with regard to the votes by means of which the Committee on Development and Cooperation’s proposal was approved, which were 26 in favour and 2 abstentions."
"Mr Wijkman has not questioned these results, but has referred to the opinion in the corridors probably being different."
"I would like to say, Mr President, that I have the greatest respect for everybody’s opinions, but that in a democracy it is votes that count."
"With regard to the Commissioner, who has also referred to this humble Member of Parliament and who has said that he has heard no argument to convince him of the need for two regulations, I would like to say to MrPatten who is a good friend of mine that I believe that he has not properly understood the position here."
"I believe it is not the Commission who has to be convinced of the validity of the arguments, but Parliament, because, Commissioner, I would remind you that it is the Commission that answers politically to this Parliament, and not Parliament to the Commission, and that we are involved in a codecision procedure in which it is assumed that Parliament has something to say."
"Mr President, I was extremely distressed by what Mr Deva said, since he insinuated that we were not fighting to eradicate poverty, but that we Spaniards had other kinds of interest."
"The truth is that I felt bad, and I would also feel bad if I did not say this here, since we are working together with the Committee on Development to eradicate poverty: to eradicate poverty in Asia and in Latin America."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate:"
"- on the report (A5-0358/2003) by Mrs Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of youth (COM(2003) 272 C5-0257/2003 2003/0113(COD))."
"- on the report (A5-0357/2003) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level and support for specific activities in the field of education and training (COM(2003) 273 C5-0255/2003 2003/0114(COD))."
"- on the report (A5-0359/2003) by Mrs Iivari, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture (COM(2003) 275 C5-0262/2003 2003/0115(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2002 the three European institutions worked together in order to draw up a new financial regulation, and this now gives us a clear framework for the subsidies by means of which we support a large number of excellent European organisations in the fields of culture, youth and education."
"From now on, any funding decision will have to derive its justification from a legal base."
"This obligation is imposed, in particular, on those subsidies which, up to now, have been financed from headings which, because of their position in the budgetary nomenclature, tended to be treated as administrative expenditure and so could be paid without a legal base."
"The changes in budgetary nomenclature introduced by the new financial regulation mean that such subsidies can no longer be treated as administrative expenditure and so the subsidies in question require a legal base."
"It was this new obligation which led the Commission, in the spring of this year, to submit seven proposals for new legal bases."
"Those seven proposals, covering seven different areas, were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer setting out the common context which justified their presentation and the essential elements used to ensure a similar response, between one proposal and another, to the common problems facing these sectors of activity."
"Mr President, today’s vote is concerned with three of those seven legal bases."
"They need to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, particularly since the texts in question are being adopted by the codecision procedure."
"I am grateful to Mr Rocard for having realised just how urgent they are and for ensuring that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which he chairs, was able to examine the Commission’s proposals rapidly."
"The switch from one budgetary approach to another may, however, cause serious financial difficulties, the consequences of which could prove to be drastic for the Europe of culture, youth and education if the joint legislators do not reach an agreement as soon as possible."
"The proposals which the Commission has submitted to you are aimed at ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted transition from the old system to the new one, and we have tried very hard to draft texts which broadly reproduce the 2003 detailed implementing rules, with the aim of ensuring that essential continuity and losing none of the advantages to be gained, in terms of the proper management of public funds by taking this new financial regulation into account."
"From this point of view, the proposed legal bases should be perceived as a technical adjustment, though there is a strong temptation to take this opportunity to embellish them with innovations and improvements."
"In this case, however, the best is the enemy of the good, especially if those additions compromise the whole thing in the eyes of the Council."
"With this in mind, the Commission’s proposals are soberly worded, with the essential objective of preserving the , while giving it a legal structure which complies with the new financial regulation."
"I should like to ask you not to move too far away from the Commission’s proposals and to do everything to ensure that these legal bases can be adopted as quickly as possible."
"In the case of the ‘culture’ legal base, there is even less scope for flexibility, because the Council has to take a unanimous decision, but we must retain some flexibility, not only on culture, but also on youth and on education, because it has to be said that these three areas are essential to the development of Europe."
"All possible means of reaching a compromise must be explored if they could enable us to bring these procedures to a speedy conclusion."
"With effect from 1 January 2004, in fact, if there are no legal bases, it will quite simply become impossible for us to give our financial support to all those bodies which contribute to the creative, cultural and intellectual vigour of Europe."
"In other words, an agreement at first reading is essential if those bodies are to be paid in January 2004."
"In all three cases, the Commission’s proposal has followed the stipulations of the financial regulation, and it is on that basis that I should like to explain the Commission’s position on the amendments contained in the three reports."
"I should like to thank Mrs Iivari, Mrs Prets and Mrs Pack for the considerable amount of work that they have carried out on these measures, the vital nature of which they are well aware of."
"We note that the length of the programmes – five years for culture and education, and three years for youth – has met with mixed reactions."
"We willingly accept Amendment 16 on culture, which proposes to shorten the length of the proposed programme to three years if that will enable a rapprochement to be achieved between the various institutions involved, so that the proceedings can be completed."
"We reject, however, Amendment 8 on youth, and insist that 2006 should be the deadline, because by 2007 we would like to set up a new youth programme which will give preferential treatment to participation by European youth organisations."
"There is a link between the issues of duration and budget in all three cases."
"Amendment 17 on culture, which reduces the budget, would be acceptable if Amendment 16, reducing the duration of the programme, were adopted."
"Moreover, if the duration is not amended, Amendment 11 on youth, which proposes an increase in the budget, is acceptable in order to cope with the challenges posed by enlargement."
"On the education side, we can accept in part, or in spirit, a group of amendments, namely Amendments 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, which seek to amend, by making amendments as part of the 2004 budgetary process, the total amount of funding and the maximum and minimum percentages of that funding reserved for each activity in the programme."
"According to the thinking behind the financial regulation, the long-term objective is to issue invitations, open to everyone, to submit proposals, with the famous ‘earmarking’, the method sometimes used now for allocating subsidies, being the exception."
"In order to facilitate the transition towards the approach contained in the financial regulation, the Commission has encouraged a mixed system, consisting of invitations to submit proposals and budgetary earmarking for Part 2 of the culture base."
"Therefore, we accept Amendment 18 on culture, but we are obliged to reject the culture Amendments 5, 15, 19, 20 and 23, which move too far away from the situation that we are trying to rectify."
"From this point of view, the criteria should be clear, or clarified further."
"We therefore agree with Amendment 10 on youth, but we disagree with Amendment 1 on culture, which strays too far away from the financial regulation in the way it redefines organisations pursuing aims of general European interest."
"In this respect, we cannot accept Amendment 5 on education, which is concerned with the International Federation of Europe Houses (FIME), and which seeks to add it to the list of bodies covered by Action 1, because, on the one hand, FIME plays the role of an intermediary in the redistribution of subsidies, which excludes it from the sphere of action defined by the financial regulation, and on the other hand, an audit of the activities subsidised by the Commission in recent years has been launched in the light of past experience."
"I should like, however, to explain to you that the Commission has already begun to phase out preferential collaboration activities with independent networks such as FIME."
"Moreover, FIME, like the Europe Houses that are affiliated to it, has been invited to respond to the invitations to submit proposals issued by the Commission, either at central level or at national level, via the appropriate representatives."
"Any invitation to submit proposals requires a jury of experts composed, depending on individual cases, of external experts or Commission officials, so as to guarantee its objectivity and transparency."
"A certain number of amendments have this in mind, and want Parliament to be informed in advance about the content of any invitations to submit proposals, before they are published by the Commission, or about the principle, the detailed implementing rules, or the composition of a jury."
"Mr President, while supporting these principles, the Commission cannot accept these amendments, which do not correspond to provisions concerning relations between the institutions established in the comitology decision, or which interfere with the executive powers of the Commission."
"These are as follows: on culture, Amendments 11, 21 and 22, on education, Amendments 13, 14 and 15, and on youth, Amendments 15, 22 and 23."
"However, we agree to Amendment 17 on youth, which proposes that Parliament should be informed every year about the annual implementation of our youth programme."
"Naturally the Commission imposes an obligation on those people who have received a European subsidy to publicise the fact adequately."
"While sharing Parliament’s opinion on this point, it seems to us to be more appropriate to put this publicity obligation in the annex."
"That is why the Commission accepts Amendment 12 on culture, but cannot accept Amendment 3."
"The same situation means that, on youth, we accept Amendment 20 but reject Amendment 6, and, on education, we accept Amendment 12 but reject Amendment 2."
"It is a rule of the financial regulation that a gradual reduction should be applied to operating grants renewed annually."
"This gradual reduction is not always properly understood, and attempts have been made, in various places, to derogate from it."
"We cannot accept Amendments 13 and 14 on culture, which seek to abolish the annual reduction."
"The only exception recognised by the financial regulation involves cases where the beneficiaries have the characteristics of a body pursuing aims of general European interest within the meaning of that regulation."
"Three amendments on youth, namely Amendments 5, 18 and 19, seek to restrict the programme to youth organisations possessing such characteristics, and this is something we accept."
"On the other hand, other amendments go much further in the opposite direction, and we cannot accept either Amendment 24 on youth or Amendment 24 on culture, both of which propose a substantial increase in the rate of the gradual reduction."
"Mr President, I shall pass rapidly over those amendments which the Commission agrees with and which seek to either clarify or simplify the text, or to strengthen it along the lines proposed by the Commission. These are, on culture, Amendments 2, 4 and 8; on education, Amendments 1, 3 and 7; and on youth, Amendments 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13 and 16."
"In addition, the Commission sees itself in the role of cultural ambassador, as proposed in Amendment 9 on culture."
"I have limited myself – and please excuse me for having spoken for such a long time – to mentioning the most sensitive amendments proposed in the three reports."
"I should now like to invite you to do everything you can to ensure that the support which the Union gives to the Europe of culture, education and youth does not experience an eclipse."
"An agreement between the joint legislators, at this stage in the proceedings, is vital if the system is to get back on the road at the beginning of 2004."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, you were right to say that time is short and that we must make an effort so that the projects can start and those concerned can get their funding."
"That was also my first point of criticism, because the time that has been left us is very, very short."
"If we are to do our work thoroughly and well, we need time, otherwise things catch up with and overtake us and that is when we fall back on makeshift solutions with which ultimately nobody agrees and which nobody likes."
"I would like to ask you that in future such matters and such important decisions be given a suitable time frame, because what we have here now is people breathing down our necks and the result is that we have to give way because we want the organisations to get their funding and their subsidies, even though there is still a lot with which we do not entirely agree."
"The fact that the legal act is not yet available is regrettable and is already having repercussions."
"There is already a shortage of funds, for twinning schemes, for example, where the first tranche cannot be paid out; information campaigns, too, in the Member States are having to rein in their resources a great deal."
"At a time when we are on the verge of enlargement and we need more information than ever, I think such repercussions are definitely out of place."
"I therefore believe there is an urgent need to offer transitional solutions so that programmes can continue if there are difficulties, so that Europe’s citizens are not hindered in their planned activities and the confidence which is in any case so very difficult to build up is not undermined at the same time."
"As regards the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Medica and Sport’s three reports, which are up for discussion, I think they can easily be discussed and dealt with together, but they differ completely in content and we cannot therefore strike a deal on them simultaneously."
"For example, the intention behind the proposal to harmonise action programmes as regards the proportion of cofinancing, the principle of degressivity and, not least, the alignment of their running time to 2008 is a good one, but there is no way it will work in practice."
"I am also against having a uniform cofinancing rate of 20% for all three areas."
"Many organisations, most especially in education, receive such minimal support that any further reduction would actually disqualify them altogether and it will not be worth picking up a pencil to make an application."
"A 20% rate for youth organisations is the maximum because lack of sponsorship makes it very difficult for organisations to carry on their activities as it is."
"Regarding the principle of degressivity, which is set at 2.5% from the third year, with the money saved being fed specially into new projects for the new Member States, I think that is also a mere drop in the ocean."
"I am convinced it is right to integrate the youth action programme into the new youth programme from 2007, since that will certainly bring great advantages to young people and youth organisations."
"The aims of supporting youth organisations that operate on a European scale include promoting international dialogue among young people, getting information on relevant topics to as wide a public as possible and offering informal educational opportunities."
"EU support for organisations will offer young people not only a chance to cooperate in matters that affect them and their interests, it will offer them everything, the whole broad spectrum of European politics and the related dimension."
"I believe they should be included in all discussion phases."
"So far as the geographical applicability is concerned, I think the principle of the wider Europe must also be applied to youth organisations."
"I support the involvement of youth organisations from the European Union, the Member States, the EFTA and EEA countries, the Balkan countries and certain countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States."
"But I do not think that the activities of organisations working with partners outside those countries should in any way be restricted provided they are supported by their own governments and organisations."
"In order to take some of the sting out of administrative decisions, the Commission should give applicants the opportunity to correct formal errors within a set period from submitting the application."
"All organisations that have received funding from the EU budget should also indicate this on their home pages or mention it in their annual reports."
"That applies for all three programmes, both to give an overview of the organisations’ activities and to make the European added value visible."
"Education, youth and culture should be paid greater attention; they should not simply be mentioned or serve as padding for speech making."
"Europe’s future lies in an open-minded youth, given an opportunity through strengthened educational institutions and organisations to build a Europe of common social prosperity, the foundation of which will be acceptance of cultural diversity and dialogue with art and culture."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to have basic legal acts that allow the Commission to proceed according to clearly defined principles when approving and managing grants."
"The authorising officer, in other words, the Commission, needs such guidelines in order to comply with both the Financial Regulation and the wishes of the budgetary authority, namely Parliament."
"I very much regret, however, Commissioner, the time pressure we are under, for which we are not responsible."
"The Commission adopted this act at the end of May and we were unable to examine it earlier, and I find we are yet again in difficulties under such pressure of time."
"There was no need for it, because it was clear, even before the Financial Regulation was adopted, that the present grants from Part A have to be replaced by multiannual programmes and it is therefore impossible to understand why the proposal came so late."
"We are being made to bear the consequences of something that is not our fault."
"Whose fault will it be if beneficiaries do not get any subsidies early next year?"
"The Commission will point its finger at us, the Council probably will too."
"But it is not our fault."
"We like to work carefully."
"This time, again, we were not able to."
"We really must do our best to ensure that it does not happen again, but we say that every time and I am having to say it again now."
"We have three reports, which Mrs Prets has already mentioned, and I agree with much of what she said."
"All three reports contain institutions and associations which are active as cultural ambassadors for Europe in the widest sense and which promote and foster the common cultural heritage in Europe."
"This House has for years supported all these organisations; it even founded some of them."
"Those that have been formed recently do not know that, of course, like the Youth Orchestra, the College of Europe, the University Institute in Florence, the Law Academy in Trier, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, the Mercator Network of Information and Documentation Centres, or the European Youth Forum."
"Up until now these organisations really have done their job of providing information and working for the integration of Europe."
"This also includes something that we have not created, but for whose existence I am grateful and for which you all really should be grateful: the FIME network, which has been working for European integration for 50 years in 118 houses in 32 European countries."
"That is why I am unable to understand what you unfortunately found it necessary to say – I assume you were forced to do so by those who today briefed you with completely incorrect information."
"In my opinion, we must say that the FIME is working well, that the FIME had an excellent audit early this year, that the FIME underwent an audit again three weeks ago, which consisted only in being asked to get all its files – 300 of them – to Brussels so they can be inspected there."
"The FIME has offered to allow everything in it to be looked at properly, as laid down in an agreement with the Commission."
"The result of that was that DG Press said that none of it was in order."
"I can only say that what they reported was not in order."
"We promised the FIME EUR 2.2 million in the last financial year. It got none of that money this year, nothing, simply because one of the FIME’s houses, Avignon, was guilty of a EUR 200 000 fraud."
"Those EUR 200 000 could easily have been deducted from the 2.4 million and then the FIME would have been able to work."
"If the Commission applied to itself the standards it applied to the FIME in this case, it would have been out of office long ago."
"I had to say that because I am simply furious."
"Unfortunately, my adversary is now Mrs Reding who cannot do anything about it."
"She repeated what she had been given to say and I can only say that what she was given to say is not in accordance with the facts."
"And it can be checked by the courts."
"The opinion of our group on the subject of earmarking: We are in favour of earmarking."
"We are against degressivity. We will therefore also vote accordingly."
"I would like to say once again in connection with earmarking here that I am glad the Commission has proposed retaining earmarking."
"No doubt it did so because it knows that we as Members of the European Parliament are closer to the citizens than the officials sitting here in Brussels, and they know that we know what may be politically and also culturally relevant in these individual cases."
"The Financial Regulation cannot rate higher than a basic act or than this budgetary authority."
"That cannot be and I therefore believe, as our legal service has also said, that earmarking is right."
"I hope that together we will get it through because I believe it will bring us closer to our common desire of bringing the citizens to Europe, of really finding the soul of Europe, than will what others have proposed here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately I cannot really defend my report on support for networks at European level in the field of culture."
"My main proposals were narrowly defeated in the committee vote."
"I hope that Parliament will be able to correct the situation in tomorrow’s vote, especially as the committee’s proposal to continue the practice of earmarking in the funding of cultural organisations is clearly in contravention of the Financial Regulation, according to an opinion of Parliament’s legal department."
"I am appalled that even the Committee on Budgets is so obviously determined to act in contravention of the Financial Regulation."
"Up till now I have defended the work of the Union to citizens in many contexts, because it is based on law and not on the power of the strongest."
"Now I do not know what to say."
"The Commission proposal for a Community action programme to promote organisations active in the field of culture was born of necessity: switching to an activity-based budget has made it unavoidable."
"European cultural organisations formerly financed from Section A relating to administrative expenditure need a legal basis for funding to be able to continue."
"The change will give us a unique opportunity to create an action programme for networks active at European level in the field of culture, where funding criteria can be determined and EU support for the networks can be organised in the way set out in Title 6 of the Financial Regulation, which emphasises the importance of the principles of transparency and equal treatment."
"The Commission proposal under discussion covers not only cultural organisations active at European level funded under former budget line A-3042, but also the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network centres funded under budget line A-3015 as well as grants under budget line A-3035 awarded for the preservation of Nazi concentration camps as historical monuments."
"In this connection it should be stressed that the problems with the report do not concern these points: what is most essential for the funding of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and concentration camp memorials is that the legal basis should be brought into force from the beginning of the year."
"We spoke here of haste, but I think that if we want to we can obtain some results quite quickly."
"Differences of opinion regarding the funding of organisations active in the field of culture are connected with three points."
"Firstly, the application process and Parliament’s practice of earmarking are at odds with one another."
"Secondly, there is the matter of how long the programme is to last."
"As the Council on Education, Youth and Culture, which must decide unanimously on the issue, is, according to my information, definitely of the opinion that the programme should last until 2006, and not 2008, I have tabled an amendment on the matter."
"I think it would be a very good idea to make the funding of cultural organisations part of the new culture programme in preparation."
"The third problem is linked to degressivity with regard to amounts for grants."
"On that point too I disagree with the majority on the committee."
"A small and gradual fall is, I think, acceptable, to be able to make room too for new organisations."
"We have to bear in mind such matters as EU enlargement."
"Furthermore, the amendments I tabled contain the suggestion that, owing to a lack of time, the list the Committee on Budgets has decided upon, could be finalised next year."
"This way the continuity, which is necessary, is guaranteed."
"The application procedure for 2005 could then be commenced in good time at the start of the year."
"I also propose that multiannual funding be made a possibility and that an addition be made to the funding criteria that safeguards the financing of, , European orchestras."
"These proposals were overturned in the committee vote, although they are clearly in the interests of cultural organisations."
"Thus far the debate on the Commission proposal has been in many ways a mind-broadening, though not entirely elevating, experience."
"As I have stood for an open application procedure, I have wanted to make the present arbitrary and haphazard practice an open one based on clear rules."
"At present there are organisations on our list which in fact no longer even exist."
"We also have to bear in mind the interinstitutional division of labour."
"The Commission puts forward a proposal and implements the will of the legislator."
"Parliament is the legislator and in my view it should not try to wield any executive power."
"As the draft EU constitution makes Parliament the primary legislator, Parliament must itself respect that role."
". Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the three proposals we are dealing with today, I would firstly like to express the extent to which I believe the application of Rule 162(a) of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedures – enhanced cooperation between committees – has once again been emptied of any meaning."
"Nobody questions that the aspects of co-financing and degressivity fall within the competence of the Committee on Budgets."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport voted on and rejected the amendments by the Committee on Budgets on these two aspects, using the argument that it contradicted the other elements of the report."
"This is the crux of the matter, and not only with regard to the three reports we are dealing with today, but with regard to enhanced cooperation in general."
"This procedure is intended to facilitate cooperation between the competent committees and strengthen the role of the committee asked for an opinion."
"But if, from the outset, there is not enough time to facilitate this cooperation and if, furthermore, it is sufficient for a single amendment to be presented in the committee responsible which contradicts what has been presented by the committee asked for an opinion, Rule 162(a) is automatically negated."
"This is precisely what has happened in the Committee on Culture in relation to the opinion delivered by the Committee on Budgets."
"In other words, that after Rule 162(a), we automatically moved on to apply Rule 162, that is, to deliver a normal opinion."
"I am convinced that it is Rule 162(a) itself that contains the catch, and, in its current wording, all it does is create unnecessary conflicts between committees rather than promoting cooperation between them."
"I therefore believe that it is essential that, with a view to the future, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs examine this rule, either with a view to revising it, or with a view to completely removing it."
"Returning to substance of the proposals, I would like to focus on two aspects: co-financing and degressivity, which are the issues that have raised most problems."
"I am talking about two fundamental aspects of the general system for awarding grants because they allow for the co-responsibility of the beneficiary for the correct use of grants and also ensure that the organisations do not depend solely and exclusively on Community grants in order to operate, thereby promoting their establishment in the future."
"Furthermore, degressivity allows money recovered in this way to be able, in this case, to be used to subsidise new associations, particularly those in the enlargement countries."
"The Commission’s proposals therefore provide for co-financing and degressivity in the award of all these grants."
"Nevertheless, I must express my surprise at the fact that the Commission has applied different percentages in these three proposals, which are the responsibility of the same Directorate-General, both for co-financing and for degressivity."
"Since Article 109 of the Financial Regulation states that equal treatment must be one of the principles for the award of grants, it is not justifiable that associations with the same objective but which act in different fields should be subject to differing treatment."
"The amendment approved by the Committee on Budgets called for all associations receiving a grant under any of the seven programmes – in accordance with the various groups of associations identified – should have the same rights and obligations in the aspects of co-financing and degressivity."
"Furthermore, in the case of co-financing, it was not a question of establishing fixed percentages, but of establishing minimums that would then allow the executive authority to apply percentages in accordance with the real needs or possibilities of each association."
"I would like to stress that it was not a question of seeking harmonisation, but of applying that principle of equal treatment."
"For its part, the Committee on Culture eliminates degressivity in its three proposals, believing that all associations likely to receive a grant are of general European interest, within the meaning of the exception provided for in Article 113(2) of the Financial Regulation."
"I believe that this is too broad an interpretation and I would question whether all these associations are genuinely of European general interest."
"The Committee on Culture appears to have interpreted the maintenance of degressivity on the part of the Committee on Budgets as a kind of punishment of these associations when in reality it promotes – together with co-financing, as I said earlier – their establishment in the future, since nowhere is it written that these grants should be awarded"
"Otherwise, when the day comes that, for one reason or another, this source of funding runs out, all the associations could find themselves under serious pressure."
"Finally - as I pointed out in my speech on grants during the last plenary session – lack of time has had a terrible effect on the whole of this procedure."
"The Commission was under time pressure in presenting its proposals and Parliament has also been under time pressure with regard to the amended proposals we are presenting today."
"Anybody who has studied them will have realised that they contain more than one contradiction."
"I imagine that we are all guilty as well as victims in relation to this problem, but what worries me most is the extent to which the European Parliament's position will have been strengthened following tomorrow's vote, because what we have ahead of us, jointly, is a difficult conciliation with the Council, since the latter does not appear to be prepared to give ground on those points which it considers fundamental, such as pre-allocation, co-financing and degressivity, or the programmes’ financial framework."
"– First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the sound work that they have done."
"Although they are not present right now, they will be able to read this in the Minutes."
"As a Liberal, I am pleased about the fact that the Commission has tabled the proposal to provide a legal framework for support in the fields of culture, education, training and youth."
"The procedures followed to date have not always been a guarantee for transparency and quality, and these are, after all, two requirements if Europe wants to become the world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy."
"It is important for the Commission to keep this in mind when it makes the different calls for proposals to be submitted."
"We need clear criteria for the awarding of subsidies to organisations and projects, and these must be clearly publicised, so that the applicants know where they stand."
"The selection of organisations and projects must be done very carefully and must not be left to the Commission itself."
"This is why I have started to argue in favour of involving independent experts."
"In the Netherlands, we have a Council for culture."
"This is an advisory council that issues well-founded advice to the minister, who acts upon this advice, unless there are very good reasons not to."
"I can imagine that this could also be set up for the selection of organisations that are culturally active at European level."
"This is a far purer procedure than the way we are operating at the moment."
"However, the question now at issue is whether or not to earmark."
"Traditionally, my group has not been in favour of earmarking, but the selected organisations should be able to rely on a certain degree of continuity."
"I have also spoken in favour of this within my group."
"To my mind, the option of concluding multi-annual framework partner agreements is a good way of getting round this, but we must beware of these subsidies being maintained until the end of time."
"Consequently, my group argues in favour of introducing the degressivity principle, which should kick-in in the third year."
"According to my calculations, with an annual degressivity of 2.5%, as proposed by the Commission, the organisations can be supported for another forty years or so."
"That, though, is quite a commitment for us, and even for our grandchildren."
"This is why we, the Liberals, propose 10%."
"In that way, the organisations can rely on thirteen years of support from us."
"The possibility is thus created also to support new organisations, which, in the light of enlargement, should definitely not be overlooked."
"Continuity, combined with room for innovation, that is my motto."
"Unfortunately, we are facing a problem next year, in that the action programmes are expected to go ahead on 1 January 2004, which is only a few weeks away, and nothing has yet been organised."
"The organisations that have hitherto received subsidies run the risk of being left in the cold in 2004."
"The Liberals want to prevent this from happening, and that is why a transitional arrangement should be put in place."
"As a final point, I should like to indicate briefly that not only must the allocation procedures be transparent, but that matters should also be dealt with swiftly and efficiently."
"I have mentioned this before and I should like to repeat it here: this is important and it applies to all three action programmes."
"Mr President, first I want to congratulate the three rapporteurs, especially Mrs Pack, because just before our sitting commenced, she proved that behind her harsh political voice there hides a sweet, melodic voice, and that is something very, very important."
"I want to say that this reform, with the addition of the legal terms, was needed, is important and results in a better working order."
"Nonetheless, I want to express a number of concerns."
"These concerns relate both to certain permanent agencies receiving Community funds and to the procedure for selecting the agencies which are not permanent."
"I fear that we are in danger of creating certain agencies that will eat up the Community budget and of complicating work which could be carried out through them."
"On the other hand, by leaving an important area of the decision concerning these agencies to the Budget Authority, which are not permanent, I think that we reduce transparency and the proper criteria for selecting beneficiaries."
"I want to express particular concern about the Youth programme."
"I fear that the European Youth Forum is very detached from the new generation and from agencies which relate to the real world of youth."
"I also fear that the criteria for the selected agencies, according to which, for example, an agency which pursues an objective of general European interest in the field of youth or an objective which forms part of the policy of the European Union can be selected, result in our castrating young people."
"We should accept and encourage contestation and questions concerning the policies of the European Union."
"Mr President, I appreciate very much that the Commissioner is tiptoeing through a minefield, walking on egg shells and is certainly trying to do her best to see that we rescue something from the first-class programmes we have organised over many years."
"We all know in this Chamber and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that the work of the European Union must be carried out not only inside the institutions but also by people outside."
"Fortunately, there are many worthy, hardworking organisations doing a great deal to promote European Union and cooperation."
"In particular, the European Councils, the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament and the Model Youth Parliament."
"These organisations have been backed and supported by the European Union and the Parliament over many years by grants voted by Parliament."
"It just seems incredible that in the year of enlargement and of the adoption of a new Constitution not to mention the European elections we should even be thinking about reducing or dropping funding for these emblematic institutions."
"I would say to Mrs Dührkhop that we can always find ways of spending money on bureaucracies, jurors, and administrative procedures."
"We need to find a way of getting the money to the people who are actually going to do some good with it."
"To organise an orchestra which draws its players from the top conservatories across Europe requires a great deal of organisation and forward planning."
"How can you book concert halls if you do not know that you are going to have the money?"
"Some of these procedures are simply going to cancel that effort altogether."
"If the European Union cannot organise itself to give assistance, or simply will not, why should any other organisation be thinking of doing so?"
"As for the policy of digressivity, I normally agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, but digressivity simply shows the lack of vision of the people who dreamt up that policy - a total lack of vision, in stark contrast to the vision of the founding fathers of Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to apologise for the absence of two other Members from my Group, Mrs Ahern and Mrs Echerer, who are not able to be present this evening."
"I wish to express my thanks and gratitude to Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, but my main thanks go to Mrs Prets, even though she is not present, for her excellent work on this report, which shows a great understanding for the needs and objectives of youth NGOs."
"In an increasingly individualistic society, the role that youth NGOs play in engaging young people in civil society is crucial."
"As said in its recent policy paper, youth NGOs are social agents that empower young people; they are environments for non-formal learning and are specifically suitable, therefore, for young people to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding, self-motivation, project-management, conflict-resolution, organisation of skills and more."
"Youth NGO activities are heavily reliant, of course, on grants."
"That is why I welcome that all kinds of youth organisations, including and other international non-governmental youth NGOs, are excluded from the principle of digressivity which would mean a reduction of 2.5% in their funds from the third year onwards."
"Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs is the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness and efforts in creating a generation of young people that will become more socially involved."
"I also support the proposal to improve the user-friendliness of the grant application process."
"At the moment it is far too complicated."
"Therefore, I completely endorse Mrs Pack's Amendment 16, which gives applicants the opportunity to correct errors after submitting their applications."
"This should reduce the number of applications that are rejected for technical reasons."
"I also very much hope that Mrs Pack's excellent report will be endorsed by a substantial majority to guarantee a legal basis to effectively fund international youth NGOs."
"Mr President, the action programme for education and training reflects the need to establish a proper legal basis for providing grants for organisations engaged at European level in the education and training fields."
"I would like to see the programme supporting efforts to increase young people's awareness of the political system and indeed the promotion and the development of civics as well, although I know schools are not included in these particular programmes."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner's views in relation to the importance of highlighting this aspect, which is particularly important in Irish society today."
"The multiannual programme is to cover the period 2004 - 2008, and is valued, as we know, at EUR 129.62 million."
"Would a shorter period be more beneficial to allow for an earlier review and to take into account developments arising from enlargement?"
"I strongly support efforts to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion so that the new programme is not delayed any further."
"The Commission only adopted the proposals in May 2003, and therefore we cannot realistically expect the first grants to be available before late summer 2004."
"I share the rapporteur's view about transparency."
"I believe any beneficiary of EU funding should be obliged to indicate in a prominent place such as websites, annual reports and even on headed paper the fact that they are in receipt of EU grants."
"Mr President, I do not want to repeat what other Members have said, especially my colleague, Mrs Dührkop, but I should just like to give a warning in relation to two of the reports you have in front of you."
"Later this month the Committee on Budgets will have a conciliation meeting with the Council on a variety of issues and one of those issues will be to get an across-the-board agreement on those areas where we have codecision."
"There are seven areas in total, three of which are on the plenary agenda for this week."
"We in the Budgets Committee especially through the work of Mrs Dührkop, who has worked in a very assiduous way have tried to seek an agreement on these reports."
"We now find, however, that two of the reports are giving us serious problems."
"If Amendments 19 to the Prets report and 14 to the Ilvari report are carried, we will have real problems when it comes to the conciliation."
"In fact I am sure the Council and the Commission will say that the reports actually violate the Financial Regulation."
"If Parliament were to reject those two amendments it would make life a lot easier."
"I need to give warning now that, if those two amendments are carried, I, as Chairman of the Budgets Committee, would consider that to be a breach of Rule 63a."
"In other words, we will taking into account the Financial Regulation and the budgetary consequences."
"I will stand up during the vote to ask Parliament to support an oral amendment to ensure that both these reports fall into in line with the Financial Regulation."
"Hopefully, when we come to conciliation, we can get a consensus on all the reports and not just five out of seven."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, Mrs Pack, Mrs Prets and Mrs Iivari, on the reports we are debating tonight."
"I will refer firstly to the report on the youth programme and I would like to say that I believe it to be very positive because it proposes, amongst other things, bringing the European Union's institutions closer to young people, and I believe that this is absolutely correct because we must not forget that they are the future of Europe and it is they who must know us best."
"Furthermore, it is very important that the opinions of these young people can be communicated to all the Members of this House and other people in the European institutions, because when it comes to making decisions it is very important to be aware of those opinions."
"And providing youth programmes with stability and continuity, provided that the principle of subsidiarity is respected of course, is essential to their smooth operation."
"With regard to the report on education and training, I would like to say that I completely agree with the constant quest for quality in teaching and education, and I believe it to be wonderful that this is being promoted at European level."
"But I would like to add, in relation to the three reports in general, that we must attach more importance to education, youth and culture, because although we always say here that they are extremely important issues, the reality is that this view is not then reflected in the European Union's budgets."
"And if they are not reflected in the budgets, it is very unlikely that our voters will believe us when we say it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject which we are examining appears at first sight to be technical, yet it conceals behind it a very serious political dimension, in that it concerns the funding of organisations which, according to the wording repeated in the explanatory statements of all three reports, 'reinforce the European message' and operate in three crucial areas: youth, education and culture."
"But why spend around EUR 40 million a year over five years in order to reinforce the so-called European message?"
"Because it would appear that the advertising and promotions carried out both by the services of the European Union and by the Member States in order to convince the peoples of the benefits of Europe are not enough. Nor are the funds in these three sectors of educational exchanges and special programmes for youth and culture enough."
"The daily experiences of the workers, unemployment, hardship, the attack on their rights and the commercialisation of everything prove exactly the opposite."
"A multisided mechanism is therefore being constructed which even wants to involve and buy off independent organisations and foundations."
"Without wanting to belittle the work of some of these organisations, we cannot but identify certain typical cases of funding, such as that of the European Youth Forum, which are an attempt at direct intervention in the youth movement in a bid to prevent the radicalisation of young people."
"Of the action in the field of education, we single out funding for teaching about European integration in universities, the funding of foundations which promote the policy of the European Union, even training of national judges in Community law."
"The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the erection of propaganda mechanisms which aim to conceal the anti-grass roots character of the European Union."
"That is why we shall vote against all three proposals, without entering into the debate on the details."
"– Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteurs and I would like to concentrate on one question, in fact on the area of culture and Mrs Pack’s report."
"It goes without saying that we are emphatically in favour of a transparent and secure legal basis, but we must ask ourselves the question here as to what extent a common European cultural policy will in fact still be possible with this procedure, or are we concentrating exclusively on a procedure and the citizens are no longer so important?"
"Take the action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture, for example."
"There are two funding structures, two sets of rules, one for so-called permanent organisations and one for the second area, which operates by calls."
"There is no question but that we want to promote as many new initiatives as possible from the existing budget allocations."
"But the way proposed here and which was in particular decided by the Council at the first reading makes it impossible any longer to include European initiatives that actually deserve such support as permanent bodies."
"As the report mentions, there is the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, which is supposed to be one of these permanent bodies, but it cannot be the only one in the whole of Europe to have the right to be a permanent body of this kind."
"The European Youth Orchestra, the Institute in Florence, the Institute in Trier, the College in Bruges: what sort of a proposal are they supposed to make?"
"How many European Youth Orchestras must there be to ensure sufficient support?"
"If there is any doubt, we must join with the Commission in entering into litigation with the Council to really make support for these possible."
"Mr President, I have listened very patiently to what has been said."
"However, I should like to return to the realities."
"What are those realities?"
"A new financial regulation has been decided on, by a vote in the European Parliament."
"That new financial regulation has consequences."
"Parliament was aware, when it voted in favour of the new financial regulation, that it would have consequences."
"Now one of those consequences is that it is impossible to go on funding certain bodies in the way they have been funded in the past."
"That is the problem."
"Therefore we had to find a solution."
"The easiest solution would have been to say that we shall just apply the financial regulation, then close the door and that would be the end of it."
"The Commission, however, because it cares about bodies involved in youth, education and culture, did not choose the easy way out. It chose the difficult way."
"In other words, despite the new financial regulation we are trying to ensure that we can continue to fund those bodies, and we have done so, because the proposal which is on the table now allows us to continue to finance the College of Europe in Bruges, the European University Institute in Florence, the Academy of European Law in Trier, the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht, the Human Rights Centre in Venice, the Jean Monnet Chairs etc. It also allows us to finance – and I shall not read the whole list, Mr President – the orchestras, the Chorale Academy, Europa Cantate, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, the Youth Academy Foundation, Europa Nostra, the Artists’ Villages, Europalia, Euroballet, the Pegasus Foundation, the Boniface Memorial Foundation, and so on."
"There are dozens of them, Mr President. It also enables us to continue to provide funding for the Youth Forums and the youth organisations."
"I am sorry, but when I hear that all these things will no longer be funded, I wonder what I have been doing for the last few months in trying to continue the funding despite a financial regulation which no longer permits that funding."
"I think it is very disagreeable of Parliament to tell us that it received the proposal too late."
"Parliament received the proposal in May, and we are now in November."
"Why did Parliament not receive the proposal until May? It could have received it a month or two earlier."
"It did not receive it then because, during those months, the Commission was achieving the impossible in order to safeguard cultural bodies, educational bodies and youth bodies, and in order to proceed in the direction desired by the European Parliament, in order to give assistance to those beneficiaries which Parliament had selected, quite rightly, so that they could switch from one system to the other without any interruption."
"That is what we were doing during the months before May."
"What remains to be done now, then?"
"What remains to be done is for Parliament to come to an agreement with the Council, because all our legal services have told us that earmarking, for example, which was Parliament’s idea, would not be possible."
"It was thanks to the Commission, to its assiduousness, and the way it forged ahead in order to find an intermediate solution, that it was possible to safeguard Parliament’s earmarking."
"The new financial regulation makes no provision for earmarking."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, let us keep both feet firmly on the ground."
"If we took so long, it was because we needed to find solutions to an impossible situation, solutions that would be in the interests of our cultural, educational and youth bodies."
"Parliament now has to vote on the amendments."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Budgets has made it very clear: either Parliament votes in favour of those amendments which are likely, in the codecision procedure, to meet with the Council’s agreement, in which case from January onwards, all those bodies to which we are committed will receive their money, or it votes in favour of amendments which will never receive agreement from anybody, in which case, come January, the bodies that I have just referred to, and there are dozens and dozens of them, will not receive any money at all."
"I have done everything I can, Mr President, to make a solution possible."
"I hope Parliament and the Council, for their part, will also do everything they can to ensure that the solution can be implemented with effect from January 2004."
"Mr President, would you allow a question to the Commission, although it does not strictly speaking conform to the Rules of Procedure?"
"As an exception, I will give you fifteen seconds in which to ask your question."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission’s proposal provides for transitional measures for the three proposals we are discussing."
"Therefore, even if an agreement is not reached with the Council, could you explain to me how it is that there is a risk of certain organisations not having funding?"
"Mr President, the risk is clear."
"I should like to say to the honourable Member that if there is no agreement in the codecision procedure, if there is a delay, if we have to start discussing all the details again from the beginning, then no decision will be taken before the January 2004 deadline."
"We may perhaps reach a decision in spring, or in summer."
"I do not know, but I do know that throughout that time it will not be possible to pay the bodies in question, because without legal bases nobody will provide a signature so that a payment can be made."
"That much is very clear. It would be illegal, and no one is going to accept the responsibility for doing something illegal."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0279/2003) by Mrs Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women in the new information society (2003/2047(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, you certainly know that the lack of access to new technologies and digital illiteracy are increasingly developing into new forms of social exclusion which directly endanger women."
"Evidence to date has revealed huge differences between the two sexes both in education and in the labour market."
"The report which I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights starts by listing the reasons, such as social stereotyping and cultural preconceptions, which restrict the options of girls and raise barriers to their careers, resulting in general negative consequences in the economy as a result of the non-rational use of human resources."
"Over the last decade, we know that three million new jobs have been created, of which 1 600 000 have been taken up by women."
"However, it should be noted that over 60% of the new jobs created are in the high technology sector, where women are underrepresented, especially at the higher levels of technical specialisation and at the decision-making level."
"Hence, economic development in the field of modern technologies under present circumstances is exacerbating structural weaknesses and widening the gender gap."
"The labour market is still divided by gender, with the men dominating in new technologies and women in lower paid jobs which call for less specialisation and offer less security."
"In the field of research and science, women are not only seriously underrepresented, they are present in just a few scientific fields and completely absent from others, while they are markedly unequally represented throughout the scientific hierarchy and have less opportunity to secure funding for research."
"Of the 500 000 researchers working in industry in Europe, only 50 000 are women."
"In the public sector, universities and research centres, the percentage fluctuates between one quarter and one third, but in higher positions of responsibility the percentage is less than 12% for women."
"In industrial research, the situation is even worse, and the new technology sector appears to be the worst of all."
"Better access for women to research would certainly help to enrich scientific methods, themes and subject matters."
"Similarly, in the field of the media, there is no representation of or participation by women journalists in positions of administrative responsibility, while no attention is paid to the issue of discrimination against women and images of women are often projected in the media which have nothing to do with reality."
"At the same time, the Internet continues to be dominated by men and to be directed mainly at men, thereby giving rise to discrimination."
"Surveys show there are differences in the way in which men and women use Internet services."
"Similarly, we have worrying evidence about the small percentage of women Internet users in the accession countries."
"In order to increase the number of women in education and training in the new technologies, my report proposes the inclusion of computers and the Internet into primary schooling from an early age, so as to encourage young girls to take up lessons in a positive direction."
"Surveys show that contact with science and technology at an early age could change the attitude of women before stereotyping starts to affect their behaviour."
"The Lisbon strategy and the employment guidelines should be applied in order to limit the gender division of labour, with women concentrated in certain professions with low qualification requirements, low pay and no prospects of advancement."
"That is why both the Commission and the Member States should undertake the commitment, with the full use of Structural Funds and in particular the Social Fund, for training in the new technologies, particularly with regard to the entry or return of women to the labour market, always in the context of the Lisbon objectives."
"At the same time, sexual equality policies and programmes need to be implemented that aim especially to vocational training, lifelong learning, compatibility between professional and private life and the equal division of family responsibilities between men and women, which will facilitate women's access to the information society."
"Special attention should be given to the content of the multimedia, in order to promote positive images of women, such as the amazing performance of women at all levels of education."
"We are calling on the European Commission and the Member States to promote the full and equal participation of women in the media, including the administration, planning, management, education and projection sectors."
"At the same time, policies need to be adopted that will improve working conditions in new sectors, such as teleworking."
"Special attention needs to be given to improving women's access to the Internet and new technologies by creating an extensive infrastructure and by providing technological equipment in rural and suburban areas, which are poorly served today, especially in the poorer areas and the accession countries."
"All the policies of the European Union should promote a strategy to safeguard the basic infrastructure which will provide access, equipment and connections for every house, school, public building and library."
"In order to combat social exclusion, priority must be given to vulnerable groups of girls and women, immigrants, the disabled, the destitute, unmarried mothers, women farmers etc."
"Similarly, the Commission needs to collate additional statistics on structural differences in the IT sector, so that we can investigate the real participation of women, their representation and trends in the job market."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities emphasises that, up to now, the gender dimension in the new technology sector has been completely ignored."
"That is why, within the framework of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society to be held in Geneva in December 2003, we are calling on the Commission and the Council to submit practical strategy proposals and contribute to the incorporation of horizontal policies for gender equality."
"The digital economy offers both opportunities and challenges to women, challenges which differ from the challenges to men and are based on their different roles and places in the family and society."
"Integrating the gender dimension into the development of new technologies does not only raise the question of access, quantitative participation and the equal representation of women; it also raises a deeper question and presents an opportunity for a critical evaluation of the culture of the information society, with its values, development strategies and objectives and the involvement of human resources."
"I hope that my report will contribute to the public dialogue on the kind of information society we want."
"Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank Mrs Karamanou for her work on this report on women in the new information society."
"As we know, globalisation and the information and communications technologies (ICT) have dramatically changed all areas of social and professional life in Europe."
"More than half of all people working today use computers in their professional lives, 40% of Europeans use the Internet and, in the last five years, more than 60% of all new jobs created in the Union have been in the high-tech sectors."
"One fact leaps out from these figures: there will be no real need for workers who do not have the necessary education to use the new technologies."
"Progress has been made in the field of gender equality, with almost as many women (46%) using computers as men (54%), and the situation is similar as regards the Internet."
"The gap between men and women is growing within disadvantaged groups, however."
"The new technologies offer new opportunities for jobs and for people’s working lives, including teleworking which, at least in theory, can help women and men better to reconcile family and working life."
"Although women appear to be more interested in teleworking now, they are still not making great use of it, so much remains to be done in this area."
"Men occupy two-thirds of all jobs in new technology sectors."
"Only 15% of professionals in this sector are women, and the figures are more or less the same when it comes to education."
"In some countries, less than 30% of women go on to study the new technologies in higher education."
"Women account for 19% of doctorates in computing, and the percentage of women setting up their own businesses is much lower."
"In the world of business, the higher up the decision-making ladder you go, the fewer women you find in the new information sector, although I believe this is to some extent the case in all sectors."
"In this context, the Lisbon strategy and the European Social Policy Agenda and the Employment Strategy have played a significant role in promoting women’s access to the information society, including all the steps adopted by Education Ministers at national and European level."
"By the same token, the Framework Strategy for Gender Equality encourages an employability-oriented approach and women’s access to jobs in the new technologies sector."
"A number of other Community-funded programmes also promote gender equality, and the social partners have a key role to play in supporting women’s participation in the information society."
"If we want to achieve results, all of these policies clearly need to be consolidated and, in this, the Commission’s role is crucial, but all parties involved at all levels must seize the opportunity represented by the new knowledge-based society to ensure that men and women are equally represented in the sector."
"To my mind, all future action should hinge on three priorities."
"First of all, it should focus on finding a place for women everywhere and in all social situations."
"Secondly, emphasis should be placed on education and training."
"Thirdly, work must be done to improve the rate of employment for women and the percentage of women setting up their own businesses in the new technology sector."
"As I said at the beginning of this speech, particular attention must be paid to women who risk being excluded from the information society, including women who are older, unemployed or on a low income, women who are immigrants or who have disabilities and, above all, women who have not received sufficient education."
"The necessary infrastructure must be established in towns and at regional and local level."
"Improving access to broadband connections can prevent exclusion in both urban and rural areas."
"Access to the new technologies in all areas must not be confined to helping women to find new jobs."
"By promoting new working methods, new ways of organising work, such action will also create the conditions necessary to bring about change in current employment practices."
"I have already mentioned teleworking, but the quality of work and the level of work satisfaction could also be improved. Finally, it could further integrate women into the labour force."
"Increasing the participation of women in the labour market is crucial to attaining the objectives set in Lisbon and significantly improving enterprise creation could make a real change to the hand women are dealt."
"We must improve the role women are given in the fields of ownership, supervision and management in the ICT and media sectors, by providing the necessary assistance to women who set up their own businesses, by funding projects and by cooperating on implementing action plans, particularly in knowledge-based sectors, by supporting awareness-raising campaigns and by encouraging women to grasp job opportunities in the new technologies sector, once they are trained."
"We must establish conditions that will enable all women to participate in employment, including mothers of young children, older women and women with disabilities."
"In order to achieve equality between men and women, women’s representation in the market must be improved, but in itself, this is not enough."
"Women must also play a major role in decision-making bodies and in society in general."
"As regards the new technologies, real changes in the field of gender equality will only be truly effective when women also occupy senior positions in this sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this action requires partnership and practical action."
"Increasing the participation of women in the information society is an issue that concerns everyone."
"The Commission, the European Parliament, governments, regional and local authorities, the unions and employers all share this responsibility, which the Commission hopes everyone will shoulder."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of this evening's debate is not just one aspect of women's modern professional life; it is particularly important to the development of the European Union, the success of the Lisbon objectives and, of course, the future of women themselves."
"The whole world is developing into an information society and our experience shows that those states, areas and citizens most familiar with these new opportunities have greater chances of employment and advancement."
"That is why the new technologies do not by themselves constitute a market sector with a constant increase in jobs but do affect the development of other sectors."
"The European Union is lagging behind the United States in research and the use of new technologies. However, even inside the European Union there are discrepancies between the Member States, between the regions and, unfortunately, between the two sexes, as both the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out."
"My honourable friend Anna Karamanou has taken a highly positive initiative in drafting a report on this subject; a report which will give us a better understanding of the problem and the need to take suitable, efficient measures with suitable cooperation at European, national and local level."
"The rapporteur's proposals touch on a broad range of policies to promote the participation of women in the world of new technologies; policies which relate to the workplace, the business world and the world of education and rightly point out that, in order to achieve this objective, women need to participate in the planning of and decisions on the relevant policies."
"I should like to comment in particular on facilitating Internet connections for housewives, because this will make life easier for women themselves."
"At Community level, the averages vary perceptibly: 48% of men and 38% of women have a home connection."
"Our experience tells us that access for women may have multiple benefits for society."
"And as this year is the year of the people with disabilities, I should like to refer in particular to the initiatives taken by mothers in order to deal with their children's health problems."
"Today, we can find websites on the Internet where mothers exchange experiences and promote solutions to an impressive degree."
"Take, for example, the Dyspraxia Foundation, which was set up in 1987 by two English mothers, Stella White and Marion Owen."
"Their names deserve to be mentioned."
"Today, this initiative is a reference point for mothers and an example which has been followed in various European countries and elsewhere, in Canada and in Japan, where mothers are setting up similar websites with positive, specific results in the application of new methods to deal with their children's physical and mental health problems."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0344/2003) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Hellenic Republic with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network (9870/2003 C5-0260/2003 2003/0817(CNS))."
". Mr President, the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June expressed the need to speed up work on adopting, before the end of 2003, a legal instrument intended officially to create a network of ‘Immigration’ liaison officers (ILOs)."
"The idea is that all these ‘Immigration’ liaison officers of the Member States, located in the same foreign country, should work effectively together, within networks, in order to contribute to the gradual establishment of the coordinated and integrated management of our external borders."
"The regulation proposed by Greece is needed to provide a framework for formalising and strengthening the informal cooperation that already exists between liaison officers."
"The ideal situation would be to have Community ‘Immigration’ liaison officers with their own duties, who are trained and paid by the Union, but unfortunately neither the jurisdiction nor the budget for this yet exists and some States remain unconvinced."
"Liaison officers symbolise the external representation of the Member States, and some people do not look favourably on any loss of their national prerogative."
"In the meantime, this new proposal for a regulation is, to my mind, a step towards achieving greater transparency."
"There are essentially three types of task that would be given to the liaison officers: they would help to prevent illegal immigration and to combat the traffickers, they would help to return illegal immigrants and would contribute to the management of legal immigration."
"This last point is still rather vague, however, since the form that this management might take is not set out in any of the regulation’s articles and yet is, I believe, a crucial matter."
"This is, therefore, a shortcoming that needs to be remedied and, in fact, contrary to what some would have us believe, foreigners are not dangerous; they are in danger themselves."
"People who leave their country, their friends and family, to immigrate to the European Union do so for significant reasons that are often matters of life or death."
"Each one of us would probably, in the same economic, social, psychological and emotional conditions, do the same."
"We must, therefore, disseminate information on the possibilities of legal immigration in the countries concerned."
"To achieve this, I believe we must all be clear about our immigration policy, which is not currently the case."
"We must also warn people about the risk that they face of falling into the hands of unscrupulous smugglers or of finding themselves involved with a slave-trading network."
"In order, however, for these measures to be truly effective, I call on the Member States to ensure that they are not themselves the cause of some illegal activity."
"To this end they should, as I see it, act on two fronts: firstly, on the status of temporary workers."
"Studies of the black labour market in European farming indeed show that undeclared overtime and the use of illegal methods of recruiting for the farming labour force, which sometimes border on slavery, are increasing in the Member States."
"Often, the major distribution chains put pressure on producers, who then use unemployed and illegal workers and it is unthinkable that we should accept contracts that place workers beyond the law."
"I wish to emphasise that, very often, making legislation tougher reduces the number of legal workers and increases the number of illegal workers, whom it in no way prevents getting through."
"Furthermore, it is crucial that we avoid making a link between immigration and organised crime."
"Illegal immigrants are not criminals, but human beings who have not been fortunate enough to be born in the right place."
"A clearer distinction should therefore be made between the roles of liaison officers, ‘Immigration’ liaison officers, airport liaison officers, documentary advisers, technical advisers and consular services, all of which deal with immigration issues, and it would also appear appropriate to delineate the area of activity of liaison officers and precisely define their tasks."
"There should also be some harmonisation, even if only partial, of the training they should receive."
"Some ILOs interviewed when the Danish Presidency report was being drafted see this as a for the creation of a genuine network."
"This training could normally be given in the form of seminars and workshops, which would have the undeniable advantage of fostering personal contact – the very essence of a network."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that in no case must immigration be seen as a threat."
"In no case must illegal immigrants be seen as criminals."
"They are victims, because they have had the misfortune to be born in a beleaguered country. They are victims because they are desperate and are looking for compassion."
"If the European Union is incapable of understanding that, then we can only despair of progress and of the civilised world."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication of November 2001 on a policy for combating illegal immigration, the Commission set out, in the chapter on measures to be implemented within the Union’s external border, the need for a network of immigration liaison officers."
"The Commission is of the view that this network must ensure the necessary exchange of information between immigration liaison officers and also the coordination that the Member States must develop with third countries in order to work together in the field of European immigration policy."
"The action plans adopted by the Council on illegal immigration and on the management of our external borders, as well as the conclusions of the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils, also express the need for the creation of such a network."
"The Commission, therefore, looks favourably on the initiative adopted by the Greek Government to table this proposal."
"We share the idea, as emphasised by the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, that some rules contained in this initiative, in particular as regards the system of information exchanges between liaison officers, are sometimes excessively vague."
"Taken as a whole, however, we believe the text provides a good working basis for more structured and better coordinated cooperation with third countries in the field of immigration."
"This coordination will become even more important in future with the new requirements that will shortly be adopted on the policy of visas being issued in third countries."
"Once this regulation is approved, immigration liaison officers posted to third countries must form effective networks for cooperation at local or regional level on the basis of the positive precedent set by the network established in the Western Balkans at the initiative of the United Kingdom and which has shown positive results in regulating immigration from that region to the States of the European Union."
". Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed the proposal for a regulation implementing an initiative by the Hellenic Republic, as decided at the Thessaloniki summit, on the crucial social and political issue of illegal immigration."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs has unanimously accepted certain amendments, most of which have also been accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and will, I hope, also be accepted by Parliament, and which improve the regulation."
"There have been previous proceedings on the matter in the European Union at previous Councils, but there was no agreement, meaning that our debate today positively ratifies a political wish of the European Union."
"This directive, without bringing a final result as a whole and a full political answer to the issue, is nonetheless a first important step forward."
"In one way, it communitises this policy and creates prospects for further improvements."
"The proposals by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, will, I hope, improve the regulation, making it more transparent and more democratic, with the safeguarding of parliamentary control and with cooperation which respects the legal order in the countries which will operate these networks."
"The operation of these networks will allow for better management of the resources made available by the European Union for this issue, will improve relations between the European Union and the countries in which the networks operate and may facilitate the foreign policy of the European Union by unifying it on this issue and by making it transparent to the countries, thereby facilitating our relations with them."
"In addition, given that various other illegal and criminal activities are carried out alongside illegal immigration which violate basic human rights and debase human dignity, such as trafficking in women and drugs, the modern slave trade etc., the proper application of the present regulation will offer positive services here too."
"Honourable Members, we constantly witness thousands of drownings on our shores or in our border rivers, deaths in containers, on the shores of the Mediterranean or the Channel or in inaccessible mountains."
"I hope that the proper application of this regulation, together with other supporting policies to develop and democratise the countries of origin of illegal immigrants, will significantly improve the deeper social and political problem which affects our societies and provides a breeding ground for a climate of racism and xenophobia which is an insult to the humanitarian and democratic values of European political and social civilisation."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and also thank her for the good relationship she has had with the rapporteur for this group, accepting many of the amendments and proposals we have presented in committee."
"I agree that this proposal is important, and the creation of this network of liaison officers is important, particularly in view of the fact that we have decided we have discussed this here many times on the importance of communication and communication strategy in the countries in which immigration originates, providing information on the means of legal entry and on the dangers and deceptions surrounding illegal immigration."
"I would like to point out that in this very Parliament we recently approved a resolution on the European Union's information and communication strategy, and that Recital N stated that immigration policy and respect for human rights were considered a priority within the Union’s information policy, and furthermore called on the Commission to make its offices in the countries in which immigration originates partly an antenna for informing these countries of the means for legal access to Europe and of the dangers involved in illegal immigration."
"I therefore believe that the amendments which have been introduced in this regard into the rapporteur’s report are particularly important, and oblige the Commission to participate, in some way, in the meetings of liaison officers, and provide it with the opportunity to inform citizens of these countries in which immigration originates of the means for legal entry and of the dangers of illegal immigration."
"On the other hand, I believe that perhaps one of the amendments presented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs is rather over the top insofar as it could constitute a first step towards the creation of a European Union foreign service, but it is the case that these liaison officers, with the support of the offices of the Commission in relation to information and coordination, are without doubt a first step towards the creation of this Community immigration policy which we all want to see."
"In this way, we want the countries in which immigration originates to see Europe as a single region and for the offices of the Commission to act as a coordinator to some extent of the immigration policy which we all want the European Union to have."
"Finally, I believe it is important and I wish to address this to the Commissioner to accept that the countries which do not have representatives in the countries in which immigration originates may delegate that task to liaison officers from another country which does have representation in that country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have on several occasions expressed our concern that the Union’s external borders constitute one of the weakest links in the system for creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"We therefore support all initiatives that could contribute to strengthening control of the Union’s external borders, which is crucial."
"As Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, the Seville European Council called for a network of immigration liaison officers to be created and the Thessaloniki conclusions stated the need to speed up work on adopting a legal instrument by the end of 2003."
"Hence the report that we are examining today and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Roure on her work."
"Informal cooperation between immigration liaison officers already exists and this initiative is intended to give this cooperation a framework that will formalise it and strengthen it."
"This network of officers can and must contribute to preventing illegal immigration and to combating this phenomenon, to help in the return of illegal immigrants and to the management of legal immigration."
"We want to develop a proactive policy for legal immigration, and at the same time effectively combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"I must once again express my regret that, because trafficking in human beings falls under the third pillar, it cannot be included in the scope of this regulation amongst the responsibilities of liaison officers."
"Once again, we are facing an absurd situation due to the division of issues between the three pillars, a distinction which, once again, is pointless and counterproductive."
"I also wish to emphasise that preventing illegal immigration requires the existence of legal channels of immigration and properly-targeted information campaigns in order to act as a deterrent to potential candidates for immigration."
"We can and must avoid further tragedies such as some that are still fresh in our minds."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0361/2003) by Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union (2003/2179(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance and significance of the recommendation we are debating today."
"What we are dealing with today is the first initiative, in the form of a Green Paper, aimed at considering, together with other instruments, the future proposal for a framework decision which will regulate – as its title states – the minimum rules on the procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union."
"Judicial cooperation between the States of the European Union, in both the civil and the criminal fields, is reaching levels which were unimaginable a few years ago."
"These levels will reach their peak when, at the beginning of 2004, the European arrest warrant enters into force, if things go to plan and despite certain difficulties which appear to remain in certain Member States."
"This is why, at the moment, when the construction of the European area of freedom, security and justice is making progress, and concern about terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration is increasing, we are seeing greater cooperation between police and judicial bodies of the Member States and it is becoming essential that we do not continue to ignore the necessary safeguards which suspects and defendants must enjoy during the criminal proceedings so that their right to a fair and impartial trial is guaranteed at all times."
"The purpose of the recommendations we are debating today is, therefore, simply to achieve a degree of unification of procedural practices in the Member States, on the basis of the rights established in the European Convention on Human Rights, the case-law of the Strasbourg Court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and within the framework of the judicial and criminal convergence which today is being achieved in the European Union, based on mutual recognition, described as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in the civil and criminal fields in the Union by the Tampere European Council."
"It was at that same important European Council that the foundations were laid which have led us to be here today discussing the minimum procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings in the Union, since there was insistence there on the need to carry out work in relation to aspects of procedural law with regard to which it is considered necessary to have minimum common standards in order to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, respecting the fundamental legal principles of the Member States."
"The Green Paper sets out the reasons why the proposals have been restricted to the five rights which appear in it: legal aid, translation and interpreting, information about rights, the protection of vulnerable suspects and defendants and consular assistance."
"I wonder, Commissioner, Mr President, whether it would not have also been useful to have in some way considered the types of crime which affect all or the majority of States, which, to a certain extent, would have complemented the necessary unification of procedural practices."
"The admissibility and weight of evidence, judgments in absentia and the regulation of bail are being left for a subsequent occasion and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner how that work is going – and these are issues which certain groups have been determined to include in the recommendation, despite the fact that that is not its purpose."
"I believe that the approach which has been taken in drawing up the Green Paper is sensible, because it is still an undeniable reality that criminal jurisdiction is the central core of the sovereignty of the States, and is therefore very inflexible when it comes to establishing substantial common procedures and systems."
"And, although the idiosyncrasies of each European society and their own legal cultures must be seen as reasons for this resistance, it is also the case that the criminal process is a system which imposes limits on the State, which is a measure of the quality of that State in terms of the Rule of Law and respect for the citizen, something which this House, as the ultimate expression of its will, must always defend."
"There is, therefore, no question that this is a timely proposal, something which cannot lead us to think that the instruments approved so far – such as the European arrest warrant – have meant any undermining of the fundamental rights and safeguards of our citizens, but which nevertheless does make it necessary for progress in this direction to be complemented by a degree of unification of procedural safeguards."
"That aside, I must reject the two amendments presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which are aimed at making the entry into force of the European arrest warrant conditional upon the entry into force of the framework decision on procedural safeguards."
"I reject these amendments because the scheduled date for the entry into force of the European arrest warrant is January 2004 and because the arrest warrant in itself is based on reciprocal trust between the different judicial systems of the Member States, even though it is essential that the implementation of the minimum standards imposed by the framework decision is carried out urgently and as soon as possible."
"I just wanted to stress the most controversial point and the point which has given rise to the greatest discrepancies between certain political groups."
"Finally, I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank the political groups for the practically unanimous support this report has received in committee and which I hope will be reproduced tomorrow."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar, for his excellent report."
"The Commission shares his view about the crucial importance of setting common minimum standards on procedural safeguards."
"This is vital to ensure the mutual trust which forms the basis of the measures set out in the mutual recognition programme of which the European arrest warrant was the first to reach political agreement."
"A common set of minimum standards on safeguards is necessary to ensure that the fundamental rights of European Union citizens are respected in an equivalent way in the 25 Member States."
"A proposal for a framework decision is planned by the Commission as a follow-up measure to the Green Paper if the main ideas that we have put forward deserve the support of this Parliament."
"A measure of this sort was envisaged at the Tampere European Council, hence the references to protecting the rights of individuals."
"This measure does not, in fact, go further than the already existing provisions the European Convention on Human Rights and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations."
"It will highlight what is seen at EU level as essential for a fair trial and it will make mutual recognition measures operate more smoothly, since Member States will be more willing to accept that other Member States have proper safeguards in place."
"Regarding the recommendation made by the rapporteur to include provisions governing other fundamental rights such as the right to bail, or rules on the admissibility of evidence, the Commission explains in the Green Paper that these two very important areas will indeed be the subject of separate measures of their own in order to do them justice."
"The work on the right to bail, which also covers detention conditions, forms the subject matter of a measure in the mutual recognition programme and will be more appropriately dealt with as a single issue."
"I can even tell the honourable Members of the House that the Commission has presented a questionnaire to the Member States on this specific issue."
"We have received the first answers and we will be presenting a first evaluation of these to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will meet tomorrow morning here in Brussels."
"A communication on the subject is included in the Commission's work programme for 2003."
"In the work programme for this year, there is also a Green Paper on the approximation, execution and recognition of criminal sanctions in the European Union."
"This is designed to ensure equality of treatment for convicted persons throughout the European Union so that, for example, those sentenced in a Member State other than their own are not discriminated against by virtue of their foreign nationality."
"Regarding fairness in handling evidence, this area is too vast to be covered in a Green Paper that already proposes several rights, as does the current one."
"The Commission therefore decided to devote more time to this topic and conduct a specific study as soon as the first stage of the procedural safeguard work was complete."
"The Commission has now started work on a study of safeguards on fairness in the gathering and handling of evidence."
"This will cover, inter alia, the right to silence, the right to hear witnesses, the problem of anonymous witnesses, the right to disclosure of exculpatory evidence, how the presumption of innocence is to be understood, whether there are circumstances where the burden of proof may be reversed, and many other aspects of the law of evidence."
"This is one of the most complex issues in penal law."
"Regarding the principle, an initiative tabled by the former Greek presidency is currently being discussed in the appropriate Council bodies and, once again, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will discuss this Greek initiative tomorrow."
"Finally, on the questions of the conditions of prisoners in the European Union, the Commission recently prepared and sent a questionnaire on this issue to the competent authorities of the Member States."
"The replies to this questionnaire are now arriving and are a useful source of information which is being taken into account in the process of preparation of the two Green Papers mentioned on pre-trial detention and approximation, mutual recognition and enforcement of sanctions."
". Mr President, I have taken the floor to stress the importance of this Green Paper – for I feel it is my duty to do so – and, therefore, to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the contribution he has made with this Green Paper to the building of an area of freedom and justice."
"I would also like to thank Mr Hernández Mollar for incorporating the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which was the fruit of extensive, in-depth analysis, extensive debate and great understanding of the issue."
"He reiterated just now that we need to call strongly for criminal procedure to provide substantial criminal , because that is the way to be able to provide safeguards, to achieve, indeed, what we see as a minimum level of reliability and minimum safeguards."
"The intention of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in producing this opinion was to stress and emphasise the need to protect the freedom of defendants."
"We are aware that the institutions describe themselves in these terms, that legal civilisation, the rule of law, prevails, and these safeguards are essential to and representative of a fair trial, which is the subject of so much discussion and, I believe, must be our ultimate goal as regards procedure."
"The Green Paper represents a change of course, Commissioner Vitorino, a radical change of course from tendencies which are not quite democratic, giving precedence to powers of investigation and investigation alone, also in a supranational form."
"The European Prosecutor for criminal protection against fraud is an example of this point, which I have already made on other occasions in this Chamber and in other debates."
"All the provisions laid down have already been mentioned, but the right to immediate defence, the right to assistance, the language guarantee and other similar matters form the essential elements of this measure, and I would stress them once again."
"What we must emphasise are not just cooperation and coordination between the Member States but definitive recognition of final criminal decisions, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is working to this end."
"To sum up, Mr President, we must ensure that the level of protection of rights provided is higher rather than lower."
"To this end, we must take into account the safeguards provided by some Member States and ensure that Europe as a whole focuses its approach on that dimension and those rights."
"The Europe of rights and freedoms demands it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar, on the merit, quality and enormous usefulness of his report."
"In building an area of freedom, security and justice, citizens’ fundamental rights must always be fully respected and safeguarded and the principles governing a fair trial must be duly confirmed."
"This initiative consequently represents a further important step towards creating a genuine European area of justice by defining a set of minimum standards in the field of procedural safeguards in the Member States."
"This is an attempt to ensure homogenous protection throughout the Union of the individual rights of those accused, sentenced or convicted in criminal proceedings."
"Adopting these common standards is crucial to increasing the confidence and the faith which members of the public and the judicial authorities in one Member State have in the legal systems of all the other Member States."
"The Community judicial instrument on which these common standards will be based is intended to improve procedural safeguards throughout the territory of the Union without lowering the level of protection that is guaranteed in the various Member States."
"Mr Hernández Mollar has already referred to some of the relevant areas but I would like to highlight legal aid, the right to an interpreter and/or translator, the protection of particularly vulnerable categories – such as minors, persons with disabilities, the illiterate consular assistance and the duty to inform everyone of their rights."
"The problem with these standards is not, in many cases, that they do not exist but rather hinges on the shortcomings in the way they are applied. The framework decisions must consequently include provisions that can be implemented effectively and sanctions, and must consider other fundamental rights of suspects and defendants in addition to those that have already been mentioned."
"In this context, the PPE-DE will, of course, vote in favour of the Hernández Mollar report."
"Mr President, I believe that the motion for a resolution contained in Mr Hernández Mollar’s report considerably enhances the Commission’s Green Paper on procedural safeguards, thanks, not least, to the contribution of numerous amendments by all the political groups."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Hernández Mollar for his work."
"As I have said, it considerably enhances the report, not just because the resolution contains a clear call for the adoption of a framework decision on common minimum standards, and not just because it also points out the elements still lacking – as the Commission, itself, recognises – in the building of a complete system of common minimum guarantees securing the basic European rights ensuring a fair trial."
"The list of these rights must be extended to the issues related to admissibility and weight of evidence, to the criteria for pre-emptive detention, to the actual conditions of detention, as well as to the right of appeal, which is important especially in terms of individual freedom."
"The principal contribution made by the draft resolution is the detailed identification of the specific content of the rights already examined by the Green Paper: legal assistance and defence, which must be free of charge for those who need it and be provided by expert professionals; the guarantee of full, adequate interpreting for speakers of other languages; the right to consular assistance and to adequate protection for vulnerable persons, especially – but not solely – minors."
"Then, particularly innovative and of particular interest is the proposal for a written letter of rights stating the rights of suspects and defendants, to be handed to the defendant or suspect at the first contact with the authorities in proceedings concerning them and which must be detailed and available in several languages."
"As we know, all the Member States are bound to abide by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Court of Justice, with its elaborate case law, monitors respect for the Convention, but that is not enough."
"The irreconcilable differences between the systems, procedures and legal traditions themselves raises concerns that undermine the confidence that the European citizens must be able to place in the Member States’ legal systems if the necessary cooperation based on mutual recognition of the judicial measures of the different countries is to develop in a territory which no longer has internal borders."
"To this end, there is an urgent need, in order to ensure both the freedom and the security of the citizens, for minimum common standards to be introduced to establish at European level the high standards of procedural safeguards which Europe prides itself on guaranteeing to all – both citizens and non-citizens – who come into contact with its legal systems."
"I can therefore inform you that my group is going to vote for the Hernández Mollar report."
"– Mr President, my group is delighted with the report and we would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hernandez-Mollar, on his work."
"I should also like to congratulate the Commission on its efforts in this area, and I hope that it will maintain a high level of ambition, both in terms of the ultimate framework decision on minimum standards for the rights of suspects, and in decisions that will subsequently need to be taken."
"I sincerely hope that we can look forward to sound proposals in the near future, also in respect of research methods, admissibility and weight of evidence."
"My group takes the view that European agreements on matters of this kind are vital, because the Member States decided in Tampere to recognise each other's judicial decisions and to implement them unconditionally."
"The most poignant example of this is the European arrest warrant, to which a number of references have been made."
"This means that Member States implement each other's requests for extradition almost automatically, without verifying whether the evidence has been obtained lawfully or checking whether the suspect can rely on a fair trial in accordance with the standards of the extraditing state, because this is all done on the basis of trust."
"Mr Hernandez-Mollar, you stated that this trust is in place, but I think that this trust, which is desirable especially in a political context, is not sufficiently in place or sufficiently substantiated."
"For example, looking at it from my own country's perspective, there has been a great deal of protest against a sentence passed on a Dutchman in Austria on the basis of only one witness statement and against the long-term detention of British and Dutch plane spotters in Greece."
"There will be similar examples like these in various other countries too."
"This shows how important it is that we first conclude agreements on minimum standards for the rights of the suspects before we start extraditing our own nationals in this way, without prescribing any further conditions."
"I would therefore urge you to reconsider our amendment."
"I know that many Member States would actually like to raise objections and that they are a little nervous about the European framework decision on procedural law."
"I find this really regrettable and also incomprehensible."
"I put it down to unnecessary interference from Brussels, but surely it is absurd that they themselves have already taken that step of a European arrest warrant, which is a very far-reaching measure on the road of European cooperation in the judicial sphere, and are now refusing to restore the balance between repression and civil rights, in respect of which civil rights agreements should be made at European level too."
"It is therefore up to us MEPs to ensure that these civil rights are not brushed under the carpet, but that the balance is restored."
"Mr President, on the eve of the entry into force of the European arrest warrant, Parliament is expressing its opinion on a European Commission communication on procedural safeguards and the rights of the defence."
"Despite your efforts, Commissioner, the planned framework decision on the matter has not yet been formally presented and, in its initial discussions, the Council has proved to be extremely divided over the need for and content of harmonised rights of defence."
"This is the context in which we are operating, and, in this context, we want to point out the position adopted by the Italian Minister for Justice, who, after personally endorsing the European arrest warrant in the Council, stated that he finds it unconstitutional in form and an out-and-out mistake as regards content."
"I believe that there would have been no legal or political grounds for these worrying statements if the Commission and the Council had listened to Parliament’s requests regarding the harmonisation of procedural rights."
"I am afraid, however, that it is too late and that the European arrest warrant will enter into force in a European climate marked by reluctance and delays in implementation on the part of the Member States."
"Despite the excellent work of Mr Hernández Mollar and taking into consideration the powerful arguments put forward by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, the Radical Members will only vote for the motion if the amendments calling for the entry into force of the arrest warrant to be made subject to the adoption of procedural safeguards are adopted."
"Mr President, first of all there is a debate over whether the European Union should be discussing things in relation to common standards on procedural law."
"In reality, however, we also have to realise that a lot of oppressive legislation has been brought in recently just one of the things mentioned tonight is the European arrest warrant and at the very least we need something to counterbalance that to ensure the rights of suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings."
"This goes some way towards ensuring that in methods of investigation, for example, there is some sort of standard."
"There also needs to be an assurance in many Member States in relation to the right to bail: I believe people should have this right."
"As many speakers have mentioned, we know that in many situations there are problems regarding access to legal representatives before and during trials."
"We need to ensure that this is not the case."
"Something needs to be put in there to guarantee the rights of suspects, because at the end of the day they are suspects: they have not been convicted and therefore their rights should be protected."
"When we take into consideration the fact that a lot of repressive legislation has been passed by the European Union in recent times without any public debate or any real participation by the citizens in the Member States, the very least we can do is ensure that the rights of people are protected."
"The same goes for interpretation and translation for many defendants."
"This is the situation in many countries as a result of the legislation has been brought in under the guise of combating terrorism."
"Many of these people who are suspects do not have the right to proper interpretation or translation and, therefore, these people cannot be guaranteed the right to a fair trial, or the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any doubt."
"Unless we in the European Union actually ensure that these kinds of measures are protected, we cannot push for any other oppressive legislation."
"As some people here have mentioned in relation to the European arrest warrant, there should be pre-conditions attached to that."
"I do not actually favour the European arrest warrant but, at the very least, minimum guarantees have to be put in place before any more legislation is agreed by the European Union."
"The Union has, over the last months and years, infringed on people's very basic rights, which are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are basic things that anybody in a democracy would feel entitled to."
". Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"First of all, I should like to reiterate my congratulations to Mr Hernández Mollar for his report and say that everything concerning the work on evidence will be done during 2004."
"This is clearly stated in our legislative programme, and that is what I said to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs during our structural dialogue on the priorities for next year."
"In parallel terms, I can say that the Green Paper on bail is ready and will have to be discussed by the Commission."
"I believe it will be adopted in the first few months of 2004."
"To Mr Turco I should like to say that I do not even dare to imagine what would have been said if I had presented the Framework Decision before seeking the opinion of this Parliament on the Green Paper: first things first!"
"Provided you vote favourably as regards the Green Paper tomorrow I can guarantee you, Mr Turco, that the Framework Decision has arrived."
"I can assure you that we have not been sleeping, but if you endorse our ideas the legislative instrument is ready to be presented to the Council."
"Finally, this is not the best hour of the day to disagree with Mrs Buitenweg or Mrs McKenna about the European arrest warrant."
"This has been a long-standing point of difference between us."
"Nevertheless, I will clearly say that I would not call a European arrest warrant 'oppressive legislation'."
"I do not intend to subscribe to such an approach because legislation that aims to reinforce law enforcement cannot be considered purely as oppressive legislation."
"There might be misuse of legislation, and that is precisely why we are adopting these minimum rules on procedural safeguards."
"That is also why we have an ambitious programme to bring together the legislation of Member States as far as procedural guarantees are concerned."
"I hope that Parliament will endorse Mr Hernández Mollar's report tomorrow."
"That will help the Commission to bypass some of the resistance expressed by some Member States as far as this initiative is concerned."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0360/2003) by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharges to be given for the financial year 2001 to: 1. the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (C5-0102/2003 – 2003/2046(DEC)) 2. the European Environment Agency (C5-0098/2003 – 2003/2044(DEC)) 3. the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union (C5-0100/2003 – 2003/2045(DEC)) 4. the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (C5-0096/2003 – 2003/2043(DEC)) 5. the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (C5-0094/2003 – 2003/2042(DEC))."
"Mr President, this is the first time that we are to give discharge to these five agencies, and it is a new situation to which both parties must accustom themselves."
"The agencies must firstly be responsible to Parliament, and that entails obligations."
"I have had a constructive dialogue with several of the agencies."
"I have had good, profitable meetings with the Working Environment Agency in Bilbao, the Monitoring Centre on Racism in Vienna, the Environment Agency in Copenhagen and, in particular, the Business Education Centre in Turin."
"All these agencies deserve special praise for their very proactive approach."
"I wish to recommend that we give discharge to all the agencies concerned."
"We have no major, outstanding problems with the individual agencies."
"We do, however, have an outstanding problem with the Environment Agency which has had several contracts with firms that have also had contracts with Eurostat firms that are at the moment being investigated by the Commission’s internal auditing service for involvement in the Eurostat scandal."
"The internal auditing service’s final report confirms that the Environment Agency’s contracts with these firms are very worrying."
"The service has promised to investigate the matter more closely, and that is something we are obviously pleased about."
"It is generally true to say that all the agencies are in a transitional phase, and they must adjust to the new Financial Regulation."
"The different agencies have chosen different models, but what is common to all the agencies is that they themselves are now responsible for financial control."
"There will no longer be external, independent control of the agencies."
"That is something we in Parliament have accepted as part of the new Financial Regulation."
"I am, however, concerned that a gap in control will come about."
"The Commission’s internal auditing service has absolutely no resources for looking at the individual transactions."
"Mr Muis made this very clear at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The internal auditing service has no resources at all for investigating the control procedures in the agencies."
"The Court of Auditors carries out very few control checks."
"We are therefore very dependent upon the agencies’ internal control operating properly."
"It will be up to the future discharge draftsmen to assess whether the system will work in practice."
"I want, however, right now to sound a warning."
"The agencies will have no controllers."
"An internal auditor, functioning as a consultant, is excellent now at the beginning, when the agencies are to set up new systems, but it is much better in the long term to have a controller rather than a consultant."
"Parliament must have more influence on the appointment of the agencies’ directors, and I am therefore pleased that we are asking the Commission to produce a proposal, something that is to be done before December of this year."
"That is something we approved unanimously in the committee."
"The agencies have had many important tasks transferred to them, so we must also ensure that they are led by competent people."
"I am therefore in favour of Parliament’s being consulted on the appointment of the directors."
"I am not perhaps as much in favour as some of my fellow MEPs of Parliament’s approving all the directors in turn, for we should then be attaching too much importance to the agencies."
"We do not, of course, even approve the Commissioners on a one-by-one basis, but if, for example, my esteemed fellow MEP’s, Mr Bösch’s, proposal that we should be involved in appointing them directly were to go through, I should have absolutely nothing against that."
"I would, however, recommend us to vote in favour of the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, proposing that Parliament be consulted but that it be the Commission that takes the decision."
"I am well aware that my fellow MEPs may perhaps be rather opposed to this amendment, believing that the Commission would be given too much power if it had to decide by itself, but I do in actual fact believe that it is primarily the Commission’s task to appoint its own people."
"We must not get involved in too many internal micromanagement decisions."
"We must instead devote our energies to monitoring the Commission, and that is something for which there is of course an absolute need in view of the way in which the Eurostat scandal has developed and the way in which all the Commissioners are disclaiming any form of political responsibility and are blaming the system."
"Basically, we should ask ourselves whether, in the end, we are good enough to control these agencies and whether we, generally speaking, have need for them all."
"This is an issue concerning which they have agreed to produce a cost-benefit analysis."
"I should, then, like to conclude by saying that the Business Development Centre in Turin has suggested that it might itself easily undertake more tasks, instead of our setting about establishing more agencies."
"Let us listen to what it says, and let us hope that the Commission will make a point of listening to ourselves."
"Mr President, the Commission is committed to satisfy, as far as possible, Parliament's requests regarding recurrent issues such as Commission proposals aiming at fostering better functioning of Community bodies."
"Decentralised Community bodies have specific missions according to their respective founding regulations."
"Any modification and/or addition of tasks would require an amendment to the legal acts setting up the agency, which requires legislative procedure to be followed, in some cases falling under co-decision."
"The Commission considers the composition of the administrative boards of agencies to be a cross-cutting issue which should be addressed in the follow-up to its communication on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies."
"In view of enlargement, the communication argues in favour of an administrative board of reduced size with a composition reflecting the balance between the executive functions at Community level and the expertise of Member States' executives."
"The Commission is expecting a reaction to this proposal from Council and Parliament before deciding on its final line."
"In this communication the Commission proposed that a director should be appointed, depending on the case, by the management board or by the Commission."
"Parliament should be involved in this appointment procedure."
"At the moment this document is under consideration by the European Parliament and by Council."
"A possible action in this field ought to be undertaken in the light of the forthcoming discussions with those institutions."
"As regards the internal auditor proposal, according to the Financial Regulation, the Commission's internal auditor shall exercise exactly the same powers in the agencies receiving Community financial support as he does within the Commission."
"Only two agencies which do not receive subsidies from the Commission are not concerned, those at Angers and at Alicante."
"As regards the proposal to use the European Foundation for Training's expertise in relation to programmes such as Tempus and Erasmus Mundus, according to the new general Financial Regulation, the Commission can in fact call for technical assistance to be delegated to existing agencies."
"However, recourse to an agency does not relieve the Commission of its obligations under the Treaty, in particular, to implement the budget under its own responsibility."
"It must therefore be able closely to circumscribe the action of the body responsible for technical assistance tasks and maintain real control over its operation and, in particular, its governing bodies."
"The governing bodies of the decentralised agencies are composed of representatives of the Member States: the Commission is in a minority and there are questions as to whether this enables it to exercise the requisite level of accountability and control."
"In accordance with the provisions of the framework regulation on executive agencies, the Commission is at present examining the creation of a dedicated agency to assist in the implementation of Community programmes in the field of education and culture, such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Youth etc."
"A cost-benefit analysis is being carried out with the help of external experts, also taking into account the functions and mandate of the European Training Foundation, the localisation of technical assistance functions for all these programmes will be decided by the Commission next year in the light of the results of the cost-benefit analysis and, in particular, the considerations of effectiveness, efficiency, control and accountability."
"The Commission will endeavour to follow up on all these issues as well as resolutions from the European Parliament in due time."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I am pleased that today’s agenda also includes the discharge of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work."
"This meets our central demand from last year, namely that there should be an individual discharge procedure for all decentralised agencies, thereby at last having equal treatment for the agencies."
"My committee is of course in favour of discharge for the agency in Bilbao, just as is the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We therefore also agree with the verdict of the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the Council."
"Let me say a few words about this Agency, which was created in 1997."
"Bilbao has now become the driving force in the field of safety and health at work."
"I need only mention its outstanding work in implementing the special programme for SMEs in 2001 and 2002."
"The splendid work it has done was also confirmed by an external evaluation."
"It was therefore only logical that in our resolution on the Community strategy for health and safety at work for the period 2002-2006 in October last year we called on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises in the future."
"It is of course clear that there must in future too be the best possible coordination between the agencies in Bilbao and Dublin."
"Even though there are no grounds for criticism from our point of view, we welcome the fact that the two agencies have concluded a specific cooperation agreement in order to improve complementarity and banish all danger of overlapping in their work."
"But we shall remain very vigilant here, especially in the light of enlargement and a possible redefinition of agency policy."
"Mr President, I cannot tell you how excited I am to be here this evening to talk on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on this subject."
"I can see that it is a subject that brings great excitement to the rest of the parliamentarians and indeed the massive audience that we have here tonight."
"One actually wonders whether these late-night sessions put our European taxpayers’ money to good use."
"I shall bend over backwards to do my bit and I will start by giving thanks to the rapporteur for all the work he has put into this."
"I welcome the fact that the new Financial Regulation gives us the power to scrutinise these agencies’ accounts and I also welcome the cooperative way in which they all worked with the European Parliament in this process."
"Because of this autonomy from the normal management framework of the Commission, the choice of director, I believe, is a crucially important one."
"The appointment must be by open process and must involve the European Parliament."
"Indeed, Parliament should have the right to give its assent to such appointments and that is why the PPE-DE Group will vote to reject the Liberal amendment."
"Although it contains some interesting ideas about the structure of hearings in the Parliament, it only proposes to give the European Parliament consultative status."
"The PPE part of the PPE-DE Group is in favour of discharge for the agencies for numerous reasons, many of which I do not understand, considering in general terms that the state of the Commission’s accounts is just a pile of pants I am using colloquialisms to give the interpreters a test at this time in the evening."
"Although the bulk of the PPE Group is for discharge, there are, however, some concerns that we would like to lay on the table for the future."
"We want to ensure that there will always be the highest management standards, in particular by these agencies cooperating fully with OLAF, by sharing best practice amongst themselves because many of the management challenges are very similar and by ensuring that their boards are an effective instrument to hold management to account and are not just a bureaucratic and cosmetic gesture."
"Some boards are already too big, especially that of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work, and enlargement risks making this worse."
"If boards become too big to assume their responsibilities in practice, agencies become vulnerable to become private fiefdoms an example of which we have seen in Eurostat."
"We would like to see people cooperating closely to avoid duplication for example, the Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions."
"I think the Commission should look at this."
"The highest standards of financial management should be ensured in particular by strengthening internal audit capacities."
"We would like to see the European Court of Auditors conducting more checks."
"I thank the rapporteur for all his work."
"The British Conservative delegation the hopefully ever-growing DE will not be voting to grant discharge, but the PPE will be doing so, and we thank you for all your work."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Blak on his report."
"I agree with the essence of what Mr Heaton-Harris has said."
"The new Financial Regulation makes it possible to include the Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the Environment Agency, the Translation Centre, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in the European Parliament’s discharge procedure for the first time."
"I expressly welcome the fact that all the agencies are now discharged by Parliament, as the most recent cases of internal irregularities in the Commission clearly show how important it is to have ongoing checks of the institutions."
"This innovation is doubtless important, but can be only the first step."
"A second innovation, an equally essential requirement, is that Parliament must be given a power of codecision in the appointment of directors."
"It is a contradiction for Parliament to have a say in appointing the ombudsman and the Commission President, while having no such right in respect of the agencies."
"We know there is a tendency for agencies to proliferate."
"There are more and more of them."
"These agencies are evidently to be given their own legal personality."
"As a Parliament, therefore, as taxpayers’ representatives, we must insist on having a power of codecision in them, in the way they are appointed."
"I have had a printout made of the various agencies we have at the moment."
"There is a first generation, to which Thessaloniki and Dublin belong, then a second generation with Copenhagen, Turin and I do not know who else, agencies not receiving a subsidy from the new budget, which you have already mentioned, Alicante and Angers, Codecision EP and Council, Brussels, Brussels temporarily."
"That is all those agencies like the European Food Safety Authority or the European Maritime Safety Agency, where they have said they will do something but they do not yet know where or when or how."
"That is an offence against Europe’s taxpayers."
"That is not addressed to you, but we do of course know that these agencies will have to start work somewhere sometime, and the Member States have proclaimed at the tops of their voices that they will, but they do not know when, they do not know where and they do not know how much it will cost."
"We have to be concerned about that, and the Social Democrats in this House, like the Christian Democrats, as Mr Heaton-Harris has said, will be insisting that we have a power of codecision here and we shall be pressing very hard for it."
"Reiterated congratulations, by the way, to Mr Blak on his report."
"Mr President, I too am concerned that there is so little interest in discussing this type of matter, but I wonder whether this is a consequence of the way in which our activities are timetabled or of our approach to these matters."
"Ultimately, what is at stake is basically the use of taxpayers’ money."
"I therefore believe that the European Parliament’s discharge of the budget must always allow for meaningful political debate."
"Fortunately, this has to some extent happened – quite recently – thereby contributing to the credibility of Community budgetary policy."
"Our examination of the budget of the five agencies that are the subject of this report should be seen in the context of these objectives and is geared towards achieving these priorities."
"All of the report’s proposals to grant discharge are accompanied by Parliamentary motions for resolutions and it is precisely in these motions for resolution that Parliament must exercise its political power."
"It can do so by drawing up recommendations or by expressing the hope that the activities of the agencies take a particular direction, both as regards the need to improve internal operations and supervision and the urgent need to increase their effectiveness in undertaking these activities."
"The report makes various observations and suggestions – which I will not list, because I have so little time – praising the words and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the European Agency responsible for health and safety in the workplace."
"There is, however, one aspect of a general nature that I believe warrants particular mention."
"This is the report’s proposal to change the composition of the agencies’ boards of administration, so as to ensure that they have more of a role."
"There are many financial reasons for such action, and in some cases operational reasons, which would mean that these boards could not function if they were larger than a certain size."
"Symptomatically, these concerns arise, as the Commissioner’s speech has just made clear, at a time when we are rapidly approaching a process of welcoming – at political level – new countries into the Community family."
"Without denying the validity of these concerns, the European Parliament must cautiously reflect on the true nature of the positions it will be adopting, because options that take a purely economic view are quite unacceptable."
"Safeguarding the principle of representativeness and total equality between Member States is, in the current context, absolutely crucial."
"Mr President, just a brief comment."
"I was very pleased with a lot of what the Commissioner said, but I really have to say how deeply disappointed I am that, following the debate in the committee, the bombshell has been dropped that the Commission wishes to set up a new agency for education and culture."
"This work could easily, of course, have been done by the other agencies."
"This means that horse-trading of one kind or another is now to be engaged in."
"We should like to have been informed of this in the committee, rather than get to hear about it in this House today, just before the whole matter is to be decided."
"It is disappointing."
"Really disappointing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0265/2003) by Mrs Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on taxation of passenger cars in the European Union (COM(2002) 431 C5-0573/2002 2002/2260(INI))."
". Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to present my report on taxation of passenger cars and echo the concerns of Mr Heaton-Harris about the lateness of the hour and the inevitable lack of an audience here."
"However, I thank those of you who have stayed."
"I would like to start by making it absolutely clear that this report is not about tax harmonisation."
"This report is about the internal market."
"It is about ensuring that the internal market operates fairly in terms of passenger cars and that the current obstacles which are there, in part, in the range of taxation currently levied, are evened out so that the internal market in this particular area is enabled to function much better than it does at the moment."
"The other issue in this report is environmental."
"It is actually about CO2 emissions from passenger cars and the way in which taxation can be used to deal with this and to improve our environment."
"I turn first to the internal market questions and particularly the issue of registration tax on cars which I recommend should be abolished."
"This report suggests that it be phased out over a long period."
"At the moment, the different levels of registration tax in differing Member States distort very markedly indeed the price of cars."
"In Finland, for instance, registration tax for new vehicles is over EUR 700, in Portugal it is over EUR 2 000 and in the UK we do not have a registration tax at all."
"What inevitably happens is that people who sell cars vary the prices to take account of registration tax in various Member States."
"The way to deal with this and to make the internal market fairer and more of a level playing field is to do away with this tax altogether, but to do it gradually."
"One thing that we need to avoid is for the Member States to be out of pocket as a result of this measure."
"Therefore it needs careful phasing-in and it needs to ensure that it is actually tax and revenue neutral, and no country is worse off by implementing this."
"This can be done, but obviously it will take time."
"No-one is suggesting that this be introduced tomorrow, but I recommend that the process be set in train so that as far as sales on new cars are concerned, we will eventually get to the position where registration tax is phased out."
"We need to look at the same issue in terms of second-hand cars and cars which go across borders."
"The same principles apply, although again this will need to be looked at and phased in."
"We are looking at doing the same kind of thing, so that the current restrictions and difficulties that people within the EU have in crossing borders with cars and needing to re-register etc., are eventually also phased out."
"This, of course, will aid not only the internal market, but also free movement of people and labour within the EU."
"On all levels it is something which we would welcome."
"As far as the environmental aspect of this report is concerned, this is something which concerns me very much as a representative of London, one of the major cities in the EU, obviously contending with car pollution all the time and always looking for ways of dealing with it."
"Members may or may not know that there is a tax in the UK on petrol to take account of CO2 emissions a green tax which works very well."
"This can be done because it is very self-contained, it is tax on a particular product."
"If we did this throughout the EU it would go a long way towards reducing CO2 emissions and would be a very positive benefit to our environment."
"Those are my two recommendations in this report."
"I believe we are doing a good thing here: it is not about tax harmonisation, it is about the internal market and our environment."
". Mr President, the operation of 15 different systems for the taxation of passenger cars within the European Union has resulted in tax obstacles, distortions and inefficiencies which prevent both the European citizens and the car industry, and trade, from fully benefiting from the advantages of the single market."
"As a result, Commission and Parliament are receiving numerous queries and petitions each year on this one particular issue."
"On 9 September 2002 the Commission presented a long-awaited communication on taxation of passenger cars, which received a warm welcome at the time from all parties concerned."
"The communication aimed, on the one hand, at providing options for action at Community level which would remove tax obstacles on the movement of new and used passenger cars, which would not incur any revenue loss for the national budgets and would not increase a total burden for the citizens."
"On the other hand, it also provided some policy measures which would establish a more direct relationship between taxation levels and the polluting emissions of passenger cars, thus contributing to the Community's environmental objectives under the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Commission considered it necessary to launch this debate with the Member States, the European Parliament and with important stakeholders before launching any proposal on passenger cars."
"This pragmatic approach allowed for a more favourable position on behalf of the Member States on a potential fresh proposal compared to the position they took in 1998 on the previous proposal which still remains on the table in the Council."
"The Commission hopes that the European Parliament will provide strong support to the policy measures included in the communication and thus reinforce the Commission's position during future discussions at the Council."
"I am happy to see that strong support already appears in the opinions provided to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I regret to note, however, that this support is not as strong in the final version of Mrs Honeyball's report as adopted by the ECON Committee."
"Finally, I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, for their efforts to conciliate and strike a balance taking into account the complexity of vehicle taxation issues."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that CO2 emissions from road traffic will increase by 31% by 2010, rather than falling by 8% as we agreed in Kyoto."
"That is why, six years ago, we agreed a CO2 strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from traffic."
"The first pillar was a self-imposed commitment by the motor industry to reduce emissions to 140 g by 2008."
"That seems to be working."
"The second pillar is consumer information, labelling for new cars, and that is not entirely working yet because it has not yet been implemented in all Member States and thirdly, tax incentives for low-consumption cars."
"I have to say that this is not working because we have in fact a patchwork of different registration taxes or annual taxes in the European Union."
"In that respect, the Committee on the Environment – and I think Parliament as a whole – would like to have a framework for tax incentives for low-consumption cars so that this third pillar of the CO2 strategy can also be implemented and we will really manage to reduce transport-related CO2; this will enable us to keep to our Kyoto target and get greenhouse gas emissions, and with them global warming, under control."
"I believe we also need a change of heart for the sake of the consumer, however, because we really do have a patchwork of tax legislation."
"Reforming the group exemption regulation has not helped."
"The price advantage is not being passed on to consumers because the effect is being absorbed by this patchwork of taxes in the European Union."
"That is another reason why, more than ever, we need a framework for sensible motor vehicle taxation in the European Union to enable consumers to benefit from this internal market advantage."
"I therefore support Mrs Honeyball’s report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to borrow from Hamlet, it is by no means just in the state of Denmark that there is something rotten with regard to car taxation."
"Many Member States still illegally tax removal vans, which impedes the movement of the workforce in the EU."
"Furthermore, however, when a car is sold for transfer to another Member State there are actually a good number of problems."
"Ten years ago the Court of Justice of the European Communities stated in the famous Nunes Tadeu case that in no single case may the tax levied on a car be more than the proportion that car tax makes up of the market price of a similar used car."
"In Finland especially, and you will be well aware of this, Mr Bolkenstein, this has fallen on deaf ears."
"I myself brought an old Citroën van into Finland a few years ago and I paid EUR 17 000 – this was for bringing my own vehicle into one Member State from another."
"Later the Court of Justice called on Finland to amend its Act relating to motor vehicles tax at the start of this year."
"I just rang a certain Finnish person who brought a Mercedes, registered in 1995 and bought in Germany, into Finland."
"He paid EUR 7 000 for it in Germany and in Finland just a month ago he paid EUR 12 000 in tax."
"That means that in Finland you pay an additional EUR 12 000 on a car bought for EUR 7 000."
"This, moreover, is an eight year old Mercedes!"
"This is how the internal market works in Europe."
"Mr Bolkenstein, we still have a lot of work to do regarding this matter before the people of Europe see that the EU actually works for the good of them, the private citizens of Europe."
"In general I support the Commission’s basic position that registration and circulation tax should be reimbursed when a car is bought for transfer to another country."
"Furthermore, removal vans should not now be taxed more than the equivalent of the administrative costs incurred, although the situation in Finland, for example, is totally different."
"In the longer term we also have to say goodbye to registration tax."
"Only in this way can we guarantee that the internal market will function properly and that people can buy a car in the country they wish and vote with their feet."
"Only in this way can consumers force the government in each country to change its ossified systems."
"Let circulation tax, however, be considered nationally, as it does not upset the functioning of the market."
"I would furthermore like to say something about Mrs Honeyball’s report, which, in itself, is excellent."
"I disagree on the question of safety."
"We do, however, need safety-based tax concessions without delay."
"The annual European death toll of 40 000 is the indisputable reason for that."
"Finally I would like to say that motoring is taxed much too highly in Europe compared to other forms of transport."
"The EU is certainly no tax haven but reasonable motoring costs should be permitted in Europe."
"Mr President, reducing the administrative obstacles to the freedom of movement of vehicles and persons and defining a direct link between the current annual circulation tax applied to light passenger vehicles and a vehicle’s environmental impact are only two of the concerns expressed by Europe’s citizens and are concerns to which the Commission wishes to respond positively."
"The passenger vehicle market in the European Union today is fragmented into fifteen completely different national segments, which creates distortions and penalties that affect not only the citizens but also the automobile industry itself."
"The real reason for this situation, however, lies mainly in the unequal tax policies applied in each of the Union’s Member States."
"It will not be easy to harmonise these policies completely in the next few years not that this is the issue today partly because we know that some States that tax vehicles are concerned not so much about the harmful environmental effects of these vehicles as about the volume of tax revenues that they can channel towards their budgets."
"Furthermore, it is worth emphasising that this report is important and useful and that its proposals and recommendations are balanced and broadly correct."
"It could have gone further in its proposals for an annual reform of the circulation tax, linking these to a more rapid abolition of the registration tax."
"The issue is not, however, to totally eliminate competition in the field of vehicle taxation between Member States: the issue at stake is the need to promote the rapid completion of the single market for cars with all the benefits that this entails for the citizens and businesses and for improving the functioning of the internal market."
"The solutions proposed in this report focus largely on achieving this aim, although they give priority, by repeating them, to the concerns that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions; such as concern at the emission of particulates that are harmful to the environment."
"Harmonising vehicle taxation is a complex issue that cannot be solved in isolation from other, extremely varied political considerations."
"This Community initiative and the support it gives Parliament, following the approval of the new regulation on automobile distribution despite the fact that this regulation has proved to be ineffective in harmonising basic car prices represents a pivotal moment in the development of this process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to thank Mrs Honeyball for her well thought-out report."
"The fact that this is an explosive subject is something of which we have become aware in the course of the committee’s reading."
"For a number of my fellow MEPs, the word ‘tax’ appears to be enough to give rise to great indignation."
"We are concerned here with coordination, not harmonisation, so you do not need to be so frightened."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes in the need to take great care with tax legislation at EU level."
"That is quite clear."
"We can, however, imagine a few exceptions, and one such is environmental tax, which is one of the things being indirectly proposed in this case."
"It is also of course a question of simplifying matters for the individual citizen, of providing better basic conditions for people’s freedom of movement and of reducing costs, as in the case of Mr Vatanen’s example involving the hugely expensive car in Finland."
"There should in all likelihood be almost complete agreement in this House about creating greater mobility for individuals and less bureaucratic rules in the internal market."
"Allow me to say a word or two about the environmental aspect."
"We know that road transport accounts for a very large proportion of carbon dioxide emissions."
"We also know that road transport, and thus the quantity of emissions, is on the increase."
"Matters cannot continue like this."
"That is something we ourselves have acknowledged."
"Through the Kyoto Protocol, the EU Member States have promised considerably to reduce, rather than increase, emissions."
"It is therefore probably a good strategy to devise simple and clear tax systems capable of benefiting the environment."
"Those of us who legislate have significant opportunities to influence the behaviour of both producers and consumers."
"A premium must be placed upon environmental considerations."
"It is a question of encouraging those motor manufacturers which produce cleaner engines and those consumers who exchange their dirty old cars for cleaner ones."
"It is also a question of buying the cleanest form of fuel."
"I also believe that use, rather than ownership, should be taxed in the first place."
"The issue of tax on diesel fuel is also interesting."
"Diesel engines have more efficient combustion and therefore release less carbon dioxide than petrol engines."
"Diesel, as a fuel, should not therefore be treated unfairly from a taxation point of view, as has also been pointed out in this House."
"These are important points of view."
"The ELDR Group has tabled an amendment rejected by the committee."
"It is about being able to put safety into the equation, as Mr Vatanen mentioned."
"We know that 45 000 people are killed each year on EU roads, in addition to all those who are injured."
"All this means enormous human suffering and considerable financial costs to society."
"If we can produce safer cars through favourable taxation, that is something it should be possible to experiment with."
"I therefore hope that you are able to support Amendment 2."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Commission on its initiative and Mrs Honeyball on her excellent report."
"Today the taxation of passenger cars in the Union is undoubtedly, as we say in Catalan, a real , in other words, a ‘rag bag’."
"As the report rightly emphasises, the functioning of the internal market is affected by the diversity, the heterogeneity and sometimes the complexity of tax systems."
"The Commission and the report are, therefore, quite right to address this issue, in order to ensure that competition takes place in the best conditions possible."
"Indeed, it appears extremely appropriate to consider taxing the use of vehicles rather than their acquisition, and the Commission is, therefore, right to propose abolishing the vehicle registration tax and establishing or increasing taxes on circulation, fuel and the use of some road infrastructures."
"We need to give priority to environmental criteria in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives, as the report rightly reminds us."
"On the other hand, as regards diesel vehicles, I agree with Mrs Honeyball that they should benefit in terms of taxation."
"Studies in this field appear to conclude that emissions from diesel engines are generally lower than emissions from other types of engine."
"The logical consequence of the ‘polluter pays’ principle would be to levy less tax on something that pollutes less."
"We must never forget, however, that from the environmental point of view and also for geopolitical reasons, the final objective must be to replace current fuels with non-contaminating and non-conflicting sources of energy."
"To this end, we should welcome all research efforts conducted into new energies, such as hydrogen."
"– Mr President, the prices faced by car drivers and the car industry due to levies imposed on car ownership and use are an inevitable fact of everyday life."
"There are too many kinds of levies on car ownership but also on use."
"In my view, it is better to apply a transparent system of levies with different, but clear goals, such as levies on car ownership to finance road maintenance and levies on car use to restore environmental damage."
"The effects of any levies to curb car use and to promote new environmentally-friendly technology need to be assessed."
"In saying this, I am not arguing in favour of a European tax system for cars, but for a system whereby the reasons for levying taxes and the goals of the Member States are consistent with an internal market, thereby not overlooking the interests of a healthy living environment."
"I therefore support Mrs Honeyball's report."
"Finally, I should like clarity from the Commission on the question as to how it now wants to make progress in the complex issue of mobility taxation."
"Yesterday, Tuesday, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected the proposal on the harmonisation of diesel excise."
"As you know, both proposals were discussed at a hearing and are complementary."
"In view of the proposals for harmonisation of diesel excise and passenger car taxation, what options do you, Commissioner Bolkestein, see, by means of an exchange of interests between the Member States, of reaching a compromise with which the Council and Parliament could agree?"
"I particularly have the reaching of a common position on levy grounds and goals for the application of levies in mind."
"Mr President, I am going to have to interrupt this consensus debate, because I am afraid I cannot support Mrs Honeyball’s report."
"Despite the protestations of the Commissioner, it is plain that this report is about harmonising taxes: it seek to produce a harmonised regime for vehicle taxation in the European Union."
"I do not think we need that for cross-border trade; there is no necessity there."
"I strongly believe that taxation is a matter that should remain within the remit of the Member States."
"It is of fundamental importance to ordinary people across Europe that they are free to elect the people who set their taxes."
"Real democratic accountability on taxation therefore requires that decisions about our taxes be taken by the governments that we elect, and not by the European Union."
"I find it surprising that Mrs Honeyball is supporting so warmly a report that promotes tax harmonisation on the very day that Gordon Brown is all over the Daily Telegraph saying that he does not like tax harmonisation."
"Our government and our Labour MEPs should try to ensure that they have some kind of consistency, because indeed Richard Corbett, as recently as this week, said 'Tax harmonisation?"
"What is all the fuss about?!'"
"I say this is a fundamental constitutional principle."
"Time and again, the Commission comes to this House and claims that this is just a technical matter, that it is just about the internal market."
"We are assured that we need not worry and that it does not really affect our democratic right to set our own taxes."
"The cumulative effect of these proposals is to strip the Member States of very real and serious powers regarding setting taxes and to remove democratic accountability from the setting of taxes, which is dangerous for democracy and is certainly unacceptable to those who elected me to represent them in this House."
"Mr President, the previous speaker will probably be amazed to find that I agree with everything she said."
"I was surprised to discover that Mrs Honeyball, an MEP for the UK Labour Party, is calling for a Commission directive on annual road taxes in the European Union, and on the structure of car purchase tax on the grounds of completing the single market, when the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer is quoted on the front page of today's newspapers as saying 'We must explicitly reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should lead inexorably to tax harmonisation, fiscal federalism and then a federal state'."
"Has Mrs Honeyball consulted Mr Brown, I wonder?"
"Her stance hardly fits in with Mr Blair’s 'red lines' vis-à-vis the Constitution."
"The tax matter should continue to be subject to a unanimous vote."
"Mr Brown also points to the rigidities, inflexibilities and lack of competitiveness of the rest of Europe compared to the more flexible and open economy of Britain, precisely because we have control of our own taxes and currency."
"Ironically, in her report Mrs Honeyball underlines the belief that the annual circulation tax paid by users of private cars should be the competence of national authorities with which I would wholeheartedly agree."
"In short, this is a confused and confusing report and its aim, in my view, along with the Commission communication, is to use fiscal initiatives to impose harmonisation on the grounds of environmental objectives, despite this not being an area of competence for the EU."
"For my part, taxation is sacrosanct to each Member State."
"– Mr President, it would seem the expressions of support by these political groups conflict a good deal with regard to this issue."
"I actually support Mrs Honeyball’s commendable report on the taxation of passenger cars."
"I think the Commission communication should be welcomed and I hope that the Commission will promptly reform European car taxation."
"As my colleague, Mr Vatanen, has already described so expertly, the current situation where such a key consumer durable good as a car is one of the most difficult things to move around within the Union area is totally untenable."
"There are considerable barriers to transfer of cars from one Member State to another, which are still being caused by differences in tax legislation as well as inflexible administrative practices."
"In the matter of car taxation the citizens of the Union are being treated totally unequally, as it depends on the country in which they live."
"The Commission proposal to phase out registration tax would be a solution to most of the tax-related problems, and it should be done as quickly as possible."
"It should be noted, however, that the European Parliament on an earlier occasion supported proposals by the Commission to eliminate double taxation, but the Council has not as yet approved it."
"The Council should seriously consider what in the final analysis serves the interest of the citizens of the Union where these issues are concerned."
"Secondly, the main focus of taxing motoring should be made to move away from the notion of ownership."
"In some Nordic countries, such as Finland, it is dreadfully expensive to buy a new, ordinary family car, just because of the registration tax."
"As a result, you see on the roads in our country incredibly old cars which in other countries of the Union would be deemed fit for the scrap heap."
"That is why the emphasis of car taxation should move more in the direction of taxation on use."
"Taxation on use, however, must also be reasonable, and the overall burden of taxation of motoring must not be allowed to become too great."
"This is especially important in sparsely populated areas like those in the north, in Finland and Sweden, where the car is often the only possible means of transport, public transport services being very limited."
"For the same reason I do not support abolishing the favourable tax treatment for diesel fuel."
"Removing the tax incentive on diesel would result in considerable costs for long-distance journeys for the peripheral areas of the Union, which already suffer in other ways."
"What is more, the latest studies show that carbon dioxide emissions from diesel cars are considerably lower than from petrol cars."
"This was something my colleague, Mr Schmidt, of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, also referred to."
"Emissions from passenger cars are nevertheless a significant source of greenhouse emissions, which is why we must act in such a way that, where possible, consumers are steered in the direction of environmentally sustainable and favourable products."
"Thus, for example, the taxation of fuels should take account of the environmentally friendly aspect by lowering taxes on liquid fuels in this category."
"Car taxation could also take account of the environmentally friendly aspect either in the form of reductions in possible circulation taxes or tax benefits for optional environmentally friendly devices."
"I furthermore take a positive view of Mrs Honeyball’s proposal regarding tax benefits for safety devices."
"Support for, and encouraging the use of, safe, environmentally friendly and, from the consumer’s point of view, durable vehicles in the Union area in this way are welcome moves."
"Mr President, I come to this debate with divided loyalties."
"On the one hand, there is no doubt that simplifying the existing vehicle tax system to remove obstacles and distortions to the free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market is long overdue."
"In fact, the prospect of a free market in cars was one of the most talked-about issues dangled tantalisingly in front of our citizens as we embarked on the single market in Ireland, in any case."
"My country is one of the ten member states with a vehicle registration tax."
"It is a very high one: I think Finland may beat us but we are certainly up there with them."
"This keeps the prices of passenger cars and all road vehicles amongst the most expensive in the EU, including imports of used cars."
"We have no indigenous car manufacturing plants, not even assembly plants."
"Our cars are all imported, contributing nothing to employment and adversely affecting our balance of payments."
"Our road network, notwithstanding Structural Fund generosity over the years, is creaking at the seams and our main towns and cities are gridlocked as our car population has increased dramatically in the last decade or so, and the graph continues relentlessly upwards."
"In fact, the price of bullocks and the number of new car sales, in no particular order, have long been yardsticks of economic performance in Ireland."
"Add to this the fact that our Kyoto CO2 emissions are now at 1990 levels plus 22% already 10% over target for 2010, and the fact that there will be little or no decrease in car prices even if there is a removal or reduction in VRT because car manufacturers have had to reduce their prices to offset our high tax regime - and they will revert their prices if the tax burden is lightened - and you have altogether a very complicated field of play."
"On the other hand, the Irish Exchequer obtains over EUR 800 million annually from VRT, this equates to a 2% increase in the standard rate of income tax and indicates the problems that would ensue if VRT were to be reduced or abolished."
"If it were to be replaced by additional petrol taxes, an increase of 36 cents per litre would be necessary to make up the difference in tax take."
"This would be inflationary, as would any commensurate increase in our already high annual circulation tax, resulting in car owners who had already paid VRT on existing vehicles being hit by a double whammy."
"While I object to paying such high rates of VRT in a so-called single market, I recognise that VRT is a once-off tax capitalised in the value of cars."
"There is no evidence that the problems with it, such as they are, would warrant a large intrusion into the domestic tax arrangements as contemplated by this Commission communication."
"While I can distinguish between indirect taxes such as VRT and direct taxes such as income and corporation tax, Member States are entitled to order their affairs so that motorists contribute to the cost of providing public services, especially to the cost of road and rail construction and the maintenance of our roads."
"Far better that than to increase income tax by 2%."
"Commission involvement in Member States' tax arrangements must come with a serious health warning. An ongoing flirtation in this sensitive area is a serious threat to the continued acceptance of the great European project by an increasingly Eurosceptic citizenship."
"I should like to point out to the Commissioner that he meddles in the tax affairs of Member States at his peril."
"In conclusion, the future for our single market must lie in a car taxation system which is visibly CO2 modulated, but without central prescription."
"The rate of this tax should fully reflect each Member State's requirements environmental, economic and physical."
"We will not truly have a single market in the area of passenger cars and road vehicles until we all start driving on the same side of the road so that we can all have either left-hand or right-hand drive cars."
"But that is a detail for another day."
". Mr President, political realism has led the Commission to initiate consultation with the Council, the European Parliament and important stakeholders on passenger car taxation before drafting any legislative proposal on this issue."
"I understand that many Members of Parliament would have preferred a more ambitious report, especially as far as the measures to be taken against the fragmentation of the internal market are concerned."
"The Commission will take the conclusion of this report seriously into account before taking any initiative in this area."
"The fact that a number of different approaches have been voiced in this room tonight provides an indication of how difficult it will be to reach a unanimous decision in Council on such policy measures."
"With reference to the conclusions of the report, the Commission would like to express its gratitude to the European Parliament for the strong support it has given to policy measures, such as those necessary to abolish registration taxes (paragraph 16), to bring forward changes in order to introduce an environmentally-oriented tax system (paragraphs 12 and 13), and to use tax differentials as a tool to promote passenger cars producing less than 120 grammes per kilometre of carbon dioxide emissions (paragraph 7)."
"Additionally, the Commission agrees in principle with a large number of paragraphs, such as 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 21."
"Concerning paragraphs 2, 3 and 15, the Commission does not share the view that existing barriers to free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market are due only to administrative practices or procedures."
"The Commission considers that a clear reference to tax barriers, and particularly to double taxation caused by registration taxes, should be stated in these paragraphs, as is the case under the relevant part of the explanatory statement."
"With regard to paragraph 5, which refers to the Annual Circulation Tax, the Commission does not share the view that this tax does not affect the functioning of the internal market."
"Diversified tax bases and important divergences in ACT levels can provide an incentive to citizens to register their car in a Member State other than the one where they normally reside, which means this tax does affect the internal market."
"With regard to Amendment 2, the Commission does not support including safety of passenger cars among its objectives."
"The danger would be that the possible effect of fiscal incentives would be watered down."
"Moreover, the problem of road accidents could be better addressed by other instruments such as speed cameras, fines, education, separate bicycle lanes and so on."
"I listened with great interest to the brief altercation between some British Members of Parliament, whilst thinking of Minister Dawn Primarolo, who spent four years ironing out harmful tax measures."
"If one really were in favour of unlimited tax competition, why would one want to iron out so-called harmful tax measures?"
"Next time such Members of Parliament who have spoken on this matter meet Minister Primarolo, they might perhaps give her a piece of their mind and tell her that she has wasted four years of her time in trying to stamp out fiscal competition."
"That said, I should like once again to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts and their supportive report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)"
"I am very pleased this afternoon to have the opportunity to welcome here to the European Parliament the President of the Republic of Lithuania, Mr Rolandas Paksas."
"It is a happy coincidence that we should have the Head of State of an Accession Country to speak to us on an afternoon when we hear from the European Commission on the annual progress reports on the question of accession to the European Union."
"In that regard the progress of Lithuania has been remarkable."
"It was not in the first group of states to begin their journeys towards the European Union but, in the course of this afternoon, we will hear an account of how substantial and how successful that journey has been in a very brief period of time."
"In Lithuania there was also very powerful positive support in the referendum indicated by both high turnout and a very high percentage of the voters who said 'yes' to a European Lithuania."
"Against that background it gives me great pleasure now to invite President Paksas to address our Parliament."
"(1). Mr President, thank you for your warm reception and this invitation to speak at the cradle of the European Union's representative democracy."
"I am the first leader of Lithuania to have an opportunity to address the European Parliament."
"Among the Members of this House there are many devoted friends of Lithuania who supported my country's independence."
"We recently marked the anniversary of European Parliament resolutions which prevented the world from forgetting the struggle for freedom of Lithuania and the Baltic States during the Cold War."
"Your support inspired us when we were making the first steps towards membership of the European Union and I thank you for your support."
"My personal thanks go to Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, who, among other things, also contributed to the success of the referendum for membership of the European Union."
"I welcome the observers from the acceding countries here in the European Parliament."
"Although you represent different nations and different political parties, you have managed to integrate smoothly into the family of parliamentarians. I hope that our states, too, will equally successfully join the family of Member States."
"In the church of Saint Pierre-Le-Jeune in Strasbourg there is a fresco depicting the march of nations towards Christianity."
"It depicts a march towards the cross, and the cavalcade of nations is led by Germania, which is followed by Gallia, Italia and Anglia."
"The last in this column of nations is Litavia that is, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania."
"For us, this reflection of fifteenth century Europe is an important and symbolic sight."
"Metaphorically speaking, this means that Lithuania integrated into the European Union hundreds of years ago."
"This summer, during the celebrations for our state's 750th anniversary, we unveiled a monument to the first and only king of Lithuania, King Mindaugas."
"I am proud of his ability to see the future and, therefore, I would call him Lithuania's first European."
"The Grand Duke of Lithuania, Gediminas, followed in Mindaugas' footsteps and invited craftsmen and artisans to come to Lithuania from all over Europe."
"Throughout the history of Lithuania we were fated to go through two occupations, the first lasted for more than the whole of the nineteenth century, while the second covered 50 years of the last century."
"After World War II, freedom fighters in Lithuania resisted the occupying forces for 12 long years."
"The struggle, which demanded a huge sacrifice, helped preserve, in the conscience of the people, their aspiration for freedom."
"During the decisive moments in Lithuanian history, our nation has been helped by its ability to mobilise itself."
"In January 1991 unarmed civilians succeeded in defending the newly-regained independence in the face of a brutal attack by the occupying forces."
"In spring 2003 90% of those voting in the referendum came out in favour of Lithuania's membership of the European Union."
"We are moving towards membership of the European Union with a clear vision of Lithuania as an active and responsible member of the European family."
"Our goal is to create a democratic state, and this is enshrined in this strategy for the country's development, approved by Parliament."
"External and internal security of the state and the wellbeing of the citizens are the cornerstones of our membership of the EU."
"I have been taught a painful lesson over the past few days, but this will only give me additional energy to pursue progress and democracy in Lithuania."
"By no means should successful integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures be slowed down."
"Our plans to become party to the Schengen Agreement and European Monetary Union between 2005 and 2009 may seem ambitious, yet they are an important part of our agenda and they will be implemented."
"This new stage in the history of Lithuania opens up vast possibilities to promote and implement our national interests."
"I am sure that Lithuania is ready to be an effective and reliable partner of other Member States."
"Our country has 2.5 million inhabitants, territory twice as big as Belgium, and we have the best roads in eastern Europe."
"Our greatest asset, however, is the people of Lithuania who, regrettably, have been through too much suffering."
"Although World War I was a great blow to Lithuania, in the inter-war period we managed, in two decades, to reach a level of economic development that was equal to that of Denmark."
"Presently, however, we are a model for the whole of the region."
"The volume of financial investment is currently growing rapidly."
"The private sector and free enterprise account for over 80% of GDP which, last year, grew by 7%."
"Our aim is to complete land reform next year."
"We already have a number of large farms that are working productively."
"We are a country of rapidly developing advanced technologies."
"IT sector growth in 2002 was as much as 30%."
"There is no truth, however, that one learns by comparing and I admit that Lithuania and other post-Communist states are moving towards membership in the European Union in the face of a big gap in economic development between 'old' and 'new' Europe."
"This gap has never been as great in previous enlargements and this cannot be masked by declarations or resolutions."
"This gap is also reflected in the transitional periods that are enshrined in the Accession Treaties."
"We take this as a reality but we are not intending to give in to it."
"Our primary goal is to bridge the gap in economic development between the old and new Member States."
"The sooner the new Member States catch up with the older ones, the greater the competitiveness of Europe will be, and the stronger Europe will be."
"To achieve this without the support of the present Member States would take too long and that is why it is a duty for us to use the support promised to us to the best advantage for our people."
"On the other hand, we must actively take advantage of the benefits of the single market and the four freedoms."
"We have no transitional periods as far as the freedoms are concerned, with the exception of free movement of labour and I would like to express my thanks to those countries who are going to open up their labour markets to Lithuanian citizens in a few months' time."
"The development of the single market will not be affected if we fail to link up the telecommunications, energy and transport networks."
"Investment in infrastructure is of special importance here."
"We have made some progress in this area: we have implemented the Via Baltica project, and that and the power bridge between Poland and Lithuania have been included in the list of priority projects."
"This would become an important element in the Baltic region's economic development strategy."
"The decisions on how to develop the Baltic Sea region must be taken now, and I expect European Parliament support in this matter."
"It would be a big mistake to see a difference drawn between the core of Europe and the periphery of Europe and I am talking not in terms of geography, but in terms of economic and social development."
"I am sure that the new Member States will be able to contribute to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The European Union is and will remain a very important factor in building Lithuania as a welfare state."
"That is why it is important to provide measures in the European Union to bridge not only the economic gap but also the gap in social development."
"Lithuania supports simple and transparent principles for the formation of the EU budget."
"In the discussion on the new financial perspective, Lithuania will seek to ensure that its interests are taken into consideration."
"We will be responsible for one-fifth of the new external borders of the European Union and we also have a neighbour in the form of the Kaliningrad Region."
"The same is true about the specific features of Lithuania's agriculture."
"I am sure that, if we use the possibilities of regional cooperation, the region of the Baltic Sea has a good chance of becoming a centre of a fast-growing economic entity."
"The new neighbours initiative may also contribute considerably to the development of that region."
"Lithuania will be responsible for one-fifth of the external border of the European Union."
"As Head of State I will do my best to ensure that this border is secure and transparently controlled."
"Our experience in dealing with our neighbours will be transferred to the older Member States."
"History tells us that without good neighbours a Union cannot be strong."
"The European Union must open up to the countries east of the new borders."
"It should do so to the extent that these new Members are ready to align their legislative frameworks with those of the European Union. The greatest achievement of Lithuania in the past decade has been to achieve good neighbourly relations in the region."
"Let me emphasise, separately, the importance of Russia as a strategic partner of the European Union."
"The Kaliningrad Region has a special place in this partnership."
"Although quite a lot has been said about the would-be strategy for the Kaliningrad Region, it has not yet been prepared."
"I suggest that we focus on the social and economic development of the Kaliningrad Region, and we are ready to share our experience gained in dealing with Kaliningrad and also with the whole north-western region of Russia."
"We must not forget the Ukraine either, nor the states in the South Caucuses."
"They have to be offered a vision of relations with the European Union."
"I have written to President Cox and other leaders of the European Union about this."
"The draft Constitutional Treaty proposed by the European Convention provides a good democratic and institutional balance which is acceptable to Lithuania."
"This document, however, still needs to be amended and made more precise."
"We must find solutions to sensitive and open issues and also launch a discussion on issues that were not discussed by the Convention."
"The main challenge faced by the IGC is agree on the institutional reform of the Union."
"If we fail to do that, the European Union of 25 Member States will not be able to become a strong leader."
"Europe is not just about votes in the Council of Ministers, or equal status Commissioners from every state."
"It is also about a spirit of compromise. It is necessary to find a balance."
"Every state must have equal rights and possibilities in the Union."
"The search for compromise, which is a characteristic feature of the European Union, will be particularly important in the enlarged Union."
"It is important that we base our existence on common values, democracy, respect for human dignity and transparency."
"We must respect each other's culture and identity."
"All of this will serve to guarantee long-term success for the European Union."
"A reference to Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution would have a unifying and symbolic meaning, because modern Europe was formed on the basis of specific values."
"Alongside institutional issues, the IGC faces an important discussion on common foreign security and defence issues."
"We must avoid any duplication of the existing NATO structures."
"The political developments in the world and the Iraqi crisis have demonstrated that, in the area of foreign policy, Europe must be able to coordinate its actions and speak with one voice."
"It is of particular importance that we maintain the viability and indispensability of the transatlantic link."
"The future security strategy of the European Union must enshrine these principles."
"In February 2003, while being sworn in as President of Lithuania, I outlined the main strategic goals of the Lithuanian State."
"I promised the Lithuanian people that our country not only seeks shelter in Europe but will participate in deciding the destiny of Europe."
"I also said that, while in Europe, Lithuania will expand the area of stability and security."
"I can subscribe to these words today."
"To conclude, I should like to remind you of the words of Robert Schuman, the father of the European Union, in his book ."
"He wrote that 'Europe is searching for itself."
"It knows that its future lies in its own hands."
"Never again will it be that near to achieving its aim."
"It should not allow the hour of its fate to slip away it is its only chance for delivery'."
"These words not only summarise the underlying notions and philosophy behind the unification of Europe, but also help to perceive the spirit of Europe."
"I should like to thank President Paksas for his remarks today, which underpin our growing connection and bond with the future states of the European Union."
"The next item is the Commission statement on employment prospects in the EU automobile sector."
". Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the ever-increasing speed at which technology advances and the increasing pressure of competition on global markets are compelling car manufacturers to adapt their production methods and also their business structures to changed conditions."
"It is important, in this context, that firms should learn how, at an early stage, to recognise what measures and investments are needed to secure the continuity of their economic activity, and to actually put that knowledge into practice."
"Restructuring, though, is often synonymous with job cuts, and frequently associated with dire consequences for the social fabric, especially in regions that have little or no potential for job creation."
"This is especially true of the motor vehicle industry, in which changes in production processes and the opening up of new markets have significant effects on employment."
"The Commission is very well aware of how difficult this balance is and of how much citizens and workers need a minimum level of security in these difficult times."
"We are persuaded that dialogue at every level, founded on comprehensive and transparent information, is of the essence if they are to adapt successfully to change."
"The Commission has invariably acted in accordance with certain principles, which it has repeatedly emphasised."
"The first is that decisions on restructuring are and shall remain the prerogative and task of management."
"What this means is that enterprises, when planning courses of action with potentially significant social implications, are meant to actively seek out a solution that is as compatible as possible and does the least damage."
"Secondly, when redundancies cannot be avoided, everything possible must be done to enhance the employability of those affected."
"This will require foresight, and these procedures must be prepared in good time and managed in an appropriate way."
"Thirdly, if an employer neglects to fully and effectively inform and consult employee representatives in good time before publicly announcing such steps, then that can in no way be justified."
"Employee participation is, in every case, and especially when an enterprise is restructured, not merely a fundamental right, but also a necessary precondition if such measures are to be regarded as socially acceptable."
"At European level, we have laid down minimum rules with which all Member States and all enterprises must comply in the event of large-scale job reductions or other measures potentially affecting workers."
"The directives on collective redundancies, the transfer of undertakings, and European Works Councils constitute our legal framework for protecting workers’ rights and for guaranteeing fair standards for information and consultation at national and supranational level."
"Most recently, we have also enacted the Information and Consultation Directive."
"All these measures enable us to help Europe’s workers successfully rise to the challenges of change, by making it possible for their employability and adaptability to be developed at an early stage."
"The development of effective procedures for information and consultation will also be among the main elements needing to be discussed by the social partners in Europe when the Commission begins revision of the European Works Councils Directive."
"What is even more important is that the Commission very much hopes that Europe’s social partners will find a way to devise proven restructuring procedures throughout the EU, as they decided to do when they responded so positively in last year’s consultation on this issue."
"These tried and tested procedures will make for further advances in the information and consultation of workers, including, among other things, the anticipation of market trends or technological developments, as well as long-term investment in people and the encouragement of employability by the use of education and training, careers advice, alternatives to closure and redundancies, and, wherever this is possible, the redeployment within the enterprise of workers affected by restructuring measures."
"It is to be hoped that these procedures will help the Ford workers, too, to deal with their present difficulties."
"More knowledge about the future prospects of the motor vehicle industry ought to benefit all interested parties."
"The Commission is currently examining developments in this sector in order to identify the elements required for restructuring and the long-term competitiveness of industry in the EU."
"It is planning to make the results of its analysis available in about a year’s time."
"It is the most recent restructuring operations that are our immediate concern today, and I need to make it clear to you right at the outset that I share your deep regret and grave concern at the potential social consequences, for the persons concerned, of the decisions to close down plant and cut back jobs."
"I hope that every effort will be made, by means of a dialogue between the parties concerned, to avoid, or at least to alleviate, them."
"– Commissioner, the tragedy caused by the drastic streamlining measures at Ford Genk has exposed a number of painful areas in the European car industry."
"There is the slump in sales, 5% since 1999 to be precise, the environmental burden against which Europe may have taken various, but insufficient, measures, as well as the powerlessness of the Member States to have any impact whatsoever on international company strategies."
"This is why I urgently call for a European initiative to support the further development of the industry within the context of a policy, instead of waiting passively for yet another reorganisation."
"This European initiative should consist of a number of elements; first of all, the further development of a concept for a sustainable car."
"Whoever is the first to introduce this onto the market and is most advanced in this respect will achieve the highest sales figures."
"If China and India switch over to generalised car traffic, the environmental burden will become untenable."
"Secondly, new technological developments need support and staff."
"Europe must take on the competition with quality and added value as its main assets, rather than cost control."
"For the latter is beyond our powers!"
"For this to happen, it will have to anticipate the ever-growing component of electronics in the added value of a car."
"Thirdly, large-scale reorganisations have a social dimension."
"By 2006, the next programme of structural funds must be approved."
"I hope that the Commission, during the revision of the European structural funds, particularly in the light of Limburg, will inject more resources into providing support during far-reaching industrial transformations."
"Following that, there is something to which you have already alluded, namely the issue of the Renault Directive."
"It must be evaluated as an absolute measure."
"People on the ground tell me that the procedure established would lead to the mechanical application of the directive."
"Employers are so frightened of making a procedural mistake that consultation is actually prevented from the word go."
"We should therefore evaluate this directive as an absolute priority."
"These are only a few initiatives; there are still many more around which Europe could work."
"Finally, it is not all doom and gloom in Belgium's car industry: Volvo, Opel and Volkswagen are continuing to invest and Ford has decided to further develop the new Mondeo in Genk."
"In principle, we should not fear the relocation of the European, and hence the Belgian, car industry."
"After all, the products involved are highly technological with an ever increasing knowledge component, the end production of which will take place ever more closely to the market."
"Commissioner, I truly hope that it will be possible to develop a policy for industries for the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just described the ways in which industry, especially the motor industry, must constantly be modernising its plant."
"We know that there is no getting away from this and that every investment in technology results in the loss of between 9% and 25% of jobs."
"We must indeed find the means to counteract this loss of jobs, which occurs as a result of technology."
"I was interested to hear the Commission’s statements to the effect that we had minimum rules for workers’ rights."
"Such a statement is, of course, no use whatever to the workers in Genk."
"I hope, though, that the Commission will remember this statement when it amends the European Works Councils Directive, as it is shortly to do, and will at last take account of something that has, in some places, become common practice, that is, making the European Works Council responsible when European mainstream issues are under discussion in a firm, and will also extend the rights of information and consultation in such a way that rights of participation – and I am not talking about consultation, but about participation – are built in."
"Thirdly, it is essential that the Commission should learn how, in the social dialogue, to make it clear to the social partners that they have to expect penalties for failing to abide by these agreed ground rules, or else such rules will become a joke."
"– In the automobile industry, a number of painful decisions have been taken recently, and one of those has resulted in very painful consequences for thousands of people in the region where I was elected."
"They have resulted in nothing short of tragedies, both on a personal level and for the region."
"This has forced us to examine not only the role of the automobile industry, but also the role of industry as a whole."
"I agree with the Commissioner when he states that a company must be able to reach its decisions independently, but I think that companies should also deliver on their promises."
"If they claim at some stage that investments will be made, then they cannot simply delay these investments, because that is very detrimental to both their workers and the authorities of the region where they are active."
"Companies require from the government a stable business climate."
"I think that we can also ask companies to aim for the highest possible level of stability and transparency: why do they take certain measures and why do they take them at a certain location and not at others?"
"The implications for a region can be very serious indeed and, as Mrs Smet mentioned a moment ago, I think that when we revisit the structural funds, we should, for example, also look at what we can do for the Limburg region."
"This is, after all, a very badly hit region, which, in fact, also has a very painful history on that score."
"We could list a whole host of things."
"In any case, people say that in the next couple of years, there will be further cutbacks in employment in industry."
"I think that if you, Commissioner, were to examine the state of the automobile industry, this might be a little late, and if you were to focus on the automobile industry alone, that this might be a little restricted, that you should take a much broader view."
"It is often said that we are heading towards a service economy, but I take the view that a service economy without an industrial basis is a very precarious matter, because products and marketing go hand in hand, and the same applies to services."
"Should we not, therefore, closely examine the developments within the industrial market and the link with the service industry as a matter of urgency?"
"In that way, the European Union does not lose its industry and can match it with a very strong and better manned service industry."
"In the European Union, we have previous experience of a situation in which an industry saw its employment dwindle, namely in agriculture, an example with which you, Commissioner, are very familiar."
"Despite all the measures that we took in that sector – democratic staffing, subsidies, and so on – we have not been able to prevent employment from going down."
"Let us therefore take a more sensible and global approach this time round than we did then with regard to agriculture."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collective redundancies at Genk announced by Ford are not the first of their kind and no doubt they will not be the last."
"They simply reflect, I believe, the current business philosophy of global enterprises."
"Collective redundancies are almost invariably a means of compensating for the reduction of profits as a result of diminished demand, a purely managerial and, I might add, unimaginative approach which the economic order must, as a matter of policy, counteract if increased demand is to be ensured."
"Looking at current policy, one can see that the cutbacks that are made in all areas of society do not stoke up demand, but, on the contrary, stifle it still further."
"One particular demonstration of the truth that management can secure employment strategies by means other than collective redundancies is to be found in the motor industry, in the works contracts at VW or, most recently, at Opel, which reduce working time to thirty hours and thus share out the work among more people."
"If current reports in the media are to be believed, though, it is evident that other, politically motivated considerations are involved in what is going on in Genk."
"According to these reports, at any rate, Ford is concentrating collective redundancies on locations – of which Genk is one and Cologne another – in those countries that did not acquiesce in US policy in the war on Iraq."
"The reason why the debate in this House today is so important is that the planned redundancies are not in line with Parliament’s resolution on the social consequences of industrial conversion – not in the way they have been thought out and not in the manner in which they are being put into effect."
"Let the Commission re-examine how the rules have been complied with."
"Redundancies on this scale are anything other than a milestone on the way to fulfilling the Lisbon Agenda and result in devastating upheavals in the regions concerned."
"If we really want not only to become the strongest region in economic terms by 2012, but also, as was stated at Lisbon, to create full employment, then the Commission, too, has to go about things in an entirely different way."
"– It is true that the automobile industry is in crisis, but there will always be a need for individual transport."
"The set-up may be different in future: there is a market for more environmentally-friendly cars and there will be a market for hydrogen-powered cars, so there is a new market that can certainly be opened up, and this industry certainly has a future."
"In times of crisis, we need to handle these crisis situations intelligently, which we have not done in the past."
"In Belgium, we had the tragic case of Renault, the closure of the factory in Vilvoorde, now Ford Genk, and there are also other cases."
"However, there are also examples of a better approach: at Opel in Germany, for example, people have opted for a shorter working week of thirty hours."
"This is a method that we Europeans should defend and spread as an example for other factories."
"I think that this could also be a possible solution for a case like Genk."
"– A few years ago, the CEO at Renault, Mr Louis Schweizer, who had, incidentally, been the principal private secretary in the cabinet of France's Socialist Prime Minister in a previous life, decided, in the interest of his shareholders, to close down the Renault factory in Vilvoorde and make a few thousand Flemish workers redundant in the process."
"Today, with the drastic streamlining measures at the Ford Genk factories, Flanders is yet again facing a tragedy in the car-manufacturing sector."
"Although I hope that Mrs Smet’s optimism will prove to be justified, many people fear that the dismissal of 3 000 workers in Genk is simply heralding the factory's final closure and relocation."
"You sometimes hear fatalists claim that, due to increasing globalisation, nobody can prevent these relocations, but we should still maintain that the Belgian Government has a massive responsibility in this area."
"Commissioner, the truth is that the Belgian Government has known since January 2002 that the Genk car manufacturer was in serious trouble."
"After all, different media, including the weekly magazine , have also reminded us that Flemish managers warned the Belgian Government that Belgium, and thus Flemish industry – which is already being weighed down by excessive labour costs – has been placed in a bad light in the United States."
"Many people in Flanders suspect that the ill-considered action by, , the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, may have played a part in the decision of the Ford management to streamline the Genk assembly works."
"If Europe wants to avoid tragedies of the kind that have unfolded in Vilvoorde and Ford Genk in future, far-reaching measures will need to be taken across all EU Member States in order to guarantee to industry, too, the , Community preference, which has, quite rightly, been applied in agriculture for decades."
"If they are not, a region like Flanders should be able to outline socio-economic policy of its own."
"Mr President, firstly, may I say to many colleagues here who are directly affected in the Limburg region, that I represent a region in the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has probably been more affected by structural change in the automotive industry than any other region in Europe."
"I want to say to colleagues from Limburg that we have had that experience and we now have a thriving automotive industry in the United Kingdom; we have more international car manufacturers assembling cars in the United Kingdom than any other country in the European Union."
"If colleagues from Limburg would like to come and talk to me about our experience in the West Midlands, we can show you the programmes we have put in place, not just to retrain and redeploy people, but also to help those smaller companies in the supply chain affected by changes in production."
"So please colleagues, do not be overly depressed about it, there are ways forward."
"It is important that we are having our debate today in the context of the future of the automotive industry because the issues surrounding the decision that Ford was forced to make at Genk go to the heart of our thinking on how we need to secure a long-term sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe, the technology and the jobs that go with it, and I and many colleagues here have a huge interest in that."
"We know that the car companies will continue to make and must make huge investments in the next generation of lighter and more fuel-efficient cars that we want, and our colleague from the Green Party made that point earlier; but those investments will come from profits – there is not going to be any state subsidy for those – and what we want are profitable car companies."
"I want to give you an important figure which relates to the Genk issue."
"70% of the world's car industry's profits are generated in the United States market because that is where they sell larger cars."
"The reason for the lay-offs at Genk is because demand for one of Ford’s largest models has fallen off dramatically."
"Ford has announced that it is going to make the next generation Ford Mondeo at Genk and our job is to ensure that we have a demand for that car."
"My conclusion for you, Commissioner, is that we want joined-up policy."
"If your colleagues in DG Environment continue to press the industry to make smaller, lighter cars without any commercial regard for what is going on, then we will be back here again."
"If we have joined-up policy-making, however, we will have a long-term, sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of this debate, I should like to ask you two urgent questions in connection with the reorganisation at Ford and, more specifically, the collective dismissal of about 3 000 workers in Genk."
"I do not think that I have to convince anyone of the fact that this is a real tragedy, not only for the people at Ford Genk, but also for the suppliers and for the region as a whole."
"However, Commissioner, the way in which this reorganisation is being managed is shocking, and in my view, contravenes European rules."
"The fact is that Ford has been in breach of contract on two occasions, the first time by failing to comply with the collective labour agreements that were concluded with the workers in 2002, and in which investments were planned."
"The second case, Commissioner, is, however, for Europe to deal with, as it has to do with a failure to consult the European Works Council in this matter."
"The reorganisation at Ford is clearly a European matter, because the cancellation of investments at Ford Genk has repercussions for two other establishments in Germany."
"Moreover, jobs have also been scrapped in Cologne and the Jaguar factory in Barnsley is being closed down."
"This clearly illustrates, therefore, that this reorganisation is a European matter that should be dealt with by the European works council. However, as it happens, Commissioner, the works council was not consulted in this matter."
"Ford is deliberately entering into negotiations on a company-by-company basis."
"This, in my view, clearly contravenes legislation concerning the European works council for which we voted here in 1994."
"After all, no attempt whatsoever is currently being made to find a solution for this reorganisation at European level."
"As my fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this could have yielded alternative solutions, for example, by spreading the work among various people in, for example, the framework of a shorter working week."
"My first question to the Commission is whether it intends, on the basis of European legislation on European works councils, to require that the Ford management start negotiations within a European framework at this stage."
"A second question on this subject, Commissioner, concerns the following. The regulation concerning Ford's European works council is apparently based on the notorious Article 13, the so-called voluntary agreements, to which the directive and annex with minimum provisions do not apply."
"Would this not yet again constitute a reason for the Commission to impose these famous minimum rules on all agreements concerning European works councils?"
"Mr President, all those who are not resigned to the absolute domination of unrestrained capitalism are disgusted by the successive crises in our industries and, in particular, by that in the automobile sector."
"In my country, Catalonia, this sector saw 31 so-called social plans – , in Catalan – in 2001-2002, as a result of which 5 200 employees were made redundant."
"The closures of companies manufacturing automobile components, such as Lear and Valeo which have shut up shop, are deeply shocking for my fellow countrymen."
"One does not have to be an expert to understand that competition with Eastern European countries is now unviable."
"Automobile companies, and others, are relocating because, over there, the costs of skilled labour are much lower than ours and, in this area, our companies cannot compete."
"If, some day, these countries succeed in genuinely converging with our own, companies will relocate still further to the east, outside the EU, following the cold logic of the market economy."
"We are told that, in order to avoid such evils, greater flexibility in the employment market is required."
"Greater flexibility means fewer guarantees for workers and, hence, less social cohesion."
"For all those who believe in the European social model, that is unacceptable."
"Mr President, the theory that made its choices about restructuring according to political criteria seems to me to be very tenuous."
"Italy is a country that is home to a large automobile manufacturer, which is Italian and which has restructuring policies that it implements, of necessity, in Italy."
"The issue is, as has been said, that the automobile market is a mature market; automobile production has shifted, little by little, to many countries, in particular countries in the Far East, and there are probably lots of Members who have bought Korean, Japanese or even Indian cars."
"The issue is that firms need to be restructured because the market changes and greater competitiveness is needed in the sector."
"I do not think that it will help us to discuss the choices made by individual firms; in my view, these choices should be left to the firms themselves, for the sake of competitiveness of the system and long-term employment: there is no point thinking that you can sustain employment today when there is a risk of losing it tomorrow."
"What can be done is to guarantee a great deal more than the institutions do today; a lot more than the European Commission – which currently assigns its budget to agriculture and declining sectors and not into innovative sectors – has done to date; to insist on the quality of the workforce in general, on training and on technological innovation."
"We need employment and we cannot expect it to come from declining sectors that need to be restructured."
"We must create the conditions for the workforce to be in the sectors of the future and not those of the past."
"The Commission does not allocate funds; the Commission follows what the governments decide regarding agriculture and other sectors."
"– In this debate, a great number of references have been made to agreements between Renault and Ford, but I do not think that these agreements actually exist."
"For what was the case at Renault?"
"It is true that the provisions with regard to the European and national works councils were completely ignored."
"That was the big problem."
"It was, above all, an issue between the workers and the company."
"Here, we have, in fact, another problem."
"There is, of course, also a problem between the Belgian Government and the company."
"That is the crux of the problem and, in my view, there are two or three reasons for this."
"The first reason is, I fear, the very complex system of Belgian social security."
"It is simply the case in Belgium that, relatively speaking, the whole surreal business is funded by social security to a far greater extent than in other countries, but that, of course, leads to a bad competitive position compared to those other countries."
"It is not, however, for Ford to solve this; it is a task for the Belgian Government."
"The second reason, of course, why matters have been brought to a head, is that it has taken far too long to comply with Ford's requests to do something about the shift bonus."
"Then it suddenly transpired that the German companies were more competitive, although wages there are higher than in Belgium."
"Who then is to blame, is it the workers?"
"No, it is the Belgian Government."
"The Belgian Government should take responsibility for this and should prevent this from happening again."
"This, I believe, is the main conclusion that we can draw from this."
"If there are problems with legislation, it is fortunate that there is a directive, so they should refer to it and start legal proceedings."
"In the case of Renault, it has transpired that this can have a positive outcome."
"That is the method, but we must in this matter look for a solution that is different from that in the case of Renault."
"Mr President, although I am of course unable to make any statement about the state of affairs at Ford in Genk in the brief speaking time available to me, but I would like to make it perfectly clear that there has been no breach of the European Works Councils Directive."
"The European Works Council has been notified, and there has been a breach of Belgian law on collective labour agreements."
"As regards the European Works Councils Directive, I can explain it to anyone, as I was its originator."
"I was myself chairman of the works council of Ford Europe for six years."
"I would recommend waiting to see what comes out of the discussions between the trade unions and the European Works Council, as I am sure that Ford Genk will get compensation for what it was promised in the collective labour agreement."
"There is no wages bargaining in the European Works Council; that is a matter for the parties to the collective labour agreement and not for the European Works Councils."
"– Mr President, whether or not this or that piece of legislation has been breached, I think it is appropriate to express our solidarity with the people who are being hit by Ford’s decisions, first of all, of course, the workers of Ford Genk, but also the people who work in the supplying companies and in other companies that have been affected."
"The Commission has told this House that it will carry out a study into the future of the sector."
"Even though, of course, studies have already been carried out and their results have been made available, I am surprised that the Commission has announced that it still intends to go ahead with this."
"In Belgium, however, there are economists who claim that employment in the western European car assembly sector is set to halve within the foreseeable future, because the potential market is unable to follow increased productivity."
"Similar predictions are being made for other sectors in industry."
"Assuming that the Commission has collated some research material of its own, I should like to ask it whether it shares these gloomy expectations."
"I hope that they are a little less gloomy, but industry is in any case facing a few changes."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether it is not necessary after all for the government to provide some support while industry is going through this transition."
"The social partners should definitely be involved as well."
"In my view, however, the government has a role to play here, as do the European authorities, which certainly have a coordinating task."
"I have another two specific questions."
"Reference has been made to the Structural Funds, and to the fact that they will be subject to a review in 2006."
"The current programming periods are still running."
"I have asked the Commission what scope the Structural Funds could offer Limburg at this stage."
"I was told that there is still a percentage of 4% in reserve that can be tapped into at any time."
"My question is whether, further to the problems at Ford Genk, the Flemish Government has asked the Commission to tap into those 4% or whether it has been silent on that score."
"Finally, I should like to say the following. This issue has naturally been discussed in the Belgian Parliament, and the Finance Minister has stated there that he would contact the European authorities to see whether it would be possible to join forces again with 'conversion partnerships'."
"These are partnerships that receive certain fiscal benefits during a certain period of time. On that front too, I should like to find out from the Commission whether or not the Belgian Government has been in touch to date."
"Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement, given your extremely polite reference."
"I assure you that the comment on institutional responsibilities as regards the budget of the European institutions did not pass me by."
"I was referring to the budget – and also to the Commission, but not just to the Commission – however, the objective is to reformulate the European budget."
"I was absolutely certain that you were perfectly aware of the functioning of the institutions."
"I was giving the information to our visitors, to our guests, not to you, Mr della Vedova."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I have closely followed this debate, in which a range of issues have been raised and ideas have been put forward."
"I will pass them all on to the Commissioner responsible so that they may be carefully examined."
"I mentioned most of the points that have been made in my opening remarks, and I do not therefore wish to repeat them."
"There seems to be general consensus as to how to deal with the crises resulting from the need to adapt and from industrial change and restructuring."
"Let me reiterate one thing, and do so clearly."
"Effective, timely and comprehensive information for, and consultation with, workers’ representatives constitutes a key element in our response to situations such as these."
"Another important element in this context will be following up the ongoing consultation with the social partners on the restructuring of enterprises."
"I am sure that you all understand how necessary it is to identify good practice for this, at European level, and, where necessary, to develop it further."
"Further to Mrs Van Lancker’s and Mr Kuckelkorn’s discussion, I would like to point out that the Commission has not, to date, received any complaint from the responsible workers’ representatives in relation to this matter."
"Moreover, if the directive in question has indeed been breached, then that is a case for the Belgian courts; it is they who must then consider the issue."
"As I have already announced, though, we will in any case be launching a revision of the directive."
"Nor must we overlook the fact that, while changes in industry have economic effects and consequences for employment and social cohesion, they can also offer opportunities, especially when they are anticipated, prepared for and managed."
"In relation to this, Mrs Weiler, you mentioned the need to make a financial request or to examine the possibility of applying structural funds for this purpose – my experts here tell me that no such application has as yet been made to the Commission."
"Dialogue, transparency, genuine worker participation, foresight, risk avoidance and the encouragement of employability – such are the key elements in a European response to all these occurrences."
"Let us all work at them and do our utmost to create the instruments – whether legal acts or in some other form – to further develop these concepts."
"– However much I admire the Commissioner for his agricultural policy, I do not think it right that there should be nobody from the Commission following these proceedings, given the huge importance of the debate on the automobile industry's future and the relevant social dimension."
"Although I am grateful to you for being here and congratulate you on everything you do for agriculture, I have to say that, normally speaking, a Commissioner should be here for industrial policy and social policy who can reply to the questions."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0412/2003) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Mid-term Social Policy Agenda Review."
". Mrs Smet, thank you for the comment you made a moment ago;"
"I agree with it, and that also applies to this subject."
"Naturally, we cannot deal with the mid-term social policy agenda review established in Nice in her absence."
"Incidentally, it is nice to see that Mr Fischler is present, and therefore the Commission too."
"I would have liked to have had her answers, particularly because we had already discussed the mid-term social policy agenda review with her in our committee."
"Nevertheless, there were still a number of questions left unanswered, and that is why we are putting these questions verbally today, without a resolution."
"The Nice social agenda is very important for the perfectly simple reason that Europe and European citizens are expecting the social side of Europe to develop further after the introduction and coming into force of EMU, the euro, and the stability and growth pact."
"This is indeed necessary; it not only costs money, it also delivers benefits; this has been clearly demonstrated by the Commission in its study."
"This agenda naturally includes creating more and better jobs, anticipating working environments, fighting poverty and social exclusion, modernising social protection, promoting gender equality and ultimately social policy as part of enlargement."
"At the end of my speech I would like to ask a few questions which we would like the Commission to answer."
"In the meantime, I note that the European Parliament has already expressed its objections relating to this social agenda three times during the annual scoreboards."
"Each time, we asked that attention be paid to the points brought forward by Parliament – some existing points relating to the social agenda, some new points connected with current events, such as the events currently taking place at Ford Genk."
"In other words, therefore, we are asking for the new policy initiatives to be properly implemented, but also for an indication as to the means by which this will be done."
"We are also of the opinion that there is often a great deal more to be done – including legislative activities – than is currently being done: deliberation, consultation, expert groups etc., all of which takes time."
"When I came in here, I thought we were going to deal with the European works council, but this will still not have happened by the time I leave, and it may not even happen during the next legislature."
"This is causing us problems all the time in practice; today's debate is proof of that!"
"In other words, we are not satisfied with the way in which a number of proposals on this agenda are being dealt with at the moment, and I would like to list a few examples."
"The most important is naturally the question of the European works council."
"We have already let it be known that we believe that consultations have been going on long enough, including in the area of social dialogue."
"The partners have had more than enough time to exercise influence on this."
"Now it is time for measures!"
"We had already expected these in 2002, but they have still not arrived!"
"This is in fact nothing new for the Commission, and it is nothing new for the Commissioner."
"The same applies to the working time directive."
"We asked that attention be paid to this area as well."
"At the moment, a number of countries in Europe are avoiding the working time regulations, and that is exactly what we do not want, as it distorts competition."
"We want to see measures introduced in this regard, and as soon as possible!"
"The Commission should take the initiative on this point, and it should do so quicker than is currently the case."
"We could go on like this for a while, including with regard to aspects such as the new occupational diseases."
"I could give you a whole list of rapporteurs we have had on this subject: Mrs Van Lancker, Mrs Smet, Mrs Hermange and finally Mrs Figueiredo."
"New occupational diseases, the social sides of competition policy, intervention procedures in the area of the delocalisation of companies; we have been asking for these for some time now."
"These points seem to be repeatedly left off the agenda, however."
"As far as social and fiscal measures are concerned, we want to put the effects these have on cross-border working on the agenda as soon as possible."
"We want the regulations to address the question of gender inequality."
"We could go on like this; the legal basis for what we call the ‘civil dialogue’ is also one of these points."
"In other words, what I said was not yet exhaustive."
"Taking all this into consideration, we would like to ask the following two questions:"
"How does the Commission intend to use its right of initiative (in other words its right to take active steps) to implement the social policy agenda, both with regard to the old points and with regard to the points we have put forward on behalf of the European Parliament?"
"In doing so, we must bear in mind that these should contribute to creating full employment, the fight against social dumping and discrimination and improving the quality of employment in Europe."
"That is our first question."
"Our second question is this: How does the Commission envisage improving employment and social policy after the enlargement of the EU?"
"We have been highlighting the problems in detail for some time, including the follow-up and implementation of the legislation, the and the development of social dialogue."
"These are not easy subjects for the accession countries."
"In this connection, I would also like attention to be paid to progress in European employment strategy and the use of the open coordination methods with regard to social exclusion and social protection."
". Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to apologise for the fact that Mrs Diamantopoulou cannot be here and ask you to be tolerant, as you have to make do with me."
"As you are aware, the Nice European Council laid down the social policy agenda."
"It was also agreed that a mid-term review should be carried out in 2003, the object of which was to be to target more specifically the actions and measures considered necessary and to present a timetable for the second half of the period ending in 2005."
"The mid-term review, adopted by the Commission at the end of June, is based on an overall evaluation of the first years of implementation, which have been the subject of annual reports in scoreboards and on a review of the most significant challenges and of the drivers of change."
"The review also sets out the Commission’s thinking as regards the realisation of the EU’s overall objectives, and the creation of more and better jobs and also greater social cohesion, all within the context of the further pursuit of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Commission has announced a comprehensive package of initiatives and actions, in which all the relevant actors will be involved."
"Let me say, in response to your two questions, that the Commission is using its right of initiative to propose the specific measures that are required and that have been announced in the mid-term review."
"These include, for example, new draft legislation, such as the proposal for a directive on temporary workers, or the simplification of existing ones, such as those in the area of health and safety at work."
"The Commission is also availing itself of its right to consult the social partners and to join with them in discovering those problem areas that still remain to be attended to."
"One of them, for example, is the issue of the portability of occupational pension rights."
"Another is the following-up of the revision of the Working Time Directive."
"This has to do with the European employment strategy, in particular with the proposals for guidelines and recommendations relating to it."
"At the same time, the Commission is encouraging the Member States to work together in modernising social security and promoting social inclusion."
"As regards your second question, I have to stress that the mid-term review’s priorities as regards the structuring of the next few years’ work are twofold."
"One is to further develop the agenda for an enlarged European Union."
"The other is, as a matter of priority, to monitor the transposition and implementation of the in employment and social affairs and to ensure that this is done properly."
"In order that this goal may be achieved, it will be necessary to pay particular attention to involving the relevant networks of national representatives, who are to perform a supporting role in transposing and implementing European law, and also to make use of the monitoring instruments still at our disposal."
"Although the primary emphasis will be on assistance and advice, the Commission will not hesitate to apply appropriate enforcement measures or, where appropriate, to take legal action."
"That applies, though, not only to the new Member States that will be joining the European Union next year, but to all the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer."
"When I look at the social policy agenda and see where we are at the moment – we are mid-term – we are a year away from elections, and enlargement is also just around the corner."
"I think that we cannot avoid taking this into account."
"If we have to choose between the priorities, then for me, enlargement is the top priority."
"There are numerous social directives."
"We are encouraging the development of social dialogue."
"We are encouraging the creation of administrations, services and institutions that can guarantee social security in these countries."
"We all know that despite the fact that these countries are acceding, it is still very difficult to implement a large number of these aspects."
"If this implementation does not go well, if social dialogue does not take place, if there are insufficient institutions in place to apply all of this, this will cause a delay everywhere. Including here."
"It goes without saying that this will entail a delay."
"After all, you cannot simply concoct a whole series of new directives when the countries that are joining next year – thus creating a global Union of 25 countries – are unable to comply with a particular dimension of this European Union."
"It is extremely important for social policy to develop in the enlargement countries."
"It is developing much too slowly and on much too narrow a scale."
"I therefore believe that this is a top priority, because it will adversely affect the growth of social policy at a European level, whether we like it or not."
"Our second priority is employment."
"I think that the Commission is making a good choice, including in its priorities."
"I agree with that."
"As we can all see, the things that were proposed in Lisbon, namely an employment level of 70% and so on, are progressing extremely slowly."
"When the new countries join, employment levels will naturally fall, not increase."
"We will therefore be even further away from the Lisbon targets than we are at the moment."
"The whole policy surrounding employment must be stimulated and supported."
"Then there is a third point: the review of certain directives."
"I think we can do that, for example the review of the Renault directive, the review of the works council directive, even the review of the directive relating to health and safety at work."
"A great number of our directives need to be reviewed."
"For me, that is the third priority that we could introduce."
"If we want new directives, we will really have to make choices and establish priorities."
"We are no longer in a position to introduce 40 new directives, not even 10."
"I think we must limit this and I think that one of the priorities in new directives should be to do something for the disabled."
"We have already had an extensive debate on this."
"This social group still has a difficult time accessing the labour market."
"I think that we need to regulate a number of things specifically for them."
"Mr President, the Commission's mid-term review is actually an exercise in marking time."
"It is full of hot air with very little substance."
"There are a range of issues outstanding."
"We now have a three-year delay in the revision of the European Works Council Directive, despite the recent occurrences at Genk and a whole series of earlier problems."
"There is a blockage in Council on the temporary agency workers directive, a vital part of our effort to balance security and flexibility."
"We have a very uncertain timetable around the revision of the working time directive and an end to the scandalous abuse of the opt-out in my own country."
"There is an outstanding call from Parliament for a directive on individual dismissals and the social security aspects of atypical working: no action on those fronts has been taken at all."
"I also share Mrs Smet's concerns over enlargement, the , the application of the – particularly in the area of occupational safety and health, the development of social dialogue, open coordination in the European Union as it will be this time next year."
"All of these things are causing us deep concern and we have seen little, if any, action on all of these important issues."
"Let me make it clear that we fully understand the pressures and the obstacles being put in the way of Commissioner Diamantopoulou and her efforts to deliver on these important issues."
"Some of these come from inside the college of Commissioners, some from Council, some involve governments of a socialist complexion."
"All I can say is that we will redouble our efforts to try to ensure that we support her in overcoming those obstacles and moving the social agenda forward."
"That is vitally important."
"Unless we can deliver and move the social agenda forward, there is a very real danger that the overall, carefully-balanced policy mix established at Lisbon will be destroyed."
"If that happens it will be a major disaster for the future of the whole of the Union."
"Madam President, the increase in unemployment, in insecure employment and in social exclusion cast doubt upon the concept of a Europe that champions social justice and solidarity."
"We know that there are more than 15 million unemployed people in the European Union and more than 60 million who live on less than 60% of the average national income. These are problems that mainly affect women, but also the elderly living on very low pensions, immigrants, children, people with disabilities and workers in insecure and badly paid jobs."
"The situation is considerably worse in the candidate countries that will be joining the Union in May next year."
"In light of this worsening socio-economic situation, measures must be adopted that are different to those used to date, because disparities have increased, cohesion has weakened and no real progress has been made as regards gender equality policy."
"The current situation calls for absolute priority no longer to be given to complying with the Stability Pact and, on the contrary, for this to be suspended so that its irrational criteria for nominal convergence can be reviewed. The current situation calls for the primacy of monetarist and competition policies to be ended and for resolving these serious social problems to be put on the agenda, for compliance with the Social Policy Agenda and for an effective public investment policy in order to create the fifteen million jobs that the European Union needs."
"Consequently, as stated in my recent report on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which this plenary adopted in September, priority must be given to solving the serious problems of unemployment and poverty – including persistent poverty – in all Community policies, specifically in competition policy (and since the Commissioner responsible for the common agricultural policy is here with us, this could at least help us to look at farming issues and here too amend policy, with a view to combating poverty and social exclusion), not forgetting the Structural Funds and the Stability Pact."
"We regret the fact that the Commission is not only failing to comply with the Nice social agenda, but also still has no plans to present new initiatives in areas already requested by the European Parliament, which has insisted that these be drawn up rapidly."
"This is a long list, which other speakers have already referred to, but which we also adopted at the sitting of 3 September and for which I once again express my support, in addition to agreeing with all the questions that have been put here."
"I repeat the need for effective measures, for mechanisms for intervention in the field of company relocations, and of the directives on Article 13, both with regard to women’s rights in all the various areas of employment and to people with disabilities."
"We must make good the delays in improving the directives intended to promote health and safety in the workplace, specifically for women, and the proposals that this Parliament has approved must be implemented."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I share Mrs Smet’s view that the great challenge in the socio-political area too has to do with enlargement."
"The introduction of the EU’s socio-political legislation on the working environment and labour law will mean a very great deal for wage earners in the new Member States."
"It will also, however, mean something for the present Member States."
"The risk of social dumping between our countries will be much reduced, something that is incredibly important."
"Another important issue in connection with enlargement is the dialogue between the two sides of industry."
"In many of the new Member States, there is no dialogue up and running, and no employers and employees used to participating together in the socio-political agenda."
"A third issue is the Lisbon cooperation, which we must review and stick to."
"This must not, however, mean that we do not put forward proposals in new areas, for example in the area of the working environment in response, for example, to atypical jobs."
"We must therefore cope successfully both with enlargement and with new risks and new socio-political challenges."
"In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs earlier this week I already really let fly at the Commission on one point on the social agenda; the Posting of Workers directive."
"It is incomprehensible that the evaluation of this directive has not been seized as an opportunity to better assess the problems of cross-border employment of workers and to take new initiatives in this area."
"Enlargement is just around the corner, and I have already told Commissioner Verheugen and Commissioner Diamantopolou that this transitional period is absolutely not a solution to the problems that enlargement may bring with it."
"We must pursue a proactive policy and we must create better conditions for active workforce mobility."
"My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already mentioned the temporary agency workers directive."
"The impasse we have reached in this area must naturally not be taken as a reason for not doing anything else in areas relating to the situation of non-typical jobs, including in connection with this directive."
"I am thinking of the position of the self-employed who are not actually self-employed but are in fact employees, for example, and the social security of the non-typical employee."
"If we do not create a better framework of definitions and labour and social regulations in Europe, this social will soon only apply to a small minority of employees, and they will not be the ones who need it most!"
"Finally, a word of warning."
"I think that if we do not manage to implement this social policy in Europe, a lot of people will turn against Europe."
". Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, let me say, very briefly, that I have taken written notes of all the suggestions, demands, and aspirations you have expressed here today, and that I will pass them on to Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"Basically, the one thing I can tell you is that I share your view, firstly, of the enormous significance of the policy set out in what we term the Lisbon targets, and also of the tasks we are presented with in the field of future social policy."
"I also agree with you that it is now in particular, so to speak on the eve of enlargement, necessary that we have to give particular attention to how these issues fit into this context, and, like you, I believe that this is a matter of urgency."
"Fundamentally, I believe, we have to continue to take action on both fronts, for we must not overlook the close connection between issues of employment and social security and the question of whether we will succeed in recreating proper growth in Europe."
"That is one of the basic conditions, and we will bring about growth of this only if we take appropriate action regarding the various elements that are necessary if our European economy is to be restructured."
"On the other hand, though, it should not be thought that this is only about growth, in other words, only about the economy; it is also, of course, about social protection."
"I have already told you in my opening remarks what the Commission’s current plans are."
"I hope that these measures will indeed enable us to make the necessary improvements to the situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A5-0333/2003) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Election 2004: How to ensure balanced representation of women and men [2003/2108(INI)]."
"We are in the middle of an exciting and demanding period in the history of Europe."
"We are increasing the number of EU Member States, and we are at the moment devising and debating a new framework for treaty-based cooperation based on the nation states and the people."
"There are quite a few prior conditions of involvement in EU cooperation, but one of them is the need to practise democracy and observe human rights, that is to say people must have equal opportunities to develop, and exercise control over, their lives."
"When we look at what is actually happening in Europe, who is it that takes the decisions? Who determines the laws?"
"Who manages daily life in international, European, national, regional and local assemblies? Who personifies public power?"
"The answer is quite simply that it is the men who do this. If there is any doubt about this, it is enough to try asking how many women there are among Heads of State or Government."
"The answer is, none."
"If we look at the family photo from Copenhagen in 2002, there are 64 people in that picture, including just eight women."
"Is that the case because there is a shortage of women in Europe?"
"Is it a case of our constituting a minority?"
"There are, now and again, people who tell us that we do, whereupon we are placed among other minorities."
"In that case, we must, however, tell ourselves that, no, this is not the case."
"We constitute at least half the population."
"Women form at least half the electorate, so it is not therefore a question of there not being enough women."
"Is it, therefore, a case of there being no competent women?"
"No, that is not the reason, either."
"There are in actual fact women – and, as time goes by, more women than men – who enter higher education, although that is no longer, of course, always a criterion for participating in political life."
"It is not this that forms the background to the situation."
"There are quite a few reasons why there are not enough women, and these apply everywhere."
"In this case, we shall concentrate on the election we face next year."
"As has been said, we are at present building the new Europe."
"Women constitute half the new Europe, and it is absolutely fundamental that this half should also be involved in deciding the framework for, and content of, further cooperation."
"One of the places in which they can do this is, moreover, in the European Parliament."
"Today, we are in a situation in which 30% of Members of the European Parliament are women."
"We are now enlarging the EU to include ten new countries and, in that connection, we are obliged to take a brief look at how women are represented in those countries."
"Unfortunately, matters do not look too good."
"Obviously, not all the countries are right at the bottom of the table, and the fact is that we also have, among the Member States, countries that are low down on the list where women’s representation is concerned."
"All the same, we have to say that the average is low."
"What, therefore, we have to concentrate on in the forthcoming election is getting more women to stand and finding out why others do not wish to do so. Are they in actual fact just not invited to stand, or does the old classic pattern apply whereby no one voluntarily surrenders power, neither men nor women for that matter."
"Personally, I believe it is the classic situation. Naturally, men do not voluntarily relinquish power, just as we women also find it extremely difficult to give up so-called power over our children."
"None of us are saints. It is now important, however, for us to try to discuss this matter and to understand that, if we are to have this EU cooperation accepted among the EU’s populations, it would perhaps be a good idea if we were to try inviting women to participate and if, above all, we were to devise systems that might give women opportunities to be elected if they were finally to appear on the lists."
"Gaining acceptance of EU cooperation will certainly take some doing. Over there sits a Swedish Commissioner and I, who speak now, am a Dane, and if there is anywhere it is hard going obtaining grass-roots acceptance of European cooperation, it is in Sweden and Denmark, with the greatest scepticism among women."
"Experience in the Scandinavian countries shows that it is not, therefore, a case of women not being elected."
"If they stand on an equal footing, they are in actual fact elected."
"The fact is that, if there are women who have any chance at all of being elected, then elected they are."
"It is not therefore a case of voters generally believing women not to be up to scratch. On the contrary, they are happy to vote for them."
"The truth is that they have no opportunity to vote women representatives in."
"It is extremely important that we discuss this matter now because, at present, 31% of MEPs are women."
"Among the new countries, matters appear lopsided."
"In a Parliament with greater influence upon European legislation than we have ever had before, we are thus now in danger of having far less than 30% women, because women are so poorly represented in, for example, the new countries."
"There are two countries that have sent no female observers at all."
"It really is unbelievable that democracy can be practised and human rights observed on that basis."
"I think we must all try to help each other ensure that there is a proper proportion of women in the European Parliament so that people feel represented in this House."
"Madam President, that was an excellent contribution by Mrs Dybkjær."
"I am able to concur with it 100%."
"It was an excellent introduction to what this debate needs to be about."
"First of all, I naturally wish to congratulate the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and also Mrs Dybkjær as rapporteur, for having taken the initiative regarding this report."
"This too emphasises the importance of bringing about balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process, especially in the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament next year."
"We must take democracy seriously and take account of the equality issue in decision-making."
"If we profess democratic values, the representation of the people and citizens’ active participation, we cannot at the same time exclude half the population from the bodies in which the decisions are taken."
"Increased participation on the part of women also means better opportunities for society to take care of its citizens."
"We lose out on both resources and experience if women cannot be a part of political life."
"Women must be given access to the labour market and to politics in order to be able to advance professionally at a pace commensurate with their qualifications."
"In that way, proper use will be made of their skills."
"Unfortunately, it has so far been too often the case that men have been elected."
"That is something we must change."
"As pointed out in the report, all the Member States have committed themselves to implementing the UN’s action plan from the 1995 Beijing Conference, together with a series of other international programmes in support of the principle of equal participation by women and men in decision-making bodies and in the decision-making process."
"These constitute the international framework within which we must all work."
"Balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process and in all areas of life is also the central theme of the Commission’s 2003-2004 Work Programme."
"The work on assessing which projects are to be subsidised from the gender equality programme is in its final phase right now."
"I am also pleased to inform you that the Commission is at present developing a database on ‘Women and men in decision-making’."
"The database is one of a series of measures for developing and maintaining statistics, which are also important as a tool and for providing background information."
"The preparations for publishing the initial results from this database are currently under way."
"At the beginning of 2004, the content will be presented on the Commission’s web site."
"It will then be updated each year."
"The main aims of the database are firstly to measure progress in relation to the commitments made and, secondly, to bring about increased awareness in the present Member States, the EEA countries and the candidate countries of the situation regarding women and men in decision-making positions."
"May I also mention the measures on decision-making which were recently adopted by the Italian Presidency with the support of the Commission and to which attention is drawn by the report."
"The Syracuse Conference, together with the subsequent informal meetings between the ministers for equality, emphasised the need to maintain the efforts to achieve balanced representation of women and men in the decision-making processes at all levels."
"It was also proposed that, by agreement between all the political parties, at least 30% of candidates they appoint to stand for election to the European Parliament should be women."
"The parties should, moreover, actively strive to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils, particularly those affecting women directly: an employment rate among women of at least 60% by no later than 2010, together with regulations concerning access to good childcare at a reasonable cost."
"These objectives are also among the tools and basic conditions that will enable women to participate in political life and the life of society generally."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the important report she has produced and at a time such as this, on the eve of the European Parliament elections."
"We all know that equality between men and women is a fundamental principle in Community law, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which included equality between men and women as an objective in all programmes."
"We therefore call for concrete measures to facilitate the presence of women in electoral lists and, therefore, in the European Parliament."
"In this case, this request could be extended to the other regional or national parliaments in which the representation of women is still low in comparison with the percentage of women, who make up half the population, and in some cases rather more than half the population."
"We know that when there is no special assistance, through positive action measures, with laws to facilitate this great presence of women, we women have real problems accessing institutional posts, political posts and therefore political decision-making posts and positions of power."
"We have had experience over recent years of the presence of women continuing to increase slightly, but in no case has it passed much more than 30% and we are right to fear that in the next European elections it may be reduced."
"As the rapporteur has said, the presence of women amongst the observers coming from the enlargement countries is really low; some countries have not presented women at all as observers, and we fear that, following the elections to the European Parliament, this presence will be no greater than 15%."
"It is precisely for this reason that it is important and significant that we are stressing this at the moment, and we are not forgetting the countries which currently belong to the European Union, in which the percentage is no greater than 30% in the majority of cases – with the exception of the Nordic countries – and in others that percentage is even lower and women are still facing significant difficulties in terms of accessing decision-making positions."
"They are still significant because there are no electoral laws – with the exception of two countries – laying down the obligation for women to be present on lists and because our ability to be present in decision-making bodies and parliaments depends essentially on the political parties, on the mentality of political leaders and on the awareness we are able to communicate to society on the importance of this issue."
"This is therefore the appropriate time and it is a task which we, as women committed to the presence of women, but also men, and Members of Parliament and political leaders must take on: this challenge of achieving greater presence for women within the political institutions."
"Only the political will of leaders, of parties, when it comes to making decisions, will ensure that there are really more women following the elections and therefore a better balance between men and women in decision-making."
"Madam President, it really is curious, after 50 years of European policy on gender equality and 100 years since the right of women to vote was claimed and recognised, that we are trying here to persuade everyone of the self-evident, in other words that men and women should share all the responsibilities and all the obligations of both private and public life equally and fairly, that there should be a balanced participation of men and women in democratic institutions and in all political decision-making centres."
"In the run up to the European elections in June, Mrs Dybkjær's truly exceptional report is of particular value, because it sets the framework within which all the Member States should move, especially the accession countries, in order to ensure that the percentage of women in the House as a result of the European elections should at least be no smaller than it is at present, which is 31%."
"And I should like to name the two countries, Estonia and Slovenia, which did not bother to send even one woman, even one as an example, with the observers they sent to the European Parliament."
"Our fears are also reinforced by the traumatic experience we had last year, with 17% participation by women in the constitutional convention for the European constitution."
"That is why our committee, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has put promoting the democracy of equality at the top of its priorities and has taken initiatives to mobilise governments, national parliaments, political leaders and women themselves in order to achieve this objective, an objective which does not simply concern the application in deed rather than just word of gender equality, but also the financial and social development of Europe through the rational use of the valuable human resource which women represent."
"The Lisbon strategy, like other ambitious European policies, urgently needs the full participation of women at all planning and decision-making levels in order to achieve its objectives."
"The future of Europe cannot be planned in the absence of women."
"In the run up to the European elections, we need additional strategies and legislative measures, positive action, quotas or political agreements which will safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in electoral combinations and in the elected bodies which result."
"I hope the new European Parliament of the 25 will attain this objective and will operate as a shining example and standard for the other parliaments in the world."
"I would also like to warmly congratulate Mrs Dybkjær on this report."
"It has come at exactly the right time, just before the European elections, and it has been mentioned here by several speakers already: we will have to do our utmost to match this turnout percentage of 30-31% that was achieved for the European Parliament elections."
"This is certainly not helped by the accession countries, where we only have 14% at the moment."
"I therefore believe that in the context of the verification of these countries, we will have to ensure that gender equality forms part of our future fundamental community law, and that we must therefore make sure on an internal level that this is also done in the relevant parliaments."
"It is all very well pointing the finger at other countries, however; but we also have examples of women being seriously short-changed in our own countries."
"In my country, it was not so long ago that only one female minister was appointed."
"There was a great deal of protest against this, but fortunately that cabinet soon fell and we now have five female ministers and five female secretaries of state."
"To my great regret, neither of the two ministers appointed by my own party, which purports to do a great deal for women, is a woman."
"Not because there are no capable women, but because there are always other people who are more important and who have to take priority."
"As long as we carry on in this way, women will have no chance."
"I am also of the opinion, however, that we ourselves must keep hammering on about gender equality and that we must keep a very close eye on it."
"For example, I would have nothing against following examples like those mentioned in Mrs Dybkjær's report – like in France where party financing depends on the number of women on the list – because we cannot stand still, we must do something."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission to pay additional attention to this point in its consultations with all Member States."
"Madam President, Mrs Dybkjær’s report deals with something of which all of us in this House have very long experience: actual life in the political organisations in which we participate."
"Commissioner Wallström said that men elect men."
"Yes, men in political parties, especially, elect men."
"They elect men to a greater extent than the electorate does, a fact that is very interesting."
"When women enter politics, the organisation of political work changes, and new issues appear on the political agenda."
"What is more, women naturally have different political and ideological perceptions."
"In the course of last year, we saw the composition of the Convention and the way in which issues of equality were manipulated when it came, among other things, to the legal status assigned to equality."
"We still see, after many years of decisions to use ‘gender mainstreaming’ as a method in decision-making, that this is completely absent from most areas of politics."
"It is now also proposed to cut back on the areas of competence of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"This is completely contrary to the trend."
"It is even a phasing-out of gender equality in politics."
"It is rather ironic reading the Council recommendation from December 1996, which stresses that the under-representation of women in decision-making posts leaves their experiences unused and undervalued and thus constitutes a loss for society as a whole."
"I do in fact agree with the Council recommendation but, when the Council’s own composition throughout the years is examined in the form of photographs shown after the Council meetings, it is seen still to hark back to another era."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my warmest thanks go to Mrs Dybkjær for this eminently timely and important report."
"We all share a concern about how balanced the representation of gender is going to be in the European Parliament in the next legislature."
"We have a good six months to work hard to dispel this concern and we should not be afraid."
"Equality is one of the European fundamental values which the new Member States have also committed themselves to respecting."
"There can be no genuine democracy if women are unable to participate in decision-making at all its levels."
"The fact is that the establishment of pluralist parliamentary democracy does not in itself guarantee equal participation of women and men in political decision-making."
"We could have rid ourselves of the problem entirely by developing a common European act regarding elections, in which gender equality would be guaranteed."
"Female politicians have to be made strong professionals in their field with the help of training and financial and moral support."
"This way the reasons for the lower areas of competency with regard to the women in a quota system compared to their male colleagues would become groundless and fade away."
"The aim of an equal society is dimly visible as decision-making without the need for quotas, with the highest decision-making bodies representing the genders equally."
"It would not seem, however, that we will achieve this without an interim stage, with the EU, the Member States and the political parties actively involved in working jointly on behalf of equality."
"The political groups should agree common policies to reach a position where in the end equality becomes a reality in economic, political and social life."
"I now want to throw down the gauntlet, as it were, and ask the male Members of the European Parliament here to think about whether they have ever voted for a woman."
"Furthermore, if you are also influential in your country’s political arena would you propose a woman as President of the Commission?"
"Moreover, if there is an office of President of the EU, who might the woman be whom you would vote for as President?"
"Madam President, I am able to support what Mrs Dybkjær has said about gender equality, so I shall instead use my speaking time to talk about a genuine success where such equality is concerned."
"I was elected to Parliament as a representative of an all-party movement, the June Movement, which has now operated for ten years on the principle that we should draw half of all our parliamentary candidates and half of our party’s leading members equally from both sexes."
"We have just recently prepared a new list of parliamentary candidates, consisting of ten women and ten men, with the vacancies divided on an alternating basis between male and female candidates."
"For a long time, we had more men than we could make use of and only half the women we needed to have been elected."
"We therefore began searching through our membership, and we finally obtained the list we wanted and needed."
"The outcome would, however, have been a lopsided list if we had not adopted regulations committing ourselves to having a list divided equally between both sexes."
"The outcome was that gender equality operated to the advantage of the men."
"Some of the women did in fact obtain more votes at the party conference than some of the men but were listed beneath men with fewer votes because, according to our rule, every other person on the list must be a woman."
"This outcome was not intended, but I can sincerely recommend all parties to introduce gender equality for all their lists."
"Women consistently hold back, even in those countries that are most advanced in terms of gender equality."
"Women do not want to put themselves forward unless they feel certain of being on top of everything, ideally more so than their male colleagues."
"We also know this from job applications. When men apply for a job, some of the many qualifications they reel off have to be discounted."
"When women apply, qualifications have to be added."
"That is the way things are, but it is something we can counteract by requiring the same number of candidates from each sex or, as I would prefer, at least 50% women."
"If, as a result, qualified men were deselected in favour of less qualified women, I should not recommend the system, but, in the case of ourselves in the June Movement, the system has operated perfectly at each election, given women the necessary helping hand and provided us with a list that better reflects the electorate."
"This is, then, an arrangement I should like to recommend to everyone."
"We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list."
"Nine of our candidates are under 40 years old and seven of them under 30 and, what is more, all of them are qualified."
"Our youngest parliamentary candidate, who is only 18, also has several years’ experience of EU issues."
"We have no special quota arrangement for young people but have made a conscious effort at renewal so that it is possible to give women and young people a real chance to compete with us old men."
"It is a pleasure to be able to contribute a success story from the real world to the debate on equality."
"In the EU Convention, Mrs Dybkjær and others fought bravely for gender equality but, unfortunately, this was only incorporated into the values of the Danish edition."
"The other countries’ editions just talk about equality rather than gender equality."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are debating today refers of course to the forthcoming European elections, but it also has wider significance for the participation of women in political life."
"The rapporteur's report contains interesting data on the current situation in the Member States and in the European Parliament."
"It also touches on all the aspects of the problem and makes interesting proposals on dealing with it, proposals which come mainly from the experience of the various countries."
"I think that promoting exchanges of these experiences is very important because it raises the awareness of the competent agencies, it gives them ideas about applying measures and evaluating progress."
"The European Commission should, I believe, provide facilities for such action."
"This year is dedicated to the action programme on equal opportunities for women to participate in positions of responsibility."
"I should like to know if there have already been any results from the application of the programme."
"However, I suspect that it has nothing interesting or progressive to tell us, because the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations, to which the programme mainly refers, cannot bear fruit if there is no public dialogue in the Member States on the subject which will engage the parliaments, national and regional, where they exist, and will bring parties, local authorities and social agencies face to face with their options and responsibilities, in order to make the whole of society aware of the issue of the participation of women, an issue which concerns the future of the whole of society and not just the future of women."
"We also need an open dialogue between the parties themselves so that everyone is informed and aware, from the leaders to the regional cadres, of the deficit in the participation of women and the need to apply a strategy to support and promote women cadres to positions of responsibility."
"Finally, I should like to say, in the run up to the European elections, that we need to raise the awareness of and inform women as citizens and voters about the meaning of these elections and their importance."
"Plebiscites and referenda, where they have been held, tell us that women are the citizens most distanced from the issues of European policy and the most Euro-sceptical citizens."
"This is a challenge which concerns us all, at both European and national level, and the European elections give us an opportunity to demonstrate our determination to face up to it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it can only be a source of delight today to see two front page headlines in the popular press devoted to the positions that the Commission and the European Parliament wish to adopt in order to ensure the equality of the sexes as regards both their access to goods and services and their representation in Parliament."
"At last these matters are being talked about."
"We can only congratulate our fellow MEP, Mrs Dybkjær, who emphasises the wide-ranging importance that the change in attitudes to integrating women into political life on an equal basis with men may have for the entirety of the social and political contracts we have with our fellow citizens."
"It is acknowledged that positive action is crucial if the balanced representation of women and men is to be achieved."
"It is acknowledged that involving both sexes in policy development improves policy and makes it more relevant to a varied population."
"The transparently weak representation of women in the decision-making process raises the problem of the legitimacy of the political structures, for the operation of a democratic system reflects the society it advocates or defends."
"Equality is a European value, which the Member States must respect."
"We cannot sustain this incoherence on the eve of enlargement when we wish to maintain, and even enhance, the representation of women in a House, which must spearhead this new trend and, at the same time, be the crucible that enables new behaviours and new strategies to be imagined."
"If this is to be possible, and not only desirable, we need from now on to act in such a way that the 2004 campaign affirms and brings to fruition the principle of effective democracy in which both sexes are represented, for the slightest decline in our representation would be a signal that might be misinterpreted on the eve of enlargement."
"I would like to draw your attention to the greatest inequality of power that exists: the one between men and women, and I would like to thank the for her report, which once again emphasises the need for parity."
"We still have a long way to go even in this Parliament, where one third of us are women, and the best performing country, Sweden, has recently gone from 40% to 45%; still not parity, although we all envy Sweden."
"We have made progress in Belgium, going from 11% to 23%."
"The new countries could learn something from this, as we have put a lot of effort into achieving it."
"If we leave it to the goodwill of, let us say, men, nothing will change."
"If we leave it to a change of mentality, then we could still be having this discussion when our great-granddaughters are MEPs."
"We must make the effort ourselves, and that applies just as much to the new countries."
"None of these countries reaches the 30% mark which we are already used to here."
"Only three countries have more than 20% representation by women."
"Only 14% of their representatives in this Parliament are women."
"If we have 100 new members of Parliament, then in the worst-case scenario, if the same ratio applies, we will have 86 men and 14 women."
"This is a general regression for women in the European Parliament."
"It should not be the case that the accession countries help our Parliament to become even more male-dominated."
"That is why we in the European Parliament want to give firm support to all women and to all governments who want to change things for the better, because nothing will happen without voluntary action."
"The quotas are often criticised for not being justified, for having to leave everything to the spontaneous evolution of democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are lawmakers, and a lawmaker knows very well that you cannot leave everything to spontaneous evolution and that action is required."
"The countries where the best results have been achieved have been those governments which have amended their legislation."
"Let me quote you the example of Belgium, where it is not permitted to have three candidates of the same gender at the top of the European list."
"We want an equal number of candidates to be put forward now too, and I hope that the excellent recommendations made in this report will be adopted by governments."
"I expect the Commission to introduce an initiative, I expect initiatives to be introduced by the Council, so that equality in this Parliament, both and does not decrease but improve after accession."
"– Madam President, I share the concern expressed in Mrs Dybkjær’s excellent report regarding the under-representation of women in the European Parliament."
"It is unfortunately true that, as I look around now, there are noticeably few women here, particularly young women and women with families."
"As many have commented, in the light of statistics the situation seems even more alarming than before with regard to next year’s elections after enlargement."
"The proportion of women working in the national parliaments in the new Member States is not more than 30% at best and in more than half of the new Member States the proportion of women members of parliament hovers around the 10% mark."
"We must nevertheless remember that things could also be better in the current Member States, including my own country, Finland, although Finland can be considered one of the pioneers of equality between women and men."
"Why are women not being voted for, then, if more than half of the electorate are women?"
"The report identifies constituency parties and the selection mechanisms as the main reasons for the under-representation of women."
"Systems like the Finnish election procedure have guaranteed an equal representation of women and men."
"Here in the European Parliament almost half the Finnish delegation are women, so there is probably nothing wrong with the system."
"Instead of parties employing long and hierarchical systems of listing names, in the Finnish election system you vote for both the candidate and the party, and in practice the European Parliamentary elections have been to a large extent about electing an individual, with candidates given priority over parties, which stay very much in the background."
"In these conditions women have done well."
"Of course traditions and election culture also have an influential role to play."
"It nevertheless shows that women are voted for if they simply stand for election."
"Why, however, are young women in particular not interested in politics?"
"Why are women not encouraged to participate in the wielding of power to a greater extent?"
"These I think are questions that furthermore give cause for introspection."
"Why is the EU not interesting?"
"Women often see EU decision-making as too distant, abstract and highfalutin."
"Women are workaday heroines who like to stick to more concrete things."
"The work situation is often difficult, especially for women with families."
"I myself have come to realise, whilst expecting my first child, how hard it has been to combine motherhood with the career of a Member of Parliament."
"The EU’s rules on maternity leave directly oppress young women."
"Maternity leave is not really a familiar concept and, for example, in Parliament it is put on a par with absence through sickness."
"There is much room for improvement in this matter and the situation is reflected in the situation regarding employment in Europe as a whole."
"Women are not sufficiently encouraged to establish a career and start a family."
"The result is that many women deliberately put off having children."
"The message coming from the EU should not be either career or motherhood."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have now heard a great deal about a very old topic, one that we have already been discussing for years – always, in fact, on the same level – and I wonder what progress we have made."
"We take pride in the 30% of Members of this House who are women."
"If we had 50%, that would be parity."
"We content ourselves with only 30%, or tell ourselves that we have made progress because we have done very well in comparison with other countries."
"What this means is that, for a century, we have been progressing one millimetre at a time, and that what we have achieved is far from being secure."
"When I say that there is the danger of us sustaining more setbacks in this area, I am not just referring yet again to the new Member States, but also to the present ones, which have to make enormous efforts to get that sort of quota into this House."
"Yesterday, when the progress reports were presented, I heard not one word said about the under-representation of women."
"This is something else that we should take into account and incorporate into progress reports of this kind, enabling them to show what is lacking and where changes still have to be made where equal opportunities policy is concerned."
"If we say there is a lack of women candidates – something of which we are very often accused – then we have to give some thought to how women are supposed to combine career, family and politics when they are constantly, too, having their consciences pricked by questions like: how can you do this, that, and the other, as well?"
"This, I think, is where society has a part to play, and this is where there must be consequences for those Member States that fail to do what they have undertaken to do, namely create really equal opportunities."
"I find myself wondering what mechanisms there are and what are the consequences when they fail to do that."
"Madam President, firstly, I wish to thank you for this discussion, which really has illustrated the importance of the roles we all have to play."
"The Commission must accept its responsibility."
"I am aware that my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou is right now investigating the possibility of organising round-table discussions in the Member States and the candidate countries in order to discuss the issue of gender equality."
"I believe that these discussions must cover everything from nominations to the way in which subsidies and forms of support might be designed to enable us also to promote gender equality."
"In this area, there is, of course, also a very important role for the political parties, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations."
"They must work closely together on improving women’s representation."
"In the run-up to the European Parliament elections, it is quite clearly an important task to ensure that we maintain, and ideally increase, women’s representation."
"All the contributions have also made it clear that the new Member States too must be made aware of this, if we are to ensure that women are well represented right from the start."
"This is an issue that, for better or for worse, we shall have to live with for a long time to come, for we unfortunately live at a time when it is easier to split an atom than to overturn a prejudice."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the vote.(1)"
"Colleagues, I am delighted to inform you that the members of a delegation from the National People’s Congress of China have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"I extend a warm welcome to the Chinese delegation."
"They are here to attend the 20th EP-China Interparliamentary Meeting, and are led by Mr Wang Yingfan, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China."
"We look forward to a constructive dialogue, and we wish you all !"
"We now continue with the vote."
". Mr President, I have risen before on a vote on reports like these and no doubt I will be doing so again in the future."
"I would normally rise before each report, but if you are agreeable, I shall make this statement once and we could accept it for all three reports in the culture package."
"Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure states that we have to ensure that all reports are financially compatible."
"To make sure that we are in line with that Rule, I would propose that we add an oral amendment to all three reports which would read 'Considers that the financial statement as amended is compatible with the ceiling of headings 3 and 5 of the financial perspectives 2000-2006'."
". – Mr President, I strongly urge Parliament to adopt this amendment."
"Parliament’s legal department has stated that the earmarking of cultural organisations is clearly in contravention of the Financial Regulation."
"This proposal will make possible a gentle period of transition, which is to say earmarking can continue in any case until next year."
"Mr President, I wish to ask the House to really stand up for its rights."
"Earmarking is the only thing that we – by which I mean we rather than the Commission – can really do for culture."
"That concludes the vote."
". It is crucial to develop a true picture of immigration in the various countries making up the European Union and we should, therefore, support all initiatives, in particular in line with UN recommendations, that promote knowledge of this extremely important situation, which encompasses situations of unacceptable and inhuman humiliation and exploitation such as trafficking in human beings or the exploitation of a labour force that has no rights whatsoever."
"This situation needs to be better understood, so that we can better combat its underlying causes, which are social injustices and inequalities or wars and all those who exploit these, particularly those who take advantage of the countless people in an ‘illegal’ situation."
"We must understand the situation, but only in order to provide meaningful support for the victims of criminal networks – men, women and children who are simply fighting for an opportunity, for the right to have a better life."
"It is another matter to use this necessary effort to communitarise immigration policy, by proposing, as the report does, to establish ‘binding European legislation’."
"It is another matter altogether to get a picture of the reality to strengthen the implementation of today’s repressive immigration policies, in order to create a ‘Fortress Europe’. This is something that we reject."
". Standardising the statistics used by national authorities and organisations, which are currently all compiled on different bases, is one of this communication’s more interesting points, mainly because of the ease and frequency with which statistical data is manipulated by the bodies that publish them."
"There is a need to improve the collection and analysis of Community statistics in a common area as important as asylum and immigration."
"I regret, however, the excessively belated presentation by the Commission of its communication – to which the rapporteur also referred since the Action Programme corresponds to the period 2002-2004, whereas the communication dates from April 2003! ..."
"I also support the rapporteur when, in calling for transparency in the collection of statistics and for them to be intelligible and accessible to the public, he suggests that the New European Migration Network will be able to fulfil the role previously conferred on the European Migration Monitoring Centre."
"Bearing in mind that one of the consequences of the Action Plan will be a substantial increase in the production of statistics, we cannot exclude the possibility, as the rapporteur reminds us, that future budgetary rules might have to be revised."
"I therefore supported the positions advocated in the report and voted in favour of it."
"We would defend subsidiarity and assert that the EU institutions should not interfere with the Member States’ electoral systems or the political parties’ systems for establishing their electoral lists."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the own-initiative report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on ‘Election 2004: How to ensure balanced representation of women and men’."
"It is very good to want to abolish discrimination in election candidacies, as proposed by the Dybkjær report, but it is still better not to add to the discrimination."
"The French law of 11 April 2003, which regionalises the method of balloting for the European elections, clearly puts the small to medium-sized parties at a disadvantage."
"In these conditions, it may be maintained that this law infringes the decision of the Council of European Ministers of 25 June 2002 according to which, when – as is the case in France – a European ballot taking place in a single national constituency is regionalised, the reform must take place ‘without affecting the essentially proportional nature of the voting system’."
"Strangest of all, the European decision of 2002 has, in accordance with Article 190(4) of the Treaty, been adopted by France by means of a law enacted only on 16 October 2003."
"In other words, the proper procedure is now apparently to adapt the French law of April 2003 to the European decision approved in October."
"Unfortunately, it has also to be said that no provision has been made for removing such a contradiction between national and Community law."
". This initiative, which is intended to promote a more balanced representation of women and men in the composition of the EP following the 2004 elections, is to be welcomed, although it has limitations."
"Increasing the participation of women in social and political life is a concern and an objective that we support, but simply calling for more women to participate in political life is not enough."
"As we know, progress in the field of women’s rights and in genuine equal opportunities is only achieved when these rights have solid foundations and as the outcome of social advances that have been won in battles by workers and women for their rights and not merely through elitist, artificial and administrative measures."
"I must underline the need, however, for greater participation by women in the social and political life of every country and in the EP."
"The problem is that the current neoliberal capitalist offensive to dismantle countless social achievements affects, today as in the past, but even more harshly, working women. Working women are the main victims, in particular as regards exercising their rights, including the right to have a job and to be elected to participate in social and political life."
"Lastly, I simply wish to recall that, in the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, on the lists of the (Unitary Democratic Coalition), of which the Portuguese Communist Party is a member, 11 of the 25 candidates were women, as was the candidate heading the list."
"I had tabled a host of amendments to the draft report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and a number of them have been adopted."
"Their purpose was to qualify certain proposals and requests made to the political parties and national governments, not in order to weaken such proposals and requests but in order to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the independence of parties and governments and to prevent interference of doubtful quality which would, moreover, be in danger of being counter-productive."
"In my opinion, asking for quotas to be introduced by means of legislation or insisting on legislating on the principle of parity democracy is going too far."
"I therefore consider that, in this area, there must be no head-on clash with countries and parties that – often, incidentally, out of respect for women – do not want quotas for women, such quotas implying that women are apparently incapable of carving out a place in the parties and in the eyes of the electorate."
"That place may also be won through the endurance, courage, aptitude and quality that should also be shown by the men who wish to take their places here."
"I was keen to make these points in order to prevent this report, for which I voted, from being counter-productive in terms of its objective, which I share."
". It is no longer the case that certain family duties and certain careers are reserved for men or women."
"Policy is no longer determined by what men think is important."
"Women are no longer expected to leave the most important decisions to men."
"This development contributes to greater equality between people."
"Unfortunately, this is not happening simultaneously throughout Europe."
"We can see from the number of women elected to national parliaments that the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands are in the lead, that the southern European and English-speaking countries are trailing way behind, and that the role of women in the East has even been forced into a decline."
"There is a justifiable fear that after the enlargement of the EU, the number of women in the next European Parliament will be lower than it is at present."
"We will only be able to bring about change in this area through the greater participation of women in areas where there are conflicts of opinions and interests, and through their participation in the organisations involved."
"We must eliminate the obstacles to this."
"Electoral legislation may contribute by abolishing systems based on districts, but not by legislating on the composition of candidate lists."
"My party, the Socialist Party of the Netherlands, has lists for the Upper and Lower Houses which comprise 50% women in electable seats, but we do not do this through coercion but through conviction."
"The feminisation of politics is achieved from the bottom up and by pursuing the struggle outside Parliament."
"Voting against this report should not, of course, be construed as any show of hostility towards the representation of women in politics."
"Apart from the fact that the general philosophy of the report – namely, positive discrimination – is contrary to the constitutional traditions of certain Member States and, in particular, to the republican universalism on which French law is based, rejection of this document is based solely upon respect for the distribution of competences between the EU and the Member States."
"In the event, and in the absence of a uniform electoral procedure, the European Union has no competence at all to intervene, as this report invites it to do, in defining the rules governing the organisation of the European elections."
"As a result, the European Parliament cannot legitimately ask the national political parties ‘to introduce quota systems, such as [what is known as] the zipper system’, whereby men and women appear alternately on the lists, ‘and/or [to] take measures so as to promote a balance in participation’ or to ask the Commission to distribute information on the mysterious concept of ‘parity democracy’ or to urge the funding of ‘awareness raising campaigns’ on the subject."
". I voted against this report because I disagree with the measures the rapporteur recommends to ensure a balanced representation between men and women."
"I totally reject this illegitimate attempt to interfere in the internal political organisation of the Member States and the ongoing confusion between equality and egalitarianism."
"Adopting legislative measures for positive discrimination that facilitate women’s access to political posts must always be considered very carefully, so as not to distort the genuine rules of democracy and of free choice and also not to offend and discriminate against women who, of their own free will and on their own merits, have risen to the highest positions without any artificial mechanisms to promote them."
"The approach adopted by the rapporteur belongs to the radical feminist clique, which appears to have hijacked the committee in which this report originated. This approach does not match the vision and the concerns of most European women who, on a daily basis, prove their worth without any complexes about their standing and without giving in to or wanting to impose a sexist approach."
"I must also emphasise, to add a little humour, both the veiled threat of civil disobedience that the rapporteur slipped in, on the grounds of a supposed breakdown in the ‘legitimacy of decision-making’ and the arrogance of ‘rewriting’ the ‘social contract’ by decree."
". In this report, the Commission is being asked to distribute information on the concept of parity democracy."
"The Commission must not be allowed to respond to this call."
"Parity democracy hinders the complete emancipation of women as citizens."
"Parity democracy aims as a last resort to introduce electoral laws that specify that half the seats in elected bodies should be reserved for women and half for men."
"This boils down to ‘sexual apartheid’ and implies a contravention of the free and individual right to elect and be elected."
"Parity democracy is based on the philosophy of differentiation and assumes that there are ‘essential’ differences between men and women."
"It is not the task of the Commission to implement these one-sided, dangerous concepts."
"I share the opinion of the French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter that the state must not be allowed to reduce people to their sex."
"The Commission must provide objective information on the effect of different legislative and other instruments."
"Interestingly, the best results have in the past been achieved in countries in which political parties have taken the initiative themselves by putting more women on their candidate lists and where the dogma of (legally enforced) parity democracy has virtually no support."
". As a liberal, I am always in favour of dialogue in Parliament."
"That is what democracy is all about."
"And as rapporteur, I have always tried to be an honest, objective intermediary and maintain dialogue between the various European standpoints in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and between the various organisations."
"Right from the beginning I could see that there would be a problem."
"I have tried to defend a compromise in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"One regulation with two chapters."
"I am sorry that this has ultimately turned out not to be the official point of view of Parliament, but I will remain at your disposal."
"I have abstained from the because I want to be in a position to maintain the dialogue between all the institutional players involved in this issue, which is so very important for Asia and Latin America."
"We have only one aim: to accept a definitive regulation in the near future with consensus between the various standpoints."
"Mr President, in view of the words of the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, who did not manage to have her point of view endorsed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, nor in plenary, she has recognised that she cannot share the conclusions or the result of the vote."
"I believe, Mr President, that the most honest and reasonable thing for Mrs Sanders-ten Holte to do would be to relinquish her responsibilities, since she cannot accept the opinion of plenary and since she has not been able to win the support of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"We have voted against the Sanders-Ten Holte report on would-be ‘Community cooperation with Asian and Latin American countries’, except in the case of a few amendments concerning humanitarian aid in the hope that this will not disappear into the hands of corrupt local political leaders."
"In our view, the amount of this aid is derisory."
"It is enough to note – and this is something we denounce – that a pretended increase in aid to Latin America entails a corresponding decrease in aid to Asia."
"Spread as thinly as this, such aid is quite incapable of offsetting the drastic consequences of the plundering that has always been engaged in, in these regions and in others, by large companies or European and North American financial establishments."
"By seizing raw materials at low prices, by carving out areas of influence for themselves or, again, by imposing their services at high prices, the rapacity of large European companies, wedded to that of their local friends, is the very source of the impoverishment of the populations of these continents."
"In recent years, this has even led to the collapse of several national economies on these two continents."
"That is because, far from eradicating poverty, all these economic trends in the European Union serve, instead, only to increase it."
". British Labour MEPs had to vote against the amended report due to serious concerns about duplicating and complicating legislation, a reduction in resources for Asia, and benchmarking."
"The Parliament has an agreed position in favour of simpler rules and procedures, and it makes no sense for a technical, legal regulation to do the work of Country Strategy Papers and National Indicative Programmes."
"Creating two separate regulations will undermine the objective to streamline and clarify development policy programmes and, as the world's poorest region, transferring funds from Asia to Latin America cannot be justified."
"We could not support Amendments 1 and 2 to split the Regulation; 93 and 94 to reduce funding for Asia and increase funding for Latin America; 3, 18, 56 and 97 on benchmarks and a Bi-Regional Solidarity Fund for Latin America (creating a cumbersome and wasteful extra layer of bureaucracy); or 18, 28, 29, 56, 57, 95, 96, and 99 which create a rigid framework for programmes intended for poverty reduction."
"It remains to be seen what the implication of today's vote will be in the Commission and Council."
"The result could be that we have not served the interests of either Asia or Latin America."
". The purpose of EU aid is to fight poverty."
"The greatest proportion of the world’s poor live in Asia."
"It would therefore be a mistake to transfer EU funds from Asia to Latin America."
"Furthermore, we believe that, as proposed by the Commission too, a single regulation for Asia and Latin America with a separate chapter for each of the two regions would be a sound solution."
"This would help prevent bureaucratic red tape and duplication of effort."
"Unfortunately, Parliament today voted in favour of two regulations, which will lead to a long drawn-out process involving the Council."
"For these reasons, we have voted against Amendments 1 and 2, to the effect that the regulation should be split into two regulations; Amendments 18, 56 and 97 concerning the creation of a Solidarity Fund for Latin America; and Amendments 93 and 94 about transferring financial resources from Asia to Latin America."
". We agree in principle with the idea of providing more support for young people, but this Commission proposal, showing a clearly federalist attitude, which is unacceptable, gives more or less sole priority to large organisations, many of them supranational, such as the European Youth Forum (EYF) and NGOs in the field of youth."
"This is happening at a time when the involvement of young people is clearly geared towards youth movements on a national and local basis, which is totally ignored in the aid being granted."
"The so-called EYF is a body that is nothing but a sounding board for the EU: it is far-removed from the European youth movement and completely ignored by the millions of young people throughout Europe."
"The proposal that has been tabled clearly demonstrates the EU’s desire to confer legitimacy on its own youth policies, in which funding is only given to ‘youth superstructures’ in an artificial attempt to promote the non-existent participation of young people in EU policies and to contribute to stifling the critical spirit of young people and of the youth movement."
"Consequently, even though the report makes some positive proposals, they are clearly inadequate given the serious problems facing young people today."
". I fully share the rapporteur’s surprise at the fact that the European Commission only adopted this proposal at the end of May, thereby forcing the awarding of the first parts of the grants to the beneficiary organisations to be postponed."
"The budgetary allocation proposed for youth organisations, as the rapporteur also emphasises, must be increased, particularly as a result of enlargement."
"The demographic structure of developing countries and the need to stimulate the interest of their young people in European issues requires just such action."
"Also to be praised is the suggestion to the Commission to ensure that the funding programmes which have been announced and embarked on are properly implemented and, specifically, to reduce the number of applications which are rejected for purely technical or formal reasons."
"I supported this report and consequently voted in favour of it."
". The Commission White Paper advocates the principle of public participation in defining and implementing policy, which is to be welcomed."
"Nevertheless, the EU’s broad policy guidelines are being implemented without and sometimes in opposition to the will of the people, particularly of young people."
"Although the financial assistance that is proposed for education and training bodies proves that there is a desire to contribute to developing our education systems, it has an elitist vision, which is far removed from the problems facing young people today and does not match the needs of each Member State’s educational systems."
"The attempts to contribute financially to actions that will help to improve education and training conditions are, however, to be welcomed, especially if they take account of the seriousness of early school leaving in some countries, such as Portugal, ongoing illiteracy, the need to end child labour and to promote education and training."
"Also to be welcomed are the proposals for a debate on these issues and for the programme to be monitored by the Member States."
"Mr President, I wanted to speak briefly on the explanations of vote on the Iivari report in order to thank Mrs Iivari and to declare that it was with much conviction that I voted in favour of this report, which has now clarified a number of points and created the conditions for the necessary means to be used, especially where the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages and Mercator are concerned; whilst, of course, the other issues in this report are close to my heart, this one is particularly so."
"I believe that this House has, recently, been consistent about this, and that it is taking the lead, and I hope that the Commission, just as it has attempted to clarify these matters, will continue to do so by way of the languages action plan and will demonstrate in practice the further commitment that Parliament has demanded."
". This proposal is intended to establish a multiannual programme (2004-2008) for awarding grants to promote cultural organisations, in order to establish a legal base for existing grants, which were previously included in the Commission’s administrative expenditure."
"Now, however, following changes to the Financial Regulation and rulings of the Court of Justice a legal base is required for these grants."
"This line must be approved so as to ensure that existing cultural organisations receive Community funding, in particular the Cistercian Route line."
"It is a pity that the budget has fixed a total of only EUR 30 million for the entire period. Lastly, I welcome the rejection of the proposal for an amendment attempting, unacceptably, to give Nazism and fascism equal standing."
". As is to some extent implicit in the Oostlander report on the ‘Action Plan for the collection and analysis of Community Statistics in the field of migration’ – on which we have also voted in this plenary session – what is here expressed quite explicitly is an initiative to create an instrument intended to achieve the communitarisation of a repressive migration policy, in line with the idea of ‘Fortress Europe’."
"Just look, for example, at the political interpretation made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy: ‘The creation of the immigration liaison officers’ network can be considered as a step in the direction towards the establishment of a common external service of the EU ...’"
"As a matter of fact, the stated aim for the activities of ‘immigration liaison officers’ is, as the rapporteur points out, to combat illegal immigration – as the individuals responsible for implementing this policy in the countries in which this immigration originates, including the task of compiling ten categories of information that these officers will have to gather."
"The rapporteur states that, as regards the aim of ‘contributing to the management of legal immigration’, ‘the form which this management might take is never spelled out elsewhere in the Regulation’."
"Hence our vote against the report."
". I support the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers in order gradually to implement the coordinated and integrated management of our external borders."
"As the Commission stated, close links already exist between immigration liaison officers, and the aim now is to ensure that this informal cooperation is placed within a framework that would strengthen it and increase its effectiveness."
"In this area, as in others, I believe it would be positive and useful to adopt instruments for coordination, with the aim of addressing issues that affect some or all of the Member States."
"This applies specifically to the enhanced – and by this I mean more precise and more efficient – exchange of information between liaison officers, to a better definition of the type of information exchanged, to the nature of the channels of communication used for the purpose and to the time limits to be observed when a request for information is received."
"The proper training of such agents takes on particular importance, as the rapporteur points out, primarily because, according to the survey conducted by the Commission amongst liaison officers, this is a for the creation of a genuine network."
"I have therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, I would like to talk about the way in which a temporary committee has finally been approved to investigate the effects and consequences of the unfortunate accident off the Galician coasts."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has made great efforts to prevent this committee from investigating everything that happened in the days preceding and during the unfortunate incident."
"We finally have the committee and I hope it can shed light on all of this."
"I would like to insist, however, on something: despite all the measures this Parliament has wished to implement in the European Union to prevent any similar accident, if today we had a case such as the we would run the same risk; because the was not entering or leaving any of the European Union’s ports: it was simply passing through our Community waters, and we have not yet got to grips with this, that is to say, we have not taken any decision to control ‘floating dustbins’ – such as the – which sail through our waters on a daily basis, and this is a challenge which we still have before us and which we must deal with if we want to prevent unfortunate accidents such as the in the future."
"Setting up a temporary European Parliament committee on improving safety at sea is the commitment that will enable us to overcome the hostility of our colleagues on the right to any initiative that would help to determine the causes of the major disaster that resulted from the shipwreck of the and to determine who was responsible. I refer specifically to the possibility of setting up a committee of inquiry, as we proposed."
"The creation of this temporary committee, which we welcome, is therefore the outcome of a long and persistent process of negotiation."
"We want the results of its work to make a real contribution to improving safety at sea, achieving the aims for which it was created, which are:"
"- to study maritime disasters, in particular those of the and ;"
"- to analyse their social and economic consequences, with regard in particular to fisheries, industry and tourism, as well as the environment and health;"
"- to assess current international safety standards and the way in which these are applied;"
"- to help to ensure implementation of the recommendations that have already been adopted by the EP and to complement them if necessary."
"In the EP’s recommendations that must be implemented, I would highlight, amongst others, withdrawing single-hulled petrol tankers, increasing resources for inspections, appropriate training for seamen, increasing resources for emergency pollution control measures and setting up safe havens, equipped with emergency apparatus."
"Basically, the June Movement believes that suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings should enjoy the greatest possible legal certainty."
"The report deals, however, with a proposal from the Commission intended as a further step in the slow development of a European legal area."
"The June Movement is naturally unable to support such an initiative."
"The June Movement has therefore voted in favour of all the points and amendments aimed at introducing minimum standards for suspects’ and defendants’ rights, but has voted against the report as a whole."
". This recommendation should be seen in the context of the debate about the Green Paper on procedural safeguards, in particular of a proposal for a framework decision on common minimum standards governing procedural law, in which the rapporteur highlights various rights that need to be safeguarded and advocates including a non-regression clause for standards already established in each country’s legislation – bringing these into line with the highest levels."
"It is regrettable and significant, however, that Parliament has not adopted the proposals for amendment tabled by my group insisting on the ‘entry into force of the framework decision on procedural safeguards being a precondition for the entry into force of the European arrest warrant and for the full implementation of the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters in the European Union’."
"As some of my fellow Members have stated, it is hard to understand how, by not making the framework decision on procedural safeguards a precondition for the entry into force of the ‘European arrest warrant’ the rights to a defence will be safeguarded in this context."
"I would recall that we fully rejected the ‘European arrest warrant’, which is about to enter into force."
". I have abstained because Amendments 1 and 2 have been refused."
"We must bear in mind that the new reform of the Spanish Penal Code, proposed by the PP and supported by the PSOE, opens up the possibility of holding incommunicado for 13 days."
"Lawyers will not have enough time to prepare the cases, and for Basque political prisoners, an impediment will still remain to their being assisted from the time they are arrested, by lawyers they can trust."
". Setting common standards for all Member States on respecting and protecting the individual rights of suspects, defendantsor those convicted in criminal proceedings, as the Commission proposed in its Green Paper, would be useful."
"The laws must be understood and justice must be predictable and, as we know, an arbitrary approach will always result in unpredictable justice."
"Furthermore, ignorance of the law is no excuse for not obeying it and does not benefit wrongdoers, who must know that criminal proceedings await them."
"This takes on even greater importance when the individual in question is a foreign citizen."
"I therefore agree with adopting common basic standards for procedural safeguards, which will increase the confidence both of the public in the judicial authorities and of the various agents of each Member State in other States’ judicial systems."
"What has really turned me against this report – in its final wording – is that it promotes standards that far exceed the ‘minimum’, for example, the register of translators, ‘compensation’ in the event of insolvency or the presence of a psychiatrist."
"In other words, I disagree with the recommendation for an extremely lengthy list of changes, which would ultimately lead to better safeguards for foreign citizens than for nationals."
"Unfortunately, therefore, I could only vote against the report."
". The opportunities provided by the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the contribution they make to changes in society are self-evident."
"The aim of the information society is also effectively to provide information that is immediate and at prices that are feasible for all citizens."
"Imbalances remain between men and women in the field of training and employment in the new ICT and I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"- The European Commission and the Member States must draw up policies that will help to increase the participation of women in ICT."
"- ICT must be integrated into education from the most elementary levels to higher education and vocational training."
"- The Structural Funds must be used to provide courses for specific training in this field that will enable women to enter or re-enter the labour market."
"These measures must also be implemented in the candidate countries and in the developing countries in order to increase women’s opportunities in the labour market, and to ensure that information is exchanged in various areas."
". The decision to draw up an own-initiative report on promoting women’s participation in what is known as the ‘new information society’ was a good one."
"I welcome in particular:"
"- its condemnation of the policy for the development of new ICT, which has largely been focused on economic aspects, and in which control is left mainly to the private sector, without any assessment of the social impact or proper incentives policies for equal rights of women and men. As the report states, this approach leads to the inappropriate perception of open participation to all."
"- its warning about the growing danger of social exclusion caused by the inability to use ICTs – so-called digital illiteracy – which mainly affects women."
"- the need to pay particular attention to women, particularly older women, unemployed and low-income women, migrant women, women belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities."
"I do not agree, however, with the uncritical tone the report adopts towards the neoliberal policies advocated in the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and in the ‘guidelines for employment’, consequently sweeping under the carpet the main causes of inequality and social injustice, of which women are the main victims."
". I have voted in favour of this report for the sole reason that I believe the European Union must focus its policies on promoting everyone’s access to the rights that legitimately pertain to them, in particular those relating to knowledge."
"In this context, women – and also men, incidentally – must not suffer discrimination."
"I regret the fact, however, that the text is unable to resist the temptation to indulge in feminist rhetoric and populism, in the guise of supposedly neutral language."
"Because it is so keen to serve a radical agenda of ideas and language, it does not even realise how totally ridiculous it ends up being as a result of its pretentious commonplaces and plain stupidity."
"Take the rapporteur’s irony, for example – when she explicitly states her desire to combat stereotypes – but then suggests overcoming the social exclusion of ‘girls and women – immigrants, women with disabilities, the poor, single mothers and women farmers’, women belonging to ethnic minorities and the elderly, by providing role-models of ‘successful, independent and satisfied women’ in the field of Information and Communication Technologies."
"Can anyone take this seriously?"
"I also share the concern the report expresses at linguistic diversity on the Internet, and consider it to be a universal factor for social exclusion, although it needs to be said in this context that the situation is exactly the same for men as for women."
"Better coordination of the Member States’ taxes on cars may appear necessary, but it must not be the opportunity to put a European tax system in place."
"Taxation of passenger cars cannot be divorced from a general tax system involving VAT, excise duties and income tax or corporation tax. It constitutes, moreover, an instrument of budget revenue and, as such, comes under the sovereignty of the Member States."
"Nor am I happy with the environmental approach chosen by the European Commission."
"Taxing passenger cars at European level, as proposed, seems inappropriate to me because, as a result of persistent lobbying, many sectors that cause a greater amount of pollution are not affected and because the structure of the automobile market is specific to each Member State."
"There are, for example, small countries and large countries, flat countries and mountainous countries, countries with little in the way of road infrastructure and countries with long traditions of public transport. These are differences specific to each Member State, and they cannot be levelled out all at once through the harmonised taxation of passenger cars."
". Mr President, it is important to eliminate the final obstacles to achieving the completely free movement of people, goods and services."
"I have therefore no hesitation in agreeing with the proposal of the European Parliament to call on the Commission to come up with a concrete proposal for abolishing registration taxes."
"The differences in the taxation of passenger cars in the EU are resulting in great differences in car prices, fragmentation of the passenger car market, double taxation and a whole heap of red tape."
"People in the EU pay too much for their cars and are prevented from taking their cars with them when they move to a different country."
"With this proposal, the EU has an opportunity to fundamentally improve the free movement of people."
"A chance we cannot afford to miss!"
". I supported Mrs Honeyball’s report because I believe it demonstrates the European Parliament’s support for the Commission so that this institution can open up a real debate in the Council on the crucial harmonisation of tax in the automobile sector."
"This proactive attitude is what the vast majority of European citizens want because they associate the excessive red tape and high administrative costs, and also the fragmentation of the car market, with the difficulties in consolidating the internal market."
"I wish to add that the crucial environmental dimension, which is covered adequately in the reports, requires a new attitude to the taxation of cars."
"The Honeyball report tackles the differences in taxation of passenger cars between one European Union country and another, together with the resulting administrative and financial problems when people move to other countries."
"It advocates increasing the Annual Circulation Tax rather than the Registration Tax and, above all, systematising the fight against pollution by applying principles of harmonised taxation."
"We do not feel at home with this method."
"Of course, we are disgusted by the absurd and socially unjust development of urban organisation and of the transport system and by its effects upon the environment."
"It is, however, particularly hypocritical to cause wage earners who purchase cars, including the most ordinary ones, to bear the penalties for pollution."
"Changing the transport system so that it is more efficient and less polluting means, in the first place, hugely extending public transport, drastically reducing the proportion of road transport by lorry in favour of less polluting and less dangerous forms of transport, and imposing stricter anti-pollution standards upon manufacturers."
"The change to the transport system should be funded from profits and from direct taxes that increase progressively on the basis of income."
"Because we reject the dissipation of responsibilities proposed by this report, we abstained from voting on the latter."
"."
"Although this report contains many positive ideas, I do have some difficulties with the excessively lengthy passages on environmental taxes."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle is generally acknowledged, and has even been incorporated into the EC Treaty, but the introduction of an environmental tax on fuel is highly controversial and should be dealt with at national level, as closely as possible to the public, so that there can be proper public debate."
"I can only advise against introducing it through the European bodies."
"In many Member States, my own included, people have for the last few years heard about nothing other than tax increases planned or decided on by the EU."
"Let me only remind you of the debates on the excise duty on alcoholic beverages, the plans to impose VAT on postal services, the proposed abolition of the lower VAT rates, the introduction – as part of the energy package – of minimal taxation on fuel, and so on. If introduced, the environmental tax that is being called for would have a catastrophic effect on the EU’s image, especially at a time when various Member States have announced referendums on the adoption of the European Constitution."
"To introduce tax increases would be to play right into the hands of anti-EU populists and would be counter-productive in terms of our efforts to stimulate economic growth."
". As the rapporteur quite rightly points out, as long ago as 1998, the European Parliament declared itself in favour of strengthening the internal market in this field and fought to end double taxation – specifically through the registration tax (RT) – in support of the European Commission proposal."
"The Council has still not delivered an opinion."
"The Council has not delivered an opinion despite the fact that most citizens agree on the need to establish more equitable conditions for car buying within the European Union."
"Look at Portugal, for example, where one tax – the Car Tax, – makes the final selling price much higher than in other countries in the European Union."
"The proposed links between levels of taxation and CO2 emissions are to be praised, as is the much-desired closer harmonisation of market conditions and the observation the report makes that competition between Member States in the field of taxation is reasonable and advantageous for strong economic development in the EU."
"Furthermore, I must recall that this subject falls, objectively – see Article 95(2) TEC – outside the EU’s sphere of action."
"Since these ideas go considerably further than being simply recommendations, I decided to vote against the report."
"That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)"
"I would like to get my thoughts on the discussion between Mr Salafranca and the rapporteur off my chest."
"I think that the rapporteur has behaved courageously, and that it is a pity that it is so difficult to bring about change in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to express my astonishment at the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, because although it is true that everybody exercises their votes as they can, as they wish or as they see fit, this report for which she has been rapporteur has been the subject of much debate in our Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the vote today has been very clear; therefore, I believe her proposal that we must seek a solution to be inappropriate."
"I believe that the solution has been expressed by this Parliament, through very clear votes, in favour of there being two separate regulations to eradicate poverty in Asia and in Latin America."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 6 November 2003."
"Colleagues, as you will be aware, on Saturday 15 November 2003, 15 people died and 28 were injured after the collapse of a gangway on the new cruise ship , in the French shipyard of Saint-Nazaire."
"On behalf of the European Parliament and in my own name, I express my most profound sympathy and solidarity with the families of the victims of this terrible and tragic accident."
"It is also my sad duty today to express on behalf of this House our condemnation and grief at the two car bomb attacks on synagogues in Istanbul also on Saturday, which killed at least 23 innocent civilians and wounded hundreds more."
"We send our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Turkish Government."
"We also commend the swift and vigorous action of the Turkish Government in seeking to apprehend those behind an indiscriminate, senseless and criminal anti-Semitic attack, one that struck at the place of traditional peaceful coexistence between different religions."
"Intolerance and anti-Semitism in all their manifestations are abhorrent to the values that we represent."
"I should also like to inform the House that the President would like, at the opening of tomorrow's sitting, to pay a personal tribute to the Italians who died in Iraq."
"For the moment, I ask you to observe one minute's silence for the victims of the accident and the attack I have just mentioned.(1)"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 13 November 2003 has been distributed."
"The following changes have been proposed:"
"I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group for a separate debate on its Oral Question on Eurostat to be taken immediately after the Commission statement on the legislative and work programme for 2004."
"Mr President, both my Group and I appreciate that when we are seeking parliamentary time it is advisable to be brief."
"That being so, we recognise the Conference of Presidents' decision last week to refuse to have a separate debate."
"We would therefore like to propose that this oral question be attached to the overall debate on the legislative and work programme for 2004, because over the weekend we heard that President Prodi will be raising the question of OLAF during that debate and we have a number of questions we would like to ask in that context, which are included in the substance of this oral question."
"That is a reasonable way for the House to proceed."
"It is what happens in normal practice."
"We will not be asking for a separate debate, but we have questions we wish to raise when Mr Prodi is with us on Tuesday."
"Mr President, I should like to speak against the proposal, but I shall do so in a special way."
"I want to say to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that it is puzzling, their having become interested in this proposal."
"When we had the opportunity to tidy matters up, it was you who lifted the carpet and swept the dirt under it, so I think you are playing to the gallery in this case."
"I therefore think we must say no."
"The members of the PPE-DE Group are deeply untrustworthy in this matter."
"(1)"
"Mr President, we members of the Communist Party of Greece also observed a minute's silence for the Italian soldiers and policemen killed in Iraq recently and for the victims of the bombings in Istanbul."
"We deeply regret the deaths of so many young people and we send our condolences to their families."
"We regret even more that these young people lost their lives serving an occupation – I refer to Iraq – as the result of the unprovoked, illegal, barbaric invasion by the American and English imperialists, with thousands of victims and massive destruction."
"Fortunately, the just resistance of the repressed Iraqi people is developing against this occupation."
"The Italian Government alone, which has hastened to help the invaders by taking part in the occupation, is solely responsible for the unjust and inglorious loss of the Italian soldiers and policemen and it must answer to the innocent victims' families."
"At the same time, we cannot fail to observe that the European Parliament has not demonstrated the same sensitivity to the thousands of Iraqis who have died as victims of this barbaric invasion or to the victims of the imperialist interventions in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan or to the victims of Sharon's barbarity in Palestine."
"We consider that the only real way of honouring the dead is to immediately withdraw the occupying forces from Iraq and to prevent any other military intervention in the internal affairs of states in order to stop further bloodshed and this crime against humanity."
"Mr President, I would like you to ask Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, to raise with the Commission the situation regarding Mrs Radia Nasrawi, who has just completed five weeks on hunger strike in protest at the intolerable human rights situation in Tunisia."
"She is one of the leading human rights activists in that country. Her life has been made unbearable by the activities of the Tunisian authorities, who oppose her human rights work."
"This situation is one which has been repeated many times over in relation to other human rights activists."
"I would particularly like the Commission to ensure that the European Union representative in Tunisia makes direct contact with the Tunisian authorities in writing, insisting that the human rights of Mrs Radia Nasrawi and others in Tunisia be respected."
"The only European Union embassies to have taken a stand on this issue are those of the Netherlands and Finland."
"It is quite disgraceful that the European Union itself has not made its views known on this matter at this critical juncture for Mrs Radia Nasrawi."
"Mr President, we have all been able to witness the fact that about a week ago, the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, sounded the starting shot for the Italian election campaign."
"Mr Prodi has issued a political manifesto, in which he has outlined the strategy and necessities that the Left needs to embrace in order to secure an election victory in Italy."
"We take the view that the President of the Commission must maintain a certain political neutrality, that he must be above party-political wrangling."
"It is now clear that he no longer does that."
"The Eurostat scandal would have been a good opportunity for Mr Prodi to take his political responsibility and to step aside."
"The publication of this political manifesto is going too far."
"He should shoulder his responsibility: either remain President of the European Commission and concentrate fully on that task, or else conduct a political campaign in Italy."
"Mr President, drugs are, of course, a big problem in Thailand, and it is entirely understandable that the Thai Government, being also under pressure from the international community and from the United States, should wage war on drug smuggling."
"This war on drugs, however, also has a flip side."
"During my visit to Dutch prisoners there last week, including Machiel Kuyt, I saw the abject conditions under which she, along with other Europeans, is being held, and how, consequently, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Thailand has been party since 1997, is being violated."
"Extremely long detentions due to a shortage of judges and overfull prisons illustrate this point."
"Two things need to happen in order for this situation to change."
"First of all, in the framework of the country strategy paper on Thailand dating back to May 2002, the European Union should turn its attention to legal aid, so that the seriously overtaxed legal system is relieved and the rights of the suspects are better respected."
"Secondly, the Union should urge its Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with Thailand, which enables the transfer of prisoners."
"These agreements already exist with a number of countries, such as Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, and certainly also with my own country, the Netherlands; other countries should also conclude them, and Thailand is very much in favour of them doing so."
"Mr President, over the past few weeks, I have received various complaints from Spanish and Dutch meat transporters who apparently have been threatened by Breton farmers and attacked when delivering their products."
"Supermarkets too are being threatened if they want to buy meat from Spain and the Netherlands, and the French Government is refusing to take action."
"Although it is the insurers that compensate the direct damage, the damage incurred in the long term, because the meat is no longer bought for fear of threats from a few gangs of thuggish Breton farmers, is a thorn in my side."
"It is also in contravention of the internal market and the free movement of goods."
"I therefore ask you to urge the Commission and the French Government to put a stop to this as soon as possible, because if it is not, French wine and champagne may well similarly be rejected in other European countries."
"This would not benefit the internal market and would even spoil our Christmas to some extent."
"– Mr President, I would like to return, albeit briefly, to the massacres which have scourged Europe, and not just Europe, in the past week."
"I feel it is right that we should express our fierce condemnation of terrorism and specifically of these incidents."
"I would like to remember, in particular, the 19 Italian victims of the massacres in Nasiriya."
"It is important that the President of Parliament expresses our sympathy for the victims and our condolences to their families tomorrow, but I feel that it is also appropriate to thank all the armed forces of all the European countries who are currently on peace missions throughout the world."
"Lastly, I hope that Parliament will make a firm commitment to implementing increasingly effective measures to combat terrorism, for the message which must be sent out by the European Parliament is that none of the European peoples are going to let themselves be intimidated by these cowardly attacks."
"Mr President, Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George Bush are both in Europe this week: Colin Powell to meet with EU Foreign Ministers and President Bush on a state visit to Britain."
"I hope that the Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister Blair will impress on their guests the need for transatlantic understanding to flow both ways."
"Europeans are rightly alarmed at the unilateralist policies of the US administration, its readiness to contemplate pre-emptive strikes and its refusal to internationalise the occupation of Iraq."
"Europeans are deeply unhappy at the prospect of military commissions imposing the death penalty or unlimited detention for the Guantanamo Bay detainees, and at the way the US is trying to sabotage the International Criminal Court."
"These are some of the reasons for the demonstrations against President Bush."
"They must be peaceful protests, and as such I personally intend to join them."
"I have just returned from Washington as an ad hoc member of the US delegation."
"Our hosts were gracious and hospitable, we had useful discussions and we have a huge amount in common."
"However, as well as us understanding their position, the Americans need to understand our objections, and our Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister must convey these objections this week."
"Mr President, you have already quite properly expressed the sympathy of this House to the Turkish Government and to the families of those killed and injured in the callous and indiscriminate terrorist attacks that took place in Istanbul on Saturday."
"These attacks on innocent civilians remind us all of the grave security threat that terrorism poses."
"We should remember that the Neve Shalom Synagogue was the subject of a horrific attack 17 years ago."
"The democracies must work closely together to combat terrorism in whatever form it takes and whatever excuses are used by the perpetrators."
"We must not allow any difference in other areas of policy to undermine our unambiguous solidarity."
"With reference to the previous speaker's remarks, we should remember that the United States is carrying enormous burdens on behalf of all of us and we should stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in these difficult times."
"Mr President, I hope I will be forgiven for moving from matters of life and death to more commercial matters."
"This House, in its role as legislator, is deeply concerned about intellectual property and the need to protect holders' rights in the interests of consumers and of fair play."
"It is all the more alarming if the holders of the rights themselves abuse the rights to the disadvantage of consumers."
"I regret to say that this is what is being done now in Scotland by Diageo, the multinational spirit drinks producer, which produces Cardhu whisky."
"The supply of Cardhu single malt has run low."
"However, now Diageo is producing something called Cardhu pure malt whisky."
"Not all Members of this House may be aware of it, but there is a very big difference between pure malt whisky – which is a blend of various malts – and single malt, which comes from a single malt distillery."
"It is vital to the health of this Scottish and European industry that consumer trust is maintained and that sharp practice by producers is eliminated as quickly as possible."
"This industry has often sought and obtained the support of the European authorities."
"We should insist that they themselves play the game."
"Mr President, please write to the chief executive and get Diageo to stop this!"
"Mr President, since the Thessaloniki Summit, five months ago, several young Europeans have been detained in Greek jails. Specifically, there are two twenty-year-old Spaniards, Carlos Martín Martínez and Fernando Pérez Borraiz, who are facing extraordinary accusations."
"These are young people who were there taking part in a demonstration under the slogan, ‘Another world is possible’."
"I believe we must concern ourselves with their plight."
"They have begun a hunger strike and they are facing possible death."
"I would ask the Presidency to call on both the Greek Government and the other institutions to adopt measures in relation to this problem."
"I should like to point out that I shall not reply to each contribution individually."
"They will all be passed on to the President of Parliament."
"Mr President, on 8 November 2003 I was in The Hague participating in a demonstration in favour of the release of Slobodan Milosevic."
"I am not going to speak about Mr Milosevic now, since I have done so on a number of occasions in the past."
"I should like instead to refer to the fact that the demonstrators in The Hague, most of them Serb immigrants, were not allowed to write slogans in their own language."
"Speaking to the police I found out that there is a general rule against slogans written in languages that the police do not understand."
"This is apparently so that the police can control their content."
"It is obvious that the Netherlands, so tolerant on many things as we all know, will not tolerate uncensored political expression."
"Another incident occurred last Saturday at the airport in Paris when I was going through a security check on my way to Athens."
"The staff insisted that I take off my jacket, although I had removed from it all metal objects and had gone through the metal detector."
"Upon my refusal, the police were called and the next minute Mr 466294 and Mr 485684 – they would not give me their names – appeared and tried to convince me that this was the rule and nobody was supposed to contest it."
"Behind this unacceptable behaviour I see a clear effort to terrorise people by having them obey stupid orders."
"I also see the presumption of guilt of terrorism for any person going through a security check."
"Moreover, if a Member of the European Parliament can be subjected to such embarrassing and humiliating treatment, I wonder what would happen to others, in particular those whose complexion is a bit darker than average."
"These two incidents show signs of a police state being gradually built up in the European Union, in line with the wish of the ruling class to exercise full control upon their subjects."
"I look forward to your reactions, Mr President."
"Mr President, many Members will be aware that there are several hundred Eritrean demonstrators outside our building this evening."
"They are here because of their concern that the Algiers Agreement – which was a settlement of the boundaries between Ethiopia and Eritrea – has not been agreed by Ethiopia."
"On behalf of Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, I have received a petition signed by 22 000 Eritreans living in the European Union and in Norway."
"Both countries are to be urged to accept the provisions of the Algiers Agreement, which was based upon the decision of the Boundary Commission."
"Ethiopia is reluctant to agree to that decision at this time."
"Mr President, would you please ensure that a letter is written to the Ethiopian Government to urge it to respect that decision, in order to restore peace between the two countries after what has been a bloody and terrible war."
"Mr President, I wish to bring to the House's attention the situation concerning a local councillor in Lancaster in the UK, who made public a decision made in secret by the cabinet of the City Council to suspend the local taxation owed to it by the local nuclear power station owned by British Energy."
"The Commission has indicated that this taxation relief could amount to the unlawful granting of state aid."
"In response to the publication of this information, this particular councillor, Councillor Dowding, has now been suspended for three months as a penalty for making public allegedly confidential information."
"Depriving the electorate of their only representation on the local council, and making an example of somebody who has brought to the public's attention an act which is not in the best interests either of that council or the European Union, is hardly an incentive to others to raise such issues."
"As the House is committed to transparency and financial probity, I am sure it will join with me in regretting the action of the Standards Committee."
"– Mr President, I should like to return to what our fellow Member said regarding Mr Prodi’s untimely remarks of a few days ago."
"I should like, through you, to ask our President, Mr Cox, what action he intends to take to remind the President of the Commission that positioning himself as leader of the Italian Left at a time when his own country holds the presidency of the European Union, and at a time when Italy is engaged in a bloody ordeal in Iraq, is inelegant to say the least."
"Taking such a stance is in any case contrary to the spirit of the rules governing the European institution in question and contrary to the most basic of political ethics."
"I would request, Mr President, that you pass on this comment to Mr Cox."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, approximately two years ago, information was circulating to the effect that Roma women were being sterilised against their will in Eastern Europe, especially in Slovakia."
"On 17 October 2003, Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, published a recommendation on ‘Certain aspects of law and practice relating to sterilisation of women in the Slovak Republic’."
"The recommendation states that there has been no organised policy in this area. It has, however, happened that women have been sterilised against their will."
"In March 2002, I put a question about this to the Commission, which promised to follow up the matter and enquire of Slovakia whether proof had been found of such compulsory sterilisation really having taken place."
"Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, has now published this evidence, and I would ask the Commissioner to fulfil its promise."
"We cannot have an EU in which what is most fundamental is not respected: a person’s right to his or her own life."
"I hope that everyone else who, later in the debate, discusses issues of life and death will also consider this aspect."
"We cannot accept such things in a European Union."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposed that the question of serious democratic violations during the recent elections in Albania be included in this week's topical and urgent debate."
"The purpose of this proposal was to send a suitable message to the Albanian authorities and prevent any further attempt to undermine the democratic morale of the citizens and candidates of this country."
"Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected by all the political groups and, again unfortunately, it was borne out by the sad events during yesterday's repeat elections in Albania, which saw very serious cases of intimidation, bombing attempts and so on, against citizens and candidates."
"I trust that the European Union will draw the necessary conclusions from this unacceptable situation, which reveals attitudes and conducts which are absolutely foreign to the European perception of democratic values and process."
"Mr President, I should like to join with you in condemning these atrocious attacks on the Jewish synagogues in Istanbul."
"As we all know, Turkey is a country that is proud of the fact that, when the Jews were being persecuted by the terrible pogroms in Europe in the Middle Ages, it gave them refuge. It is right to be proud of this part of its history."
"When these terrible attacks took place, the Turkish president happened to be out of the country on an official visit to support an illegal regime which Turkey and the Turkish armed forces have created and are obstinately maintaining in northern Cyprus, contrary to the directives of the international community."
"This coincidence alone speaks volumes and I hope that it will enlighten Mr Erdogan and that he will take Turkey, as I am sure he wants to, off the road of illegality and tyranny which only harbours tragedy for Turkey itself and the rest of the world."
"Mr President, I would like to revert to a subject raised during the previous session in connection with the fact that the Pakistani authorities are still holding the Greek seamen from the hostage."
"The accident happened in July 2003, 4-5 months ago, while the was being piloted by a Pakistani pilot in the port of Karachi."
"The procedure to restore the environment and pump out what oil could be pumped out then commenced."
"On 17 August, once the shipwreck had already been cut in two, a team from Greece headed by the shipbuilder, Mr Pappas, went to Pakistan in order to clean up the area."
"As we speak, both the ship's crew and those who went to clean up the area are being held hostage by Pakistan without charges and, apart from the fact that they have not released them, this is preventing the companies which have undertaken the clean-up operation from going there, because they are frightened that perhaps they too will end up as hostages."
"In all events, the ship was insured."
"The Pakistani Government may have differences with the insurance company. However, under no circumstances can the seamen, especially those who arrived well after the event in order to help clean up the environment, be held as hostages as a negotiating element between the Pakistani authorities and the insurance company."
"I therefore call on Parliament to do what it can to help free these hostages."
"Mr President, I represent the south-east region of England and am the only Member to live in the county of Hampshire, very close to the port of Southampton, the home port of the new , which will be the greatest liner in the world."
"This liner, built in France, will sail from England, showing there is some life left in the ."
"I know that the people of Southampton, and the port workers of that city, would wish to associate themselves with the condolences expressed to the families of the people killed and to those injured in the awful accident at Saint-Nazaire."
"Mr President, the speech by the Greek Communist Member who condemned the USA as an imperialist occupier of Iraq is a little rich from a party which in its day supported the USSR's invasion and crushing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the Czechoslovak 'Prague Spring' in 1968 and the Afghan invasion in 1979."
"The USSR would never have left these countries if it had not been forced to do so by the economic collapse of the Communist system."
"Unlike Baroness Ludford, I welcome tomorrow's state visit by President Bush to the United Kingdom, and his commitment to hand over power to a democratically elected Iraqi Government by the end of next year."
"I salute the courage of all the brave coalition forces in Iraq who are fighting for law and order and freedom and justice in that country, and against international Islamic terrorism."
"Mr President, I shall not comment on what the previous speaker said; I shall merely say that it is inconceivable to me that such reasoning should be heard in this House."
"I should like to ask you to allow me to inform the House about a number of serious infringements which I noticed during my recent visit to Estonia and Lithuania."
"In Estonia, as in Latvia, although half the population is Russian or Russian-speaking, the Russian language is not recognised as an official language."
"Public-sector services, courts and laws are all in a language of which they have an inadequate command."
"In addition, they are denied the nationality of the country in which they and their fathers were born."
"They are made to sit humiliating and highly specialised examinations in language, the constitution and history, which very few are able to pass."
"The universities and schools are closed to Russian."
"In all three Baltic States, the communist parties are banned and their cadres persecuted."
"In Lithuania, the leaders of the Communist Party of Lithuania, Mikolas Burakevicius and Koulalis, have been in prison for ten years on prefabricated charges under a law passed long after they were arrested."
"This and much more goes on in the Baltic and in other former socialist accession countries, despite assurances to the contrary by Mr Verheugen, who has repeatedly expressed his support for these flagrant violations."
"I should like to draw your attention to a letter containing specific facts …"
"Mr President, I was extremely shocked at the fact that the behaviour of the police in The Hague was likened to that in a police state, only because they insisted on the placards that were being carried during a demonstration being intelligible to the public for whom the demonstration was intended."
"This is extremely odd."
"It is, in the first place, all very well for people to travel to The Hague especially to demonstrate in favour of a totalitarian dictator, but then, on top of that, they refuse to write the placards in a language that is intelligible to Dutch people."
"What is the reason for that?"
"It is very obvious."
"If they are written in a non-intelligible language, they may contain all kinds of racist messages."
"If they are accepted after all, then the next thing is, the newspapers carry photographs that give the impression that the Dutch police is standing by while these awful things are being written."
"It is therefore entirely logical that a request is made beforehand to draft the messages in an intelligible language so that the Dutch police can ensure that the placards themselves do not infringe the law."
"If that is seen to be a police state, then that is taking matters very far indeed and is clearly indicative of what those who are behind Milosevic think a police state is like."
"Mr President, on the subject of commercial arrangements between Ryanair and the airport of Charleroi in Belgium, may I remind the European Commission that it tolerated airline monopolies and exorbitant prices for air travel in Europe for years."
"Ryanair has helped to reverse air price arrangements in Europe; it has secured favourable deals from private airports."
"Surely in this era of competition we should permit public airports to compete with private airports for the generation of air travel business, because at the end of the day it will mean cheaper air prices for consumers."
"This in turn will send out a positive message from the European Union that it is actually supporting measures which promote air travel at a competitive price and help the consumers of Europe."
"Before Ryanair started to fly to Charleroi Airport it was a deserted field and now Ryanair flies 2 million people in and out, to the satisfaction of consumers using this invaluable air link."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the European Year of People with Disabilities (2003)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity to report to you on what has been achieved during the European Year of People with Disabilities and how it is to be followed up, given that it is only six weeks until the end of the year."
"We must bear in mind that policies relating to people with disabilities are national policies. What we were trying to do in 2003 was to find all the methods, tools and gateways which we can use to give European added value to national policies."
"So far, the Year has achieved significant results to do with raising awareness about the rights of people with disabilities."
"We have had thousands of events in all the Member States at national, regional and local level, debates in parliament, fora and exchanges of best practices between the Member States, while of course the non-governmental organisations and the Disabled People's Movement have also made a real contribution to an explosion of events and to passing on the message about the rights of people with disabilities."
"The European Parliament supported the Year without reservation right from the start."
"On 3 November 2003, the first reading about lifelong learning facilities was organised with young people with disabilities and a few days ago, on 10 and 11 November, the European Parliament of People with Disabilities sat and passed a resolution on the subject."
"Of course, we should emphasise that the Year marks the start of a European procedure and that all the efforts and planning do not come to an end at the end of the year."
"It is especially important that we use the momentum created and we must say that today, in every country, initiatives and innovative action are being taken, which was not the case in the past, and we also have important, exceptionally advanced legislation in certain countries."
"On 30 October, the Commission issued a communication about the follow-up needed to this Year."
"There are three basic objectives:"
"The first is to achieve the adoption and full application of the directive on equal treatment of the disabled in employment and at work."
"The second is the successful incorporation of issues relating to people with disabilities in all policies."
"This relates to our agreement on mainstreaming, so that this policy is not just a matter for the ministries of social affairs or the ministries of health or the ministries of employment, but is a horizontal policy which concerns all the ministries in each country and all portfolios at the Commission."
"The third is improving access for all people with disabilities."
"As far as the first issue of the application of the directive is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that, in the year 2000, an anti-discrimination directive was adopted in record time, which was unprecedented in the European Union, but of course we have to say that its promotion by the Member States did not proceed at the rate we expected."
"Today, a large number of countries have still not adopted the draft directive on equal treatment for people subject to discrimination."
"The deadline expires at the end of December and, basically, only two countries have adopted the directive."
"However, we have to go beyond adoption to implementation, where important changes will be needed to the rules which apply today in certain Member States."
"This will have an impact on employers, in both the public and private sectors, and on the working practices applied to people with disabilities, because the directive, which concerns reasonable adaptations, will have to be applied to the letter."
"In other words, the workplace will have to be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities."
"The Commission will perform its duty in full as guardian of the Treaty, as regards the adoption of the directive at the correct moment in time, its proper transposition – not in the wrong way and not without there being specific references to the European text – and of course its implementation."
"The communication, as I said earlier, also focussed on the issue of horizontal policies relating to people with disabilities, in other words incorporation into all individual policies. We already have examples at European level, with an important step in the field of transport and in the field of electronic communications, for which Commissioners de Palacio and Liikanen are responsible."
"The incorporation of these issues into all the relevant policies must focus mainly on access issues, access to goods, services and buildings, and must be linked to the principle of 'design for all' expressed in the Commission communication which immediately preceded this communication."
"The communication introduces a multiannual, rolling action plan."
"The first priority is employment, which is also the most important factor for the social integration of people with disabilities."
"I would say that our philosophy is essentially encapsulated in the slogan that people with disabilities must have the right to work and not to benefits."
"Consequently, the first stage in the application of the action plan, which is to be developed between 2004 and 2005, will concentrate on putting the necessary conditions in place for promoting the employment of people with disabilities."
"Today we calculate that there are 3 million people with disabilities in Europe who could be integrated into the labour market."
"There is an even bigger number who, with special policies, with investment in these people and with skills which matched their capabilities, could be integrated into the labour market."
"Our policy for the workplace will focus on four priorities: access to and staying in employment, lifelong learning, new technologies – which we consider to be one of the most crucial elements – because, with innovation and research, a series of new tools really can give people with all sorts of disabilities the power to deal with their disabilities."
"At the same time, however, these tools must be cheap and accessible to everyone."
"Today, the European market is extremely difficult for these people."
"Every country has its own specifications to a large degree, each social system is linked to its own undertakings. This results in the same tools being cheap in one country and expensive in another."
"Hence, this field of new technologies and access for people with disabilities to the technologies in question at European level is one of the challenges and, finally, the fourth priority is access to public buildings."
"As one way of supporting the successful incorporation of these issues in policies, the Commission is proposing the publication of a biennial report on developments in each Member State, focussing each time on planning and new choices of priorities."
"We think that this report, the first of which will be published in 2005, will be an important tool for exerting pressure on the Member States, who will have to announce developments at institutional level and at implementation level, which we shall publish every two years."
"Finally, the Commission is proposing to further strengthen the contribution of all the interested parties and of the basic protagonists in the policy-making dialogue, so that we have major and permanent changes in the economy and society as a whole."
"I should like to express my satisfaction about the facility being given to carry out a study, as called for by Parliament, on the situation of people with disabilities living in institutions, who make up another large category of our fellow citizens, with special problems of another sort."
"Of course, this type of problem has a very large dimension in the candidate countries."
"Mr President, the expectations of the Year were great."
"I believe that we have significant results, especially if we think – as I stressed in my introduction – that these policies are, to a large extent, almost purely national policies."
"I believe, however, that with all this activation during the Year in 2003, the issue of people with disabilities became a top priority on the political agenda both of the Member States and of the European Union itself."
"Most importantly, however, it brought the policy of the Disabled People's Movement itself to the forefront, by putting into practice the slogan 'Nothing about us without us', meaning they must be involved at all planning and decision-making levels."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now approaching the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities, which is to be concluded in Rome on 5 December 2003 under the Italian Presidency, and it was the President-in-Office of the European Union himself, who, in his speech at the start of his six-month term of office, made what I consider to be a powerful, historic gesture where social policies relating to people with disabilities are concerned."
"He explicitly stated that the Union Presidency would take steps to lay the foundations for legislative measures to combat discrimination, producing, in practice, a directive protecting the independence and equal rights of millions of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life in the new Europe, giving them genuine hope for the future."
"However, to date, the Commission has neither provided a timetable for a future horizontal directive on the rights of people with disabilities, covering not just work but all aspects of life too, nor even given specific undertakings to integrate the rights of people with disabilities into policy, as confirmed in the recent communication, which would seem, rather, to be no more than the announcement of good intentions."
"Indeed, it is not clear how the objective of boosting equal opportunities is to be achieved if such opportunities are only available in certain aspects of life such as work."
"Here are some examples: with the directive on employment, the Commission’s aim is to achieve full employment of people with disabilities, which would be a step towards eliminating discrimination."
"This is all well and good, but how is a person to penetrate the labour market nowadays and work towards getting a worthwhile, high-quality job if people with disabilities are not provided with adequate teaching, education and training, for instance?"
"Integration starts early on, as you can see; indeed, it has to start at school."
"People with disabilities are not divided into sectors or compartments of inactivity, they are girls and boys, men and women who are entitled to full integration, not integration in some areas: thousands of children with disabilities in Europe still live in institutes rather than with their families, for example."
"The coordination method could come to our aid here too, but there is too little mention of it in the communication."
"Lastly, I would say that the European Year is certainly closing with quite a positive result as regards the goals set of raising awareness of disability issues."
"I feel that what was lacking was a specific, effective measure from the Commission, which did not act diligently on the strong, firm pressure from Parliament or the calls from the Council Presidency."
"I will end by calling on President Prodi, if Mrs Diamantopoulou will relay the message, to be, perhaps, a little more active and more diligent, even though the Commission is at the end of its term of office, as regards an issue, the issue of disability, which is of such great importance in human, social and cultural terms."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that 2003 is drawing to a close and with it the European Year of People with Disabilities."
"It is the perfect time to take stock of the situation, but also to reflect on the future of Community policy in this field."
"The achievements of this year should be welcomed, Commissioner; it has been a unique opportunity, as you hoped it would be, to promote the rights of people with disabilities and to take into account their legitimate claim to play a full part in social, economic and political life."
"The momentum created by this year, with thousands of varied events on offer at national, regional and local level, is considerable, and we are grateful to you."
"Today, however, we need to capitalise on this momentum and use this experience as a launching pad for new measures, both at the level of the Member States and at Community level."
"The communication that you are tabling does, I believe, properly reflect what is at stake here."
"I welcome this, but think that it also needs to be said, as one of my fellow Members already has done, that, given the reticence of Member States, greater affirmation of political will is still needed in this field."
"The lack of enthusiasm shown by Member States to transpose the directive on equal treatment in employment, for example, should be widely denounced, and compels us to do even more."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has a clear position in this regard, and my colleagues and I are convinced that difficulties related to disability should be addressed across the board in an integrated way, taking as our model existing legislation on equal opportunities between men and women."
"We were very keen to improve a number of legislative texts."
"You mentioned transport."
"I should like to say that where corporate social responsibility is concerned, companies’ policies on disability should be one of the criteria for assessing that responsibility and the quality of their contribution to society."
"At the same time, the European Parliament of Disabled People, which met last week, regretted the fact that a specific European directive on disability would not be concluded during this important year."
"Admittedly, the gamble taken on the employment issue is absolutely fundamental – no one can dispute that – but we want to believe, Commissioner, that this is just one step towards implementing Community legislation that needs to be even more ambitious."
"Where disability is concerned, perhaps more than in other areas, I think it is appropriate to finish by sharing with you a personal conviction."
"These Community legislative measures are essential, and we recognise this, given the impetus that they should unleash, but we also know that it is at national, regional and local level that a whole series of coordinated policies need to be brought on stream, policies that must be accommodated within civil society by industry, the social partners and – let us not forget, where school-related issues are concerned – teachers."
"In conclusion, allow me to say, Commissioner, Mr President, that where rights are concerned and where the dignity of those who today live with a disability is concerned, we cannot afford to rely solely on Member States’ goodwill."
"We need to come up with greater incentives, as I hope you are doing in the communication."
"We are counting on your multiannual report, Commissioner, precisely to exert pressure on those Member States that are not moving in quite the direction that we are recommending."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has produced the action plan on lifelong learning, new technologies, access to the built environment and so on, but we need to go much further."
"As rapporteur for the European Year of People with Disabilities, all of us set out with very high hopes for this year."
"We wanted to see positive outcomes and indeed that is what I wrote in my report."
"We need to mainstream disabled peoples' rights, get away from the medical model of disability once and for all and move to the social or rights-based model of disability."
"We also need to highlight the achievements of disabled people."
"Some of those things have been done, but I did not want this just to be a pat on the back for the Member States for having held conferences in major cities, or for them to say simply 'how wonderful we are to have had a European Year of People with Disabilities'."
"We must make sure that disabled people really are at the top of the political agenda and that means that the employment directive must be fully implemented."
"I would like to know which countries have not implemented the employment directive, which countries have not put into place anything to start to implement that directive and what sanctions the Commission is going to take against those countries to make sure they implement it."
"Furthermore, we need, as Mr Mantovani and Mrs Gillig said, a specific disability directive."
"If we do not get that specific directive, I, along with a lot of disabled peoples' organisations, feel that the European Year of People with Disabilities will have been a failure."
"I am sorry to have to say that because we have made some progress, but without the commitment to a disability directive we have not gone far enough."
"Mr President, it is true that some important initiatives for debate have been launched during the European Year of People with Disabilities, such as the Congress on Autism, held this weekend in Lisbon, and the European Parliament of Disabled People, which took place in Brussels last week."
"Everyone had hoped for much more, however, at both Community and national level, particularly in my country – Portugal – which suffers from serious social problems, the highest rate of poverty in the European Union, many forms of discrimination and has seen cuts in fundamental public investment in areas such as education and health. These factors have hit people with disabilities particularly hard, in the name of complying with the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact."
"Regrettably, we are reaching the end of this European Year without having made any progress on a disability policy and without issues relating to discrimination and the human rights of these individuals being made the top priority of the various Community policies."
"Until this is done, there can be no real social inclusion."
"I must point out that the report I drafted on the scoreboard on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which Parliament adopted in September, focused on the need to present a proposal during this Year of People with Disabilities for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty to combat discrimination on grounds of disability."
"Regrettably, this did not happen."
"In the documents adopted by the European Parliament of Disabled People last week, priority was also given to the call for this new directive to prevent the raising of further obstacles and to stipulate that the existing obstacles faced by people with disabilities must be eliminated throughout the European Union."
"This should really happen in the near future."
"The directive on equal treatment in the field of employment and occupation should also be transposed, establishing a broad definition of disability and laying down strict and effective penalties to be applied if the law is broken."
"We hope that this year will spark effective policies in this field of supporting people with disabilities and bring recognition of their rights."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of People with Disabilities is approaching its end and it is time to examine the results."
"What do we see?"
"Can a year really make any difference?"
"Have we been able to achieve anything concrete that could help us to have an impact on the day-to-day existence and quality of life of disabled people?"
"I would hope after this year some permanent changes will remain in the way at least some disabled people cope in their everyday life."
"A good example would be the use of assistance dogs throughout the Union, which, along with technical tools and information technology, mean greater scope socially, educationally, and professionally for people with visual, aural and motion disabilities."
"I will take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her genuine interest and encouragement regarding this issue, which I hope will continue to make progress and extend throughout the new Member States too, possibly with the aid of EU funding."
"There is nevertheless the question of how to incorporate accessibility, non-discrimination, and full citizens’ rights for people with disabilities in major policy lines at all levels."
"Right now too we are introducing more major areas of policy for the future."
"I am involved in adapting a proposal for a directive on public procurement and we are now trying to settle two important issues for people with disabilities and the enforcement of their citizens’ rights."
"To what extent can we take the special needs of disabled people into account in planning the built environment and its other physical aspects and developing transport and other services?"
"Another essential question that remains unanswered is the criteria for production methods."
"In my opinion, it is also mainly a matter of democracy."
"These two directives involve taking important decisions on just how great the power of decision of the local authorities should be."
"Furthermore, there is an implied danger under the new draft constitution that healthcare and other social services would be opened up to competition."
"How then would the special needs of people with disabilities be affected?"
"Mr President, last week, we had an excellent Parliament for the Disabled."
"I would, in fact, like all of us, as much as possible, to try to act on the recommendations that this Parliament made."
"Despite the fact that a large proportion of the policy for the disabled – particularly its medical component – is national policy, it is, however, the case that employment policy, social exclusion policy and internal market policy are of key importance to people with disabilities."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will give this due consideration."
"The main reason why we are here today is, of course, as various speakers have already mentioned, this specific directive."
"I believe that we should really go ahead and adopt it."
"Mr President, there is something I fail to understand."
"The Commission has, after all, always referred to the fact that this directive would be too controversial at this point in time, but, Commissioner, you yourself adopted a draft directive two weeks ago that is much more controversial than what we have here."
"By so doing, you have, in effect, totally undermined your own argument."
"If you are prepared to table very controversial directives in another field, then I applaud this, for I am always pleased when the Commission is brave."
"However, you should at least commission the studies so that it is possible to submit this proposal as soon as possible."
"That is, after all, what we have asked for."
"Finally, as you indeed already indicated, we will need to give a great deal of attention to the new Member States."
"I think that it will be some time yet before we know precisely how policy is conducted over there."
"I found out this week that certain categories of people with disabilities in some countries are not even entitled to identity cards."
"A great deal still needs to be done there, but this also applies to the current European Union, because people with disabilities are still too much the invisible citizens whom we forget all too easily."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must, no doubt, all concede that we were somewhat surprised by how very successful this year was."
"I am myself always sceptical when ‘European Years’ devoted to social policy objectives are declared, and, at the end of them one cannot actually point to anything having been achieved."
"Such was not the case with this one."
"This may be because this ‘Year’ was something special, above all in that it promised much, and because the idea for it was put to politicians by non-governmental organisations and associations of handicapped persons."
"There were discussions of a wide variety of topics, in which disabled people themselves discussed national and European approaches."
"Rather than having discussions about disabled people, we discussed things with them."
"In my own country, too, a debate has got under way, which has as its objective, not only legislative measures but also, of course, the raising of public awareness."
"We want unrestricted participation, no longer to be cared for outside society in the way we once were."
"We want full equality rather than the former demeaning sympathy, and, instead of being patronised by well-meaning people, we want the right to autonomy."
"For that, of course, we need legislative measures."
"I might add that we in this House agreed that this Year should not remain a one-off, a concern that the Commission’s new action plan takes up."
"I think the Commission is still being a bit too hesitant as regards the timescale, as we should make use of the present commitment, which is evident everywhere, rather than putting things off for another two or three years."
"I am also glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has managed to get a line inserted into the Budget, not merely for a survey, but for following up all the things that have gone well in this European Year."
"I would like to close with a very fine slogan that you, Commissioner, mentioned at a recent event, when you said that we should use ‘Getting on Board’ as a slogan."
"I would like to end with a slogan for the future, when disabled people will not just be ‘Getting on Board’ but also ‘Staying on Board’."
"Mr President, the European Union's permanent preoccupation, at the level of communications alone of course, with people with disabilities, forms part of the effort to conceal the tragic reality, which is that there is 90% unemployment in the European Union – and not 70% as the leaders assert, with a dramatic increase in unemployed people with disabilities, in conjunction with a dramatic reduction in disabled children attending special schools or parallel departments in recent years."
"In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, which are financed by the insured, not the state."
"For autistic children over 14 years old, there is not one rehabilitation centre, while few children with mental health problems attend some sort of school."
"Of the 2 000 rehabilitation centres which should exist in Greece, there are only 200 sub-standard centres in Athens."
"The problem of people with disabilities is deeply class-based."
"Equal opportunities for people with disabilities mean a free national health and welfare service, special education, assistance and dignified work for everyone."
"It means a different policy, which the European Union, by its very nature, is unable to practice."
"That is why it takes refuge in ‘lying on a massive scale’, as we say in Greece."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have to conclude once again, as I have also told you at the end of the European Disability Forum, that literally across the entire political spectrum, another directive is being requested, a broad directive which goes further than the directive that has not yet been applied in the Member States and that only pertained to work and vocational training."
"There is no argument that could justify why this directive has been neither transposed nor implemented."
"The ultimate deadline is early December, and as far as I am concerned, you can initiate proceedings against Member States that have not done anything by then, and, with the help of Parliament, put pressure on those Member States."
"Following this, however, a broad directive must be adopted immediately, not only in the form of studies."
"Studies are a start; something must certainly be done about that too."
"However, we would like your word in the mean time that this directive will actually be adopted."
"This was also a request that was made by the European Disability Forum."
"They have, in fact, got the directive all ready on paper, and we would ask for progress to be made in that area in the meantime."
"Mr President, I should not wish the European Year of People with Disabilities and the parliament we had last week to be seen as the end, but rather the beginning, of something."
"Demands have been made in a number of areas. Now, it is a question of implementing them."
"The Commissioner said that mainstreaming should apply to disability issues."
"I share that view."
"Disability policy is not a policy area. Disability issues are part and parcel of all policy areas."
"In those areas in which the EU has competence, disability issues are therefore also an area of responsibility for the EU."
"For example, one area of competence for the EU is people’s freedom of movement."
"That applies to everyone, including people with disabilities."
"Transport is also one of the EU’s areas of competence, and transport for all, including people with disabilities, also falls therefore within the EU’s competence."
"It is regrettable that the Member States have not implemented the directive concerning the equal treatment of people with disabilities in the workplace."
"That must not be used as an excuse for not producing directives in other policy areas."
"What signal would that give to those Member States which do not want to do anything?"
"They would, of course, imagine that, if they did not do anything, no further measures would be put in place."
"We know that directives are needed that cover all the relevant policy areas, and that is what we demand."
"I shall conclude by mentioning two other important areas to which attention should be given over the next few years."
"The first is the new Member States."
"Even though we face challenges in the present Member States, the challenges are still greater in the new Member States."
"The second is the debate about the future."
"We must push our demand for majority decision-making when it comes to anti-discrimination."
"The country that is least ambitious where discrimination is concerned must not be allowed to determine the agenda."
"That is why majority decision-making is needed in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, opportunity has been taken of the European Year of People with Disabilities to express numerous proposals and to formulate interesting ideas. Generally speaking, we have a wealth of material before us which, however, needs to be mastered if we want to have an integrated policy on people with disabilities."
"This is the most difficult point of the entire strategy."
"If we want to be efficient, we need to focus our policy on three objectives."
"First, we need to persuade the constitution writers that it is high time we moved on to a new generation of rights which are recognised in the countries' constitutions as an integral part of fundamental rights, because only if people with disabilities are recognised as having special rights will they too be able to enjoy the fundamental rights which are generally recognised for all citizens."
"Secondly, we need to persuade finance ministers to recognise that expenditure on people with disabilities should be seen not as consumer spending, but as an investment in human potential and, consequently, as productive expenditure."
"This will pave the way for taking the measures needed to stop the exclusion of these people."
"Finally, but equally importantly, we need to introduce a strategy to convince the rest of the population that the problems of people with disabilities relate not to a specific category, but to society as a whole, if we want to have a society with cohesion and superior living standards."
"In other words, the indifference or even, on numerous occasions, the negative attitude of our fellow citizens towards the special characteristics of these people needs to be overcome."
"Only if the problem of people with disabilities becomes a common problem will it have an auspicious outcome."
"In particular, as far as the employment sector is concerned, we need to persuade businessmen that they stand to gain a great deal from becoming involved in measures to support these people and make use of their potential in undertakings because, as experience to date has shown, these people are the most loyal of employees."
"To close, I should like to congratulate you on the initiative which you have taken and on the programme which you have announced; however, both I and my fellow Members would say that, if it is to be successful, it needs to be integrated straight away and to include legislative measures."
"Mr President, in this year we should highlight the problems but also celebrate the achievements of people living with disability, not just people of genius – the Beethovens, Miltons, Van Goughs and Stephen Hawkings – but those who are unknown."
"For example, the boy from the north of England who had learning difficulties and was written off by the education service, but was then found to have musical ability."
"Whereas had he had a job in industry he could not have read the safety signs, he went on to play in the orchestra at Covent Garden."
"Then there is the dancer who trained at the Ballet Rambert School."
"She was profoundly deaf, but learnt to dance through the rhythm of her feet and went on to dance with the Portuguese National Ballet."
"I knew a tiny, frail, 23-year-old girl who had been confined to a wheelchair all her life and had undergone 26 lifesaving operations."
"She was a trainee at the SHARE community."
"She decided to do a sponsored wheelchair push, self-propelling the wheels with her tiny hands."
"As she herself said, it was the first time in her life she had the opportunity to help other disabled people."
"People can and do achieve, despite severe physical and mental disabilities."
"For a few that means successful careers in business, politics, the arts or professions."
"For most it means more local, private, domestic achievements: coping with living and contributing to the lives of those around them."
"They bring the courage."
"They deserve from us the opportunity and the dignity."
"In government I was able to bring in a system of direct payments so that a person was not provided for by social service departments if he or she preferred to have the cash equivalent to purchase the services from the supplier of their choice."
"If you buy your own services, meals, transport and so on, then you are in charge, you have a form of dignity and independence which too often is lacking in the relationship between state services and citizens."
"That is the route we should be seeking from this year on."
"Mr President, I was not surprised that the European Year of People with Disabilities was a success."
"Anyone who has consulted and spoken with NGOs, activists and community groups on the ground, as I have in my constituency, will know that the people who represent our 37 million fellow Europeans are very clear in what they demand from us."
"At the weekend, I was told by one group in my constituency that they are happy that the European Year will have some follow-up, but they want clarity about what that will be."
"As Mr Bouwman said, they were promised an employment directive that would be implemented by Member States, and yet they see the Member States still dragging their feet."
"That is not to say that the Commission and colleagues have not pushed those Member States to implement the employment directive in its disability provisions, but it is not being implemented."
"They are therefore concerned that implementation will be lacking in other spheres."
"They want to see action after 2003, not merely more words."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the equal value of all people is fundamental to the European Union."
"That, at least, is the message in speeches made on solemn occasions."
"Actual practice leaves a lot to be desired, however."
"The European Year of People with Disabilities is coming to an end."
"In the course of the year, the searchlight has been directed to a more than usual degree upon the situation of people with disabilities, and it has revealed a lot of shortcomings."
"It is excellent that these deficiencies are being brought to light, but something also needs to be done about them."
"The equal value of every person must, then, also be the criterion for what needs to be done."
"People with disabilities are still discriminated against."
"It is not a matter of isolated cases."
"Instead, discrimination is the rule, rather than the exception."
"What is at issue is being able to cope successfully in everyday life, faced with a lack of jobs and problems using shops, post offices and banks, buses, trains and ’planes."
"It is about being able to use public services and to read newspapers, watch television and listen to the radio."
"The fact is, there is a host of difficulties for people with disabilities, making clear the need there now is for a new, all-embracing directive concerning the rights of people with disabilities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, we are in the final stages of the European year of People with Disabilities and I wish to add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have spoken in favour of a cross-cutting European directive to address this problem."
"I would like, however, to say that this European Year has already been an enormous success, because never has there been so much discussion about this issue in so many different places and never have we been so aware of everything that we need to do, at all levels of responsibility, wherever we happen to be in the European Union."
"The year has, therefore, been a great success."
"This is a first step towards the future, as has been said, and I therefore wish to conclude this debate on a note of much-needed optimism."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their commitment and for the passion with which they themselves, all this time, have supported efforts which really do function as a steam engine to promote the issues of people with disabilities."
"Allow me too, however, to express my disappointment at some sort of criticism which was voiced."
"I imagine that, not only the Members of the European Parliament, but also the Commissioners sometimes have the right to express such disappointment."
"I shall explain what I mean at once."
"I have repeatedly supported the need for there to be a horizontal directive."
"And I have explained the reasons. I shall certainly come back to why this could not be proposed at this specific moment in time."
"However, I want us to focus on what has happened, on all the policies developed, all the fights fought, because I want to assure you, Mr Pronk, that I at least believe that I have shown considerable courage – as much as my position allows – in order to put forward the directives proposed. They were not easy, I can assure you."
"When I submitted them to the Commission, there were public administrators who bet their positions that they would never get through the Commission."
"They passed the required majority of 12 votes."
"When they went to the Council, there were public statements that there was not one chance in a hundred that these directives would get through."
"Yet the directives got through in record time."
"The directives in question – and to be more specific the workplace directive – are now a huge wager which we, the European institutions, have against the national administrations."
"I have been in contact for the last two years with all the ministers in all the Member States."
"I have set up a team of experts, which has recorded the difficulties in applying these directives in each Member State."
"These difficulties are not simply a question of political will."
"It is not that the ministers or some governments are refusing to apply something which they agreed on three years ago."
"There are constitutional problems, there are political problems, there are legal and economic problems, because this is the first time we have had this sort of directive at European level and the majority of Member States did not have the basic experience needed to apply or, more to the point, adopt it within their legislative framework."
"So here we are, one month before the adoption of the legislation, which means, Mr Bouwman, that I do not have any facility to take the Member States to court. Wait until the end of December and then you can check if the Commission is doing its job."
"One month before the deadline and we only have two countries with the legislation."
"We are not talking about application."
"We are talking about adopting the legislation."
"There are many countries which have not yet drafted a bill."
"That is because there are huge problems in their parliaments."
"So that is the situation today."
"The objective, the political objective, must be for us to focus on the implementation of what we agreed on."
"I would ask the honourable Members, as I have repeatedly asked the Disabled People's Movement, to make this their top priority in their countries."
"Governments need to be criticised for failing to honour their obligations."
"There needs to be a public debate as to why we are not applying European legislation."
"A number of Members said that the European Union is all about grand speeches, nice resolutions, communications and conferences."
"I have spoken about legislation."
"I shall tell you what we have done in practice for mainstreaming over the last two years."
"With the Commissioner for competition, Mr Monti, we are making exceptions for the first time from the state aid rules and allowing subsidies for workers with disabilities."
"For the first time, we are making an exception with Mr Bolkestein, the Commissioner for the internal market, for VAT on tools used by people with disabilities."
"For the first time, Mrs de Palacio is submitting legislation on access for people with disabilities to transport, and with Mr Liikanen we are organising the whole e-accessibility programme giving people with disabilities access to the electronic sector."
"And we can take it for granted that these often involve real acrobatics at the level of subsidiarity."
"When we come to the content of the proposed directive, I should like to remind you of the areas apart from employment. They are education, health and welfare, the social systems and benefits, taxation and, as Mr Mantovani mentioned, the question of political participation."
"As I said, honourable Members, I have talked to all the ministers about these matters, so that we can see how to prepare the next step."
"I leave it to you to assess the reactions of the ministers for education to interventions by European legislation in education and of the ministers for health and welfare to interventions by European legislation in health and welfare and social systems."
"I consider the question of taxation far easier and I consider the question of European legislation on the participation of people with disabilities in the political systems of the Member States impossible."
"The reason I am referring to individual policies is to show how difficult the second step is."
"By which I mean a directive which relates to anything apart from employment, when we are totally unable to apply the first legislative act."
"Mr Pronk criticised me because I demonstrated courage and because, with so many clashes, I proposed article 13 on equality of the sexes and because I have arguments for one and not for the other."
"I shall explain to you at once, Mr Pronk."
"Legislation on sexual equality in the workplace goes back thirty years."
"For thirty years now we have been passing European legislation, implementing, improving, reverting and cooperating and now we are completely reforming, recasting the legislation on sexual equality so that we can take the second step."
"With the second step, I think every Member of the European Parliament has been following not the clash, but the furious attack at the mere announcement of the proposal."
"It is not a question of courage here."
"I think that for a politician to put forward clashing issues also has its positive side."
"Knowing the extent to which what you propose is implemented is a matter of responsibility."
"I can assure you that I had no problem whatsoever with being the good Commissioner, compared to all the other bad Commissioners who rejected the directive in question."
"I took a little longer, but after one year of the ‘Year of People with Disabilities’ and after four years with policy for people with disabilities firmly on the European agenda, with specific achievements and not just words, with legislation and with policies which are changing the daily life of European citizens, I really do think that what Mrs Lynne said about it being a failure if there is no proposal for a directive was truly unfair."
"I really cannot accept that statement."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"That ends the debate on the Commission statement."
"The next item is the report by Mr Liese (A5-0369/2003) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Council decision [COM (2003) 390 – C5-0349/2003 – 2003/0151(CNS)] amending decision 2002/834/EC on the specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: ‘Integrating and strengthening the European research area’ (2002-2006)."
"– Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome this opportunity to address an issue in which Parliament has always shown a great interest."
"I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur and all of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for the high standard of their work."
"My thanks also go to the rapporteur and members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"In the economy of the knowledge-based society that the Union has set itself the objective of developing in Europe, scientific research and technological development by definition play a key role."
"More than ever, both the competitiveness of companies and the quality of life enjoyed by European citizens depend on advances in scientific knowledge and their exploitation."
"It has often been said, and with good reason, that this century will be the century of life science and technology."
"Research on embryonic stem cells would appear to be crucial to gain more knowledge about the very first stages of life."
"It also promises to have significant medical applications, such as in the treatment of diseases that have so far been incurable, particularly degenerative diseases – cancer or Alzheimer’s disease for example – which are placing an increasing burden on European society in terms of human suffering and in economic terms."
"In the shorter term, research on embryonic stem cells will allow scientists to gain a better understanding of the processes of cell differentiation and reproduction, the key processes in forming life and in the emergence of certain diseases, which will make advances in other research areas possible."
"This research will gain from being carried out at European level, where the added value of cooperation is significant."
"Cooperation between teams from different Member States allows the resources required to be used more effectively and makes it possible to obtain the best results more quickly for the benefit of the scientific community and patients across Europe."
"I will speak first of all about the institutional context to this cooperation."
"The proposal tabled by the Commission on 9 July was a follow-up to the Council of 30 September 2002, during which the specific programmes were adopted for the implementation of the sixth framework programme of research."
"On that occasion it was agreed that the Commission would table a legislative proposal amending the specific programme ‘Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area’ and setting out a framework for research using embryos and human embryonic stem cells."
"The Commission is therefore proposing a set of principles, a framework which lays down very strict, clear and transparent conditions, both scientific and ethical, which are intended to govern the funding of research projects using human supernumerary embryos to develop new stem cell lines."
"The Commission believes that it has drafted a responsible proposal to the extent that it strikes a good balance between, on the one hand, meeting the needs of research and the expectations of patients and, on the other hand, providing an assurance that such research will respect the strictest ethical standards."
"Imposing even stricter conditions than those proposed by the Commission would in practice amount to banning this research, when in fact it is permitted in accordance with the decisions already made by Parliament and the Council regarding the framework programme and its specific programmes."
"I should like to underline that it is not our business here to lay down ethical rules for stem cell research in Europe."
"The conditions proposed only apply to the sixth framework programme and do not affect national legislation."
"This research will never be funded in a country where it is forbidden."
"In proposing these conditions, the Commission wanted to send out a clear message to those who might have reservations about the type of research concerned here."
"It proposes that only those supernumerary embryos that were created before 27 June 2002 may be used."
"The purpose of this time limit is to prevent Community financing providing any kind of an incentive to create additional supernumerary embryos for research purposes during in vitro fertilisation procedures."
"I should also like to stress that funding for research using embryonic stem cells is in addition to funding for research on adult stem cells."
"Research on both types of cells is necessary, in particular because their properties are different, as moreover are the medical applications envisaged."
"It is also important, however, to be able to have new embryonic stem cell lines at our disposal, because those that exist today are few in number, for the most part of poor quality and – I would stress – essentially non-European, patented and therefore only accessible at high prices, even for research work."
"Under these circumstances, it is in Europe’s interests to develop its own capacity."
"In conclusion, I would remind you that the three institutions have undertaken to reach a decision on this dossier by the end of the year and I am obviously counting very much on Parliament’s support to achieve this."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the topic we are considering today is one that is of great concern to many people."
"Emotions have run high in recent weeks."
"Many members of the European public have fundamental ethical convictions that lead them to reject research using the stem cells of human embryos."
"Others advocate such research, and do so with great vehemence."
"Commissioner Busquin was right to say that we are not here to decide on how reliable this sort of research is, or, therefore, to affect national laws, something that is also made clear in the Committee’s Amendment 1."
"The only issue we are deciding is what, in this field, we in the European Union will fund."
"So I ask all Members of the House to be careful about the language they use."
"This is not about banning anything, but about whether or not the European budget should fund it."
"According to the Council decision on 30 September 2002, the end of this year marks the deadline for a decision to be taken on the use of human embryos and embryonic stem cells under the Sixth Research Programme."
"This is where I have my first point of criticism to make, one also made in the amendments adopted by the committee, for the Commission proposal deals only with the procurement of human embryonic stem cells from human embryos."
"It contains no comprehensive rules on research using embryos and embryonic stem cells."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has adopted a whole series of amendments that very definitely do take up a position on research using embryos and embryonic stem cells."
"I strongly appeal to the Council, to consider both in the next stage of proceedings; this will certainly make it easier to arrive at a compromise."
"One very important amendment by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is Amendment 6, which the committee adopted by a large majority, and which states that: ‘according to an overwhelming majority of scientists, a transplantation of human embryonic stem cells to patients during the time frame of the Sixth Research Framework Programme (until the end of 2006) is not possible for purely scientific reasons, because this approach is mainly in the stage of basic research and a transplantation at the current moment would lead to non-calculable risks for the recipients.’"
"As this amendment makes clear, we cannot make exaggerated claims to the effect that we can cure everything."
"Research into embryonic stem cells is at a very early stage, and the risk of cancer associated with transplantation into patients obliges us to be very, very cautious in our approach."
"If transplantation into patients is not possible, then why does the committee nonetheless believe that this research merits our support?"
"Amendments 7, 17 and 18 clarify this. In these, we make it clear that the real object of our efforts is the use of adult stem cells in research and in the treatment of patients, but, from a purely scientific point of view it appears that we need embryo stem cell research simply to further develop research with adult stem cells."
"Nevertheless, of course, we must not lose sight of the real objective, and that is why we demand in our amendments that research with adult stem cells should take priority."
"This has already yielded real successes with real patients – real successes that have already been achieved, at least on an experimental basis, when treating patients with bone and cartilage damage, leukaemia, heart attacks, incontinence and even Parkinson’s disease."
"This, therefore, is the area that we have to prioritise."
"So far in this debate, as you will be aware, I have always been among those who have expressed fundamental misgivings about research with human embryonic stem cells generally."
"I nevertheless believe that, on most points, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has achieved a good compromise, and so I will defend to this House the committee’s position on most points."
"I cannot, however, say that of Amendment 10, on which the committee outvoted me and adopted a form of words that supports the production of new embryonic stem cell lines and research on embryos themselves."
"My personal view is that this amendment is not well-advised, and that it would be better to support Mr Nisticò’s amendments, 25 and 24, according to which we should indeed support research on embryonic stem cells, but not the procurement of new stem cell lines."
"I believe that to be a good compromise, and one that could be adopted by the Council, which would clarify matters once and for all."
"It also has to be made clear that if you support Mr Nisticò’s amendments, you are also supporting rules for publicly-funded research that go further and are more liberal than those applying to publicly-funded researchers in the USA."
"I do not therefore believe that it can be said that this approach is restrictive or inimical to research, and so I ask you to support Mr Nisticò’s amendments, 24 and 25."
". Mr President, I would like to make two points, one of a moral nature and one of a legal nature, in this debate on a very sensitive issue, and link the two questions together."
"Embryos are human beings in their own right: this is now a certainty, and it is a certainty that we want to stress with all our might."
"The Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises the dignity of these rights – physical and psychological integrity – and there is therefore a moral obligation to protect embryos as human beings, irrespective of how they have been created."
"It therefore follows that experimentation is only justified when carried out in the interests of the individual or embryos in question, and there are no justifications or extenuating circumstances, which could serve to balance out the interests of the individual, the fundamental rights of the individual, and the interests of society."
"The issue goes beyond this kind of balancing out process because the protection of inalienable and fundamental rights certainly takes precedence."
"Thus, destructive experimentation is out of the question and, consequently, public funding is out of the question for experimentation which only endorses the line that embryos are a set of cells with no intrinsic value, with no bioethical value as human life."
"Stem cells, on the other hand, can be removed, as we have heard, from the umbilical chord or from spontaneously aborted foetuses of adult cells for use in the treatment of serious illnesses."
"Thus, moral responsibility dictates that we opt for this kind of investigation, these types of treatment."
"There are, however, more than just moral arguments; these moral arguments give rise to legal arguments, which the committee of which I have the honour of being chairman has pointed out and brought to Parliament’s attention."
"The Union respects national identity, and so I am pleased to hear the rapporteur say that we are not going to diminish Member States’ legislation or cultural diversity."
"Community law takes precedence over internal law and, therefore, over the basic law of the Member States."
"Community law, despite the fact that it takes precedence in other sectors, cannot exist in all areas of general law because there is a limit, as the Constitutional Courts – of Italy, Germany and many other countries – have said repeatedly, for fundamental rights must be respected and take precedence."
"Therefore, there is clearly no question of blanket Community funding – and we focused on this point in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I am speaking in this Chamber today in support of this line."
"Mr President, I welcome the remarkable work and flexible, astute approach of our rapporteur, Mr Liese, who, from a somewhat rigid starting position, from strong ethical principles, has endeavoured to achieve, with the support not only of myself but of the entire PPE-DE Group, as balanced a compromise as possible on a very sensitive subject, the use of human embryos and human embryonic stem cells in research projects under the Sixth Framework Programme."
"As a research scientist, of course, I can only support the progress of science, in the primary interest of patients who have, for years, been placing their hope in new technologies, as has been said, which may provide a cure for or control debilitating, sometimes irreversible diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal lesions which can cause paraplegia, tetraplegia, Alzheimer’s’ disease and so on."
"That is why I want to thank Commissioner Busquin for his prolific efforts to achieve what is, without a doubt, a difficult compromise."
"I have to say that, recently, at the specific request of the Italian Minister for Scientific Research, the Italian bioethics committee, chaired by Professor Francesco D’Agostino concluded that it was ethically legitimate to remove stem cells for therapeutic purposes from embryos which can no longer be implanted."
"The decision that we will be called upon to take in this Chamber only concerns the funding of the Sixth Framework Programme and, therefore, relates to a fairly short period of time."
"However, I have good reasons for thinking that the amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which provides for the funding of research using supernumerary cells, will not be unanimously endorsed by the Council, with the risk of a minority block and the extension of the current moratorium."
"This would be even more damaging to public research in Europe, which would remain in its current state of uncertainty and lack of regulation."
"This is why I drew up a new compromise proposal, in order to find some common ground between scientific demands and ethical principles: indeed, my proposal – put forward by the PPE-DE Group, moreover – on the one hand, bans the funding of research projects which provide for the use of human supernumerary embryos, and, on the other, allows research scientists to use in experiments stem cells and stem cell lines from human embryos which are already available in laboratories and which were taken from supernumerary embryos before 27 June 2002."
"I feel that, only in this way, can we make it possible for research scientists to proceed with preliminary comparative investigations, which are essential for the purposes of the future use – or non-use – of embryonic stem cells."
"I therefore hope that reason will prevail over emotion and prejudice in tomorrow’s vote in this Chamber, in the higher interest ofpatients’ health."
"Mr President, I agree with a lot of what has been said so far."
"This has been a difficult report which arouses strong emotions and we do not have a European consensus on the issue."
"The use of human embryos to create embryonic stem cell lines and embryonic stem cell research are contentious, but we have discussed the issues and have reached a useful consensus in the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I had to modify my views on the subject – which are quite liberal – in order for a consensus to be reached, and I know Mr Liese has modified his views too."
"However, I am now concerned that many amendments that were comprehensively defeated in the Industry Committee are being retabled."
"I appeal to colleagues to think again."
"We have quite a good compromise, which we should support."
"The vote in the Industry Committee was a reasonable and proper one."
"One or two amendments need to be addressed."
"A number of colleagues have sought to reintroduce a very restrictive deadline on the use of supernumerary embryos, which is a very serious problem."
"It means that, to create any new stem cell lines, you must use ageing supernumerary embryos which are not in the best condition."
"If you accept this restrictive deadline, more embryos are inevitably destroyed to create useful and viable stem cell lines."
"It means that if you restrict yourself to using just existing stem cell lines created before the date stated by Mr Nisticò and others, you will be confined to using ageing stem cell lines from the USA that have been made by using mouse-derived proteins and that are not suitable for treatments for human patients."
"This is the trap that the USA has fallen into and we should learn from that."
"We should also take note that research scientists are already leaving the USA for the UK and Asia to avoid the problems created by the introduction of a deadline."
"Personally, I would prefer that there should be no deadline, but I think that what the Commission proposes is the maximum practicable limit."
"The rapporteur says there is no immediate prospect of therapies being available to patients; if he gets this restrictive deadline reinstated, he may be right."
"I appeal to this Parliament to support the compromise proposed by the Industry Committee and not to support restrictive deadlines."
"Stem cell research will then bring relief to millions of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes sufferers, some of them known to us personally and some in fact colleagues in this House."
"Please vote for common sense tomorrow and on Wednesday."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is not about whether the European Union should permit research using stem cells and embryos."
"The position varies from one Member State to another and is a matter of subsidiarity, and we in this Parliament have no say whatever in the matter."
"We should concentrate on the question of whether the stem cell research that is carried out in EU Member States can be financed with funds from the sixth framework programme."
"In September 2002, this question was also the topic of negotiation between the Commission, Council and Parliament during the debates about the sixth framework programme."
"At that time, a compromise was reached, and Parliament voted in favour of it."
"Our position is therefore unambiguous."
"Thanks to the compromise, it is possible to finance stem cell research with Community funds in those Member States where such research is permitted."
"A moratorium has subsequently been imposed at the request of a few Member States; with effect from September 2003, European funding of stem cell research is frozen until the Commission tables a new proposal."
"This Commission proposal is now before us and I urge my fellow MEPs to give it their backing."
"After all, it is in line with our position of September 2002 and therefore provides consistency."
"Mr Liese, the rapporteur, has attempted to undermine Parliament's position in a scandalous manner by, during the discussion in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, tabling extremely restrictive amendments, which make embryonic research in the European Union virtually impossible."
"Indeed, not only has he introduced an end date, after which stem cell lines created before that date cannot be used, he has also limited the proposal's scope by permitting research only on existing stem cell lines."
"He has ruled out the development of new stem cell lines from supernumerary embryos, while it is in this very field that the EU should gain research experience."
"Fortunately, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has opted for consistency and has taken a stand against most of Mr Liese's amendments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if there is something particularly remarkable about our rapporteur Mr Liese, apart from his intelligence and the amount of work he does, it is surely his pugnacity."
"When we debated the sixth framework programme, he fought against all research on embryonic stem cells."
"He lost."
"When, a few weeks after Parliament’s vote, the Council of Ministers wrongfully froze the research funds set aside for this purpose, he inherited a report on the same subject and, while pretending to seek compromises, set about tabling amendments to prevent practically all research in this area."
"Roundly beaten in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, he left his name on a report that he wished to see rejected and that had been adopted against his advice."
"Mr Liese is, therefore, returning to plenary this evening with the same intentions."
"Faced with his efforts, there is only one reasonable and balanced way forward and that is to support the Commission’s compromise text, a text that is fairly close to the compromise that was agreed by our Parliament when it adopted the sixth framework programme."
"To do so, we need to vote against all those amendments that distort it by changing the scope of application."
"My position, summed up in three points, is as follows: firstly, to respect those who do not want this kind of research to be undertaken in their country; secondly, to refuse a European right to veto those who wish to, and indeed do, undertake this kind of research; thirdly, to restate our firm objective of funding research that seeks to save those suffering from incurable diseases and bring relief to those enduring intolerable pain."
"That then is the position that I am adopting this evening on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and the approach that we would like to see being taken."
"Mr President, I would like to start by taking a critical view of the bitter attack made upon Mr Liese, the rapporteur."
"If, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, it is so scandalous that someone should try to get this House to accept a different position, then you evidently have no idea what Parliament is meant to do."
"Our function must surely be to take up an independent position rather than being a mere extension of the Commission, and so I would like to take this opportunity of expressing warm thanks to Mr Liese."
"Today’s vote blazes a trail."
"Mr Liese was right to say that what we are not doing today is deciding whether or not we welcome research on stem cells or embryos."
"In my own group, too, there are different opinions on that, but we can quite clearly agree on one thing, namely that it is not acceptable that research involving the destruction of human embryos, which is illegal and punishable in many Member States, should be funded out of the EU’s tax revenue."
"For money to be invested in research projects that are illegal in the Member States in which they are carried out would be without parallel in the European Union."
"Being, like Mr Liese, from Germany, I can say that this, for Germany, is yet another quite remarkable situation."
"It is utterly unacceptable, Commissioner, and something that the German public cannot be expect to tolerate – particularly since we are net contributors – that German taxpayers should be coerced into co-financing one out of every five projects in the field of research using supernumerary human embryos, that is, research in the course of which embryos are destroyed, even though this is a criminal offence under German law."
"I think this is a problem for other countries in a similar way."
"Let me repeat, Commissioner, that you are sending out completely the wrong message!"
"You are rewarding the production of supernumerary embryos, which one might term a stock incentive."
"Your proposal reduces human embryos to the level of a biological raw material."
"There is something on which I ask you to elaborate, Commissioner, something that I find utterly inexplicable, and that is that I have heard that what we are talking about here is nine research projects out of 15 000."
"Just nine projects, and I ask myself why you are so vehement in their defence."
"I get the impression, Commissioner, that this is about something quite different, that what matters to you is ..."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate and to put on record – not for the first time – my concern regarding the ethical guidelines for research funding."
"It is my hope that we can avoid acrimonious debate and respect the right of Members to express freely their views on a subject that is complex, sensitive and, for many, a matter of conscience."
"Those of us who are not scientists must rely on the judgment and evaluation of professionally qualified people."
"The fact that there are so many diverse views and divisions amongst scientists must surely bring home to us legislators that this is not a clear-cut issue."
"Whether we like it or not, the Commission proposal, if carried, will allow experimentation with the very origin of human life and the destruction of human embryos."
"We have also seen in other areas what can happen through the abuse and misuse of science."
"To the extent that we are the custodians of the public interest in such a crucial area, we must act with extreme care and reflect and respect the views of our citizens."
"I do not want to see European Union funds being spent on a practice that is illegal in some countries, including my own country, Ireland, and also in Germany, Austria, Italy and Portugal."
"Such an act would be a clear infringement of subsidiarity."
"It is unfair, disingenuous and indeed misleading to say that those who oppose funding for stem cell research are preventing the discovery of cures for serious illnesses."
"Professionals more qualified than I have proven that this is not so."
"In a previous debate in this House I said that those who marvel at the wonderment of our creation must act now in the interests of mankind."
"That time is now."
"Mr President, is the European Union going to finance research involving human embryos, yes or no?"
"That is the crucial question."
"The essence of this topic is not so much monetary, as it is ethical – a discussion about good and bad."
"It is not so much about whether funding is good or bad, but about whether this research is good or bad ."
"That is what this is really about."
"When we debate the funding of stem cell research, why can we not simply state the fact that in many Member States, this research is not permitted, and that, consequently, we should not use Community funding in those countries?"
"What is wrong with this logic?"
"If it is not done in some Member States, fine, but it is a punishable offence in a number of others."
"How can we ask Member States to contribute to research to which they have fundamental objections?"
"Surely that is a slap in the face for those EU partners?"
"I am in favour of stem cell research."
"I consider it our duty to look for therapies for diseases that are still considered incurable."
"I am also in favour of the EU setting aside funds for this."
"However, and this is where, in my view, the issue of ethics comes in, this research should not be at the expense of other human life."
"Human life, at whatever stage of development, should never be used in a merely instrumental manner."
"The Commission proposal should therefore be rejected, not only because of the considerations of criminal law within the EU and of the destruction of human life, but also because it is not consistent with what has previously been agreed."
"The Council Minutes specify that the Commission will table a proposal in which further 'guidelines' are given for the decision-making principles concerning Community funding of research projects that involve human embryos and human embryonic stem cells."
"The proposal should therefore be about 'guidelines for principles for funding'."
"However, the Commission proposal is about 'conditions for funding'."
"That is quite different from 'guidelines for principles of funding'!"
"A principle could, for example, be: no European funds for research that leads to the destruction of human life."
"Another example of a principle is: in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, no funds for research that is prohibited in certain Member States."
"Another example from my Amendment 55: no funds for ethically objectionable research if less objectionable alternatives are available."
"Although the Commission claims otherwise, there are most definitely alternatives in the issue of stem cell research, namely research involving human somatic stem cells (so-called adult stem cells)."
"A research report was recently published on this topic by the Dutch Lindeboom Institute, in cooperation with the Israeli Business Ethics Center of Jerusalem."
"According to this report, which makes reference to dozens of scientific publications, the most recent scientific developments involving adult stem cells offer a wide range of possibilities for therapies of degenerative diseases that do not rely on research that involves the destruction of human embryos."
"These developments, I quote, ‘seem to indicate that embryonic stem cells are not essential for medical progress’."
"There are therefore alternatives to destroying human embryos."
"Finally, if this Parliament refuses to concentrate on the funding of only adult stem cell research, the Liese report’s approach still deserves a great deal of support."
"I would quote Amendment 61 to illustrate my point."
"Mr President, it is rather strange that Members of this House – such as Mr Hyland – should have accused those in favour of releasing funding for scientific research on embryonic stem cells and attempting to impose a scientific model on Europe, on the European Union and on Parliament."
"What is happening in Europe, with the national laws of some Member States, is exactly the opposite, namely that ethical prejudices are blocking research for all citizens, not just for those who wish to stand aloof from such research and its results on ethical grounds."
"The European Commission has produced a compromise, which is already at the very limit of acceptability for scientific reasons: the European Commission excludes funds for what is known as therapeutic cloning from Union funding."
"Why, however, if this funding can, as it genuinely can, provide the hope of treatment and of survival – I say the hope, not the certainty, for we in this House, unlike members of other parliaments, do not have scientific certainty – for millions of people in Europe?"
"The European Commission has already been forced to make compromises of an ethical and moral nature, as you call them, and to renounce this kind of funding."
"Fine, or rather it is not good at all, but now enough is enough: there need be no more constraints; there are no scientific grounds for imposing more limits."
"Then, as regards the issue of the date, the draft amendments state that stem cells – I am referring to Mr Nisticò’s proposal – must have been derived before 27 June 2002."
"Why, however?"
"What are the ethical grounds for using older embryos which are out of date from a scientific point of view?"
"Indeed, you do not give the scientific grounds."
"The reason which you give, namely that new embryos must not be produced, is, quite simply, ridiculous, for any research scientist will tell you that this problem does not exist."
"If scientific research were to be allowed, there would be no difficulty in obtaining embryos, nor would there be any need to produce them specifically for the purpose."
"There are tens of thousands of embryos in Italy and, I imagine, hundreds of thousands in Europe, which have been frozen and for which there is only one alternative to scientific research: the dustbin."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, believes that an embryo is a human being, then?"
"Does that mean we should consign that embryo-human being to the dustbin rather than using it for scientific research?"
"Let Mr Gargani and all the others try and save those hundreds of thousands of lives frozen in laboratory freezers!"
"This has nothing to do with science."
"An attempt is being made to impose an ethical and a moral principle, and this is being done – I am referring to those who are trying to table amendments which are even more limiting than the Commission’s proposal – by means of a device which we will not allow: setting up research on adult cells as an alternative to research on stem cells."
"Unlike you, we scientific research antiprohibitionists, do not know whether research on adult cells or research on embryonic cells will produce results first."
"We do not know and we do not claim to know, nor do we presume to tell Parliament that one kind of research is better than another: they are both valuable."
"We must proceed with both kinds of research, and the first to succeed in saving the lives of the citizens of Europe and the world will be the better."
"We do not claim to have this scientific knowledge, and it would be better if you did not either."
"We hope that the Italian Presidency of the European Union, which has been so respectful of the Union’s positions in failing to muster the courage to propose a moratorium on executions, will, at this juncture, seeing as this is the approach it has chosen to adopt, do the same where scientific research is concerned and not boycott the Busquin proposal."
"Let us open the door to funding for therapeutic cloning!"
"Mr President, research using supernumerary embryonic stem cells is necessary to bring closer the day when adult stem cells can be used therapeutically to cure 'dread diseases'."
"I am sure that goal is desired by everyone."
"Parliament's previous compromise was accepted by an absolute majority of this House."
"This restricts funding of research by the European Union only to embryos which are surplus to IVF requirements and are destined for destruction only at the undifferentiated stage of development up to 14 days and only in those jurisdictions where there is effective and strict regulation and it is permitted by law."
"This has yet again been adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I regret that our rapporteur has represented his own position, rather than that of the committee."
"The suggestion that the European Union cannot fund ventures that are not permitted in any one Member State opens an absurd and dangerous precedent."
"What about nuclear research and the growing of the tobacco?"
"I should like to tell Mrs Breyer that Germany permits research on embryos, even if German embryos are exempt."
"What is the purpose of a cut-off date?"
"If it is valid to use embryos produced before a date, can it be invalid to use embryos produced after that date?"
"An amendment by Mr Nisticò is flawed by the fact that it restricts itself to stem cell lines and not to embryos."
"Do we have so little trust in European IVF practitioners that they might be tempted to overproduce embryos for ulterior purposes?"
"That is surely an unjustified calumny on an honourable profession."
"Is it more Christian to walk by on the other side and leave our fellow human beings lying in the ditch on the road to Jericho, smitten by Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease or spinal injury?"
"God gave us humans inquiring minds, the ability to tame nature, the brains and skills to improve our lot on earth."
"Yes, we must respect human dignity and I completely respect my colleagues' strongly held views as to what human dignity is."
"However, I ask is it an early-stage embryo destined in any case for destruction, or is it your parents struck with Parkinson's Disease, or your teenage son paralysed with a broken neck?"
"The Research Committee's considered position – Amendment 10 – is a position we must support."
"We must persuade the Council of Ministers to do likewise."
"Mr President, this Parliament gave its views clearly during the reading on the Sixth Framework Programmes."
"Those views were reinforced by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy last week: we are in favour of the development of therapies for dreadful diseases by the use of embryonic stem cells under very strict conditions, with no creation of embryos for research, with the use of supernumerary embryos, with the consent of parents and without payment."
"I regret the intolerant anti-European rejection of subsidiarity by some colleagues this afternoon."
"We believe that the exploration of other forms of stem cell, and indeed comparisons, are essential."
"Now to the matter of dates. I regret that the Commission chose to introduce a date, because it has encouraged some Members of this Parliament to put forward even more absurd dates."
"This has been done in a rather sly, hypocritical and misleading way in that not simply different dates, but also different procedures – with stem cell lines and not with embryos – have been proposed."
"The hypocrisy of those amendments should be exposed so that Members are absolutely clear on what they are voting."
"I have a direct question for the Commissioner."
"Is it true that the dates suggested by Mr Nisticò and others would drastically reduce the availability of stem cell lines to make the European Union totally dependent on the United States, Israel and other countries for lines under patent?"
"Would this damage European Union science and, most importantly of all, would it damage the prospects of helping people who are suffering from terrible diseases?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wrote the draft opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Because the majority of the committee differs from the majority in Parliament and because the right is considerably over-represented, the opinion took, however, a form I was unable to accept."
"I did not, therefore, want my name to appear on it."
"My legal analysis differs totally from that presented by the committee chairman, Mr Gargani."
"Firstly, there are no obstacles to this research under the Oviedo Convention."
"Secondly, I have to say that Mr Gargani’s analysis of what the research programmes mean in legal terms was also completely irrelevant."
"It was a very long way from the truth."
"I also observe in my proposal that the European Group for Ethics, of which the Commission and ourselves can make use, has not excluded embryonic stem cell research."
"What is the point of an advisory group if we do not listen to it?"
"For me, as for many others, the most important ethical issue is about reducing human suffering."
"That is something we can do if, in regulated and open ways, we try to cooperate and to do what many speakers have said we must in order to reduce suffering through diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s."
"We must have public funding, and the funding must be European if the results are to be made available to all Europeans."
"I should, however, have liked to have seen the time limit removed from the Commission’s proposal."
"It is not justified on ethical grounds."
"I view with great satisfaction the committee’s Amendment 11 about removing the demand that all alternative methods must have been examined."
"It leaves room for a very great deal of arbitrariness, and I support what has been said by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Bowe and others."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yes!"
"Yes to research."
"I remember the temporary committee on human genetics; yes to research and yes to the compromises reached in the sixth framework programme."
"And then we perhaps need to talk about something that no one has yet mentioned, even though I have been listening to the debate from the outset."
"There are those who are here to criticise this research and reject it because of something that has remained unsaid and that I am going to say out loud now."
"It is almost a vulgarity; it is the word ‘abortion’."
"There are some here who are refusing to support this research in a bid to fight against abortion."
"It is all very well to talk about suffering, Parkinson’s disease and so on, but I would also like to talk about this issue, because it concerns women’s rights."
"There are two aspects to this."
"Firstly, research on stem cells is not an ethical battle over whether or not there is a right to abortion in European countries."
"Secondly, however, men and women are not on an equal footing where embryonic stem cells are concerned."
"I would be glad if someone other than myself were to say this in this House."
"There are a whole series of amendments, Commissioner, that seek to ensure that this is not a source of financial gain, and that you reject it on the basis of Article 152 on the grounds that this is not within the competence of the European Union and our institutions."
"In fact, I might remind you that Article 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that the human body cannot be a source of financial gain, and I would also remind you that this charter will – as, I hope, all of us here wish – be incorporated in the constitution very soon."
"Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that, even though embryonic stem cells do after all affect first and foremost women, and what women carry within them, there is no question of their becoming research instruments, economically speaking."
"This is not to be a source of financial gain."
"Even though we might think that it is not up to us to say it, I nevertheless believe that we should confront this fundamental and historically significant issue."
"Mr President, I am just taking over the minute allotted to my colleague Mrs Ahern, who has unfortunately been unable to get here on time."
"I have to ask you again, Commissioner, whether it is true, as we have been informed, that this has to do with only nine of the 15 000 projects forming part of the Biomed programme?"
"If this is just about these few projects that we are discussing with such passion, then I cannot repress the suspicion that this is an un-called for attempt at making embryo research respectable in the EU."
"All the Member States that want to engage in this sort of research, and which has passed legislation permitting it, can do so, but without funding from the European Union."
"I get the impression that your concern is with something else, that this is about preparing to breach an ethical dam and open the door to research on embryos."
"If this is just about these few projects, then I ask myself why you are doing this and thereby needlessly bringing discredit on the Research Programme as a whole?"
"I can tell you right now that, although I hope it will not happen, if a majority in this House supports research involving the destruction of human embryos, then that will have to be tested against European and constitutional law."
"In Member States such as Austria and Ireland, it is a criminal offence, and it is not acceptable for something punishable within the European Union to receive funding from it."
"This amounts to a major problem for European and constitutional law."
"A few final words on stem cell research."
"Why the dates?"
"What matters to us – if this fallback position …"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate can clearly not avoid the basic issue and fail to deal with the fundamental ethical problems, even though they are not what we are here to discuss and decide on now."
"If they were the issue, I would happily say to Mr Cappato – who criticised national legislation banning this type of research for being prejudiced – that there is no prejudice here; this word is always used as a smokescreen when there is disagreement."
"This is a principle, not a prejudice – the principle that an embryo has human life."
"More than this, it is a known fact and recognition of this fact."
"This is not, however, what we are here to discuss."
"As various speakers have stated, we are only looking at the issue of European funding for this type of research."
"On this point I fully agree with Mr Bowe, who holds a completely different view of the basic issue."
"He said – and I agree with him – that there is no European consensus on this issue and because there is no European consensus there can be no European funding in this area."
"That and that alone is the issue at stake."
"Otherwise, we will be breaching the principle of subsidiarity, which we believe must be scrupulously observed."
"If there are Member States that wish to undertake this type of research, then let them. If it is legal in their countries, let them, but let them do so with their own financial resources."
"Using Community funds, particularly funds contributed by citizens in countries where such procedures are illegal and are even prohibited by law, would constitute a breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This would constitute a financial breach of the substance of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is basically what we are fighting for in this debate, although we are happy to engage in ethical debate if necessary."
"We must emphasise, however, that this is not the real issue."
"Furthermore, I wish to add my voice to those of my fellow Members who are calling for greater priority and greater investment to be given to research into adult stem cells."
"I urge the House to support the amendments tabled by Mr Gargani, which express the opinion adopted by a majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"– Mr President, the debate on the use of stem cells in research has to be based on fact and steered away from emotional argument."
"Talk of life and death distort reality."
"Stem cell research is only a question of life, as research can help save countless lives each year."
"For this reason EU funding must in future be targeted at stem cell research."
"As the Commission proposal also states, stem cell research is expected to play an essential role in promoting the development of forms of treatment in many areas of medicine."
"This applies in particular to the treatment of various degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease but also to more common diseases such as diabetes, the number of cases of which has rocketed."
"For Europe to be able to exploit stem cells successfully in the future the most important thing now is to set aside adequate resources for basic research into stem cells and furthermore permit the funding of embryonic stem cell research under the Sixth Framework Programme."
"This will ensure that research in the field can make progress within a regulated framework and that European researchers and ultimately patient groups can benefit immediately from new knowledge and skills in the field."
"If the use of stem cells is not permitted under the constitutions of some EU Member States, that must not be a barrier to research, and the benefits obtained from it as a result, in other EU countries."
"I am against artificial deadlines."
"It is wrong to set dates before and after which stem cells can be used."
"Of course ethical principles and technical safety measures have to be complied with, but now, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of cells that will be destroyed in any case."
"In any case, we have to use our common sense in this matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the revolutionary technique of therapeutic cloning echoes to a large extent man’s ancient dreams and myths."
"Therapeutic cloning opens up a whole new area for human knowledge and medicine."
"Dogmatic attitudes in this field, particularly those based on the Bible, are therefore pernicious."
"They demonstrate little concern for the reality of people’s lives."
"Loyalty to beliefs and to their origins is their ."
"We all agree with the universal ban on reproductive cloning but this does not mean that it is a taboo subject and that it should be likened to devil-worship, which is what we are seeing at the moment."
"Only recently, an extremely eminent French philosopher, Marcel Conche, in a book entitled ‘Confession of a philosopher’ which is a dialogue with André Compte-Sponville, claimed provocatively that the right to be cloned, provided, of course, that it is subject to strict rules is – would you believe – a fundamental right."
"I do not share this view, but it is a fine exercise in intellectual freedom."
"Those who would like to ban cloning outright but are unable to achieve this are putting so many obstacles and barriers in its way that research will be completely stifled."
"We cannot accept such a blatant strategy."
"Unlike Mr Lisi, I see no good reason for completely excluding Community funding from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research ‘Research using embryonic stem cells’."
"It should be emphasised that, even today, it is impossible to tell which stem cells, those derived from embryos, from foetuses or adults, best meet the needs of fundamental research and clinical applications."
"The answers clearly lie in undertaking scientific research and in the freedom given to scientists and researchers."
"– Mr President, given the way that society is currently organised, where economic decisions are determined by profit, I do not trust the way in which industrial groups use scientific discoveries."
"But it is not the freedom to research that poses a problem, because research is what leads to human progress."
"We do not accept that the most reactionary pressure groups should be able to censure research on the grounds of religious interdicts or for whatever obscurantist reason it might be."
"We will therefore be voting against any amendment that seeks, on pseudo-ethical grounds, to ban research on stem cells from supernumerary embryos."
"Citing respect for life as a reason to oppose research on a mass of embryonic cells is all the more unacceptable because it prohibits therapeutic advances – and these have been made – that make it possible simply to save lives."
"In addition, these objections sometimes come from political movements that are apologists for the most odious wars, when it is not stem cells that are destroyed but actual human beings."
"I will finish by saying that in France, scientists have just demonstrated in protest at cuts in research funding."
"I support their protests."
"If there is not enough money for research, we should take some from the defence budget, which, conversely, is steadily rising."
"Mr President, as has already been said here, a couple of years ago, when we held the debate on the Sixth Framework Programme, a compromise solution was reached on the conditions under which research on stem cells could be funded."
"Let there be no doubt that this was a compromise solution between those people, such as myself, who preferred a more open and liberal position and others who advocated more restrictive solutions."
"Consequently, now that we are debating the issue once again, it does not appear logical that that compromise solution should be considered an extremist position and that other parties, opposed to research on stem cells, should tell us: let us now seek a compromise between that solution and our position, which, at the end of the day, means rejecting any possibility of funding research with stem cells."
"No, Mr President, this is not a good system."
"It is a form of subterfuge aimed at hindering the European funding of research with stem cells, when there are many countries which allow it, because there are significant sectors of the scientific community and of the social community in general which believe that researching with stem cells can lead to great progress in the fight against the extremely serious diseases which devastate us today."
"I believe that this way of working is not worthy of the European Parliament."
"It could have been said – and this would seem logical – that, since it is exclusively a question of funding, the funding would be allowed."
"Mr Ribeiro mentioned the principle of subsidiarity, well, let us accept it."
"We could say: European funding is allowed in all countries which allow research with stem cells."
"Under what conditions?"
"Under those allowed in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity in those countries."
"Nevertheless, rather than maintaining this position, we have upheld the agreement which was reached on the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Let us not now aim, as a result of intolerance, not just to destroy the European Area of Research, but also to prevent and hinder successful research in this area in the countries where it is allowed."
"Mr President, I had the privilege of serving on the human genetics temporary committee in 2001."
"I recall that the House was completely polarised on that issue."
"The rapporteur produced a compromise that neither side, in the end, was prepared to vote for."
"Therefore we must recognise that there are widely different opinions honestly held in this House."
"Mr Blokland tells us that the issue is simply one of right or wrong."
"However, with respect Mr Blokland, it is a question of your opinion of right and wrong."
"Other colleagues in this House take a different view of what is right and wrong."
"I know that there are Members who hold strong religious views."
"For example, our rapporteur, Mr Liese, has strong religious views."
"However, I would say to Mr Liese and those who think like him that they have no right to impose their particular views on the whole of European society through the means of legislation."
"There are third countries where religious fundamentalists seek to impose religious laws on the whole of society."
"Most of us in this House would condemn that practice and yet some of us are seeking to do it here."
"Many colleagues propose alternative research methods – for example, that we should use adult stem cells."
"Most of us are not scientific experts."
"This is not an issue which we are able to judge."
"It is an issue which we should allow scientists to judge in order to make the best decisions in the interests of research."
"If we are serious about promoting research in the European Union, if we are serious about promoting the economy of European Union Member States, then we should not support these backward-looking amendments that seek to restrict research in this way."
"Mr President, I have a question for the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, I really do not want to provoke you, but your answer does give me real cause for concern."
"Amendment 18 states that, ‘In addition, research on embryo or foetal stem cells deriving from spontaneous or therapeutic abortion may be funded.’"
"Rumours have it that the Commission is already doing something of the kind."
"You see, abortion is legal – up to the third month in Austria."
"By then, the child’s heart is already beating."
"If the child is handicapped, whether mentally or physically, it can be aborted up to the ninth month."
"Will there be some point at which we say that we want to save life, even if the child had to die anyway?"
"Will we also do that with a three-month old child whose heart is beating, or with a nine-month-old child whose death is inevitable?"
"Abortion is carried out quite legally."
"You know, the reason why I find these arguments so horrifying is that I heard them a number of years ago when a former Nazi doctor was on trial in Vienna."
"During the Nazi era, he carried out experiments on children with serious mental handicaps."
"The argument by which he justified his actions was that these children would have to die anyway, and that he wanted to help other people."
"Let me say something to Mr Cappato."
"My dear Mr Cappato, you are such a charming chap!"
"Even at the moment that your mother’s ovum came together with your father’s sperm, even when you were a tiny embryo, you were just as charming, just as handsome as you are now, your voice was as easy on the ear as it is today."
"You were already unique."
"Never before had you had the chance to come into the world, and never again will there be another Marco Cappato."
"Even as an embryo, you were already a personality."
"And Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, you have a little baby!"
"This baby was an embryo, and it was your baby."
"Your child’s laughter, the colour of its skin and eyes, all were already present in the embryo."
"I do not believe that anyone would say they were prepared to sacrifice their own child, even only as an embryo, for the sake of saving someone else."
"Mr President, I was against the compromise reached by Parliament on this issue at the time, and I am against the Commission's proposal today as well and, consequently, the Liese report."
"And there are procedural reasons for this, because I believe, in agreement with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that within the framework of the internal market and since there is freedom of establishment, Community funds cannot be used to finance research which is not permitted in some Member States."
"Above all, however, I am against this for reasons of principle, because I am against any research which involves destroying a life, however incipient it may be and however noble the intended aims of this research are."
"All lives, regardless of their stage of development, have the same value and we cannot save some lives at the expense of others because, although the life being destroyed is embryonic, it is a life just the same."
"I agree that research has to be promoted, in particular if the aim is the well-being of patients suffering from serious diseases, and I am in favour of freedom of research but we must always fully respect human life and the dignity it deserves."
"The possibilities opened up by research with adult stem cells are very hopeful and much closer."
"Very positive results have already been achieved."
"Let us therefore focus the programmes’ funds on this type of research, which, furthermore, does not pose any ethical problem."
"Because, however many time limits we set, however many ethical principles we establish to justify this research, the destruction of an embryonic life represents a clear violation of the most fundamental of these principles, these principles which we say we defend and which we do defend: respect for human life and the dignity it deserves."
"Mr President, as parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent in keeping with the laws and the constitutions of our sovereign Member States."
"We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended."
"It is unacceptable for human life, whatever its age, to be treated as a commercial product, without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos."
"It is deeply disturbing that the European Commission, supported by Members of this Parliament and certain Member State governments, is seeking to impose public funding of controversial and unethical research without proper public debate and without the opportunity for national parliaments to respond."
"There has certainly been no debate in Dáil Éireann."
"This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions, but also the conscience of millions of citizens."
"It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research."
"This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and, as our rapporteur has pointed out, is high-risk."
"Let us not play on the hopes and fears of sufferers."
"Let us use public funding for adult stem cell research, which has positive scientific results and may be as effective as research using embryonic stem cells."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rejected the Commission's proposal and I urge support for the amendments tabled by its chairman, Mr Gargani, which I have co-signed with other Members."
"Last week a key committee in the Irish Parliament also voted to reject this unethical research."
"There is a public outcry in Ireland."
"Tánaiste Mary Harney and the Irish Government have no mandate to agree this funding on behalf of Irish citizens."
"Just as there was no public mandate for an EU Constitution, there was clearly no mandate for this unconstitutional and unethical use of taxpayers' money."
"Mr President, there is one fundamental reason why this debate becomes heated at times."
"It would be very easy to draw on legal arguments."
"Many Members have already raised the basic question: can the European Union, with great difficulty, adopt an initiative, which does not have backing in all the Member States of the Union?"
"That would be one of the many possible – if you will forgive the expression – hypocritical approaches to the issue."
"On this matter, there is a basic problem, which politics cannot resolve: politics is the art of the possible and, without a doubt, the art of compromise, but compromise on fundamental values is impossible."
"Therefore, on this matter, with due regard for the positions of all the Members and with due regard for the positions expressed by the Commission, all the attempts that have been made thus far seek to open the door to a new process, and that process involves tampering with the principle of life."
"For some, this path is completely acceptable, and for others it is a path which is not acceptable because it runs counter to certain fundamental values."
"That is why, as I see it, none of the attempts at compromise that have been made – although I commend the wisdom, ability and capacity of the Members – has achieved the ultimate goal."
"As regards the process in question, I would draw your attention not so much to the initial phase, the phase we are experiencing now, which is extremely important because the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases is at stake, but to what will happen when we have decided to meddle with life: not in the short term, that is, but in the medium and long terms, and these are all questions of eugenics."
"We are going the same way as we did with the atom: in exploring the possibilities of the atom we made the atom bomb, and now we need rules to take us back a step."
"At this juncture, therefore, on a matter such as this, which is much more complex and much more sensitive, there may well be a need for further reflection."
". Mr President, my group has given me another two minutes, and so I can deal with a number of the questions put by some of my fellow-Members."
"For a start, it is unfortunate that not only the Commissioner, but also a number of Members of this House have asserted that the adoption of Mr Nisticò’s proposal would make research impossible or – to put the charge in a diluted form – that we would then be entirely dependent on the United States."
"Can you confirm, Commissioner, that Sweden is situated in Europe rather than in the USA?"
"Most of the stem cell lines listed in the NIH register come from Sweden."
"I once took the trouble to consult the people who manufactured them."
"Let me quote from Professor Lars Hamberger, whose unequivocal response, in an e-mail, to the question as to whether these stem cell lines were available to European researchers was as follows: ‘At present, we have 24 stem cell lines, out of which 20 are relatively well characterised."
"In the case that European researchers want to get access to these cell lines they can apply to us, and if the respective country laws and regulations permit export we can arrange, and we have already distributed a few cell lines to Europe.’"
"So these cells are available; I have had similar answers from the other institutes."
"Mr Nisticò has again drawn my attention to the fact that his proposal actually goes further than the Americans’."
"This is not just about cells, but about cell lines and a later date, so I ask you to desist from asserting that all research would be made impossible."
"Let me conclude with a thought that I ask Members of this House to take on board."
"Many of us have mutually contradictory interpretations of what subsidiarity means."
"I ask you, though, to imagine for one brief moment that we are dealing with a different type of research, for example, research involving cruelty to animals, specifically primates or anthropoid apes."
"In that event, I think the arguments would be reversed."
"What is absolutely vital here is that, day after day, the Commission says ‘no’ to research projects."
"I agree with Mr Linkohr that we must make more funding available for research, but, for as long as we are unable to fund uncontroversial projects, we have to think even more carefully than the Commission suggests about why we want to support controversial ones."
"For that reason, I believe that Mr Nisticò’s proposal really is a good compromise."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to correct a misconception about the Irish Constitution which, it has been alleged, bans embryo research in Ireland."
"The Irish Constitution is in fact silent on the matter, as indeed is Irish law."
"The Irish Constitution does indeed ban abortion, but it provides for exceptions."
"The issue is not as black and white as it is being presented."
"That was a point of clarification rather than a point of order."
"Mr President, regarding the order in which amendments would be voted, I would suggest that when we look at those amendments referring to the date we take first those furthest away from the Commission's proposal, which includes a date."
"Those would be Amendment 68 from Mr Bowe and others, followed by Amendments 10, 64, 25 and 24."
"That would be a more logical order, given that they are furthest away from the Commission's suggestion."
"I hope the voting lists can be changed along those lines."
"I will make sure that the services concerned are aware of your suggestion."
"Mr President, there is talk here and there about information from Stockholm and Sweden concerning how many stem cell lines there are."
"I wonder about the date to which the answer obtained by Mr Liese is relevant."
"A lot has happened since 2002."
"I have received an answer from the Carolingian Institute to the effect that they only have three well-characterised stem cell lines now available to them."
"That is significantly fewer."
"I hope that the Commission discriminates according to date in this area."
"– Mr President, the Commission does of course attach great importance to your work and has taken a keen interest in it; it has also examined your amendments closely."
"It was pleased to see that, at the vote in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, a clear majority emerged in favour of providing Community funding for research projects involving the procurement of human embryonic stem cells from supernumerary embryos and therefore the creation of new lines."
"This is an important point in support of research which will in all likelihood have beneficial effects on the treatment of major health problems."
"The Commission does, however, have some difficulties with those amendments that seek to remove the 27 June 2002 cut-off date for the creation of supernumerary embryos, as proposed by the Commission on 9 July."
"I acknowledge the fact that this date has no scientific basis: it is simply linked to when the framework programme was adopted."
"In effect, the Commission, like Parliament for that matter, had gone along with the majority at the vote on the framework programme and that is why this date has been taken as a reference date."
"Furthermore, this proposal should be seen, as Mr Bowe said, as a compromise gesture, a signal to those who want – and I understand this, as it is quite legitimate to hold a different opinion on the subject – to prevent in vitro fertilisation being diverted from its objectives and being used to create embryos for research."
"We have always said very clearly that we do not want embryos to be produced specifically for research purposes."
"The aim of including this date is then to show that we are not encouraging the creation of embryos for research purposes, but that existing supernumerary embryos may clearly be used for research because, as several Members have said, they are no longer part of a parental project."
"On this basis, the Commission is able to accept a majority of the amendments, which are I might add excellent, thanks to the work done by the rapporteur and the whole of the committee."
"The amendments concerned are Amendments 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18, either in full or in part, subject in some cases to their being redrafted."
"These amendments clarify the content of the proposal and thus correspond, as Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel stressed, to the position agreed by Parliament when the framework programme was adopted."
"I would remind you that Parliament’s proposal was also based on the opinion of the European Group of Ethics, which had set out what could be done."
"In response to Mrs Breyer, I would add, along the lines of what I have just said, that the fact that there have not been many expressions of interest – nine so far – was to be expected, because generally speaking there are few really competent research teams working in new research areas."
"Moreover, it is better that this be the case, because in an area like this it is genuinely competent teams that we need, which can provide a maximum guarantee that the dossiers will be dealt with ethically."
"The Commission cannot however accept Amendments 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 16 and 19, in particular because they seek to remove the date fixed for the reasons that I have just explained."
"We wanted to produce a compromise and we wish to keep this date."
"This applies, amongst others, to Amendments 5 and 10, which delete the reference to this date."
"Amendment 11 removes a condition from the Commission proposal."
"I will take this opportunity to stress the conditions, because much has been said about different methods, in particular those that use adult cells or cells from the umbilical cord."
"In this regard, we state very clearly, in the point deleted by Amendment 11, that we need to ensure that all other alternative methods have been examined and demonstrated not to be sufficient for the purposes of the research in question."
"This is also a signal to those who are not in favour of these research developments."
"This type of research will only be developed if it really is a solution that is scientifically proven to be necessary."
"In other words, many scientists, including those who are not, from an ethical point of view, in favour of research on supernumerary embryonic stem cells – like some of the professors who took part in our meetings – have to recognise that this method is worth exploring, that it complements research on adult stem cells and that it should not be ruled out."
"I would like to finish with the amendments that Mr Nisticò has tabled here in plenary."
"I recognise that Mr Nisticò always goes to great lengths to reach a compromise."
"I might add that he made a similar effort at the parliamentary vote in June 2002, because it was his amendment around which the consensus was built that formed the basis for the Commission proposal."
"Mr Nisticò, the amendments that you have tabled here are not entirely neutral, however, and this also answers Mrs McNally’s question."
"When you link cells and supernumerary embryos with cells and lines already in existence before 27 June 2002, you put a total restriction on research."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear – for the sake of Mr Liese, who is obviously very familiar with the dossier, but sometimes confuses the different concepts, lines and dates – that, on 27 June 2002, there were no stem cell lines in existence in Europe, at least formally speaking."
"The existing European stem cell lines appeared later in Sweden."
"In response to Mrs Thors, I would say that you can ask the researchers in Karolinska; three lines turned up there sometime after September 2003."
"If you incorporate this amendment, you will therefore create the following problem: the only stem cell lines that were in existence before 27 June 2002 are in American, Israeli and Asian hands."
"This means that you are linking them to trade mechanisms, because the American lines are available but under commercial contract."
"You would not give Europe the slightest possibility of developing this type of research, which is worthwhile; you would not allow Europe to move from embryo lines to existing stem cell lines."
"Today there are more of them in existence."
"There are two in the United Kingdom and seven in Sweden (three in Karolinska and four in Gothenburg), but they appeared after 27 June 2002."
"You are therefore putting Europe at a disadvantage in two respects: in terms of scientific value and also because of the fact that the lines from before 27 June 2002 are sold on the open market."
"This is therefore completely contrary to the spirit of what many people have in mind, which is for that matter what the Commission also has in mind: under no circumstances can supernumerary embryos be a source of profit."
"I cannot be clearer than that."
"We do not want stem cell lines to become marketable commodities; they should simply be made available to the European scientific community."
"At present, they are not available to the European scientific community, except in exchange for payment."
"They are also being imported into Germany."
"Research is being carried out on imported stem cells that have been traded."
"I have every respect for differences in ethical views, but your line of argument does not hang together."
"Your reasoning is internally consistent when you say that you do not want research on supernumerary embryos."
"That is consistent."
"But you cannot link this to a date; the date is a symbolic gesture, a compromise, so as not to encourage the creation of supernumerary embryos and stem cell lines."
"That is totally contradictory and runs completely counter to high-quality research at European level, quite apart from the fact that it does not resolve the ethical problem either."
"We could not accept this amendment if it were to be adopted in plenary."
"I am quite happy for you to try to find solutions, but this one does not make any sense."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its work on this difficult and sensitive dossier, which affects each one of us and indeed life itself."
"I understand that there are differences of opinion."
"That is a sign of Europe’s greatness."
"But there is also a value: research."
"The purpose of the Commission’s proposal was to try to respond, as has been said, to a concern expressed both by Parliament and the Council of Ministers at its meeting of 20 September 2002."
"The Commission has worked to provide a framework for this research with strong, consistent ethical rules, in such a way that fundamental principles can also be defended in this area."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"No scientific evaluation justifies research on embryonic stem cells and researchers have said that using these cells for therapeutic purposes has proved unsuccessful."
"Nevertheless, alternative methods, such as adult stem cells, offer very promising results."
"Two comments must be made on the argument, which enables this fundamental research on embryonic cells to include adult stem cells."
"First and foremost, existing cell lines are sufficient and this is the proposal by Mr Liese."
"Then, it ignores the fact that the purpose of adult stem cells is to repair tissue on the patients themselves, whilst the purpose of embryonic stem cells is to follow the development of the human being from conception onwards."
"The Commission proposal is ambiguous and inappropriate since scientists do not promise any results for 10 to 15 years and this research does not match the urgency of the needs of patients who are suffering while they wait for a treatment to be found."
"We need to prioritise funding for research into adult stem cells, the only alternative method which does not raise ethical issues and which is a technique that has been approved by all Members."
"I will not support the Commission proposal amended by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and I will vote in favour of the Gargani amendment, to which I also added my name."
"The next item is the report (A5-0389/2003) by Mr Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on Investing in research: an action plan for Europe [COM(2003) 226 – C5-0381/2003 – 2003/2148(INI)]."
"Mr President, my report is less controversial, but, I believe, no less significant."
"It makes the simple claim that Europe must invest more in research."
"The proportion of Europe’s gross domestic product devoted to research expenditure is to increase to 3% by 2010; one-third must be raised from public funds, and two-thirds to be contributed by industry."
"Only in this way can the European Union become the most competitive region in the world, which is what Europe’s Heads of State or Government called for in Lisbon as many as three years ago."
"The Commission endorses this call and has calculated that, by 2010, industry’s expenditure on research will have to increase by 9% per annum, and the public contribution by 6% per annum, if this target is to be reached."
"We are nowhere near doing that."
"Even though the EU is more populous, the USA spends USD 140 billion more every year on research; the National Institute of Health, which deals solely with medicine as a life science, has USD 28 billion at its disposal – more than the whole of the rest of the world spends in this field."
"Its budget has doubled over the past five years, and, in 2004, it will be getting another billion dollars, itself equivalent to over two-thirds of the budget of the German Research Foundation."
"The National Science Foundation will also have its funding increased by 6%."
"The USA is not alone, though, in increasing its expenditure on research, which is already at a high level;"
"Japan has sharply increased its spending on research, even though its economy is flagging."
"In 1997, all parties in the Japanese parliament joined in taking the initiative in adopting a ten-year plan, with substantial rates of increase to encourage young scientists."
"Canada, which was facing economic recession some years ago, has consciously invested in science and technology and is now reaping the economic rewards of its efforts."
"In the past year alone, the sum of CAD 800 million was made available for the purpose of attracting foreign professors to the country."
"In Europe, by contrast, spending has been static and has, in some countries, even been reduced; despite all their pious utterances, most EU countries are cutting back on education and research."
"Fewer and fewer students are interested in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology."
"Enterprises are moving their research to the USA."
"UNICE is already talking in terms of the threat of de-industrialisation."
"To be sure, there are exceptions: Sweden and Finland are showing us what everyone should be doing."
"Why is it, though, that it is the larger countries that are neglecting research?"
"I have just received a letter from Italy, where a competition was held to appoint 1 600 scientists to university posts."
"They have now spent two whole years waiting to be appointed because the funding has not been made available."
"Surely, though, this cannot be just about money; after all, we spend a lot of money on subsidising all sorts of things, including EUR 900 million from our budget for tobacco cultivation alone."
"It is evident that what we lack is not money but the right priorities; it is in the past that we invest rather than in the future."
"What is to be done?"
"We have to change course, or else our repeatedly calling for a knowledge-based society in Europe will become a sad joke, and then nobody will take the EU seriously any more."
"It will be seen as a tired and enfeebled colossus, a continent filled with boastful babble, fragile and old, nothing more than a historical museum."
"I therefore have three demands to make in the hope that Parliament, the Commission and Council will endorse them."
"Firstly, there must be an increase in private-sector expenditure on research; a rate of increase of 9% per annum would be feasible if we were to do as the Commission communication on research policy recommends."
"To do that, we have to try every incentive, including tax exemption."
"Secondly, we have to increase public expenditure."
"What this means for the EU’s research budget is that the Seventh Research Framework Programme must run to at least EUR 30 billion."
"I might add, by the way, that this figure corresponds to the annual increase of 6% for public-sector research expenditure that I have called for and takes account of the growth in the EU’s size."
"Thirdly, the EU should act on the advice of the scientific organisations and set up a European Research Council, from whose resources basic research would be funded."
"If we are to change course, the new policy has to be set out, so I suggest that we hold, before the European elections, a European Scientific Congress in Brussels or Strasbourg."
"Enough has been written, enough has been said; the Commission, too, has presented a convincing document."
"Enough of statements of intent; now is the time for action."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Linkohr who, naturally as rapporteur, carried out a very important task and who has, for a long time, been familiar with the issue."
"This is a very high-quality report, which is entirely worthy of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its members."
"Once again this report shows, and I am delighted about this, the importance that Parliament attaches to research and innovation."
"What is also very important is that this is a growing phenomenon."
"The Council of Ministers now regularly discusses research and innovation."
"The Growth Initiative introduced research and innovation as a key element of European growth."
"In the same way, knowledge production has – and this is quite logical – become a major political priority in the knowledge-based society."
"This is why, moreover, the 3% objective, which was discussed here in Parliament, was also adopted by the Council of Ministers and must be implemented."
"Mr Linkohr did, however, quite rightly mention that, in order to implement the 3% objective, an average increase of at least 8% is necessary, 9% for the private sector and 6% for the public sector."
"It is a good idea to repeat these figures regularly if we want to take up the challenge."
"The actions proposed in the action plan are aimed at many aspects, in particular creating a more favourable environment for private investment as well as in research and that regards, in particular, the areas of competition, intellectual property, the regulatory environment, financial markets and taxation."
"Nor must we forget however, as you stressed, the issue of public support for research and innovation, which remains essential, as does, of course, the whole issue of fundamental research, and I will return to this after the speeches – which will no doubt provide some responses – on this European Research Council which is being discussed and formed."
"There is, of course, also a process and the action plan is the start of the process."
"There is no time to lose."
"Fundamentally, I believe that we need, once and for all, to not see research as an expense, but rather as a priority investment for the future of Europe."
"I think that this is the key element in the approach and I feel that, with the joint action by Parliament, the scientific community, and industry, there is greater and greater awareness that this is a question of life and death for Europe, in economic and social terms."
"I would like to thank you Mr Linkohr, and all of the Members too, for having given your backing to these issues and I hope that the next time I speak, I will of course be replying to more specific aspects of what has just been presented to you."
"– Mr President, I would sincerely like to thank my colleague, Rolf Linkohr, for his commendable work in this important matter."
"There is consensus in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy regarding the fact that research funding in the EU should be increased significantly and promptly."
"Thus, on the threshold of enlargement it would be good to come up with some clear figures in addition to all the fine words."
"The final sum for the Seventh Framework Programme has to be EUR 30 billion."
"A smaller investment will not bring the same benefit."
"One of Europe’s weaknesses has been insufficient SME involvement in research."
"Statistical illusion also has a part in this."
"The most important tool in Europe to achieve the 3% target is companies and in particular SMEs."
"At present, companies are doing much innovative work that is not statistically recorded at all as Research and Development and it cannot even be supported through the various public aid instruments."
"The reason for this is that the notion of innovation is vague, the rules can be interpreted in many ways, and, consequently, there is uncertainty over the fairness of the system."
"For this reason, it is this area that needs improving, because SMEs are often particularly innovative."
"They are also a driving force behind any kind of growth and the creation of new jobs."
"Market-oriented research support for SMEs should be encouraged through special funding."
"Forms of public intervention, be they tax advantages or direct subsidies, must not, however, influence what types of subsidy are approved nor the permitted intensity of aid granted."
"Member States should in future be free to devise their own policies so as to ensure that the competition rules which are within the Community’s competence are neutral in relation to the choice of instruments."
"The establishment of a European Research Council would strengthen the worldwide competitive position of basic research carried out in Europe at the highest scientific level."
"This would mainly come about by offering long-term funding at European level."
"There is a need to ensure that the European Research Council is granted sufficient resources, not out of the present budget, but over and above the existing research funding."
"It is also important that the Commission should provide further and more accurate information about which forms of public aid do not distort competition."
"The Commission’s aims to investigate and clarify the Community’s R[amp]D state aid system and target such aid at horizontal objectives are very important and welcome."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"We are lucky to have two committed men, both of whom realise the importance of science."
"I was re-reading the hearings documents on the appointment of the Commission and I was very pleased to see how far the Commission has gone towards the objectives the Commissioner set out at that time."
"At the moment the whole credibility of European Union Member States is at stake."
"They have made declarations, including the one made in Lisbon, but they have not taken the action needed to put those declarations into effect."
"Indeed, some Member States have done precisely the opposite of what is needed."
"The rapporteur, like many of us, endorses the Commission's recommendations and the action plan it has put forward."
"We plead with Member States to implement what they have said in their declarations."
"We need the Finance Ministers of the European Union to look towards the seventh framework programme and the necessary funding."
"We need to train and retain scientists; women scientists in particular are a wasted resource."
"There needs to be coordination between research infrastructure and regional policy."
"We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries cannot."
"We have much to learn from them."
"I entirely support the creation of a European Research Council to give some coordination and coherence to our work, particularly in basic research."
"A recent meeting with astronauts made me more aware of the potential for science in Europe if we take the messages of the Lisbon declaration seriously."
"Almost all of us know them off by heart, but Member States have so far taken very little action on them."
"Congratulations again to Mr Linkohr and to Mr Busquin."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Barcelona, the European Council decided in 2002 that EU expenditure for research and development needs to be increased to 3% of the Gross Domestic Product."
"This is a necessary target if we want to close the gap with the US and be the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"Unfortunately, this 3% is currently not being achieved; it is only 1.9%."
"Industry must account for the lion's share of this 3%, because, according to the Council proposal, one-third should come from the government and two-thirds from industry."
"This is an agreeable proposal, but the European governments should, however, create the right climate for industry to be able to gain a permanent foothold in Europe and to re-invest, particularly in development and in R[amp]D. This also applies to a great extent to small and medium-size enterprises."
"In various Member States, initiatives have been developed in order to provide financial support to starter projects from SMEs, especially in the field of technology."
"In this respect, the fact that technological research, especially high-quality research, takes a very long time to establish is being overlooked."
"That is why there is always a need for new funding, and this is not always forthcoming in Europe."
"Starting is not such a problem, but secondary funding is a huge problem."
"We are experiencing this in the Netherlands too, with the hugely successful 'Biopartner' project."
"However, an investment climate requires clear and transparent legislation, backed by sufficient and well-trained researchers."
"Moreover, the mobility of researchers in Europe is still a major problem, because researchers are being hindered by different working conditions in the different Member States."
"I would therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to put their money where their mouth is and take specific measures to create a favourable business climate for research and development in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points in Mr Linkohr's report with which I agree."
"They include recognising the role of research and researchers and the need to increase expenditure and ascribing the importance to basic research which it deserves."
"For that I should like to thank our rapporteur."
"On the other hand, however, there are also extremely dangerous points in keeping with the more general policy of commercialising everything."
"They include the reference to competition-orientated research in paragraph 5, the approach to intellectual property rights from the point of view of the commercial interests of private undertakings in paragraph 26 and public intervention for market-orientated research and financing which abides by the rules of competition of the European Union in paragraph 32."
"We also have a proposal for tax incentives for private research activities, while the main international cooperation which appears to be of interest is at the level of undertakings in paragraph 41."
"The most worrying of all is that the suggested criterion for measuring the success of each research activity is if it has a positive economic result, while the introduction of a corresponding evaluation system is proposed in paragraph 37."
"The above proposals and everyday political practice in research and higher education make the positive points in the report sound like a simple wish list."
"Thus, I disagree with the overall orientation of the final version of the report."
"We face the demolition of the system of values developed over previous centuries and the erection of a new structure founded on commercialisation and corporate profit."
"Mr President, once more I would simply like to thank theMembers for their speeches and respond to some aspects of them."
"First of all, as Mr Linkohr rightly said, I believe that what is very important is that we show that we are keeping a close eye on the next Financial Perspective, because this is what will determine the leeway after 2006 and, not least, the place of research and innovation in the European Union budget."
"As Commissioner for research and innovation, I submitted proposals and the Commission will present a document, but it is clear that there will be a major political debate next year and up until 2006."
"That debate will allow a Financial Perspective to be drawn up, which increases the relative share of research and innovation in EU budgets, and will do so in order to respond to various needs that have been expressed and to sustain the 3% objective."
"Clearly it is also important that, when I think of new measures, I am thinking, among others, of fundamental research, which is not currently supported at European level."
"I am thinking of space policy, on which Mrs McNally and myself have just published a White Paper, which has obviously drawn on this desire to develop new technologies and to develop technology transfers and to sustain this level of scientific curiosity, which is determined by the desire to go further because there is the potential to do so."
"Mrs Matikainen, however, you rightly stressed the role of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is true that the drive to transfer research to the economy, which is also a reality, is and must be greater for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"You are from a country that sets an example for us since, in Finland, 55% of small and medium-sized enterprises maintain regular contact with universities and centres of research."
"These areas must be extended to European level and there are, of course, methodologies, which must be specific to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Commission intends to adopt the category exemption of small and medium-sized enterprises regarding state aid for Research and Development at the beginning of 2004."
"As a result, from 1 January 2004, it will no longer be necessary for small and medium-sized enterprises to inform the Commission and, therefore, it will be possible for the various States and regions to adopt more individual and specific measures for their small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Furthermore, as regards fundamental research, it is absolutely necessary that there is a clearer proposal on this field, in the Seventh Framework Programme, that also takes into consideration the current debate in the scientific community on the European Research Council."
"You have spoken about this European Research Council, which seeks to place the best scientific teams in the area of fundamental research in competition with one another at European level and consequently to support these areas which, as has been said, are comparable with what is being done in the National Science Foundationwhere the best teams have programmes at US level."
"We should have this type of programme at European level."
"There is, of course, the issue that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, moreover, quite rightly stressed, and that is the issue of funding."
"This obviously includes public funding, private funding, which must be increased, and of course looking to the European Investment Bank, which could be more geared towards research and innovation, which is, incidentally, happening more and more."
"Also, in the Growth Initiative, which was adopted on 11 November 2003, we find the concept of ‘quick starts’, that is to say projects that can be implemented quite quickly."
"In addition, for the first time, EUR 14 billion is earmarked for projects for European structures and for essential European infrastructure."
"We are, of course, thinking about all general network issues, all issues of space policy, regarding in particular the GMES and interactive telecommunications satellites; we are, of course, thinking about tri-electron lasers, which are crucial to the emergence of a new generation of research in molecular biology, in materials and in nanotechnologies because nanotechnologies will be essential, bearing in mind the shift from microelectronics to nanoelectronics."
"We have made provision for a technological platform and, in this area; the Finnish centre is involved in implementing the shift from micro to nanoelectronics because it is there that the greatest challenge lies."
"As regards this challenge, we will clearly look into the issue of technological platforms."
"According to the sector, we will endeavour to bring together major players to determine research projects as well as research needs."
"Moreover, to reply to a question from Mrs McNally, it is, therefore, through programmes that include questions such as: ‘what are you going to do?’ that we will get there."
"As regards the Member States, the 3% objective and the Growth Initiative call upon them to say: ‘this is what we are going to do."
"Here is our programme for us to reach the objective by 2010’."
"The Commission’s role will therefore be to encourage, because even if we cannot decide for the Member States, we can still motivate them, show the best practices and support the process to this 3% in 2010."
"This is an essential process if Europe wants to keep its place in the world, but that requires financing and being given the priority, which is granted to research policy."
"I think that you appreciate this and I would like to thank you for supporting this policy."
"Since, in addition, this will probably be one of the last times we will be given these reports to discuss, I would like to thank all of the members of the Commission, as well as Parliament for the support they have given to research and innovation and my friend Erkki Liikanen, who will take over from me."
"Clearly we are on the same wavelength and we are in favour of an ambitious European industrial policy for research and innovation."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"– I very much welcome Mr Linkohr’s own-initiative report on ‘Investing in research: an action plan for Europe’ and wish to express my personal thanks to him."
"I endorse his call for a significant increase in the amount of money spent on research in Europe with the aim of achieving the Lisbon targets, even though prompt transposition will be made difficult by the present tightness of many Member States’ budgets."
"If research in the EU is to be built up on a long-term basis, any increase in expenditure must therefore go hand in hand with greater efficiency in the application and management of the resources and with a more pronounced bias towards basic research."
"I am glad that the lead committee has agreed to my amendments in this regard."
"However, it also rejected the motion that what are termed the new instruments in the current Sixth Research Framework Programme should be drafted more rationally."
"This has led my own group to reintroduce Amendment 1, in which Parliament ‘calls, in the context of the 6th Research Framework Programme, for the ideas of 'networks of excellence' and 'integrated projects' to be geared more closely to the guiding notion of the European Research Area, and that adjustments, particularly in relation to the size of projects – both in terms of the number of project partners and of the financial volumes involved – should therefore be made.’"
"It is our expectation that this will enable, even now, the EU’s research policy to be adapted to the currently prevailing realities."
"I therefore ask you to adopt this amendment."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports:"
"– A5-0374/2003 by Mrs Read, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95/EC laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks (COM(2003) 220 – C5-0199/2003 – 2003/0086(COD))"
"– A5-0375/2003 by Mrs Read, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on Interoperable Delivery of pan-European Government Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (IDABC) (COM(2003) 406 – C5-0310/2003 – 2003/0147(COD))"
"– A5-0376 by Mr Clegg, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Eighth Report from the Commission on the implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package (COM(2002) 695 – 2003/2090(INI))"
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Read for her reports on eTEN and IDABC, which strongly support these programmes."
"Mrs Read has been very committed over the years to the IDA Programme."
"The Commission would strongly support a vote in favour of these reports."
"Let me start with the eTEN programme, which was formerly known as TEN Telecom."
"This programme will play a key role in achieving the objectives of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan."
"The programme has been reoriented to the objectives of eEurope 2005."
"The focus has been fixed on services in the areas of eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning."
"The programme has shown, through a number of validation projects, that there is high potential for the deployment of such services."
"However, the current 10% limit of Community financial support has proved insufficient to overcome the barriers to deployment at a trans-European level."
"The Commission has proposed raising the maximum level to 30%, since both research and experience in other programmes show that this is the level needed to encourage deployment successfully."
"However, as a former budget Commissioner, I should like to reiterate that the budget for the programme will nevertheless remain unchanged."
"The funding will concentrate on fewer but more focussed projects, thereby making the programme more effective."
"The scope of the new IDABC Programme will be broader than that of the present programmes."
"IDABC provides a more comprehensive coverage of pan-European eGovernment services."
"The benefits resulting from the cooperation between public administrations across Europe extend to citizens and businesses."
"IDABC supports, initiates and manages the delivery of pan-European eGovernment services with a view to giving business and citizens easy access to cross-border information and transactions."
"The Commission fully supports the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as submitted to the plenary session today."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1 to 5."
"Considering that the Council is expected to reach a political agreement on the IDABC Programme on Thursday, the Commission hopes that the very good cooperation with Mrs Read and the European Parliament will allow a second reading and final adoption before the parliamentary elections."
"Let me turn now to the third element of our debate today, which relates to the implementation of the telecom regulatory framework."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Clegg, for the thorough job he has done, and Parliament for its interest in the Eighth Report."
"I particularly welcome your involvement in the ongoing issues of the transposition and implementation of the new regulatory framework in the Member States."
"Eight countries have now succeeded in adopting legislation: Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"The Commission has opened infringement proceedings against those Member States that have failed to notify measures."
"We will pursue these proceedings vigorously."
"At the Council on Thursday, I will be urging those Member States that have not yet transposed to make renewed efforts to complete the task with the minimum of further delay."
"In addition, in a few days the Commission will adopt the Ninth Implementation Report, addressed to Parliament and Council, which sets out in more detail the state of play of transposition as at 1 November."
"As far as the situation in the electronic communications market is concerned, the report will identify some encouraging signs on the market after the difficult financial conditions of last year."
"The number of mobile subscribers is anticipated to grow at a greater rate than in 2002, despite the high penetration rates already achieved."
"Even if competition in the broadband market is still weak, the number of fixed broadband lines increased by nearly 80% in the year to October 2003."
"Unbundling, in particular, has developed significantly, with over 1 million new unbundled lines between October 2002 and October 2003."
"Some of the key issues we are examining in our assessment of transposition measures include the role of national regulatory authorities, and the putting in place of measures to avoid over-regulation."
"Accession countries will need to adapt their laws to comply with the new framework by May 2004."
"Parliament is being kept fully informed by way of the recent Comprehensive Monitoring Reports, which contained a chapter on the telecommunications sector."
"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and to assist the authorities in accession countries."
"The situation regarding transposition and implementation there will be fully covered in the 2004 report."
"In conclusion, with renewed effort by all Member States to complete the process of transposition and market review in the coming months, we believe we can do our share of the work to help the market stabilise further and to maintain its growth, so that consumers can continue to benefit from competitive prices and the development of broadband services."
". Mr President, I am delighted to present these two reports to you."
"I will deal with the easier one first, the eTEN programme, which the Commissioner has outlined with admirable clarity."
"I want to recommend to Parliament that it accept the Commission proposal."
"I was interested that the budget blood still runs in the Commissioner's veins."
"He was quite right to point out that this proposal is a reallocation of an existing budget and is not about raising the total budget."
"However, if the 10% ceiling is raised to 30%, it will mean the deployment of fewer but more focused projects in the future."
"The Commissioner again is quite right that when the potential for deployment of a product is recognised, the main barriers it faces are financial ones. There are difficulties which we well know in obtaining private capital for initial investment in this area."
"To raise the ceiling in this way is a proper use of funds in the eTEN budget programme."
"I hope that the Commission proposal is accepted and I have not tabled amendments, nor have other colleagues, which is the right thing to do."
"The IDA programme is more complicated."
"I had hoped that we would get a first-reading agreement on this but this proved not to be possible."
"In some ways, for very good reasons, the Council showed a good degree of diligence in its considerations of this proposal."
"What we are looking at here is extending the IDA successes in cross-border cooperation and communication between public administrations."
"This will build on that and also extend this cooperation to citizens and to businesses."
"However, there are also important changes which relate to the procedure, which has been streamlined and simplified."
"It is good that lessons have been learned from previous IDA work."
"The Commissioner knows that I was the rapporteur on two or three separate IDA proposals and I note with some wry humour that this was long before the phrase 'eGovernment' was widely used or even invented."
"However, the proposal can and will have real benefits."
"The Commission estimates that for every euro spent on IT infrastructure, the public sector can gain up to EUR 1.8."
"The annual cost of the TESTA programme, the part of IDA that deals with infrastructure, is EUR 4.6 million."
"The benefits are estimated to be EUR 8.6 million across the public sector: a genuine multiplier."
"The new programme will be called IDABC."
"I will read to you what it means because it is sometimes easy to forget: Interoperable Delivery of pan-European eGovernment Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens."
"Although it is a real mouthful, we can point to the IDA successes as bringing real benefits to European Union citizens in ways that really touch their lives."
"IDA is currently working in the following areas: agriculture, humanitarian aid, the internal market, statistics, environment, trade, employment and education."
"I pulled out here, and in my explanatory statement, five or six specific projects: the Solvit network, which provides a mechanism for people who come up against barriers to the internal market to raise the issue with the Member State concerned; the Euphin programme, which enables authorities to exchange data on public health issues, including communicable diseases in a fast and secure way;"
"Ploteus, a portal that supplies information on learning opportunities around Europe;"
"TourNet, a system for linking tourism administrations so that they can share information about their own particular areas; and finally Transcards, a more local and focused programme, which allows citizens living on the French-Belgian border to use the health facilities of either Member State, regardless of which country they live in."
"They are all good, quotable examples of tangible benefits the IDA way."
"This new proposal will bring not only tangible benefits in the IDA way, it will also bring benefits to European citizens and businesses."
"It will facilitate the free movement of people, goods and services by making eGovernment applications more accessible across national boundaries."
"I very much hope that Parliament supports the Commission proposal in the way that I have amended it and I commend it to you."
"Lastly, I should like to make a very brief comment on the report by my colleague, Mr Clegg."
"I will not go into the detail."
"He has done an excellent job here and is quite rightly using very specific language about some of the shortcomings of Member States."
"The Commissioner indicated his seriousness as regards addressing those Member States which did not meet the due deadlines: the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy made it clear that it would back him if he wanted to take the action he has outlined."
"I am confident that Parliament will also support him in this."
"We are already getting some indications that the accession countries are saying that they do not have enough time and need more breathing space."
"It is difficult to resist those arguments if existing Member States, which should be well able to transpose and implement, have not done so."
"I commend my own two reports, and that of Mr Clegg, to the House."
". Mr President, I am reminded on occasions like this how very specialised these debates must appear to the rest of Parliament given that we are so small in number."
"Seeing so many friendly and familiar faces here this evening, however, I am also reminded that we perhaps make up in sheer intelligence and talent for the lack of numbers that we are able to muster this evening, merry gang of telecoms specialists that we are."
"On a more serious note, I would like to thank many colleagues here this evening for their support and cooperation in producing this report, which really was a collective effort."
"I know that all parliamentary reports are collective efforts, but this one very much represented a collective effort by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy as a whole, including the shadow spokespeople."
"This was reflected in the unanimous vote in our committee."
"It is not an exaggeration to say that this report represents a welcome new development in the way in which Parliament is working, in the way in which we are increasingly not only promulgating and amending legislation, but also developing a highly welcome preoccupation about how that legislation is subsequently implemented."
"It would be irresponsible for us as legislators not to pay due attention to what happens to our worthy texts once they are adopted as legislative texts."
"This is a model example of not only cooperation across parties, but also cooperation between institutions in ensuring implementation is properly and fully pursued."
"I would like to isolate four points which are of particular significance."
"First, in urging the Commission to take action against those Member States that have not yet implemented the telecoms legislation in good time, and welcoming any action already taken, it is important to remember that we stress in paragraph 3 of this report that we also believe the Commission should continually look at innovative ways of not only forcing implementation on those reluctant Member States, but also encouraging implementation by benchmarking and comparative analyses."
"The Commission can produce these in order to urge the laggards to take a good example from those Member States who are perhaps more advanced."
"Second, our comments in this report on the regulatory structure and the European Regulatory Group are important."
"In paragraph 22, we put it on record that we feel that the existence of the European Regulators Group – the ERG – and the Independent Regulators Group – the IRG – is increasingly illogical because there is so much overlap between the two."
"Whilst many of us here understand that the Commission cannot take a formal position on this, it is worth stressing this evening that we feel there is absolutely no logical reason why these two bodies should coexist as is currently the case."
"A merger between the ERG and the IRG is desirable."
"I would like to see more proactive input from the Commission as regards the accession countries, and the degree to which they are abiding not only by the old framework but also looking to adopt the new framework."
"In our discussions with the Commission on this report, the Commission explained that it would be too onerous and complicated to meet an initial demand made by myself and others for specific reports on the implementation of telecoms law in the accession countries."
"In the end we urged the Commission to collate more information on the state of play in the accession countries."
"However, it is important that it should be taken seriously."
"If one looks at the monitoring reports issued recently by the Commission, there are only about two or three paragraphs on the telecoms sector in many of these countries."
"That really is not good enough."
"As they approach their own date of entry into the European Union, it is essential that we monitor that situation more closely than perhaps has been the case hitherto."
"Finally, I would like to draw special attention to the importance of paragraph 9 in our report, which stresses once again that notwithstanding the emphasis in all the regulatory activity in recent years on increasing access-based competition, our long-term goal has to remain facilities-based competition."
"That is sometimes obscured by all the battles we have about local loop unbundling, bit stream access and so on. At the end of the day, what we want for the benefit of European consumers, let alone European telecoms operators, is sustainable, robust, facilities-based competition."
"It is to that end that I hope this implementation report has made some contribution."
". Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I would like to thank Mr Clegg for the work he has done and his cooperation in enabling us to bring our own ideas into the report, and also for pushing the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to take the initiative."
"Many of us worked as rapporteurs or shadow rapporteurs on the electronic communications package of legislation over two years ago and it is important that we continue to show our political support and sustained engagement."
"After all, we all put a lot of work into it."
"We know it is in the implementation phase now, but it sends a clear signal that this Parliament is extremely interested in what we regard as one of the most important pieces of internal market legislation and one that enhances competitiveness."
"Competitiveness is absolutely crucial to the current agenda."
"I would like to highlight one or two points that the Committee on Legal Affairs considered in relation to our work on the universal services and users' rights directive."
"Firstly, we thoroughly endorse the Commissioner's opening statement about avoiding over-regulation."
"One specific measure in the universal services directive is aimed at ensuring that Member States do not intervene directly in the retail market to try and cap prices unless they have exhausted remedies at the wholesale level."
"They must be asked to keep that in mind and act on it."
"The second point is a practical one: we have put a lot of work into our directive on tariff transparency and publication, to encourage Member States particularly to address the issues of tariff transparency and comparison for private consumers and for small businesses."
"Unfortunately I have not seen a great deal of evidence that Member States have really taken that on board and I hope that will be picked up in the Commission."
"We would encourage you, Commissioner, and your team to pay close attention to this whole transposition, to make sure that we get the maximum benefit from this very important piece of legislation."
"– Mr President, my task is a relatively simple one."
"The committee adopted both of Mrs Read’s reports by a large majority, without us having to make major changes to them."
"This means, Mrs Read, that I can keep my comments relatively brief."
"Our group unreservedly endorses the Commission’s intention, which the committee has also approved, namely to increase the upper limit for aid granted for trans-European electronic networks from 10% to 30%."
"Although the overall framework is no bigger – which means that fewer projects can be supported – we were persuaded that the 10% limit was too low, so we support this motion, and you can rely on our unconditional support for the first report."
"In the second report, your concern is to introduce greater flexibility into pan-European Government services, which are capable of being used in every conceivable way."
"In it, you express your desire to do away with the Commission’s distinction between ‘projects of common interest’and ‘horizontal measures’, thus allocating resources, totalling EUR 59.1 million for 2005 and 2006, and EUR 89.6 million for the period from 2007 to 2009, in a more flexible way."
"We support you in this concern, too, and I believe that both your reports, in which you describe the problems in great detail, will enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House."
"I would now like to conclude with an additional observation on the trans-European networks as a whole, a topic that has been on our agenda for many months, indeed for years."
"Up to now, the problem has been that these great projects – whether in transport, telecommunications, in the energy infrastructure, in research and technology – have suffered from insufficient financial resources."
"The consequence has been that the implementation of the Essen resolutions, which first sought to promote the trans-European networks, has been very slow, very sparing and very incomplete."
"A group of experts under Mr Karel van Miert conducted a mid-year study of the transport infrastructure."
"The Commission’s new initiative for growth, the sixty-two projects in which are expected to be signed off by the Summit, deals precisely with this area."
"Even though we are, today, discussing only funding and total budget, I can tell the Commissioner that the approach of promoting and extending trans-European networks is the right one if we want, not only to free up markets, but also to make Europe fit for the future and thereby move a bit closer to achieving the goal we set ourselves at Lisbon."
"Congratulations to our two rapporteurs, firstly Mrs Read, who has always been a doughty supporter of telecommunications."
"I am very pleased that she realises, as we all do, the added European value of telecommunications for all of the Lisbon agenda."
"Firstly, on the trans-European networks, when I arrived in this Parliament, the talk of the town was the Delors White Paper, one of the main planks of which was European networks."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner and his staff have been adaptable enough to recognise that if the proposals put forward are not working as originally designed, the best thing to do is to, for example, concentrate on fewer projects in a more focused way and to increase the Commission contribution, since the 10% clearly was not stimulating the sort of initiatives we wanted."
"I strongly support their flexibility."
"I also support, of course, the IDABC Programme as outlined by Mrs Read."
"I believe that one of the neglected parts of the Lisbon agenda is greater social cohesion, which the IDA Programme will contribute to greatly, as well as, of course, the knowledge-based economy."
"The word 'interoperability' is appearing increasingly frequently."
"We are a continent comprising many small countries with different traditions."
"If we do not ensure that our systems can be brought together and work in an interoperable way, we are doomed to be less successful than continental blocs such as the United States."
"Therefore I strongly support the interoperability aim of IDA and its support of community policies as outlined by Mrs Read, those that are traditional – agriculture, employment statistics – and those that are newer – civil protection, humanitarian aid and justice and home affairs."
"I am also interested in making our citizens feel safer and, of course, I am also interested in the internal market."
"Turning to Mr Clegg's report, I would again like to congratulate him."
"He and others on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have been very vociferous in saying that it is simply not enough to pass directives and to put in place legislation if Member States then feel free to transpose that legislation according to some personal timetable which does not make Europe more competitive or promote social cohesion."
"Commissioner, I am glad that in your eighth report you bring out some of your tough instruments and make it clear that you will instigate infringement proceedings against those Member States which fail to transpose."
"This should be done far more frequently in a whole range of Community policy areas, because there are some Member States that take advantage of the markets created by those Member States that do transpose, while not playing fair themselves."
"I also agree with Mr Clegg that accession countries should be looked at."
"Congratulations again to both rapporteurs."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join other Members in expressing my approval, not only of the three reports we are discussing here but also of the Commission’s proposals."
"The main aspects of the Commission’s proposals and of the reports have been highlighted, but I would like to insist on the aspects which appear to me to be fundamental."
"Firstly, the slowness of the process implemented on the basis of these proposals, which are very positive in terms of relaunching and achieving operational unity in the major communications networks and which, as the Commissioner has quite rightly stressed, within the context of enlargement, are very necessary."
"There is therefore an essential need to respond to this reality and at the same time to fulfil the Lisbon commitments."
"But, unfortunately – and we see this in practice – there are obstacles to fully attaining these objectives, some of which – as has been pointed out – are highlighted in the White Paper by the former President of the Commission, Mr Delors."
"There are basically two of these obstacles; the lack of discipline and commitment on the part of the Member States, a significant obstacle which distorts the market in these fields and, in particular, in the telecommunications fields, which is the issue dealt with in the report by Mr Clegg; and secondly, the financial difficulties in supporting and developing these major networks of communications, telecommunications and electronic services, in the case we are now considering."
"Overcoming these two obstacles will clearly be the competence and responsibility of the Commission, but in this task it has the support of this Parliament and the Liberal Group which I represent."
"Madam President, I will focus on just one point: is a European regulation for telecommunications needed?"
"Nick Clegg is saying that it only has to be provisional and I am saying that it must be permanent and firmer than the current regulation."
"I would have liked Nick Clegg to give greater consideration to the analyses of distinguished economists from Oxford and Cambridge, who stress that if competition policy is then the regulation has to be to meet the economic, social and environmental aims."
"The rapporteur stresses that incumbent operators must give way to competition and, although this is true, it will not automatically be efficient, nor will it even be effective where competition is limited."
"The European telecoms sector has just come through a disastrous period in terms of investment and employment and has frittered away its lead with the GSM provision."
"A UMTS regulation would have allowed the use of infrastructure to be shared, instead of investors duplicating them and getting heavily into debt by doing so."
"Furthermore, the discrepancy between the ‘price’ criterion and the ‘quality’ criterion forced the UK regulator to impose greater quality obligations on British Telecom."
"As regards the social and territorial cohesion objective, the Commission report is particularly weak."
"Is there really universal access?"
"We do not know."
"Does it need to be extended with effective territorial coverage for mobile phones with access for everyone to a fast Internet connection?"
"There again, there is no opinion."
"Generalising the call for tenders procedure could favour all the pressures for eliminating universal service."
"As regards the issue of calculating the costs for special financing, the answers vary significantly depending on the choice of the relevant territory."
"All this becomes all the more important in the context of enlargement."
"Who will dare to say the liberalisation will be enough to ensure that private capital is invested ."
"I will therefore speak strongly in favour of more stringent European regulation."
"There is no evidence to support the idea that the national regulatory authorities should simply be independent and regulate themselves."
"These authorities must be part of a legislative and regulatory framework in the public interest."
"Madam President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow fans of communication, since, as was just mentioned, we are by and large among friends in this house, there is actually a whole range of dangers that Mr Herzog has just highlighted and that I will not go over again."
"I will, therefore, endeavour to be positive by saying that the three reports, despite everything, form part of a policy intended to prevent the digital divide and, from this point of view, I will not just thank the two rapporteurs for their work, but the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will also support these three reports."
"I will go back over Mrs Read’s proposals in a little more detail because as regards these very technical subjects, which are, however, of financial interest to the European territorial authorities – and I am speaking as someone from the Auvergne, moreover – these proposals help to ensure that the information society is not left in the hands of one or two monopolies."
"There is not just Bill Gates in the age of computers, and that is just as well."
"I will, therefore, make every effort to concentrate more specifically on thanking all those who told us beforehand what they were doing, so that we could clearly follow the amendments that were being prepared."
"The TEN programme is a decisive implementation tool alongside the general rules for granting Community financial aid in the area of trans-European networks."
"This is provided for until 2005."
"The objective is to raise the aid ceiling to projects in the telecommunication sector from 10% to 30% and this proposal is not insignificant because it will probably enable the Lisbon objectives to be backed up and therefore Europe to be developed in the area of services of general interest."
"This is precisely what we are interested in; that this is known as universal services or services of general interest, and that this service will in any case ultimately apply to all citizens and will be a tool that is strengthened for the good of all."
"This concept of services of general interest is perhaps even truer, moreover, with the IDABC programme for the period 2005-2009."
"Indeed, we the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are as you know pro free software and have found that it is backed up because it is included in the idea of interoperable delivery of pan-European Government services to administrations."
"We therefore support these projects."
"I will say, to conclude – because it is interesting news – that the town of Munich for example, apart from the example that was set with IDA, has switched to LINUX, to free software, and I hope that other administrations will take up the same challenges."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for this report, which is, , technically detailed."
"We will give our full support as regards expenditure, so much so that, for my part, I have sent a letter signed jointly by myself, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the Chairman of the Committee, supporting the Commission’s proposal on the IDA programme as regards raising the maximum funding level."
"What is the reason for this?"
"We feel that 10% is only a symbolic gesture whereas raising the figure to 30% is a tangible action, which will show people that Europe is close to the citizens rather than far away, particularly where TENs are concerned."
"As the rapporteur for this subject, however, I would like to speak about TENs in general."
"I feel that raising the maximum level is important for trans-European networks in general."
"We started with 10%, we raised the figure to 20% at first reading and now we are talking about 30%: this is significant."
"In addition to this, however, I feel that we need to amend the report on TENs so that it provides the possibility of introducing a subsidised system, with regard to all the networks included in the TENs in all sectors, including telecommunications and including IDA, in order to give the States the option of doing all this on the ground where they have problems with local authorities."
"I believe this is something that could streamline the procedure and provide an increasingly smooth channel for funding to reach the territory."
"In addition, I must mention what is known as -rewarding, which we already see as a comparative document and which should, in the future, reveal the good States and the bad States and, above all, make it possible to intervene where it is necessary to use the funds in question."
"Lastly, I would state that we certainly do not support what is known as the quick shortlist, in that it runs counter to the procedures of the Treaties."
"That area is not the responsibility of the Commission but the responsibility of the Council and Ecofin, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, on the other."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mr Clegg, for making the climate in the committee conducive to the report’s unanimous adoption."
"Tomorrow we will see that this report will not meet with resistance; quite on the contrary, it will be adopted with a great degree of consensus."
"We are particularly advocating a competitive and open market."
"Why do we do this?"
"Quite simply because we, in Europe, want to become more competitive."
"When competition is on a global scale, telecommunications are urgently needed as a key to the future, and our telecommunications need to be highly competitive."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that this be implemented as quickly as possible, not only in the candidate countries, but also in the Member States."
"We do not want distinctions to be drawn; we want the regulatory authorities to make public the progress achieved in the various countries, so that benchmarks and best practice may show us how to advance more rapidly where broadband is concerned."
"We know that there are, at present, a number of difficulties associated with the introduction of UMTS, because the auctioning of frequencies had an inflationary effect."
"I therefore think it makes a lot of sense for certain Member States to decide on tax incentives in order to get these new technologies up and running as soon as possible."
"Reference has already been made to the overlap of work between regulatory authorities."
"It is indeed necessary to bring the national and European levels together, even though, of course, the main work should be done in the Member States, with the European level intervening only when absolutely necessary."
"It is particularly important that these institutions should be independent, and I believe that, in the future too, we should take care to ensure the functioning especially of the technical interfaces in order to guarantee the systems’ interoperability."
"It might therefore make sense for the regulatory bodies to give some thought to the question of in which areas we need Europe-wide standardisation and in which mutual recognition, for it is, in the final analysis, targeted technical standardisation that can guarantee competition, it being of the utmost importance in terms of competition that interfaces should work and that the different systems should be capable of being used alongside each other."
"We are of course all aware that businesses and entrepreneurs are tempted to create monopolies and keep technological innovations to themselves, but we must nevertheless guarantee the existence of a functioning market with technically well-executed interfaces."
"Madam President, I also wish to congratulate both the rapporteurs on good and timely reports."
"Speaking mainly on Mr Clegg's report, one of the greatest obstacles to investment and competition in the telecoms market throughout Europe has been the lack of consistency and application in regulation."
"The differing requirements, and consequently the differing costs, have deterred new operators from starting up operations alongside existing ones."
"As a result, it has stifled the market and reduced competition."
"Therefore, I welcome this new regulatory package as it proposes changes by generating a consistent approach with the aim of liberalising the telecoms market."
"It provides a unique opportunity for all the governments to set the standards in a developing market and to finally begin fulfilling the goals we set at Lisbon, which have been all too slow to be realised."
"Today's buzzword in the telecoms arena is 'implementation'."
"This is the key issue, more so now than before, as the sector is showing positive signs of stabilising."
"However, I fully support the rapporteur in questioning the Commission as to why it is that only five Member States have met the deadline for the transfer of the new regulatory package this year and why the Commission has been very slow in responding to this."
"What exactly is it proposing to do?"
"The Commission needs to be tougher."
"We need action from the Commission, not just words, because delays not only penalise both new entrants and incumbents, but also put up barriers to the National Regulatory Authorities and the collation of information from the market players."
"We have to move on and we need proper market analysis on which we can base further action."
"I am also extremely disappointed at the slow development of broadband."
"I have been contacted by numerous people in the West Midlands who have expressed their concerns about this moving at a snail's pace and the need to address that, especially in some rural areas."
"Madam President, two aspects of this package warrant particular attention: the first concerns the double standards it adopts towards the Lisbon strategy: the social aspect is totally overlooked and ignored by the Member States, specifically targets for employment, social inclusion and equal rights and opportunities, but when it comes to liberalising sectors that are of interest to economic groups, the Commission is asked, in the Clegg report on telecommunications, for example, to press ahead with infringement proceedings against Member States that have dragged their feet in the liberalisation process, without even bothering to find out whether public services are guaranteed for all citizens."
"This position is unacceptable."
"The second aspect concerns increasing the maximum funding level from 10% to 30% of a project’s total investment costs at implementation stage, but without increasing the overall budget, which is a problem, because this means that fewer projects will be taking part at a time when a balanced development must be guaranteed."
"In other words, the countries with the greatest shortfalls must not find it more difficult to get projects funded."
"Consequently, this increase of the maximum funding level must be accompanied by an increase in the overall appropriations."
"Madam President, in the proposal for a Regulation on trans-European communications networks it is noted, as in the case of other networks, that there has been no progress in the implementation of the projects of Community interest as a result of the lack of funding, either private or by the Member States concerned."
"In this regard, forgive me if I leave behind telecommunications and comment on the planned South-East European high speed railway, where it is surprising that the Vitoria-Irún-Dax Atlantic branch, with a link to Bilbao, has been removed from the Commission’s final report, according to the requirements of the European Council, despite the fact that the Basque Government has made a financial commitment to this line and has been prepared to build it since February 2001."
"Furthermore, this project can be in operation from the outset linking the French and Spanish States, via Irún, since there is already an international European gauge track throughout the French network as far as that point."
"For these reasons, the fact that this Vitoria-Dax branch is not included is not comprehensible either strategically or politically and I would call publicly on both the Council of Transport Ministers and on the Spanish Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, for it to be reinstated."
"– Madam President, I wish to thank both my colleagues for their very creditable work in this area."
"I shall now just concentrate on the report by Mr Clegg."
"The topic he deals with is now extremely important because the Commission is for example calling for the swift implementation of the new European regulatory framework in all Member States."
"Mr Clegg quite rightly criticises Member States which, despite pressure from the Commission and the sector, have not done enough to adopt the new legislative package as part of their own legal system."
"If Europe wishes to create a genuine Internal Market for the telecommunications sector as well, it is particularly important that we ensure that harmonised legislation is implemented."
"We must keep to what we have decided."
"With circumstances as they are it is dangerous to start proposing measures to remedy the market situation before the telecommunications package has even been implemented."
"Given that eight Member States have not made the package part of their own legislation, it is nothing less than a scandal."
"Point 34 in Mr Clegg’s report is not the correct way to proceed in the situation as it is now, since in my view it conflicts with the Universal Service Directive."
"Can we have the operators pay for these reforms in the infrastructure?"
"As a list of obligations and remedying actions has just been launched on the market it is sheer madness to confuse the issue by adding new public service obligations or imprecise notions regarding a monopoly, which are oddly combined with perhaps some quite interesting business concept, which is to say the European service number idea."
"The whole information and communications technology sector has to be regulated until the markets are fully competitive."
"That is only fair for everyone."
"Let, then, the new service concepts come about in a commercially competitive market where business developers skilled in their field will certainly do their work well."
"That is European innovation."
"Let us also do our work: let us enact laws that last."
". Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament, who have been very consistent in following this file."
"I have a few comments."
"Interestingly, a couple of studies have been carried out recently which compared levels of productivity growth and development in the EU and in the United States."
"One was conducted under the leadership of Professor van Ark of Groningen University."
"There, they have studied the industrial and service sectors, trying to spot the areas in which the gaps between the EU and the US have been narrowing and widening."
"The communications sector is one area in which Europe has done better than the United States."
"The latest issue of the Harvard Business Review came up with the same conclusion."
"Even though only two reference countries were used – France and Germany – productivity growth in Europe has been about 15% faster than it has in the United States over the last five years."
"Therefore, the liberalisation of telecommunications within our regulatory framework has provided a real boost for innovation and competition."
"I am also sure that investment into research and development has been very helpful."
"All this shows that the right pressure for competition and a push for innovation also boosts productivity growth, which is a major benefit for the whole sector."
"Second, on future issues, I agree with Mr Clegg that in the long term, facilities-based competition encourages investment."
"The big challenge in applying these regulations will be how to build a bridge from service-based competition to facilities-based competition."
"The only way to do it consistently is via the opening-up of legacy networks, which have hitherto been financed under monopoly conditions."
"Where the opening-up of networks will require future investment and may involve risks, these risks must be properly assessed."
"Mr Herzog made a very interesting comment."
"It is very clear that we need both ex ante and ex post regulation."
"Ex ante regulation should be used in cases such as universal services, when there is strong public interest, but once markets are fully competitive, then reasons for broad ex ante regulation will essentially diminish."
"Regulation is not the purpose here."
"The purpose is high-quality services for the citizens at competitive prices."
"Finally, Mrs Gill, as far as our measures on the implementation of the regulation are concerned, the Commission is extremely strict when it exercises its role as guardian of the Treaties."
"The infringement procedure has three phases."
"The first is the letter of formal notice, which we have sent out."
"We are waiting for the reply."
"When we have received it, we will produce a letter giving a reasoned opinion."
"If we are not happy with the reply we will take the Member State to court."
"We will be extremely cool and objective in applying these principles, so there is no reason for concern in this respect."
"I also noted the comments of both Mrs Read and Mr Clegg on the accession countries."
"I am ready to have another look at this and will be happy to discuss that issue another time."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is a report (A5-0383/2003) by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the introduction of special tax arrangements for diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, this with a view to aligning the excise duties on petrol and diesel fuels [COM(2002) 410 – C5-0409/2002 – 2002/0191(CNS)]."
". Madam President, on 27 October 2003, after more than six years of negotiation, the Council adopted the energy tax directive."
"That directive includes some aspects of the commercial diesel proposal and notably it gives Member States the possibility to apply differential tax rates to commercial diesel and non-commercial diesel."
"However, the energy tax directive is still based on the principle of minimum rates only."
"Hence, it does not remedy the problem of distortion of competition on road haulage markets, which stems from the significant differences in diesel taxation in the Member States."
"Only harmonisation, or at least a greater approximation, of commercial diesel taxation will put an end to those distortions of competition."
"Three parliamentary committees, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have broadly supported the Commission's proposals for that reason."
"However, the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have also shown that there is wide recognition of the existence of such distortions."
"However, that committee does not share the views of the Commission on the need and the means to reduce those distortions of competition."
"I recall that, according to Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning excise duties must be adopted to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and proper functioning of the internal market."
"It is clear that the distortions of competition resulting from the very significant differences in excise duties applied to diesel by the Member States are a threat to the functioning of the internal market."
"I would like to point out that the Commission reacted positively to many amendments contemplated by the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and other Members of Parliament."
"In particular, the Commission could in principle have accepted the following three items."
"Firstly, the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel."
"Such a fluctuation band could be considered a 'second best' if a harmonised rate for commercial diesel cannot be achieved."
"The second item is the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned."
"Third, there is the issue of the implementation of a refund system, as a practical tool for differentiating duties for commercial and non-commercial diesel."
"To my surprise, it appeared that these amendments were subsequently not considered by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to be sufficient to allow support for the Commission's proposal."
"Finally, the Council, according to the minutes concerning the adoption of the energy tax directive, is clearly committed to pursuing its work on the commercial diesel proposal."
"For the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of this proposal."
"I would invite Members of Parliament to consider their position on this issue very carefully before the vote on it this week."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot share the Commission’s view that the time is ripe for this proposal, which aims at full harmonisation of excise duties for commercial diesel."
"My criticism mainly concerns the following matters."
"I will start with the reasoning behind the proposal: is there really a problem?"
"The Commission mentions two primary reasons for its proposal: protection of the environment and fair competition in the Internal Market."
"Whilst being a staunch supporter of both these aspects, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal as drafted will have the desired effects."
"First, the environmental effects should be seen in a wider context."
"It is questionable whether the proposal will have any environmental benefit worth mentioning."
"The Commission, citing evidence which can best be described as anecdotal, contends that trucks make unnecessary detours to fill up their sizeable tanks in countries where excise duties, and hence prices at the pump, are lower."
"The proposal contains a reference to a 1997 OECD report, which concluded that ‘gasoline tourism’ accounted for 20% of sales in Switzerland, for example."
"Even if one accepted this figure, there is no way of knowing whether this is a real substitution – that truckers are not filling up before departing from the country of origin – or whether this is a result of drivers making detours in order to fill up in certain countries."
"I wonder whether this really is a problem of such magnitude as to merit such a far-reaching measure, total harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission."
"Neither am I at all convinced that it is even desirable to eliminate differences in excise duty between Member States."
"I am of the opinion that an element of tax competition is very healthy, especially as the proposed harmonisation drive would result in higher taxes in most Member States."
"Finally, coming as I do from a peripheral region of the Union, I would say that I consider that regional aspects must also be taken into account."
"Scandinavian truckers are unlikely to be affected by gasoline tourism in the same way as German or Belgian haulage companies allegedly are in the congested regions of the Union."
"I believe that this proposal has been tabled outside its proper context."
"Although there are a number of references to the ongoing debate on a new transport policy framework and the proposal to introduce a charge on infrastructure use, there has been no real discussion of the interaction between these two initiatives."
"The Commission has presented concrete proposals on infrastructure charges and taxes, so it would have been better if these measures had been proposed simultaneously. Otherwise, there is a clear risk that an excessive burden will be placed on the transport sector in the form of increased diesel taxes and raised infrastructure charges."
"While it is true that the proposed Article 8(e) makes reference to this problem, it only applies during the transitional period, and only to trucks weighing less than 16 tonnes."
"How, moreover, will this proposal affect the new Member States, some of which at present apply taxes that are significantly lower than those in force in the EU at the moment?"
"Is it, as the Commission suggests, realistic to expect a harmonised tax rate to apply to all 25 Member States by 2012?"
"I fear that massive price hikes in several new Member States would place such tremendous burdens on them – quite apart from increasing inflation at a time when they are striving to bring down their inflation levels to qualify for EMU membership – that this development is not politically possible."
"Besides, the candidate countries have already done a lot to adapt to the current minimum tax rate and already the relatively modest increase foreseen in the Directive on energy tax may pose difficulties for some countries."
"One of the Commission’s reasons for tabling this rather complex proposal is to bring the tax rate for passenger cars rapidly in line with the rate for unleaded petrol."
"The Commission justifies this sort of tax treatment from the environmental point of view."
"We have to consider what impact the harmonisation of these tax rates would have, for example, on R[amp]D for diesel engines."
"We must also bear in mind that at the moment, in a competitive market, European manufacturers are market leaders in the area of diesel technology."
"We must also consider what impact this will have on the petroleum industry and oil refineries as, with the proposal, diesel consumption is likely to decline."
"Finally, I want to say that before the summer recess I tried to make some amendments to this proposal, to make it possible for Parliament to adopt it."
"I only received verbal assurances from the Commission, however, that the change Parliament desires will in fact be what the Commission pushes for in the Council."
"It is very unsatisfactory that the consultation procedure in Parliament will either have to reject the proposal or give the Commission in its negotiations with the Council."
"I therefore hope that in future a new constitutional agreement will allow the use of the codecision procedure and qualified majority decision-making in matters of taxation, making it much easier for Parliament to adopt a Commission proposal with certain amendments and return to the issue at second reading."
"– Madam President, Europe must take measures relating to car use if we wish to comply with our Kyoto obligations."
"It would be shortsighted to try to attain the Kyoto targets at the expense of those who create employment, if no previous attempt had been made to exploit all the opportunities which transport affords for reducing emissions."
"The EU has already concluded agreements, for example with European car manufacturers, concerning production of cars which are cleaner and perform better in terms of fuel economy."
"The directive now before us is important for efforts to achieve the same end from the demand side by making costs visible to consumers."
"It is just a pity that the Commission proposal comes on its own."
"For it to be adopted, it ought to be discussed in a broad context: within a decade it is proposed to establish a European tax system comprising charges for vehicle registration and use, an intelligent pricing system for infrastructure, and harmonised fuel taxes."
"As it is not possible to adopt such a comprehensive approach now, and as this directive fixes the level of fuel taxes for quite a long time, a decision seems unlikely."
"A comprehensive review would be in the interests of consumers and would ensure balanced development of transport in sparsely populated regions where no public transport is available."
"In rural and remote regions, people are more dependent on private cars, and the external costs of transport are lower than elsewhere."
"People have a tendency to reconsider their choices only when a major change occurs, such as when moving house, transferring to a new place of employment or buying a new car; they may not even realise substantial developments in public services have been made."
"Accordingly, big changes in immediately perceptible costs, such as fuel prices or road pricing, are important initiators of choice processes."
"In that sense, a linear model for increasing excise on fuel may be too slow and gradual to spur consumers genuinely to perceive the situation in such a way as to change their consumption patterns."
"At all events, it is important from the outset to stress in public information the ultimate objective of internalising the external costs of transport."
"Diesel vehicles consume less fuel and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions."
"It must, however, be remembered that they emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, which are a serious threat to public health."
"It may be considered a justified objective, therefore, to align the rates of excise duty on diesel and petrol."
"Madam President, I am sorry that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Mrs Kauppi are so negative towards the Commission’s proposal."
"I naturally respect the fact that many are opposed to tax harmonisation on principle."
"There is of course a value in countries’ determining their own taxes because these fund a significant proportion of welfare provision which, as is known, differs from one Member State to another."
"Even if it is important as a matter of principle to stand up for the right of individual nations to determine their taxes, this principle should not, however, be honoured to the point at which it becomes counterproductive."
"In certain areas, common tax rates have a clear added value."
"Diesel fuel tax is one such area."
"There are a number of drawbacks to having different tax rates on diesel fuel in the Member States."
"Firstly, different tax rates militate against fair competition between EU companies, for which it costs more in one country than in another to transport their products."
"It creates an imbalance in competition between companies."
"Secondly, this difference encourages what is known as fuel tourism."
"I have myself worked in the transport industry, driving heavy lorries."
"I know that drivers travel hundreds of extra kilometres to buy cheap diesel fuel."
"Not only that, but they attach additional tanks to their lorries so as to be able to fill up with enough fuel to make their journeys that much more profitable."
"Naturally, this fuel tourism also contributes to further destroying the environment."
"We work an unnecessary number of hours on the roads, and the number of accidents is increasing."
"That is the price we have to pay for the large discrepancies that currently prevail in the tax area."
"Thirdly, this situation, involving big differences in taxation, creates scope for social dumping. The gap between different transport costs in different countries is widening, and this makes room for social dumping."
"The environment, road safety, employees’ conditions and fair conditions of competition will be the overall losers if we retain an arrangement within the EU involving large differences in fuel costs."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the way in which Mrs Kauppi, in her revised report, has moved away from her negative stance."
"Mrs Kauppi, you are quite right to say that the Commission proposal leaves room for improvement, but I cannot be satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the lead committee, which rejected it."
"With this proposal for harmonising the taxation of diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, the Commission has taken a courageous step in the right direction, one in which the lead committee was not prepared to join it, thus ignoring the recommendations in its favour in the opinions of the advisory committees."
"In essence, the Commission proposal has two ends in mind."
"It envisages disentangling the tax rules on fuels, for commercial purposes on the one hand and for private use on the other, and, secondly, duties on diesel fuel in commercial use are to be harmonised, the object being to avoid distortions of competition."
"Competition, though, is distorted not only when rates of duty are not harmonised, but also because drivers work and drive for different periods of time."
"That should not, however, be a reason to reject the proposal, but rather a reason for improving it."
"After all, Parliament has always encouraged and endorsed measures aimed at opening up markets and making competition fair."
"Harmonisation is, moreover, intended to avoid the customary detours and the damage to the environment that results from them."
"It cannot be denied that ‘gasoline tourism’ is commonplace nowadays, and it is partly responsible for the damage to the environment."
"So how do things now stand with the outcome?"
"Firstly, it does not get to grips with the alignment of competition conditions in the transport business, which is so urgently needed."
"Secondly, this decision amounts to a retrograde step in terms of environmental policy as well."
"This is lamentable, and it is my belief that it would have made sense, particularly at the present time, for the Commission to improve its proposal in order to tackle the deplorable state of affairs to which I have referred."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell Mrs Wenzel-Perillo that Mrs Kauppi’s report, in the resolution of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on page 9, has this to say: ‘We call on the Commission to submit a new proposal as a matter of urgency.’"
"That is precisely what this is about."
"We have not rejected the proposal or said that the whole thing is preposterous."
"There are very many approaches, and they are all right, but, if we are thinking in terms of the whole picture, there are still very many questions left to be resolved."
"I think that the harmonisation of fuel excise duties makes sense, but does that achieve its purpose if we retain differences in taxation, tolls, road pricing and vehicle taxes?"
"If we are in favour of an internal market, we also have to think about the effects on the environment."
"Does it really make ecological sense for us, in this directive, to favour heavy goods vehicles by separating the diesel and excise duty rates for the commercial and private sectors?"
"Are diesel cars not urgently needed to bring about a reduction in CO2 emissions?"
"We therefore cannot see any justification for aligning the excise duty rates for diesel and petrol."
"Are there not circumstances under which this uncontrolled abundance of divergent diesel tax rates might result in abuses, and lead to an abuse of the trust of all those who took on board higher acquisition costs when they changed over to diesel?"
"Let me conclude, then, by saying that something remains to be done about tax in relation to the internal market, but many issues still have to be resolved before we can describe the cost-benefit equation as balanced."
"I am, therefore, rather surprised that, on page 24 of tomorrow’s communication by the Commission to the European Parliament, it is stated in the working programme for 2004 that this directive is already to be transposed, even though we are today discussing the need for the Commission to submit a new proposal."
"Only if the new Commission proposal is quick in coming will we be able to achieve the working programme’s objective."
"– Madam President, this directive will not be transposed as quickly as the Commission imagines."
"We are dealing here, of course, with a typical case for mainstreaming."
"I very much wish the traditional transport sector were as keen on proper Europe-wide regulation as it is on combating distortions of competition."
"It is simply that certain things have to be considered as a whole;"
"I mention this just by way of introduction."
"Fundamentally speaking, Commissioner, I do of course share the Commission’s view that harmonising indirect taxes makes sense as a means of guaranteeing the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Arguments based on fair competition and the protection of the environment always go down well with the public."
"In this instance, though, the subject matter has to be seen in a more nuanced light."
"On the one hand, we are dealing with what I would almost call the Commission’s inability to fashion a more comprehensive policy for the public in the transport sector, and, on the other hand, the finance ministers want to raise more money by increasing duties on diesel fuel."
"The way in which road and rail interact demonstrates a policy of isolation rather than one of integration."
"In the same way that we need a comprehensive transport concept for Europe, so we also need an overall concept for all taxes on motor vehicles, tolls and the transport infrastructure costs directive."
"It has to be seen as a whole, as a single package."
"Only in this context would the alignment of diesel tax be sensible and feasible."
"In the proposal for a directive, the Commission has also referred to the sharp increase in the number of privately owned diesel cars and regretted the revenue lost to the Member States’ budgets."
"It describes this as an error in need of correction."
"It is regrettable that it had nothing further to say about the owners of these vehicles, which are as a rule cheaper and use less fuel, who have, up until now, been able to drive more economically with diesel."
"It is worth examining more closely the question of who drives these vehicles."
"As a rule, their drivers are workers who are obliged to travel to work by car every day because no other options are available."
"In some states, these vehicles make up over 50% of private cars."
"European tax policy meant that it was precisely this factor that had a decisive effect on the car market, and environmental concerns have eventually resulted in improved technology in this sector."
"It is, I believe, precisely in this context that this issue needs to be considered more fully."
"I do not think that the underlying thinking is wrong or bad, but simply that the proposal needs to be revised or reworked."
"As it stands at present, it is not exactly in line with our thinking."
"My group recommends that the Commission should submit a new proposal, and advocates the rejection of the one put before us."
"Madam President, Commissioner, this is a sensitive subject."
"We see this from the many vicissitudes that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has gone through since we dealt for the first time with the issue of tax on diesel fuel."
"Of course, the debate in the House this evening also indicates this."
"I wish to thank my fellow MEP, Mrs Kauppi, for the typically assiduous and ambitious work she has done."
"This time – this once, I hope – I must however inform you that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party do not share her conclusions."
"Certainly, we can agree that the Commission proposal entails problems, difficult issues and delicate considerations."
"My conclusion, nonetheless, is that it is a pity that the committee’s majority could not have built upon what was good about the proposal and improved it instead of rejecting it in its entirety, something now proposed by both the big political groups."
"I therefore share Mr Bolkestein’s opinion on this matter, and I shall explain why."
"Firstly, the ELDR Group’s amendment is about tax coordination, not harmonisation."
"We propose allowing taxes to vary and fluctuate within a broad tax band, providing scope for the Member States’ own judgments without dispensing with what is good about the proposal."
"Secondly, the Commission proposal is of course about improving the environment."
"I certainly think that a number of the arguments sound like just a lot of excuses."
"Tax competition may, I agree, be a good thing, but not if the environment suffers as a result."
"Environmental and energy taxes are the taxes I believe can be decided at EU level."
"Thirdly, the big differences between the Member States damage the internal market."
"To maintain, as Mrs Kauppi does, that there is no diesel fuel tourism is, in actual fact, to put one’s head in the sand – or possibly in the tank – and not see what is actually going on."
"A modified Commission proposal would be good for the environment, strengthen the internal market and improve competition."
"That is something to which opposition in this House should be impossible on the part either of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats or on the part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Let us not end up recoiling in fear or engaging in exaggerated rhetoric every time we debate a proposal containing the word ‘tax’."
"Madam President, Commissioner Bolkestein, it is not the first time that I have pointed out in plenary that my group shares your opinion, that is that we are particularly disappointed by the vote which took place in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which in my view was a reactionary vote."
"Before I presented my comments I re-read the Commission proposal, the document of 24 July, and, both personally and on behalf of my group, I find the proposal made by your services to be of a very high quality, because it gives a very positive diagnosis and clearly explains the impact that we can expect from this proposal."
"I would like to once again stress to my fellow Members that the Commission made an extremely progressive proposal, which can be expected to have an impact in 2010-2012 for the candidate countries."
"It begins with an extremely weak central rate, which is the simple indexation of the rate that was in force as early as 1992 and, it is true, this means that some States will have to raise these rates."
"I also think that the comment from fellow Members, to the effect that an overall package should be proposed, is nothing more than a ploy to sidestep the issue; in other words, agreement will not be reached on the entirety of the measures proposed."
"I would also like to say – and in my view this is one of the reasons why this proposal was rejected by the main political groups – that you are obviously stressing the issue of distortion of competition but, if you carefully read the Commission proposal, you will clearly see that it seeks not, for example, to increase the overall tax burden of the States, it involves reorganising the national tax systems."
"For example, one proposal, which we support, is to reduce taxes on transport infrastructure and instead, to favour taxation according to use, which is the same index as that of the ‘polluter-pays’."
"It is clear that States do not want interference in the tax systems, but they are wrong."
"I would also like to say that, as regards the plan for sustainable development, the Commission paper stresses, according to the European Environment Agency that the external cost of transport represents 8% of GNP."
"I think that the Commission is right to stress that if the Council wants to respect the objectives, in particular regarding reducing pollutant emissions for private cars, then it must follow your proposals."
"Mr Bolkestein, you have the full support of my group, but I know that this will be insufficient."
"Nevertheless, we continue to battle on together; we will get there one day."
"Madam President, I was driving through Luxembourg this afternoon."
"As befits a true Dutchman, I always fill up there, paying Luxembourg prices."
"Normally, I fill up in the Netherlands, but if I travel through Luxembourg on my way to Strasbourg anyway, it does work out as more cost-effective."
"According to the Commission’s explanatory note to the harmonisation proposal, countless drivers drive extra miles to fill up cheaper elsewhere."
"This strikes me as illogical and certainly not a reason for tabling a far-reaching proposal for harmonisation. I therefore find this proposal very worrying."
"My first objection is that the proposal is not in keeping with other proposals for tackling environmental problems as a result of mobility and transport."
"In addition, I regard the proposed harmonisation of excise duty on fuel as an undesirable measure in view of the Member States’ sovereignty in the area of taxation."
"Mrs Kauppi is right to note that any taxation competition is healthy as it is."
"I have therefore joined with Mrs Lulling and Mrs Villiers in proposing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject the proposal, and we have been backed by a large majority."
"I urge my fellow MEPs to follow our position and reject the proposal for harmonisation."
"Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Bolkestein what the Commission will do when Parliament rejects the proposal?"
"I would appreciate a concrete response."
"– Madam President, I cannot but endorse the rapporteur’s view, as Europe needs more fiscal competition rather than less of it."
"The average tax rate in Europe already stands at over 40%, which is markedly higher than in Japan and the USA, and with its consequences we are all familiar. We have to contend with rising unemployment, fewer enterprises being set up, and declining levels of investment."
"The Commission is aware of these facts, yet it nevertheless advocates the introduction of tax increases, taking away the dirty work from the Member States’ finance ministers, who increase the taxes and shuffle off responsibility onto the EU."
"Doing this would be simple if we were to jointly commit ourselves to making the internal market a reality and were to ensure that the competition rules were not cut back."
"As the Member States would have to commit themselves to slimmed-down structures, this would automatically reduce their administrative obstacles and taxes."
"If we do not seize this opportunity, Europe will become an ever-expanding giant, but one enfeebled and dried out."
"It could also mean a great idea running into the buffers."
"This would be a pity, as we need a strong Europe."
"–Madam President,the Commission has chosen an inopportune time to put before us a complex and completely superfluous proposal for special rules applicable to the taxation of diesel fuel."
"Over and above that, it seeks to completely harmonise duties on diesel for commercial purposes by 2010, which would end up amounting, for most Member States, to a tax increase and therefore an increase in the price of diesel."
"It is, moreover, proposed – without considering the devastating effects on diesel technology – to raise the tax rate on diesel to the level of that on unleaded petrol."
"As our rapporteur has already described, that is completely absurd."
"Faced with the Commission’s regrettably uncompromising attitude towards the amendments proposed in a spirit of goodwill by our rapporteur Mrs Kauppi, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of whom I am one, voted by a massive majority – of twenty-three votes and two abstentions – to reject the Commission proposal in its entirety, and it did so for the many good reasons to which reference has already been made."
"The result of the Commission proposal would be a complicated system of rebates, one that would be bureaucratic, expensive and practically unworkable."
"It would leave us wide open to further tax fraud, with which we are already familiar in the context of VAT, and I personally agree with what our rapporteur has already said, namely that healthy fiscal competition is desirable and helpful in terms of stimulating economic growth;"
"I certainly do not believe that it distorts competition in the internal market."
"What is the point of imposing even higher taxes on our businesses at a time when the economic environment has for some years been characterised by stagnation and unemployment?"
"Such a thing is absurd, and I hope that the Commission will listen to our rapporteur and will put before us a complete and properly thought-out package to coordinate, among other things, the tax treatment of fuel and charges for the use of infrastructures."
"Madam President, the Commission initiatives on harmonising taxation of vehicles and fuels are broadly justified and are to be welcomed."
"They are justified because they constitute an essential factor for the smooth operation of the internal market, by attempting to eliminate or alleviate the anomalous situation of vehicle and fuel markets that are enormously segmented."
"These initiatives are to be welcomed because they systematically prioritise an approach that takes account of the environmental impact of traffic."
"Transport and mobility are, today, crucial factors for the pricing of goods and services and it is, therefore, crucial that in no way do they constitute breaches of competition."
"This does not mean, however, that there can now be complete harmonisation of fuel taxation even if this is spread over time."
"A degree of competition in taxation is, of course, perfectly acceptable if it leads to tangible benefits for consumers."
"The ultimate aim of all Community initiatives and proposals for initiatives must be to meet the needs of Europe’s citizens, either by making goods available and guaranteeing their quality, by ensuring the environmental sustainability of societies or by gradually reducing the costs of accessing this type of goods."
"This proposal, in this specific wording, does not look as though it will help to achieve significant results in the field of environmental protection and could even lead to pressure to raise prices."
"Furthermore, an initiative of this nature can only be accepted by the Council if it is integrated and coordinated with the directive on the taxation of energy products and with the proposal for a framework directive on infrastructure charging."
"The political complexity of this issue and the difficulties in managing, in the context of this directive, the administrative aspects of its implementation, specifically those concerning the distinction between fuel used for commercial purposes and fuel for private use, and the consequent return or refund of duties, justify the reserved standpoint of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The Commission must view the possible rejection of this proposal, however, as a spur for drawing up a new draft that takes account of the suggestions and proposals made in the European Parliament, respecting the immediate interest of the citizens and contributing to overcoming the inevitable resistance of some Member States."
". Some Members of Parliament have spoken about competition in the fiscal area."
"Indeed they have spoken about fiscal 'sovereignty'."
"I should like to read out Article 93 of the Treaty."
"The text I have in front of me is in French."
"‘The Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament […] adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties […] to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market […]’."
"The English text says that 'the Council shall establish measures'."
"The word 'shall' indicates that the Council has no choice but to harmonise the excise duties insofar as they are an obstacle to the internal market."
"So do not tell the Commission that this is anything to do with fiscal sovereignty."
"Article 93 of the Treaty says that the Council must harmonise excise taxes if they are an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"The question is then raised as to whether there is an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Mr Blokland said that he did not think it logical for lorries and cars to go out of their way to go to Luxembourg to fill up with diesel."
"Let me give you some figures."
"These figures pertain to diesel sales per head of population. They run as follows: 610 litres for Belgium, 531 for Denmark, 424 for Spain and 536 for France."
"These figures are all in the area of 400 to 500 to 600 litres per head of population."
"Then there is Luxembourg."
"Where the amounts in all other Member States do not go over 640 – this is the figure for Austria – in Luxembourg the figure is 3 106."
"Now why should that be the case?"
"It is quite simply because the excise duties in Luxembourg are dreadfully low, and therefore it is an open and shut case that there is a distortion of the internal market here."
"There is not a shadow of a doubt about that."
"If Mr Blokland says that is not very logical then I am afraid I cannot follow the logic of Mr Blokland."
"In my view it is perfectly logical that lorries and cars go out of their way to line up in Luxembourg."
"If you travel to Luxembourg you will see the long line of lorries all trying to fill up with that cheap diesel."
"So there is no doubt that there is a distortion of the internal market here."
"That is one of the reasons why the Commission is making this proposal, which is to be considered by the Council after Parliament has given its opinion."
"The second reason – and Mr Jonckheer was very eloquent in pointing this out – is that the implementation of this proposal will lead to a general reduction in emissions of pollutants, such as NOx, volatile organic compounds, SO2 and particulates."
"There will also be a reduction in CO2 emissions."
"That is the reason that the environmental NGOs support this proposal."
"Mr Jonckheer is quite right in pointing this out to his colleagues."
"He ended his speech by saying that his support will probably not be sufficient."
"I am not so pessimistic."
"I think that after this debate many Members of Parliament will realise that there is a distortion of competition, that harmonising excise duties on diesel is good for the environment, and that Article 93 lays the obligation – not the choice – on the Council to do it."
"That is also what the Commission is trying to do."
"Furthermore, it is far from the intention of the Commission to go for an increase in taxes."
"That is the last thing the Commission would like to do."
"Member States are perfectly free to cut their taxes elsewhere if they have to increase the excise taxes on diesel."
"So do not think that the Commission wants to do that."
"It is certainly not the case."
"As regards the situation of the future Member States, may I stress that during the enlargement negotiations, all the future Member States agreed to apply the current minimum rates on motor fuels as of 1 May 2004, the date on which they will become Member States."
"Most of them, except the Baltic States, are already at levels above those rates."
"Mr Blokland asked me what my reaction would be if Parliament were to reject this proposal."
"Once again, this is not something I expect."
"However, if that were the case, then, in accordance with the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission, I shall raise the issue in the College of Commissioners in order to consider carefully the Commission's position under those circumstances."
"Lastly, on the amendments, as I have already said, the Commission could accept the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel as a second-best solution."
"It could also accept the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned."
"Therefore, the Commission agrees in principle with Amendments 1, 3 to 12 and 14 to 16."
"Amendments 2 and 13 are acceptable in part, subject to some rewording when they refer to establishing a connection between this directive and the directive on infrastructure charging."
"The Commission does not support Amendment 17 because the proposed rates are not consistent with the energy tax directive."
"The proposal may look complicated but it is dead simple."
"It is beneficial to the environment."
"It goes against the distortion of the internal market as it has to in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty."
"–Madam President,because Commissioner Bolkestein has used what I have to describe as intellectually dishonest comparisons to pillory my country and has presumed to describe our taxes as far too low, I must, with some regret, put him right on some points."
"I do not know how good Commissioner Bolkestein was at geography in primary school, but I have to point out that Luxembourg just happens to be where it is, and when Mr Blokland travels from Holland to Strasbourg, he is not indulging in ‘gasoline tourism’ if he does so by way of Luxembourg."
"That is the easiest way to get here, and it just so happens that he has to fill up his tank ."
"That, after all, is one of the common market’s freedoms – free movement of goods, of capital, of people, and so on – and it is one of these fundamental freedoms, the free movement of goods and services, that the Commission is now seeking to jeopardise."
"I would also like to point out that, every day, 100 000 people cross the border into Luxembourg every day to work, coming from Belgium, Germany and France."
"They are entitled to fill up their tanks there."
"We are creating jobs for 100 000 commuters across national borders, who would otherwise be hanging around on the street in France and in Belgium."
"Your arguments, Commissioner, do not hold water, and I find it regrettable that you have presumed to adduce them."
". Madam President, what would a debate be without a last intervention from Mrs Lulling?"
"It would not give me the same warm feeling, the feeling that I have now."
"Thank you very much for your contribution, Mrs Lulling, but would you please explain to me why Luxembourg's diesel consumption is 500% higher than Austria's, the next highest in the list?"
"If you can explain that to me, then perhaps I will change my proposals."
"But you cannot explain."
"It is quite simply because the excise taxes in Luxembourg are very low."
"It is an open-and-shut case."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"(1)"
"– We were all deeply shocked at the tragic news of the bomb attack on the Italian base in Nasiriya on 12 November 2003 and the death toll that now stands at 27 people: 19 Italians, 8 Iraqis and many wounded."
"Those young men and women, dedicated , were enthusiastic and committed to their mission, which was to assure peace and relieve the suffering of the population in that war-torn region."
"19 have now returned to their homeland in coffins shrouded with the Italian tricolour."
"I have already expressed, on your behalf, our sympathy to the families of those victims, to the President of the Italian Republic, Mr Ciampi, to the Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, to the Defence Minister, Mr Martino, to the police and armed forces, and of course to the people of Italy."
"Our hearts also go out to those wounded in this attack, for their personal suffering and the tragic loss of their friends and colleagues."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I express our profound indignation and utter condemnation of this attack."
"Let us pay homage on this day of national mourning in Italy, to the bravery, courage and dedication of the Italian and soldiers who laid down their lives in Iraq for peace and freedom."
"I ask you to observe one minute's silence in their memory."
"(1)"
"– The first item is the Commission statement on its legislative and work programme for 2004 and the Oral Question on Eurostat (PPE-DE: O-0067/2003 – B5-0415/2003)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last time during this legislature that I will address Parliament on the state of the Union."
"It is a solemn occasion in the work of our institutions, when, traditionally, we take stock of the situation and cast an eye together over the work the Commission plans to do in the coming year."
"I am sad to say that, this year, our hearts and minds are greatly troubled by the tragic events that have dominated the news in recent days."
"I am referring to the series of acts of violence that have sown terror and grief in Iraq and Turkey."
"At this moment, your and my thoughts are with those mourning in Italy, to whom we extend the sympathy of all the people of Europe at the death of the 19 young men on a peace mission."
"Our thoughts are also with those mourning in Turkey and the Jewish communities, and with all those suffering throughout the world as a result of terrorist attacks."
"I know I can speak for the whole of the Commission when I express my deepest sympathy for all the women, men and children who have been affected by these tragedies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the problems we experience every day show us that, despite these difficult moments, the Union is in good health, notwithstanding the Eurosceptics and the unexpected critics."
"The situation is not easy because we are in a period of transition that is both delicate and complex, but a larger and stronger Union is within our reach."
"We have come through two difficult years for the economy but the latest indicators suggest that we are leaving this negative period behind."
"There are widespread expectations that economic activity will pick up over the second half of this year and then speed up in 2004."
"The worst seems to be over: business and consumer confidence is rising and optimism is, at last, starting to grow among European operators."
"Economies are also recovering in other regions of the world outside the Union."
"In the United States, monetary and fiscal stimuli and an increase in productivity are keeping growth rates high."
"However, there are some concerns about the deficit, which could grow further next year as a result of the tax cuts and the cost of the conflict in Iraq."
"In Japan, the prospects, at last, look good and the trend in the other Asian economies remains positive, with growth forecast at 6.7% for next year."
"There are also positive signs coming from the countries about to join the Union."
"In response to the general recovery in Europe and the prospect of enlargement, growth in these countries is expected to reach 3.8% next year."
"This is another sign that the political decisions taken to support the unification of the continent were right."
"The recovery is still fragile, however, as I said, and we need to speed up implementation of the Lisbon agenda and continue our structural reforms."
"The European Initiative for Growth, on which the Commission has been working since the start of the year, has now taken shape."
"It provides for public and private investment to spark growth and employment."
"Bolstered by the support it received at the October European Council, our initial proposal has become a genuine road map with clearly-defined actions and deadlines for the elimination of the financial and, above all, regulatory and administrative obstacles that discourage investment."
"The Initiative also includes the quick-start list, which consists of a series of projects that are or will soon be ready for launching."
"We have worked closely with the European Investment Bank and identified 56 projects in the fields of transport networks, energy, telecommunications and research."
"When drawing up the list, we applied a number of very clear criteria."
"Firstly, they are projects at an advanced stage of development that can be launched immediately."
"Secondly, all these projects have a significant cross-border impact."
"Finally, we have selected projects that can have a multiplier effect on investment, particularly private investment, but which will have little environmental impact."
"We have also undertaken to promote highly innovative projects in the field of research and development."
"As regards funding, total investment – public and private – will come to approximately EUR 10 billion a year between now and 2010."
"Private-sector involvement will vary from project to project."
"However, as an overall guideline, we expect 60% of the capital needed to fund the projects to come from the public sector and 40% from private investors."
"This means that about EUR 6 billion a year will come from the Union and national budgets."
"That is the equivalent of approximately 0.05% of the Union’s GDP, and you will agree that is a very cheap price to pay to give the European economy a beneficial kick-start, a price that is perfectly compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"What are the stages of this Initiative of ours?"
"The first stage is the December European Council, which will need to approve it."
"Then the Member States will need to reform their administrations and regulations, which are often the real obstacle preventing these projects from being implemented."
"In particular, that will make it easier to involve the private sector."
"I therefore call on the Member States to coordinate their national and regional spending plans with the European Initiative to maximise the impact of the investments."
"The legislative and work programme for the coming year coincides, ladies and gentlemen, with the major changes for the European Union."
"I will just remind you of the key dates for the institutions: on 1 May, 10 new Member States will officially join the Union, the elections will take place in June and the current Commission’s term of office will end on 31 October 2004."
"The programme I am presenting to you today is intended to complete the achievement of the strategic objectives that this Commission set itself for its term of office."
"In view of the fact that next year will be a special year, it consists of only 73 new proposals; this may seem a lot but it is far fewer than in previous years."
"The proposals cover the political priorities that were discussed in depth in our structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council between March and June."
"The main priority is to give shape to the future of the enlarged Union. It is based on two cornerstone objectives: ensuring the success of accession and preparing the political ground for the new Financial Perspective."
"As regards stability, we will need to develop a neighbourhood policy to create a ring of friends around the new borders of Europe."
"We must also complete the Tampere agenda by 1 May 2004 to complete the area of freedom, security and justice."
"With regard to the third priority – growth – we need to speed up our progress towards the Lisbon objectives."
"From an operational point of view, the programme incorporates the objectives contained in the new interinstitutional agreement with a view to streamlining legislative activity."
"For example, we have brought our proposals into line with the Union’s annual and multiannual programming and we undertake to apply the integrated impact assessment process to all the most important initiatives."
"As regards stability and security, at the Thessaloniki Summit, we presented a series of proposals on justice and home affairs and laid the foundations for a new neighbourhood policy."
"The proposals presented on economic matters concentrated on the Lisbon strategy, on completion of the single market, on research and on trans-European networks."
"At this point, we should not forget the recently-adopted legislative framework for the chemical sector."
"It has to be said, however, that the workload has been extremely heavy this year and the Commission has not been able to complete all the tasks it set itself."
"For this reason, the programme for 2004 includes some uncompleted initiatives."
"I would like to express the appreciation of the whole College for the excellent cooperation of the European Parliament in the planning exercise."
"The structured dialogue has proved to be an excellent instrument but there is always room for improvement and that is necessary."
"Bearing in mind the deadlines that will affect both of our institutions next year, the Commission will work closely together with Parliament to improve our relationship."
"In particular, we propose replacing the current methods of dialogue with an exchange of views between the Conference of Presidents and Vice-President de Palacio in April; using the written procedure for the mid-term evaluation for the programme and, lastly, deferring the presentation of the programme for 2005 – which will be the responsibility of the next Commission – until the December 2004 part-session, which will allow us to coordinate our work."
"Lastly, we have conducted an initial evaluation of the internal reforms that have modernised our financial and personnel management."
"The serious irregularities in past management of the Union’s statistical office, Eurostat, have given us much food for thought and led us to re-examine the situation, which has resulted in our proposing a plan of action that I would now like to outline to you."
"I am sorry this speech is so long, but this is an important section."
"On 25 September 2003, I gave my views on the Eurostat affair to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents."
"I gave my assessment of the facts, as revealed by the investigations conducted by OLAF and the extensive work done by the Commission departments."
"I did, however, accept that breakdowns in our communication system – between OLAF and the rest of the Commission, and between the Director-General of Eurostat and his Commissioner – had meant that the Commission was unable to take all the necessary precautionary measures earlier."
"I therefore promised to present you with an action plan to remedy them."
"After that meeting, the internal auditor produced the final report and presented it to Cocobu."
"It does not contain anything new which might alter my analysis."
"In short, it is quite clear that the most serious events took place before 1999, that the reorganisation exercise started in 2000 and that Eurostat, Financial Control and other sources involved OLAF very swiftly on the main aspects of this affair."
"In any case, the Commission was only in a position to act as of May 2003 because of a number of communication breakdowns at various levels, which I have identified."
"We took decisive action; we could have moved more quickly, and that is why we are presenting to you an action plan."
"The plan is based on the fundamental principles of the reform, and the key points include the functional independence of OLAF, the new Financial Regulation, which came into force in January 2003, the new Staff Regulations, the provisions concerning rights and obligations and the codes of conduct."
"All these reforms have been introduced gradually."
"As I stated on 25 September, it would be unfair to judge the reform, with its successes and its inadequacies, as if everything had been completely operational as early as 2000."
"Rather, the period 2000-2003 must be seen as a transitional period."
"However, this same Eurostat case is an illustration of just how necessary it was, particularly as regards matters such as mobility for sensitive posts, segregation of operational duties and control duties and the establishment of an internal auditor."
"It is therefore a question of building on what has been achieved by the reforms, which are already bearing fruit."
"We need to consolidate them, giving the political actors the means of shouldering their political responsibilities."
"I would also remind you that we have taken some tough measures this summer concerning Eurostat itself: the Director-General has been replaced; the Operational Director posts have been advertised both inside and outside the institution; a new Resources Director has been transferred; the organisation chart has been overhauled, etc.; lastly, a high degree of mobility has been applied to Unit Head posts."
"In the same vein, I felt it was necessary, as a first step, to amend the code of conduct governing relations between the Commissioners and their departments, which dates from 1999."
"Although the general principles which formed the basis of the code in 1999 should be maintained, in particular the principle of non-interference in management, more emphasis should be placed on the Commissioners' political responsibility, which covers not only their own actions but also those of their departments."
"The revised code of conduct will therefore include a whole series of provisions improving the flow of information to Commissioners to ensure that they are in a position to exercise this responsibility properly, so that they can supervise their departments' work and give them general instructions, including instructions relating to financial management."
"The code will also lay down a specific procedure for formally referring matters to the Commissioner, so that the Director-General can immediately draw the Commissioner's attention to any fact or development that might involve the Commissioner’s political responsibility or that of the College as a whole."
"Secondly, I would also like to respond to another question thrown up by the Eurostat affair."
"It actually seems that certain signals and pieces of information emerged in various parts of our institution concerning this affair well before May 2003."
"Taken in isolation, these signals were not such as to alert us to the gravity of the situation."
"Had they been centralised and analysed as a whole, we would not have had to wait for the first substantive information from OLAF before taking precautionary measures."
"I have therefore decided to introduce a new systemfor collecting and cross-checking all information relating to allegations of fraud, irregularities or wrongdoing, for analysing this information and for informing either the Commission or the Commissioner responsible, as appropriate, so that they can take any administrative, financial or other measures necessary, in particular to protect the financial interests of the Union."
"I have decided to take responsibility for the political supervision of this system myself, with the help of Mr Neil Kinnock and Mrs Michaele Schreyer."
"The preparatory work will be carried out at administrative level by a group of officials of the rank of Director-General, coordinated by the Secretary-General."
"This system will enable us, in particular, to provide better follow-up to information received from OLAF, IDOC and the IAS."
"Clearly, the idea is not to carry out additional investigations or to usurp the role of the policy-makers or administrators, who will continue to be responsible for keeping a close watch on management and responding appropriately to the information and investigation reports they receive."
"It will serve primarily as a watchdog and early warning system."
"Thirdly,I have decided to improve the information channels between the central services and the operational departments, strengthening links, improving certain practices and following up some of the suggestions made in the internal auditor's report."
"These are essentially technical measures, but I believe they are very important for improving the flow of information and strengthening the systems of checks and balances."
"I described these measures to Cocobu earlier today."
"To conclude this reflection on the Eurostat affair, I will now come to OLAF."
"Everyone acknowledges that the present situation is, in a number of respects, unsatisfactory."
"OLAF is a Commission department, but it conducts its investigations in total independence."
"It is in complete charge of the decisions it takes in the course of its operational activities."
"That is also as we intended."
"Nevertheless, the current legal framework remains vague on whether or not it must pass on information to the institutions or persons concerned by an investigation."
"This has proved damaging in the Eurostat case."
"I want to dispel all doubts with this analysis of OLAF: its Director-General, Mr Brunner, enjoys my full confidence."
"I am analysing the way the institution is organised, not criticising the work of the Director-General, who took the right action in this case."
"The Commission is in the awkward situation of having to take political and legal responsibility for OLAF's work without actually having the means to exercise that responsibility, and it is also legally responsible for OLAF in any court actions that may be brought against it, for example claims for damages by individuals who feel their rights have been infringed."
"I had proposed to Parliament, in connection with the plans for a European Public Prosecutor, that OLAF be given full independence within a clear political framework."
"That is still my objective. Further work on making OLAF an entirely external body must remain on our agenda."
"However, in order to resolve the current operational problems swiftly, I would like to propose immediate steps which will entail amendments to the OLAF Regulation, the aim being to have them adopted by the present Parliament."
"We have to do something to give our successors a legal framework in which they can work with peace of mind."
"The need to strengthen the regulatory framework has also been expressed by the OLAF Supervisory Committee and in the work in progress in Cocobu, in particular in Mr Bösch's report."
"The Commission is taking this into account."
"I would now like to lay before you the main aspects of the improvements we are planning."
"Firstly, strengthening OLAF's operational independence by refocusing its activities as appropriate, particularly with a view to enlargement."
"There might be a case here for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations."
"Secondly, allowing OLAF to concentrate on its priorities."
"To this end, we must lay down and enshrine in the Regulation a principle whereby action is taken as appropriate and discretion is exercised."
"This will allow OLAF to pass on to the appropriate authorities the task of following up cases which are of minor significance or lie outside its priority activities and will also make for speedier and more effective investigations."
"I would specify here that the decision on whether or not to open investigations must always remain with OLAF."
"Thirdly, clearer rules on the flow of information between OLAF and the institutions and bodies concerned."
"We shall also have to look into how this information is handled by the institutions involved."
"We need to strike a better balance between safeguarding the effectiveness of investigations and protecting the Union's financial interests with precautionary measures."
"Light will also have to be shed on the question of ultimate responsibility for decisions taken."
"Fourthly, amendments to the Regulation will also cover safeguards for the rights of the defence, an issue of fundamental importance."
"Fifthly, at the same time, we need to take a fresh look at the governance of OLAF both in terms of beefing up the role and make-up of its Supervisory Committee and in terms of setting up an interinstitutional Administrative Board."
"To sum up, I am proposing to increase the effectiveness of OLAF — as it faces a growing workload in an enlarged Union — by increasing its staff resources, refocusing its tasks on its investigative function and amending the Regulation, and to make OLAF more accountable."
"Mr President, here, then, are the basic lines of the action plan I am proposing to launch in response to the questions raised by the Eurostat affair."
"A communication will be adopted by the end of the year."
"As for the internal measures within the Commission, I expect to have them adopted as of December."
"Moreover, I hope that our contacts with Parliament will be advanced enough for us to table a legislative proposal on OLAF that has a reasonable chance of being adopted by Parliament and which takes us forward towards the idea of the European Prosecutor, which we all continue to support."
"Mr President, I began my address by stressing the major challenges that lie before us in 2004."
"To these I should, of course, add the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Of the many issues on the table, I wish to focus today on just one, the composition of the Commission."
"It is claimed in many quarters that a Commission with 25 or more members would be unworkable, but I want to tell you now that, next year, we will be putting that idea to the test because, for a period of six months, we will be welcoming colleagues from the new Member States and the Commission will be composed of 30 members."
"Of course, this will be a transitional situation in which no new portfolios will be created and it will last only until the end of this Commission's term of office: from 1 November 2004 onwards we will have 25 Commissioners."
"I am convinced that, whether it has 25 or 30 members, the Commission will be able to function extremely well."
"In the first place, the Treaty of Nice already guarantees the coherence of an enlarged Commission, and the President of the forthcoming Commission will have increased powers to organise, direct and monitor its work."
"In the second place, I do not agree that the Commission's tasks break down to a dozen or so portfolios."
"We must not forget that Commissioners also serve as the face of Europe with regard to public opinion in their countries of origin, and this will be even more important for the citizens of the new Member States."
"Lastly, the effectiveness of the Commission depends not on the number of its members but on the way in which its resources are used."
"The reforms we have introduced over the last few years have already brought positive results here."
"Thus, collective responsibility and the consistency of the Commission's work remain central to my concerns, therefore."
"An enlarged Commission undoubtedly presents a number of challenges, but the idea of a two-tier Commission, in which half the Commissioners would have a secondary role, does not provide the answer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken of short-term commitments, but my Commission is already looking further ahead."
"Early this year, we launched a wide-ranging debate on the new Financial Perspective."
"In 2007, the Union could comprise 28 Member States and around half a billion citizens, and it will have a new constitutional framework."
"Clearly, therefore, discussions must start right now if all the instruments are to be operational by the end of 2006."
"Past experience has shown us that there is no time to spare."
"In preparing for the future, politics should call the shots because, before we begin working out the accounts we have to decide what we want the overall framework for the Union's policies to be. We must keep our eyes fixed on our objectives: peace, sustainable development, solidarity and freedom."
"In practical terms, this means that we must work along the following lines: a road map for the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda; solidarity between countries and regions to help those who are lagging behind;"
"European citizenship in an area that has developed from a marketplace into a political area; the external dimension of our model and our policy choices, starting with the neighbouring countries with which we must build a ring of friends. It is important that thislegislature – the legislature that has brought the enlargement process to its conclusion – should be involved in establishing the policy lines for the enlarged Union."
"In conclusion, Mr President, 2004 will be a year of challenges, renewal and undertakings."
"The European elections will provide an invaluable opportunity to gauge the extent to which citizens are participating in our venture."
"Against such a backdrop, the Commission is aware that it acts as a point of reference providing the system with continuity, stability and dynamism."
"We are committed to striving together with Parliament, the Council and all the other Union institutions to make a success of our appointment with history."
"Together, we can build a greater, more independent, stronger Union."
". – Mr. President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, as part of the proceedings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, we listened with great interest to the presentation by the Commission of its Legislative and Work Programme for 2004, which has been formally presented to the European Parliament today by President Prodi."
"The major institutional events in the Union’s calendar in 2004 give this programme a particular significance."
"Indeed, 2004 will be a year of great changes."
"First of all, we have the signing of the new Constitutional Treaty, which will lay the foundations for the future development of the Union."
"Next year will also see the European Parliament elections – which, for the first time, will also involve the citizens and candidates of the 10 new Member States."
"On 1 November 2004, the new Commission will take up full office."
"Finally, next year will see the start of the negotiations for the definition of the next Financial Perspective, which will be decisive in orienting European Union policy in the coming years."
"Although the Council has not yet set out its position with respect to the Commission programme, it certainly agrees with – and is ready to subscribe to – the three main priorities identified by the Community executive: enlargement, stability and sustainable growth."
"The Council has taken note of the objectives established by the Commission, as well as the initiatives and proposals it intends to present during 2004 in order to implement these priorities."
"Taking into account the institutional events of the coming year, the legislative work will need to be as focused as possible, and the Presidency is therefore pleased to note the Commission’s undertaking to concentrate first and foremost on the initiatives considered to be most essential."
"I would also like to emphasise that, even more than in the past, the cooperation between the Council and Parliament will be decisive in ensuring that the Commission’s legislative proposals are adopted within the hoped-for timescale."
"The Council is pleased to note that the Commission has implemented in full the new impact assessment procedure."
"Indeed, as the European Council stressed in October, this procedure is extremely important if we are to avoid the situation arising where European Union legislation makes the Union less competitive than other major economic areas of the world."
"The Presidency is also extremely pleased to note that the Commission’s annual programming exercise has been carried out within the framework of the structured interinstitutional dialogue."
"The dialogue between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Council and Parliament, on the other, which was initiated on the basis of the Commission Communication on Annual Policy Strategy, makes it possible for these two institutions to ensure that their point of view on the proposals put forward by the Community executive for the following year is taken into account, before the final version of the legislative and work programme is drawn up."
"I therefore feel that I must stress at this point that the sooner the Annual Policy Strategy is presented, the more fruitful this exercise is likely to be."
"More specifically, its timely presentation would enable the discussion of budgetary procedures to be developed on the basis of the results of the structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council."
"Even though, as I have said, the Council has not yet defined its position as regards the Commission’s work programme, it will, of course, take it into account in drawing up its own work programme."
"In this connection, I wish to remind you that, in accordance with the reforms approved by the Seville European Council, the aim of which is to ensure greater continuity and consistency in the Council’s work, the six delegations that will be holding the Council Presidency over the coming three years are drawing up a multiannual strategic programme that will be adopted by the December European Council."
"I would also like to mention here that the future – Irish and Dutch – Presidencies, which will have the task next year of steering the work of the Council on the Commission’s initiatives for 2004, are already working on drawing up the next annual programme for the Council – as, I remember, was done by the Greek and Italian Presidencies for the current year."
"Parliament will, of course, be informed at the earliest possible date of the results of this work so that it can put forward its own observations, as envisaged by the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like, if I may, to take the opportunity provided by this debate on the Commission’s programme to say a few very brief words on the goals of the Italian Presidency with a view to the December European Council, a subject to which I shall, of course, return with you in more detail during the next plenary session in Brussels."
"The decisions adopted at the December Summit will, to a certain extent, reflect the priorities established by the Commission and will, therefore, be able to help us achieve the objectives set for 2004."
"As regards enlargement, the December European Council will be called upon, first and foremost, to evaluate the progress achieved in the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of the reports and strategy papers presented recently by the Commission, and thus to establish the timescale for the conclusion of the membership negotiations with these two countries."
"Again on the basis of the Commission report, the European Council will also be called upon to assess the progress made by the 10 accession countries in the adoption and application of the Community ."
"As regards the stability objective, as defined in the Commission’s programme, where internal actions are concerned, the Council will need to assess the progress made in terms of asylum, migration and external borders, especially in the light of the timetable drawn up in Thessaloniki, Seville and Tampere."
"As regards external issues, the European Council will be called upon to adopt the European Security Strategy drawn up by the Secretary General/High Representative, to address the question of weapons of mass destruction and to evaluate the progress made in ESDP."
"The Heads of State or Government will also approve a detailed work programme for the Commission and the Secretary General/High Representative on relations with the Arab world."
"Lastly, on the subject of sustainable growth, the European Council will need to adopt tangible decisions on the Growth Initiative, especially where the quick-start programme is concerned, and will receive a report from the Commission containing proposals for the reinforcement of the production framework, with a view to preventing deindustrialisation."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to express our sense of grief for the murdered Italian soldiers and and also the Iraqi citizens who fell victim to this hideous crime."
"We also wish to voice our outrage at the criminals in Istanbul and convey our respects and sympathy to the families and survivors there."
"There are situations in political life when one would gladly avoid making certain statements or adopting a particular type of speech."
"Unfortunately, however, I have no choice but to make my views plain, and I do so calmly and objectively, as I do not wish to create even more waves in Italy’s public debate after the events of last week."
"Mr Prodi, you deemed it appropriate to launch a political manifesto in Italy last week."
"This manifesto, Mr Prodi, is not our problem, although it could be argued that if you present a comprehensive policy programme, this should not be in response to a country’s domestic political situation; the place for this would have been the European Parliament."
"That also needs to be said, ..."
"... but that is not my main point."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will undoubtedly have an opportunity to express your views."
"As a democrat, kindly let me express mine."
"My main point of criticism, Mr Prodi, is that you have engaged in party politics. You have called on a specific political movement, namely the Italian left, to join forces, thus creating ..."
"... the impression that there are on the one side people who are pro-reform and pro-Europe, while on the other side there are those who are not pro-Europe."
"Let me say, on behalf of my group, that every single member of our group shares the passion for Europe, and we should not drive a wedge between Europeans, neither in Italy nor in Europe."
"Nor can it be claimed that this was a declaration made in a private capacity, for it comes from the President of the Commission."
"Anyone who is the Commission President always acts on behalf of all Europeans."
"I share the view of our fellow MEP Mr Barón Crespo: if the Commission President heads the list for the European elections, he must resign from office."
"In fact, Mr President, my comments in prompted you, ..."
"... finally to make it clear that you will remain in office until the end of your term on 1 November 2004."
"We welcome this clarification, but even members of your Commission were still saying last week that there were rumours you might be standing as a list candidate in the European elections."
"Thankfully, you have now clarified your position."
"Nonetheless, this state of affairs – this rumour mill – has also harmed the Commission and I mention it here because it needs to be mentioned."
"Anyone who holds high office in the European Union should always bear in mind that every time they speak, they do so for the European Union as a whole."
"Indeed, if had called me to ask me about the statements made by the President of the European Council on Chechnya, I would still have said that I did not agree with the sort of declaration you have issued."
"We are trying to be objective. We want to serve Europe, and that is why we must not divide Europe."
"Mr Prodi, let me remind you that on 15 September 1999, you were appointed with the support and trust of our group, even though you do not belong to our political family."
"We gave your Commission our trust, even though the majority of your Commissioners – contrary to the outcome of the elections – do not belong to our political family."
"I welcome the fact that the constitutional draft states that in future, the outcome of the European elections will be taken into account when a candidate is proposed for the office of Commission President."
"Commissioner Solbes, I hope to hear a word or two on the stability of the European currency."
"I believe this is an issue which you will also be addressing today, Mr Prodi."
"I would like to give encouragement to your Commission and thank Commissioner Solbes in particular – whom we regard as the guarantor of European currency stability – for maintaining this course, not only towards the small countries but also the large countries in the European Union."
"Mr Antonione, I particularly appreciate the fact that the representative of the Council is here today."
"This should be taken as read, but this was not the case in the past."
"I welcome the fact that you are here today, and I would like to give you our encouragement and call on you, at the Intergovernmental Conference, not to endorse the ideas floating around in some finance ministers’ minds, namely to reduce the rights of this House on budgetary issues, which we will resist resolutely. I would ask you to make it plain that you side with the European Parliament on this issue and that we want equality between this House and the Council of Ministers on the European Union budget."
"Let me conclude with comments which I make with a great deal of personal regard, as the Commission President is aware, although personal affinity and political issues must be kept separate; criticism cannot be brushed under the carpet out of a sense of personal regard. It is essential to speak the truth."
"Mr Prodi, you are the President of all the Europeans."
"You hold the highest office in the European Union."
"Give us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the opportunity to give you our trust until the end of your term in office on 1 November 2004."
"If you prove that you can earn it, you will have our support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group. I would like to convey our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in recent terrorist attacks."
"We stand shoulder to shoulder with the families of the Italian servicemen and of the Iraqi citizens who died. We also wish to express our solidarity with the families of victims of the attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul."
"Moving on, Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Poettering for bringing politics into this debate. It does seem strange that we are unable to speak of politics here."
"I did indeed say to the President of the Commission that he ought to resign if ever he decided to stand in the elections to the European Parliament. I said more besides."
"Firstly, the President of the Commission currently enjoys the support of practically all shades of the political spectrum in the House. He must therefore fulfil his responsibilities."
"As a citizen, however, he is entitled to make known his vision of the future of Europe."
"I therefore believe that the fact that he drafted this document on the European dream is a positive development. I should add that I find the document far superior to the speech he gave today."
"This said, I detected a degree of pique in what Mr Poettering said. He seemed to resent that someone who apparently belonged to one side should have defected to the other."
"As I see it, one has every right to correct oneself and mature as a person as one journeys through life. I for one welcome the fact that President Prodi has adopted a more socially and politically progressive stance."
"There should be abundant opportunity to discuss this in the future."
"In any case, between now and the last day of this legislature what we really need is a strong and determined Commission. I would say that the same applies to the Council."
"I believe the most outrageous behaviour we have witnessed during these last few days was when the President of the Council departed totally from the line taken by the Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament. He made unacceptable pronouncements concerning Chechnya and Russia."
"You all have the power to rectify the situation. We could join together when we vote tomorrow on the draft resolution on the Russia Summit."
"I should now like to focus on President Prodi’s speech."
"Firstly, I should like to say that I am not about to complain on behalf of my group about there being fewer proposals."
"Our difficulty is simply that we do not know what the proposals are."
"We have been informed that Vice-President de Palacio plans to meet committee chairmen. No doubt we shall find out then."
"In connection with assessing the Commissioners’ politics I should just like to mention that I shall be sending Mr Poettering the statements made on the Socialists by Mrs de Palacio. It has to be said that she does not miss a single Popular Party function in Spain."
"Mr Prodi is not the only one to be active in politics back home. We all are."
"Mr Prodi resorted to expressions more commonly used by weather forecasters in order to describe growth. He stated the outlook was set fair."
"I believe it would be very helpful for him to explain, on behalf of the Commission, how the latter intends to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to the new situation."
"This is a crucially important request."
"It goes hand in hand with the need to strengthen economic governance."
"I have also been struck by the fact that the financial perspective has been left until last, as if it were an afterthought."
"The Delors plan of ten years ago has indeed been revived. As I see it, it is important to discuss research and development, not just infrastructure."
"They are the nervous system energising the whole of the Community. I have also been struck that so little detail has been provided concerning reform of cohesion policy following the debate on the Sapir report and Commissioner Barnier’s statements."
"I believe the President of the Commission should be much more explicit. After all, this issue is crucial to the new Member States and also to the balance between current Member States."
"Secondly, Mr Prodi devoted practically half of this speech to Eurostat. I would like to suggest a number of qualifications here."
"Firstly, through the Casaca report, the European Parliament played a decisive role in the Eurostat issue, over and above the many reports drafted within the Commission and OLAF. I believe this must be emphasised, because new instruments are being introduced whilst overlooking the crucial role played by the European Parliament."
"I regret the other groups in the House did not agree to debate the Bösch report on fraud to coincide with the President’s presence. This report is available and the President himself referred to it."
"Regarding Eurostat, I note the proposal to define the nature of political responsibility and the reform of the Commission’s code of conduct. Nonetheless, I am surprised that a new instrument amounting in practice to a duplication of OLAF is now being proposed."
"I fear we may end up in a situation resembling the one illustrated by a cartoon from the Soviet era. This cartoon showed a citizen being trailed by two KGB agents."
"This is not a case of multiplying the instruments, but of acting in a clear and democratic manner. There is an important role for Parliament to play here."
"I do not think that the situation will be resolved by creating a new power centre within the Commission."
"Finding a loophole in every law is a widespread human weakness. I believe there are sayings to this effect in every language."
"There is certainly one in Spanish. It follows that bringing out more and more rules and regulations will not necessarily improve matters."
"What is required is the option of specific monitoring. In my view, the idea of establishing a link between OLAF and the European Prosecutor could be a way forward."
"I would like to hear the Council’s view on this rather than the Commission’s, since the main opposition to the European Prosecutor comes from the governments."
"It is not a contentious issue amongst ourselves."
"Mr President, I therefore feel it is essential to negotiate an urgent procedure to allow these issues to be discussed before the end of this legislature."
"President of the Commission, I would like to enquire whether you were thinking of a compromise solution for the December Conference Summit when you referred to 25 or 30 Commissioners."
"If the two figures are added together some countries end up with two Commissioners."
"My final point is the following: I should like to know if you are standing by your proposal to distribute portfolios and organise a Commission composed of so-called senior and junior Commissioners."
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to join others in expressing our solidarity, sympathy and condolences for the Italian and other victims of the attack in Iraq last week and, of course, the victims of the horrific attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul."
"I would like to depart from the political pyrotechnics of some of the previous interventions and focus on the subject at hand today – the annual legislative programme."
"I would first like to stress that the ELDR Group defends the right of the Commission President to express himself personally on political issues concerning the future of the European Union."
"I must however say that, as a Liberal who treasures the diversity and pluralism of public opinion, I have some personal doubts about the wisdom of advocating two opposing blocks in the European debate either here or, more generally, in the Member States."
"Turning to the annual programme, other colleagues will speak on the Eurostat issue later."
"The ELDR Group has consistently welcomed the progress made over the last few years in the way in which the Commission has presented this important document."
"Only a few years ago it was nothing more than an arbitrary shopping list of legislative and non-legislative proposals."
"There has been an attempt, both this year and in previous years, to include some strategic thinking and we welcome some of the recent innovations, such as the move towards more rigorous impact assessment procedures."
"However, as President Prodi himself rightly indicated, there is still much room for improvement, and we would like to highlight three areas in which we consider that the document presented to us today is still seriously lacking."
"Firstly, the selection of the three strategic priorities – namely enlargement, stability and growth – is fine."
"However, those priorities are so open-ended it is almost impossible to imagine anyone disagreeing with them."
"It is equally impossible to imagine any legislative or non-legislative proposal that would not fall under those three strategic priorities."
"In other words there seems to be no real choice about what the European Commission is proposing this year, and no choice about what the strategic priorities of the European Union should be."
"On the contrary, there is a risk of a very open-ended approach towards EU business because of the very open-ended nature of the three priorities themselves."
"Secondly, there is no discernible link between those three vague priorities and the lengthy annexes containing legislative and non-legislative proposals."
"We understand that one of the annexes – both of which include around fifty legislative proposals – is supposed to relate to the priorities, while the other is not."
"Those of you who have examined the lists will have seen that they are interchangeable."
"They are not clearly organised according to the priorities, but seem to have been organised artificially into two categories."
"In other words, the priorities themselves do not seem to have guided the selection of legislative and non-legislative proposals before us today, which again gives a somewhat artificial tenor to the selection of the proposals presented to us."
"Thirdly, as both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have mentioned, this summer we all signed an interinstitutional agreement explicitly designed to ensure better law-making in the European Union."
"The Commission explicitly committed itself, in that interinstitutional agreement, to explain fully today when it presents its annual legislative programme, firstly the choice of legislative instrument for each proposal, and secondly the choice of legal base."
"There are some indications on the legal bases, in these lengthy, somewhat impenetrable annexes, but no reference whatsoever to the choice of legislative instrument."
"It cannot be that, a few months after the signing of an interinstitutional agreement on better law-making, the Commission fails, at the first hurdle, to honour the promises made in that agreement."
"It bodes extremely ill for the improvement of law-making for that to be the case."
"This is a terrifically important moment in the political and legislative cycle in the European Union."
"It is the moment when the European Commission exercises its supreme privilege and prerogative – namely the monopoly right of initiative."
"That right of initiative is only ever defensible if exercised in a fully accountable, transparent manner in which motives are fully explained and political accountability is fully safeguarded."
"On the basis of what we have seen today, we do not believe that to be the case."
"There is still very significant room for improvement."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues, and especially my Italian ones, in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I should like to express our deepest sympathy with the badly hit Italian and Iraqi families."
"We absolutely deplore the dreadful acts carried out by the terrorist groups, and we condemn them most vigorously."
"I should like to use the GUE/NGL Group’s speaking time to talk about Eurostat, and I should like to make it quite clear that my group is not out to have the Prodi Commission dismissed because of Eurostat."
"On the contrary, we should like to bring this matter to a close and give the Commission peace to do its work in its last year."
"The Commission has a very ambitious work programme for 2004 with enlargement and the creation of stability and growth, not only in the EU but also in the rest of the world."
"Unfortunately, the Eurostat scandal will hang like a cloud over the Commission until political responsibility for it has been assigned, so we should like to call upon Mr Prodi to dismiss the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat so that the Commission can be given peace to do its work."
"We have now obtained the final report on Eurostat from the Internal Audit Service."
"It unfortunately confirms what we have known for a long time, namely that the administration of Eurostat has been scandalous."
"It has, however, been very difficult for the Internal Audit Service to establish what really went on in Eurostat."
"There are no files, and most documents are missing."
"It is therefore impossible to say very much about practice after 1999, but we know that the unlawful accounts were open right until the summer of last year and this year."
"We know there is a strong likelihood of a considerable amount of money having gone into the wrong pockets."
"We know that there is still no database of contracts."
"We know that the audits have not been followed up."
"We know that almost nothing has been done to tidy matters up."
"We know, in other words, that Eurostat’s administration has been scandalous, including after 1999."
"Is anyone taking responsibility, however?"
"No, apparently not."
"The Santer Commission fell just under five years ago."
"It did so because the Group of Wise Men concluded that it was very difficult to find anyone in the Commission who was willing to take responsibility."
"Following a host of reforms, we had in actual fact hoped that those times were over, but we have unfortunately been back in rather familiar territory in recent days."
"After the fall of the Santer Commission, we have now obtained a new article in the Treaty."
"It has now become possible for the Commission President to dismiss individual Commissioners."
"That is something Mr Prodi has chosen not to do, given that the person responsible, Mr Solbes, knew nothing."
"Mr Prodi has, however, conceded that Mr Solbes became guilty through having taken no action."
"That is, in my view and that of my group, reason enough."
"Passivity and indifference are also a form of crime, and one for which responsibility must be taken."
"Mr Prodi has today presented his action plan for Eurostat."
"I am obliged to say this very clearly: my group is sick to death of action plans."
"We want to see results."
"We have seen a host of action plans and plans for reform over the last four years."
"It is, of course, excellent to have plans for new and better procedures, and we shall naturally give our backing to such procedures."
"That is just not enough, however."
"The culture must be changed."
"It will be so only if the President sends a clear signal to his employees."
"Irregularities and fraud have consequences."
"We do in fact remember some wise words from Mr Prodi: zero tolerance for fraud."
"Fine words, but patently of no consequence."
"Less than a short hour ago, I issued a piece of advice in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It was that another Commissioner should be found to take over Eurostat in the last year, with Mr Solbes otherwise retaining his areas of responsibility."
"He gets bottom marks for his administration of Eurostat, however."
"With his passivity, he has been a party to maintaining a culture of systematic disarray and irregularities."
"He can, in other words, no longer have responsibility for Eurostat, and I now really do hope that the promise of consequences and of zero tolerance for fraud will be fulfilled and someone else found to take care of Eurostat."
"Mr President, my group, too, would like to express its sorrow and sympathy after the tragic events of recent days."
"It was silly to think that an unfounded war could miraculously produce peace and democracy."
"The Middle East is a daily reminder that one of the reasons that peace and democracy now seem increasingly distant possibilities is the international community’s inability to achieve genuine cohesion."
"The Commission President started his speech today with an optimistic reference to the economy and told us that the goal of a larger Europe which is capable of responding to the challenges of our time is within our reach."
"I agree, but I am afraid that, in some cases, the methods proposed reflect a somewhat conformist political and economic approach which is not centred on the most innovative and bold options open to the Union today."
"Mr Poettering, I can assure you that the approach underpinning the work programme is identical to that of President Prodi’s manifesto."
"Since our business is politics and we consider ourselves to be a genuinely European political force, our considerations apply to both documents."
"As the Commission itself admits, it has pursued only the economic aspects of the Lisbon strategy with any determination."
"President Prodi, that is not good enough!"
"We fear that behind the politically correct concept of sustainable development lurks the concept of continuous development."
"The environmental dimension continues to do a disappearing act at the crucial moments where existing practice and instruments are concerned."
"As you are aware, we believe the Growth Initiative to be very important, but we really cannot bring ourselves to share the general enthusiasm over the list of roads, airports and high-speed trains costing billions of euro, most of which are still at the planning stage."
"Something we see as crucial is the imperative need for greater transparency as regards the European Investment Bank funding criteria and greater involvement of the European Parliament in establishing those criteria."
"We are not convinced by the Commission’s continuing reluctance to launch an energy efficiency plan which turns its back on the nuclear sector completely."
"What we lack today is a convincing framework for investment in technologies which can saveresources and focus on social cohesion, education and innovation."
"Considering, in addition, the delayed presentation of the Commission’s proposals on reforming the Structural Funds, we can only harbour some doubts as to the Union’s ability to respond to the challenges of growth and enlargement in due time."
"The success of the Growth Initiative depends, not least, on discerning implementation of the Stability Pact – and we would like to hear your opinion again on this, President Prodi – and on a proper programme for observing the Kyoto Protocol."
"If the majority of the Member States do not change course, the Union will not be able to fulfil its obligations."
"A few months ago, President Prodi, we proposed the launch of a Climate Stability Pact, but I am afraid that we have not received any response."
"We are just a few weeks off the start of the COP9 in Milan and we would like to put this proposal forward once again."
"Just as in the matter of the deficit, it is the Commission which has the responsibility of calling to order those Member States – in particular Spain, Italy and Portugal – which, as things stand, will prevent us from achieving the Kyoto objectives."
"There are some points missing from your legislative programme."
"I do not have time to go into them all so I will just mention two."
"Commissioner Reding, the European Parliament has been calling for almost two years, genuinely united in its desire, for a proposal for a directive or, at least, a Green Paper, on media concentration and freedom of information."
"It is clear from your manifesto that you attach great importance to this issue."
"Why, then, can the Commission not manage to take action on this matter?"
"Lastly, a couple of months have passed since the failure of Cancún, yet we have absolutely no idea what conclusions and what lines of action the Commission intends to follow, and there is no link with the Millennium Goals either, Commissioner Lamy."
"Lastly, the question of Eurostat."
"President Prodi, you said you had learned a number of lessons from the Eurostat affair, but your text fails to mention one that is genuinely important: the Commission must pay greater heed to Parliament."
"The recommendations in the discharge reports are not just friendly advice – they are provisions which require the Commission to act and to do so in useful time."
"We used to have an unresponsive Commission and now we have a Commission which is capable of responses, and we do acknowledge this."
"Now, you have a year in which to make it capable of adopting decisive initiatives."
"We welcome the reform of the code of conduct and the improvement of the information channels between OLAF, the Commissioners and the Directorates-General, and it will not surprise you to hear that we also welcome the recognition of the role of whistleblowers."
"Moreover, many of these measures have already been called for by Parliament."
"We would remind you, however, President Prodi, that transparency is a good way not just of combating fraud but of preventing it too, and it is my genuine hope that, next year, in welcoming the new Members with open, transparent institutions as well as open arms, we will be able to put the events of recent years behind us."
"In any case, President Prodi, I would like to say in conclusion, on behalf of my group, that the report still fails to express awareness of a certain sense of responsibility and to acknowledge the errors made."
"As you, yourself, admitted, the initial signs were there before May 2003: it was a question of seeing them, and we feel that this is something we can be forgiven for expecting of the Commission, particularly after the events which marked the term of office of the Santer Commission."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to express sympathy and respect for the Italian police officers who, together with American and British soldiers, have been killed by terrorists in Iraq since Parliament last met."
"In the same way, we should like to express our sympathy and respect for those who lost their lives in the attacks on the synagogues in Turkey."
"The western world must stand united in combating terrorism."
"I should also like to talk about Commission President Prodi’s statement on the Eurostat scandal."
"Listening to his statement, as we have done today in the Committee on Budgetary Control, one would imagine that we had all just emerged from the primeval forest and that public administration was still something to be invented."
"Mr Prodi has reported on everything that does not work, referring to the lack of communication between the Commission and the control bodies, the OLAF internal audit, Parliament etc."
"Mr Prodi now promises that matters will be improved, but these problems are of course known by all governments with much larger administrations than the Commission’s."
"In all normal democracies, the political systems and administrations are developed in such a way that embezzlement and fraud are prevented or discovered very quickly."
"The Commission still has to devise all these arrangements."
"This can only be interpreted as an expression of total incompetence on the part of the Commission and as a lack of will in a system characterised by a down-at-heel administrative culture."
"That is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has such a lot of difficulty obtaining the analysis reports and has a duty of confidentiality imposed upon it with regard to everything it knows."
"Someone has known about the scandal for a very long time, and someone has wished to conceal it."
"Mr Prodi says that his reform, which was begun in 1999, is already working."
"How, then, will he explain the fact that the press and the European Parliament knew about the Eurostat scandal a good year before MEPs forced the Commission to act."
"Mr Prodi says that OLAF had been working on fraud in Eurostat for several years, without providing a word of information to the Commission, yet he says he has every confidence in Mr Brüner and OLAF."
"There are three possible explanations: either the Commission gave OLAF’s director completely fatuous instructions, with the result that he did not keep the Commission informed; or the Commission wished to leave unpleasant matters on the back burner for years in a secretive OLAF; or OLAF’s management is appallingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of sounding the alarm bells so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud."
"Mr Prodi says that he has now taken some tough decisions."
"No, Mr Prodi, you have not."
"You have merely suspended a few criminal bosses on full wages, and you have only done it under pressure from the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament."
"You bear full responsibility."
"This Parliament will be naive if it gives discharge for your administration."
"Mr President, there is a difference between guilt and responsibility."
"Who bears political responsibility for the Eurostat scandal?"
"The scandal is not that someone has had their fingers in the till."
"The most serious scandal is that we have an accounting system that still makes embezzlement possible."
"Forty-seven auditors and other experts have worked with Eurostat since June 2003."
"They have asked for 78 contracts but only received 60."
"Of those 60, 28.5% were implemented in contravention of EU rules governing invitations for tenders."
"Where are those 18 missing contracts?"
"Who is responsible for their not being there?"
"Who will obtain them?"
"There must of course be copies of the contracts in all the firms."
"Why have they not been obtained straight away, and where are the banks’ copies for the secret accounts?"
"Who is responsible for the fact that the 47 auditors do not have them?"
"Who is taking responsibility for ensuring that all the documents in proof now come to light?"
"Mr Prodi, you have just held a meeting with the Committee on Budgetary Control in my group’s offices, where you promised openness and zero tolerance for fraud, as you also did when you came to office in 1999."
"Up until now, however, zero tolerance has been shown first and foremost to those who have revealed fraud and warned against the accounting system that permits it."
"The Commission has shown efficiency in its dealings with Paul van Buitenen, Marta Andreasen and Dorte Smidt-Brown."
"They were quickly and resolutely frozen out."
"Who has responsibility for restoring their civil rights?"
"When will you say to Mr Solbes: ‘Pedro, you are not perhaps the guilty party, but Eurostat is your responsibility."
"Step down."
"I accept Mr Blak’s proposal and assume responsibility myself for providing a full explanation of the Eurostat scandal’."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot think of anyone who appreciates the sympathy expressed by Parliament at the murder of the Italian soldiers and Iraqi civilians."
"Those who have died know they were murdered for the same reasons as their US and UK colleagues and fellow-soldiers are being murdered, and for the same reasons that we find ourselves in Istanbul with a cowardly, two-faced, three-faced Europe, which, in general, needs the capacity offered by Istanbul in order to ensure that an Israeli has the same human rights as a Palestinian, the same human rights as someone who is in favour with this Europe of Vichy, with this Europe with pacifist tendencies, of this Europe of our Parliament, not even a tenth of which is present here this morning: just count the heads – 58 – not even a tenth of the elected representatives."
"That follows, however, for it is nothing but a voting machine, and it is a party political voting machine; this is a Europe which deserves no credit at all for expressing sympathy, for it is sympathy which is impersonal solidarity, solidarity against George Bush and with Saddam Hussein, always, consistently, in all events."
"Mr President of the Commission, as I read your ‘State of the Union’ speech I am reminded of something: it is as if the ‘State of the Union’ speech were being made by that Washington which your Europe hates, as it hated it in 1939 and 1940, as it hated the plutocratic Judaeo-Masonic democracies in the 1940s, as it hated the France of Jacques Doriot in addition to the France of Marshal Philippe Pétain, as it hated those who cried, ‘Die for Danzig, die for Danzig!’ – no, never, ! – when, in the name of pacifism, the murderous, shameful Munich Pact struck; the shameful pact which set the scene for the Holocaust and established the fascist, communist, fundamentalist, Counter-Reformist alliance."
"The Europe of reform, President Prodi?"
"Be patient: minus the beautiful baroque art of Bernini, this is the Europe of the Counter-Reformation, of the era when the undiluted perversion of the policies of the Pope-King made Dante Alighieri call a ‘shameless whore’ the See which exploited the story and mission of Christ in the interests of the most abasing worldly affairs – in the Vatican at that time but I say it is happening today too."
"I am quoting Dante, and, much as it pains me, I feel that the quotation is appropriate."
"The state of the Union, Mr President: according to the lines you are all taking – Parliament, Council and Commission – we should have a Commission comprising 30 members, soon to become 35, because we are the United States of Europe."
"Of course, the President of the United States ought to have 50 or so ministers to run the country effectively, is that not so?"
"It is not this way that you will unite a Europe which provides an alternative, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Alcide De Gasperi, of Konrad Adenauer rather than of Erich Ollenhauer or his other contemporary nationalistic social democrat rival."
"Such is the state of the Union."
"This Union, President Prodi, is what funds all the dictatorships with which it sustains relations, following a criminal policy."
"The provisions of Article 2, which are usually the basis for agreements with dictatorship regimes, are not worth the paper they are written on."
"At the moment, we have here in Strasbourg the representatives of the real Vietnam of tomorrow and all the years to come, we have representatives of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who are asking to see you."
"Every day, in the face of events in Vietnam, Cambodia and throughout the world, we, and Mr Solana and others, as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, essentially side with Milosevic against those fighting for democracy."
"The state of the Union is pitiful, for Europe is the Europe of television, of Munich, of fascism, of communism; it is a democratic and civil disgrace."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 is going to be a very important year, a year of challenges, as Mr Prodi has just said."
"Next June, European elections will be held in very special circumstances, when we welcome ten new countries in the most extensive enlargement that Europe has ever seen."
"They will take place in an atmosphere of hope for a constitution for Europe, on the basis of the excellent draft submitted by the Convention, all of this against an unstable international background, with an increasingly-entrenched war in Iraq, intensifying international terrorism, presidential elections in the United States and a still-fragile economic climate in Europe."
"In such a situation we need to hold to our course with a strong and independent Commission at the helm."
"If, as we all hope, there are signs of an economic recovery, the Commission must be able to respond so as to take advantage of all of the opportunities likely to benefit its economic and employment policy."
"The European Parliament cannot afford to lose a year."
"Our fellow citizens would not understand."
"We therefore need to concentrate on those proposals that absolutely must be adopted by the end of the parliamentary term, that is to say during the first quarter of 2004, and monitor progress on those that we are patiently waiting to scrutinise for the first time."
"For the second year running, we have maintained the principle of structured dialogue between parliamentary committees and commissioners."
"We welcome this, but the dialogue still has room for improvement."
"We therefore propose the creation of a more reliable interinstitutional timetable, to be drafted on a multiannual basis, which would make it easier to follow up and evaluate the actual results achieved."
"It would also be desirable to provide for more systematic follow-up to the demands made by Parliament for additional actions to be incorporated in the programme."
"As far as the accession of the ten new Member States is concerned, we have every confidence in the friends who will be joining us."
"We take note of the extraordinary progress that they have made, but we attach great importance to their respecting the and applying the texts relating to controls at the new external border."
"Similarly, we also think it is important to monitor the level of nuclear safety within the enlarged Union."
"This enlargement cannot succeed unless the institutional framework is adapted."
"Our group wishes to see the work of the Convention respected."
"This draft should therefore be safeguarded and must be recognisable in the constitutional treaty."
"The Commission has undertaken to improve our legislation, to make it more accessible, easier to read and more transparent, and to simplify law-making."
"We will ensure that it does so!"
"This is one of the public’s major expectations."
"The added value of the European Union rightly lies in policies which further the fight against illegal immigration, in common management of our borders and in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and this thanks to enhanced police and judicial cooperation and the development of a common asylum policy setting out clear procedures."
"These initiatives should be taken in cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the enlarged Union’s new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus."
"An additional key to stability is the concept of sustainable development, which should have a bearing on all of our legislative work."
"Making a success of sustainable development means fostering private initiative, educating and informing the public, continuing to pursue healthy macro-economic policies that generate jobs, accelerating structural reform and promoting investment in infrastructure and human resources."
"These initiatives should be undertaken in accordance with the Lisbon agenda, which seeks to boost potential economic performance by increasing the flexibility of the markets in goods, capital and labour."
"Whether it be transport policy, research policy, which is still insufficient in the light of the brain drain, telecommunications, with the development of the Internet, our Structural Funds policy, which is essential for revitalising the regions – and not only in the enlargement countries – all of our initiatives and policies should place the people at their heart."
"That is why we expect a robust commitment from you to take account of increasing life expectancy."
"All of this is part and parcel of sustainable development."
"Furthermore, although we warmly welcome the thematic strategies for the environment, we deplore the lack of initiatives on the urban environment and the lack of follow-up to the Thessaloniki Council, which was supposed to create a European diplomacy network on the environment and sustainable development."
"Even though next year is bound to be slightly curtailed by the European elections, neither the Commission nor Parliament will be short of work."
"As I said at the outset, you should hold to your course for 2004."
"Finally, I regret the obvious lack of commitment on the part of the Member States when it comes to implementing Community legislation, all the more so when the codecision procedure is used."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, you are right to make the issue of enlargement the central priority for 2004 in your proposals."
"In reality, enlargement has been formally agreed but in many people’s minds – perhaps in this House, but especially in the wider population – it is still not truly complete."
"For that reason, the Commission is right to focus in the coming months on ensuring that where there is corruption, where there are administrative issues to be resolved, and where nuclear safety is at stake, all the countries which are due to accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 are genuinely preparing to do so."
"Our negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania must continue too."
"We must state clearly and unequivocally that 2010 is the envisaged date – but no country can assume that the envisaged date will be the actual date unless they persist with the reforms they have begun."
"Mr Prodi, you will have the task of preparing the Council’s decision on Turkey next year."
"However, I would ask you to consider this: unless a positive decision is adopted in favour of opening accession negotiations, you will need to come up with ideas on how we can intensify our cooperation with Turkey until – and, indeed, during – the opening of negotiations."
"The events of recent days in Istanbul demonstrate the importance of cooperation with Turkey, especially on security issues."
"This closer and coordinated cooperation with Turkey is essential, irrespective of the accession issue."
"Enlargement also raises the issue of effective and secure external borders."
"I agree that this is an important aspect of our development, also in the context of the wider Europe."
"However, cooperation with our neighbours is also essential, for example, in preventing cross-border crime and combating the evils of human trafficking."
"Developments in the Balkans have shown that it is quite possible for the European Union to shape this cooperation productively."
"However, it is also crucial that when we talk about migration, we also talk about integration."
"I hope that the Commission will point out to some countries that it is not just a matter of restricting migration. The task is also to integrate the people who come to the European Union more fully into our societies."
"As regards policies for growth, which your programme also deals with extensively, we support the Commission’s proposals on investment in networks and knowledge."
"We need a swift decision here."
"This House must make some swift decisions in order to implement the Growth Initiative."
"Emphasising investment is all well and good, but networks and knowledge need investment too."
"Indeed, experience in recent months has shown that if we merely liberalise without creating incentives for investment in networks – such as energy or transport – at the same time, the temporary or even the longer-term collapse of networks may be the result."
"If we want to modernise Europe, we – and that means the European Union as a whole and, of course, all the individual Member States – must increase investment not only in knowledge but also in our infrastructure."
"On the issues of liberalisation and harmonisation, I would ask you, Mr Prodi, also to consider that we are trying to achieve a European social model. In my view, this is not adequately expressed in your paper."
"I sometimes have the impression that we are more liberal than the neoliberals in their theory books and more American than the Americans in some of our steps towards harmonisation and liberalisation."
"We must consider the social consequences. We must make combating social exclusion and poverty a priority."
"In some countries, poverty is on the increase again. Surely that is a catastrophe?"
"This may also be due to the fact that the austerity programmes do not adequately consider how spending cuts and liberalisation measures impact on various social groups."
"That is not an argument against liberalisation, but simply an argument for considering the social impacts of unemployment etc."
"In this context – and in my view, the paper does not focus adequately on this issue either – I would like to highlight the importance of public services, which we will be discussing next week in this House."
"Many public services are a particular feature of the European social model which we wish to stand up for, clearly and unequivocally, also to the outside world."
"I therefore ask you to take more account of that in your work"
"I would like to make two further comments."
"The first concerns foreign policy. This Parliament has very often discussed the position of this House and the European Union on the Middle East."
"We must have the strength and determination to pursue the goal we have set ourselves and clearly support all peace initiatives, the most recent being the Geneva Accord."
"However, none of the developments in the Middle East and none of the criticism we voice towards Israel remotely justifies anti-Semitic statements or actions."
"Europe must be clear that criticism of the present Israeli Government’s position cannot be a motive for any kind of anti-Semitic words or deeds."
"We should all have learned the lesson of the disaster of the Second World War in particular, and together, we should resolutely counter all forms of discrimination and anti-Semitism, notwithstanding our clear position on the Middle East."
"Mr Prodi, you have heard our views today. We want a strong Commission President and a strong Commission."
"Please do not add grist to the anti-European mill by raising uncertainty or, indeed, doubts that you will represent a strong Commission as its President until the elections next year. This is essential to ensure that when the voters go to the polls in June, they know what they are voting for, namely a strong and united Europe with a strong Commission and Commission President."
"Mr President, to begin with, I should like to say how encouraging it is that Commission President Prodi and the Commission have apparently learned from the Eurostat case, that there are a number of things that are to be tidied up and that a number of reforms are to be implemented so that nothing similar happens in the future."
"In the process that is now to be begun, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that we continue to have a strong internal audit service which, in spite of everything, is of course the first link in the chain when it comes to discovering fraud, misappropriation and irregularities."
"It is important for us to have a strong and independent OLAF."
"It is particularly important for us to have a clear definition of political responsibility."
"I think, in actual fact, that political responsibility is of crucial importance and, what is more, political responsibility borne by the individual Commissioner."
"If we do not have this, I do not believe it will be possible for the reforms to percolate through the system and down to the individual employee, lowest in the hierarchy."
"I therefore listened, of course, with great attention to Mr Prodi’s remark that we are now to have a definition of political responsibility."
"I should therefore like to ask the President of the Commission how the political responsibility we are now to have defined differs from that defined by the independent experts and that indicated in the Code of Conduct signed by the Commissioners in 1999."
"We are now also to have a monitoring unit for picking up signals if something goes wrong."
"Mr Prodi argues that the Commission did not have the ability to intervene prior to May 2003."
"My question, however, is this: what kind of signals is this group to pick up?"
"Now that it has emerged that 14 critical auditors’ reports are not enough, just as complaints from various employees to different Commissioners, letters in the press, hearings in the Committee on Budgetary Control and auditors’ letters to the Commissioner responsible in the department responsible are not enough, what kind of signals are needed before the Commission intervenes?"
"– Mr President, Commissioners, as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to briefly discuss the social state of Europe."
"For I have noticed that, slowly but surely, we are moving towards a situation in which social policy competition is increasing considerably and in which the European citizen might well conclude in time that social dumping will be playing a part, more so than is currently the case and more so than we can justify to the citizen in Europe."
"We would like a straight answer from the Commission to the question whether we can expect its position on employment directives before the end of March. This would allow us during the last plenary meeting in April to give our position on these employment directives against the backdrop of the current economic climate."
"We want to speed up the process of adopting directives in the area of the European works council and on working times, which have to do with social dumping."
"After all, in some countries, England being one of them, it is possible to work up to sixty hours or so."
"We want speed in the package that pertains to the Posting of Workers directives."
"We want acceleration where the European social funds are involved, and I could go on like this for at least another five minutes."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like once again to express our sympathy for the victims of the massacres of Nasiriya, for their families and for all the European armed forces engaged throughout the world in peace missions combating terrorism"
"I will now focus my speech on the Eurostat case."
"There are too many unresolved questions in this affair and the measures that have been taken to remedy matters are few and, I would venture to say, belated and, therefore, probably ineffective."
"My opinion was confirmed after President Prodi’s hearing before the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, in which he was, quite frankly, too general and, if I may say so, a little reticent."
"As regards the way the affair has been handled, given that we have a President who has made transparency one of his principal objectives, we do not understand why we have witnessed all kinds of endeavours to keep the documentation under wraps and avoid public debate in the Eurostat case, as if we were dealing with a state secret."
"There are too many questions, as I said."
"Has this drain on the EU’s funds come to an end?"
"If it has come to an end, when, exactly, did that happen?"
"Just this morning, the fact that the most serious incidents took place before 1999 was stressed once again."
"What about the less serious incidents?"
"When did they occur?"
"Are they still going on?"
"Most importantly, what is the criterion for assessing the seriousness of an incident?"
"The size of the sum taken, maybe?"
"I would respectfully point out that fraud is serious by its very nature, and it is much more serious and unacceptable when public officials are involved."
"Moreover, how is it possible for a fraudulent organisation to have succeeded in operating without hindrance for years in the Commission?"
"Are we really to believe that nobody noticed anything, despite the fact that rumours, faxes and emails on unlawful gains and fake contracts were flying around the Commission departments?"
"What is more, we fail to understand how the Commission’s watchdog system works, for many other outrageous incidents have been discovered in addition to the Eurostat affair, such as the case of cereal prices."
"In this connection, the most ridiculous thing – it would be laughable if the matter were not so serious – is that the document presented this morning states – and I would draw your attention to this – that we need gradually to lay the foundations for a new culture of responsibility and transparency."
"What are we to infer from this?"
"That, hitherto, irresponsibility and lack of transparency have been the norm in the Commission?"
"There is something else that needs to be said on the subject of Eurostat and the serious nature of the scandal surrounding the organisation."
"This is not just another department, one of the many centres of European bureaucracy: it is an institution which, in carrying out its recording and statistical work, is, in actual fact, the guarantor of the Stability Pact, verifying the implementation of the Maastricht criteria."
"It therefore plays a part in defining Member States’ economic and financial policies and, in practice, in forcing the States to adopt stringent policies which often involve budgetary or welfare cuts."
"It is therefore an institution which has a watchdog role and which cannot afford to be associated with even the remotest doubt or suspicion regarding its impartiality or authority of the kind currently surrounding it."
"We realise that the affair is embarrassing because public funds have been used for unlawful purposes; we also understand the problem caused by the fact that the affair has exploded at a sensitive time, on the eve of the European elections, of enlargement and of the Constitution; we understand the problem but we cannot compromise on the matter."
"We can neither condone nor, as some would have us do, underestimate the severity of the incidents of corruption, fraud and malpractice."
"It is the citizens who demand that we stand firm, the same citizens of whom we ask sacrifices in the name of the Stability Pact."
"What is more, instead of pointing the finger and making a scapegoat out of some civil servant and bringing the affair to a hasty conclusion in this way, we would have greatly appreciated it if the Commission had fully shouldered its responsibilities, as Mr Santer did over much less."
"We cannot let all this pass without speaking out, especially at a time when the President of the Commission is disseminating a political manifesto – or maybe we should call it an electoral manifesto – describing the Europe of his dreams while neglecting the Europe that exists here and now."
"As if things were not bad enough already! President Prodi is entitled to put himself forward as a candidate for the next European elections, but, if this is his intention, we expect him to do things properly and resign."
"On the other hand, the damage this would cause at institutional level would be severe and, quite frankly, unacceptable."
"Mr President, I want to make clear my distaste for the complete farce that went on over the release of the OLAF report and the reports on Eurostat."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I was perfectly entitled to see those reports without being subjected to a ridiculous Stalinist rigmarole."
"It clearly demonstrates the Commission's contempt for this Parliament, for democracy and for the people that ultimately have to underwrite the Eurostat corruption, by which I mean the taxpayers of Europe."
"The report highlights the fundamentally inadequate procedures for combating fraud and more importantly how slow the Commission was to react to clear evidence of major problems within Eurostat."
"I am also deeply concerned about the snail's pace at which OLAF worked in investigating this whole sorry matter."
"The stench of graft is all around us and is getting stronger by the day."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have before me President Prodi’s manifesto."
"It contains good ideas, even if they may be a little trivial and general; some of them certainly deserve support and others less so, but, although I do not object to the Commission President drawing up a political document – he is still entitled to his own political views – it is unacceptable that he should address an individual country and an individual party in this manifesto."
"It should also be pointed out – and I am going to do so – that, in his position, rather than expressing ideas he should be making things happen."
"He is the President of the Commission: he is in a position to accomplish things, he can take steps to make them law."
"As regards the fact that he said that his manifesto is addressed to the whole of Europe, I beg to differ."
"Indeed, I quote: ‘It is against this backdrop that, turning to Italy and the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament next spring, I have proposed that all reformists ...’ and so on."
"Then the document makes a clear reference to the Olive Tree for it says: ‘But the inspiration is still the original inspiration behind the Olive Tree’."
"This is therefore a partisan document, which is unacceptable from the President of the Commission."
"If Mr Prodi claims to have addressed Europe as a whole then he is speaking a load of codswallop, not least in that I do not seem to remember seeing any olive trees sprouting up and growing in countries such as Sweden or Finland."
"Mr President, I, like other colleagues, welcome this debate, because it makes sense to have a debate on the legislative programme before we take decisions on the 2004 budget."
"The priority of enlargement, along with the other two priorities, makes real sense for the European Union."
"Since most of the Commission is here, it would make sense to summon all our colleagues in order to hold a real debate on what the European Union is going to be."
"That would suggest we should cancel all meetings outside the Chamber to allow our colleagues to be present."
"I wish to make a remark about the Commission reforms which, as you have said, Mr President, were the reason for the Commission coming into office."
"My Group has continually pressed for reforms based on the Wise Men's report."
"There has been significant progress, and most recently we received a very positive document detailing changes in the financial regulation and the staff regulations yesterday evening in the Committee on Budgets."
"However, this document still fails to address the weaknesses in the way the Commission is operating, as revealed by the Eurostat affair."
"In the light of the three steps you outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, my Group is disappointed at the way in which the reforms have been implemented."
"One or two of our members said to you that reforms in relation to the flow of information, proper internal audits and Commissioners' responsibility for the services they run should have been completed by September 1999."
"If the institutions are to be successfully reformed, which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run, it is a problem, as Mr Blak has said, that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility."
"You have sacked a Director-General, but the Commissioners are still in place."
"You reassured us this morning in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commissioners will have responsibility, but there are still unanswered questions."
"My main question, to which I would like a reply, Mr President of the Commission, concerns the internal documents relating to Eurostat."
"You have come forward with proposals for the reorganisation of OLAF."
"However, we as a Parliament are still waiting for OLAF's report on Eurostat."
"Are the suggestions for reorganising the whole system coming from OLAF, because OLAF is a Commission service, or are we going to be able to have OLAF's report so that we as a Parliament can assess the situation and come to a conclusion?"
"Other speakers have already said that we will need a strong Commission during 2004 to ensure that we can manage the responsibilities of the Union effectively."
"– Mr Elles, I share your view about the presence of Members, but unfortunately the President cannot run Parliament like a regiment of soldiers."
"Mr President, it was a good thing, Mr Prodi, that you attended the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, and it is important to say so."
"As a matter of principle, I would like to draw attention to the PSE Group’s concerns about the Eurostat affair, but about other issues as well."
"It is not good if the Commission always needs a new scandal before it takes a further step along its road to reform."
"This is constant grist to Mr Bonde’s mill – if I may be so bold as to name names – and he makes political capital out of it."
"That is one lesson the Commission should learn."
"Let me now turn to some individual points."
"I greatly welcome your announcement this morning that the information channels between OLAF and the Commission are to be reviewed."
"That is necessary."
"However – and let me speak plainly – this must include answering the question how the Commission deals internally with information from OLAF, so that this information is not simply buried in the files without anyone knowing about it while everyone has their knives out for the Commission."
"I also welcome the fact that when asked, you clarified to the Commission on Budgetary Control that your proposals on the reform of OLAF do not imply that you are questioning or restricting OLAF’s responsibility for internal investigations."
"That is very important, for it would have resulted in a major clash with this House."
"We want to see OLAF as an independent agency, especially in light of the internal investigations, and so I welcome your clarifying this point to the Committee on Budgetary Control and urge you to continue along this course."
"Let me comment on the issue of political responsibility."
"We have always adopted the position that the Commissioners should also be able to exercise this responsibility."
"Based on your statement this morning and the fact that a supplement to the Code of Conduct has again become necessary – describing how the Commissioners themselves should ask questions and how the services and the Directorates-General should be obliged to inform the Commissioners about problems, or landmines – I can only assume that this has not been set down on paper or been common practice."
"That was how we analysed the situation in July."
"However, the time has come to learn lessons from this."
"We want a radical reform of the relations between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners, and we will scrutinise your proposals to see whether they match these requirements."
"Mr President, whenever we speak, just about anywhere in our own countries, particularly over the past five years, there is one topic that is always particularly sensitive, which is: how are the finances being managed?"
"Then the general opinion on Brussels is not all that great."
"This is why it was very much to be welcomed that the Prodi Commission declared that from now on, there would be zero tolerance across the board."
"We were therefore very shocked to hear the claims made in connection with Eurostat a few months ago."
"It has to be said that the Commission was quick to react when the news broke, but the big question is: what did the Commission know before that point?"
"In my view, there are clear indications that the Commission, in the years leading up to May 2003, could have had some knowledge of what was happening at Eurostat."
"The Commission failed to take any action in the light of that information."
"Although it may talk about the need to improve information, we were told at regular intervals that an enquiry had begun at Eurostat."
"The big question is: why did the alarm bells not go off sooner in the Commission?"
"When I hear the Commission speak, the main point it is driving home is that it is proud of the results achieved."
"In fact, the Court of Auditors stated yesterday that there are signs of improvement, and the Commission can be proud of this, with good reason."
"However, as for the aspects that went clearly wrong, the Commission washes its hands of them."
"The fault lies with OLAF, or the director-general, or whoever, but not with the Commission."
"That is wrong."
"I can only refer to an English politician, maybe a statesman – Mr Kinnock will undoubtedly know him – Lord Carrington."
"He knew nothing of the Falklands war, he was not sufficiently informed and despite this, he assumed the political responsibility for it."
"That is a very honourable position in my view."
"In the political culture from which I come, a minister, a secretary of state or a councillor is always responsible, and that should also be the case for a Commissioner and for the Commission."
"That is an issue on which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be focusing."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, your Commission was not formed out of the blue."
"It succeeded the Santer Commission, which had to go precisely because nobody took responsibility."
"You stated that you were going to apply zero tolerance, and we took you seriously."
"At the moment, however, we are utterly disappointed."
"After all, it has taken a thousand press articles before Parliament was informed about the Eurostat fraud, and today, you are bringing us a fine story, showing, in fact, that you are evaluating OLAF rather than Eurostat and your own responsibility."
"You stated that the Commission should take the political responsibility for OLAF's actions without having the means to do this."
"I find this incredible and ,I would follow this up by saying that the Commission is also politically responsible for Eurostat. In its defence, the Commission states that is does not have the means for that either."
"The gospel contains a fine fable which states: Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness, how can you season?"
"Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another. I would like us to ..."
"– Mr President, formally speaking, the Commission’s work programme for 2004 is well presented, but reading it does not give the impression that next year is going to be a historic turning point for the European Union."
"Of course, its priorities have to be approved, first and foremost the end of the accession procedure for the ten new members and the creation of a neighbourhood policy for the enlarged Union, establishing an area of peace and prosperity on the basis of shared values and interests."
"Here we see a concern to step up the fight against illegal immigration, which is given greater prominence than in previous programmes."
"Its move up the list of priorities is realistic and must of course be followed by tangible initiatives."
"Approval also has to be given to efforts to establish sustainable growth through a whole series of initiatives, including, amongst others, the Lisbon objectives and the major public works programmes that are currently being planned."
"Nevertheless, we remain perplexed about the calls for increased coordination of economic and budgetary matters, along the lines of the stability pact, as this risks on the contrary reducing flexibility, which would have an adverse impact on growth."
"Finally, this programme leaves many questions unanswered."
"Some are inevitable: 2004 is full of uncertainty, with the European elections, the renewal of the Commission and the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of which no one can know in advance."
"Other questions concern enlargement, which does not amount solely to an accession procedure, as the document that has been tabled would seem to suggest, but which is also going to mean a significant change in working methods, including in the Commission."
"Will these working methods remain the same, as the document would seem to assume, or will they have to be changed?"
"In addition, will we have to reckon with more differentiation?"
"President Prodi only referred to this briefly at the end of his statement, just now, but we would have liked the document to address this issue in more detail."
"A way must be found to restore the harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission. It is to that strategic alliance that so many advances in the project of European Union were due."
"Nowadays we think of ourselves as citizens of a Union, not as mere consumers in a large market. The concept of a consumer implies the existence of a market."
"The concept of citizenship, however, demands and requires the existence of a Parliament as a . Such a Parliament needs to be a functioning entity."
"It must also be in a position to audit the Commissioners appointed, to invest the Commission, and to exercise democratic control over the latter. It has to be a Parliament capable of debate, rebuttal, ratification and rectification."
"It must be a Parliament firmly anchored in the real world that is not vain enough to court stardom. It must not adopt an arrogant stance either."
"Such a Parliament is certainly called upon to cooperate with the Commission, as the latter is a key institution in the project for European integration. Nonetheless, Parliament must also continue to play a vital and leading role in the future."
"This vital cooperation between Parliament and the Commission must not prevent the Commission from continuing with its activities. The Commission must always be governed by criteria of transparency, clarity, honesty and efficiency."
"For its part, Parliament must also demonstrate a capacity to distinguish between the essential and the ancillary. It must not succumb to the temptation of adopting a permanently hostile attitude to the Commission."
"It must exercise its rights and duties, in other words, its responsibilities to the citizens, with a sense of proportion, responsibility and in a measured manner. Sadly, Mr Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has been found wanting in this respect."
"Mr Baron raised doubts concerning the activities of Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission. Mrs de Palacio has a fine record of defending European interests."
"Many have good cause to be grateful to her. Further, she is irrevocably committed to the cause of the victims of terrorism and to the cause of freedom and the right to life in the Basque Country."
"I have to say, Mr President, that I was surprised to hear Mr Baron speak of awarding so-called compatibility certificates when you consider he occupies a seat in this House whilst simultaneously holding a seat on the Madrid town council."
"In conclusion, I should like to state that the measures proposed by the President of the Commission are on the right lines, taking into account also developments in what has become known as the Eurostat case. Even though I am of a different political persuasion, I have no doubts as to the integrity of the Commissioner in question."
"There is a general reluctance to stick one’s neck out for anyone these days."
"Nonetheless, I am prepared to vouch for the honesty of the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, and for the measures he has proposed concerning amendment of OLAFs remit."
"These measures are on the right lines and aim to restore that strategic alliance and harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission on which so much of the progress made in the European Union project is based."
"– Mr President, many EU citizens consider bureaucratic Brussels as something that does not concern them."
"The challenge which faced the newly-elected Parliament and the Commission in 1999 was to change this attitude."
"Over the past couple of years, the Commission has published different proposals for administrative reform within the framework of the European treaties.The Kinnock reforms focused on human resources policy and a result-oriented budget."
"Via the European Parliament, a whistle-blowing regulation was introduced."
"Thanks to the White Paper on good governance, we obtained programmes for the codification and simplification of existing legislation."
"Legislative programmes were said to be reduced by 35 000 pages."
"As proposed by Parliament, an interinstitutional agreement was adopted on better legislation, containing proposals for alternative forms of regulation, with the option for Parliament and the Council to have a monitoring role as legislators."
"The Convention subsequently resulted in a reduction in the number of types of decisions from twenty-seven to only six. It also led to a clear and adequate distribution of tasks between Europe and the Member States, and a greater role for local and regional authorities."
"We would like to give Europe back to the citizen, to adopt policy from the bottom up."
"Accordingly, we are giving the national parliaments a greater role in order to help us in the European Parliament to monitor compliance with subsidiarity."
"Keep things at a national level where possible and do at European level what has to be done in a European context."
"We are therefore carrying out reforms both within and outside of the framework of the Treaties."
"Thanks to these, Europe will be able to perform better and more democratically, for example in the area of cross-border crime."
"What is irritating is that those achievements are sometimes at risk of being cancelled out by incidents such as Eurostat."
"Quite apart from the matter itself, it is of major importance for the Commissioners' political responsibility for their officials to be 100% possible and clear, not soon but now."
"The citizens and the European Parliament want a democracy, not a technocracy."
"Thanks to the White Paper and many actions that have subsequently been taken by Parliament and by the Commission, better and more effective legislation and administration have been established to a great extent."
"This has been done by guaranteeing access to documents for the citizens, by remaining committed to a modern human resources policy and a result-oriented budget, by working on announced impact assessments, for example in the economic, social and environmental fields, and by actually implementing the interinstitutional agreement."
"Actions speak louder than words."
"In a nutshell, we are working towards a recognisable and approachable European administration."
"In this respect, the coming into being of the constitution will be crucial to the European citizens."
"We need results in 2004."
"There is no need for an electoral handbrake; this is not about winning the battle of Italy, but the battle of winning the hearts and minds of the European public."
"We would ask Italy to launch into an energetic final sprint, and I know that Italians are experts when it comes to cycling and final sprints."
"We would wish Mr Prodi and his Commission that success in 2004."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Council representative, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with everything Mr Salafranca has said on Eurostat and, in this opinion, I would point out the rightful need for a transparent response, which has been fully met by what the Commission has done and by the action plan presented today."
"It is worrying that we should continue to exploit this matter for political ends, blowing out of all proportion a question which is certainly not central to the life of the Union, while the Iraq tragedy strikes once again, reminding us of our inability to act and, what is more, our hypocrisy in the face of a war which was started to combat terrorism but which has ultimately served only to fuel it."
"We are not involved."
"We do not have our finger on the world’s pulse."
"Our times demand a great injection of political measures, giving Europe a soul and making it more than a wounded, helpless giant that some people continue today to want to see caught in the vice of bureaucratic neutrality: we need more politics of the kind proposed in Mr Prodi’s document, which he has addressed as a European citizen to his own country, first and foremost, but which applies to the Union as a whole and to all its political groupings, including the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Poettering, the many Christian democrats whom you should be representing as well, who cannot sit back and accept any shift to the right."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi most sincerely for appearing before the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should also like to thank him for addressing the House today and giving such a clear account of concerns for the future."
"We strongly agree that it is necessary to work for the future and to improve on what has not been done well so far. We are therefore glad to hear talk of reforming the reform, if I may put it like that."
"In other words, despite reforms or attempts at reform some things have not gone well. Further reform is needed."
"Nonetheless, Mr Prodi, Members of the House also like to discuss what has taken place during these four years and what has not worked well."
"Parliament’s critical approach is aimed in fact at improving things in the future."
"We hope it will be possible to avoid repeating some of the difficulties we are currently confronted with."
"This is why we could have welcomed more detailed responses from you on certain issues, Mr Prodi. We need to be confident that the problems currently causing us serious concern will not recur in the future."
"We are concerned because we in Parliament wish to work with the Commission. We want to cooperate to strengthen and improve European institutions still further."
"What is needed is a strong Parliament alongside a strong Commission, Mr Prodi."
"At the same time, it is of course a positive approach. Mr Prodi, you must be in no doubt that our aim is for the Commission to become better and stronger as we go forward into the future."
"After all, that is the message we have to deliver when we stand in the European elections. We will be telling the citizens that they must vote in elections to the European Parliament to promote still stronger institutions."
"That is the positive message we must convey. We would like to work with the Commission to get it across."
"Mr Prodi, please bear in mind therefore that our criticism is always positive and is aimed at facilitating solutions acceptable to all."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that behind every legislative programme lies a political project."
"From this point of view, 2004 ought to be the year that will allow us to reconcile two absolutely essential objectives of our Union: peace and prosperity."
"In other words, we have no chance of successfully meeting any of the challenges that await us in 2004 unless we re-lay the foundations for prosperity on our continent."
"The third objective set for 2004 by the Commission, sustainable development, is therefore absolutely essential in the light of the Union’s current economic situation."
"In this context my group dares to hope that the Commission will make employment a clear priority, because neither enlargement nor a new constitution will be acceptable to our fellow citizens unless we first turn our attention to the issue of employment."
"To do so, we also need investment, both private and public, in human resources and we need a return to a level of growth that is sufficient to increase the quality of life of our fellow citizens."
"We must not rely solely on variations in interest rates or on the outside world to deliver growth areas for the Union."
"We might perhaps regret the fact, moreover, that the Commission has not, in its wide-ranging programme for 2004, addressed more explicitly the question of economic governance, above all given that the conditions in which the Commission is intending to prepare the spring summit, particularly as regards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, do not yet appear to be quite clear."
"We need to know under what conditions the new Commission will have to implement the follow-up to this strategy and with this in mind, it might perhaps be useful for the outgoing Commission to draft an assessment of the first phase of the strategy."
"Lastly, it seems to me that the Commission’s programme ought to give a higher profile to the issue of sustainable development."
"I also note that despite a totally unrealistic number of new legislative proposals, some omissions can be observed."
"Firstly, there is not a word about the second reading of the directive on investment services, when it is a text on which we have done a great deal of work. I therefore dare to hope that we will be able to complete it before the end of this parliamentary term."
"The same goes for the review of the Financial Services Action Plan and the extension of the use of the Lamfalussy procedure."
"This Commission and this Parliament ought to conclude work on all of these dossiers in the course of 2004."
"Let me finish by saying how surprised I am, Mr President of the Commission, that your legislative programme, which is so heavy and so crowded, does not even mention a framework directive on services of general interest, something that my group and this House as a whole have repeatedly requested, and for which the Convention also expressed a strong desire."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I turn to you, Mr President, in your capacity as chairman of the Conference of Presidents."
"As you know, the parliamentary committees have been fully involved in preparing the legislative and work programme that Mr Prodi has just presented."
"It is thanks to this interinstitutional dialogue that today we have a programme for 2004 that largely reflects the shared priorities of our institutions."
"Nevertheless, there is certainly still room for improvement."
"Although the Commission has not taken account of all the requests made by the parliamentary committees, experience shows that the reliability of the timetables could be further improved."
"By way of an example, seventeen of the twenty-two proposals for codecision in the 2004 programme have already appeared in previous annual programmes and ought therefore to have been tabled long ago."
"It is therefore essential for both parties to monitor this programme carefully."
"In this context I would remind you that last year Parliament put forward the idea of having policy papers for each legislative area."
"These would form the basis for more detailed programming and would also be entirely in keeping with the objectives of the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’, which requires the three institutions to both better coordinate and better synchronise their legislative work."
"I would stress the three institutions because the Council is not currently involved in the structured dialogue."
"At the next Brussels meeting of the European Council, the Council’s first multiannual programme will be presented."
"It would be helpful if the European Parliament could be informed of the programme in good time precisely so as to establish a constructive dialogue between the three institutions concerned."
"I will also take the liberty of drawing your attention to the need to agree a procedure for an dialogue with the Commission for the year 2004."
"We will be addressing this issue this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents."
"But in my opinion it is essential that every effort be made to ensure that all of the stakeholders, including national parliaments and advisory bodies and, at the end of the day, the European public, have a legislative programme for the year 2005 in good time."
"If it is true that the current Commission really will be able to present its political strategy and budget for 2005 to the Union before October of next year then it should also be able to present its legislative programme during the course of that same month of October."
"Last year, I said here that I was convinced that, thanks to the structured dialogue, we were seeing the establishment of a genuine culture of planning and interinstitutional programming."
"The experiences of these last few months and the prospects for the future are in line with the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’ and fully confirm my optimism."
"It is up to all of us to work on this together in the interests of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is the year in which it was planned to conclude the programme laid down at the Tampere European Council. In addition, in the short time remaining we need to integrate the ten new states into this objective."
"The objective remains unfixed. We have repeatedly expressed Parliament’s concerns about the integration of the Tampere objectives in the acceding countries."
"As regards the internal situation, I am very concerned at the length of list 4 at this late stage. This is the list awaiting decision by the legislator."
"It contains the directive concerning conditions of entry and stay in the European Union for reasons of work or study."
"It also contains the decision to be taken on granting asylum status and the minimum conditions for people to request asylum in Europe."
"The statute of long-term residents and the directive on family reunification should also be on the list. Although a decision has been taken on the latter there are countless exceptions to it, to the extent that there is really nothing to choose between having this directive and having fifteen different sets of legislation."
"True, this is a problem for the Council."
"Nonetheless, it is also the Commission’s responsibility to defend the programme it has itself proposed and to defend it strongly. The programme is good, consistent and global."
"The Commission must defend it as Mr Prodi stated a few weeks ago before the House when he spoke following the tragedy of the victims in Italy. Sadly, that tragedy was repeated in Spain."
"Mr Prodi, you can count on our support in defending the programme before the Council."
"The Council is currently exerting strong pressure to establish disjointed measures regarding what it terms illegal immigration. These measures are doomed to failure."
"I am not making an ideological statement. Rather, I am stating it is clearly impossible to take account only of the point of view of ministers responsible for home affairs in as complex and global an issue as immigration."
"I urge you to put immigration in its broadest sense on the agenda for relations with our neighbours."
"It has to be a factor in achieving stability and prosperity."
"Immigration also needs to be linked to employment, as has already been the case."
"You can count on our support over this."
"There is also an extensive list of decisions outstanding in the field of cooperation over criminal issues."
"Curiously, that list contains, amongst others, the directives on the protection of the Community’s interests and combating people trafficking."
"As I said, this is curious."
"I appeal to you to deal with these issues as a matter of priority. Once again, you can rely on Parliament’s support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission President began his statement this morning by saying that the Union is in a good state of health."
"What planet is he on?"
"The Stability Pact, one of the foundations of our single currency, is in jeopardy, and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union."
"With his extremely ill-considered description of the Pact as the ‘Stupidity Pact’, the Commission President has himself contributed to its derailment."
"Two major countries have blatantly departed from compliance with the Stability Pact’s rules. Regrettably, this includes my own country, which pushed for the launch of the Pact in the first place."
"How, and with what authority, does the Commission President intend to call these countries to order given that he himself has helped to undermine the Pact?"
"What is the Commission President actually doing to counter the threat to the Pact which also emanates from the Convention’s draft?"
"Who actually authorised the Convention to delete the goal of price stability from the catalogue of Union objectives?"
"Price stability is the basis of the Union’s entire monetary constitution."
"In Germany, we lobbied for our public’s endorsement of the single currency and the phasing out of the Deutschmark by assuring them that price stability and the independence of the Central Bank would be guaranteed."
"We will feel cheated if the goal of price stability is now softened and price stability is put on the backburner."
"That is why, Mr Prodi, we expect you to give Commissioner Solbes your backing on this matter, not stab him in the back."
"As a second point, you mentioned the Lisbon strategy."
"In ten years’ time, we will supposedly be the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world. Is this anything more than empty words?"
"Believe me, Mr President, you will need to change your legislative culture in more ways than one if we are to achieve this objective!"
"Mr President, Italy currently holds the Presidency of the Council, and a distinguished Italian, Mr Prodi, is President of the Commission. Consequently my first words must surely be words of condolence to the Italian people following the tragic events of recent days."
"I should like to turn now to a subject Mr Prodi dwelt on at length, namely the issue of controls."
"In modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control."
"Mr Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, referred earlier to the Casaca report on the importance of Parliament as a source of political power. There are also the legislative controls."
"As Mr Baron said previously, duplication of administrative controls must be prevented."
"Administrative controls have their place within administration. I do not believe, however, that the outstanding issues before us today can ever be adequately dealt with without an ordered system of political and legislative control."
"Secondly, the Commission’s legislative programme focuses on enlargement."
"In this connection I am bound to reflect the very grave concerns felt by this House following the Commission’s latest monitoring report presented by Mr Verheugen in plenary."
"We wonder how many of the acceding countries really are in a position to transpose the Community between now and 1 May."
"In the event of one or more of these countries failing to fulfil the relevant requirements, we wonder too what measures the Commission intends to propose and what measures the Council intends to adopt to prevent such countries joining the Community."
"I also have to say that this House was taken aback by the Latvian Government’s decision to relieve one of its members of the duty of observer at the European Parliament, because the member concerned had expressed opinions at variance with the official government line."
"This is all linked to the issue of minority populations in the Baltic States. The question arises as to whether these countries are meeting the fundamental Copenhagen criterion of having an open and functioning democratic system in place."
"The legislative programme also contains a reference to the Union’s new neighbours. In particular, there is a suggestion of creating common areas for matters of justice and home affairs together with Russia and Ukraine."
"I would remind you of recent events in those countries. Leaders of industry have been arrested, imprisoned and tried."
"It seems likely that this was done for political reasons, not for strictly legal ones. One might well wonder how much we could have in common with governments of that ilk."
"Finally, I should like to raise an issue touched upon by Mr Clegg and Mr van den Berg amongst others. I refer to the adoption of the interinstitutional agreement."
"I note that the President failed to refer to this agreement in any way. Though it is recent, this agreement is of major importance."
"It would be appropriate for the Commission to provide the House with some information on the implications of this agreement for the Commission’s legislative programme."
"Mr President, I would begin by emphasising some of the remarks made in this Chamber today regarding our concern about EU accounting."
"That concern is more widespread than I can recall on any previous occasion."
"Looking at Annex 3 of the Communication from the Commission, I am particularly concerned to see that the Prodi Commission is claiming great success in this area."
"Its commitment to achieve a broad programme of internal reform includes agreeing a new financial regulation for the management of Community funds."
"However, there is nothing new about the Eurostat crisis or the background to it, while the Court of Auditors has been unable to sign off the accounts for nine successive years"
"Let us not say that Parliament is suddenly completely in the clear over this."
"Parliament has, notwithstanding the approach taken by the Court of Auditors, passed those accounts year-in year-out, so there is no doubt whatsoever that the Commission has been led to the view that these were not matters of sufficiently high concern to Parliament."
"If that has changed I welcome it."
"Why do I welcome it?"
"Because at this moment EU citizens regard the Commission as synonymous with negatives as regards fraud, maladministration and shoddy accounting."
"I very much regret that and take the view that the European Union's image should be improved."
"We look to the Commission to address that issue."
"How can it do this?"
"Very simply by addressing the concerns that have been raised, by not disregarding those concerns and by taking action in relation to the position of the whistleblowers who have drawn them to public attention."
"There are currently three such persons who have been suspended from their duties."
"I call on the Commissioner to take action to ensure that those people who have drawn attention to the scandals relating to EU accounting, and whose current suspension is completely misunderstood by the people of Europe, are restored to the role of clearing up the EU's accounts."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on the issue of culture, and I welcome the Commission’s endeavours in the field of education, youth and culture, also for 2003. For 2004, you list a work programme with seven proposals of interest to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"I must start by voicing criticism of the fact that these work and action programmes are always submitted relatively late in the day."
"As a result, we are currently negotiating the programmes for youth, culture, organisations and vocational training. We are under enormous time pressure and have to find solutions under these conditions."
"Otherwise, the programmes for next year will fail and will not be implemented. No one wants to be exposed to this criticism and, above all, this responsibility."
"The priorities of the Commission’s action programme for 2004 do not necessarily lie in the area of education, youth and culture. For specific reasons, it has other priorities, such as enlargement, parliamentary elections, economic security etc."
"Nonetheless, I would ask the Commission not to neglect education, youth and culture."
"In the planning timetable for this year, the objectives set were far higher than actually achieved."
"I am thinking, for example, of legislative proposals which should have been adopted in September or October, such as the Europass Training, European CV, etc. but which were postponed, may be adopted at the end of this year, and in some cases will be implemented in 2004. The post-2006 training programmes are a case in point, which are a key aspect of cultural policy."
"I therefore call on the Commission to adopt the pledged proposals to ensure that they can at least pass through their first reading in Parliament during this electoral term."
"I wish to draw particular attention to the legislative proposals in the audiovisual sector, which are supposed to be submitted in December."
"There is still no text submitted for the long-announced revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive."
"What we have instead is an apparently never-ending consultation process by the Commission."
"The accession of ten new Member States, stability and sustainable growth are undoubtedly important, but this does not mean that culture and education should be overlooked."
"Education must be a priority for enlargement."
"Topics should be interlinked."
"The focus should not always be on economic and political linkage."
"Culture and education must be integrated more fully, education as the basis for progress and development in the European Union, and culture as a prerequisite for community relations, dialogue and respect for cultural diversity."
"– Mr President, I should like to concur with the words spoken, to my great delight, by Mr Nassauer, namely that the implementation of the 2004 work programme is starting under a very dark cloud, particularly on account of the fact that the two key countries, France and Germany, which, in the framework of the EMU, invented the Stability Pact, have, five years down the line, pretty much forgotten the promises they made."
"And that the architects of this pact have shifted from being strong to being weak, from being stable to being unstable, from being reliable to being unreliable, and from having a sense of responsibility to having no sense of responsibility."
"These are the terrible facts that were also recently reaffirmed on Dutch television by the director of the Dutch Bank, when he also remarked that without a Stability Pact, there would not have been a euro and that we are even being taken for a ride by those who have drafted this Stability Pact."
"It is under this cloud that further discussions on the EU's enlargement are taking place."
"There are a few more countries waiting to join."
"In my view, it is very important for us to doggedly persevere with honest and coherent policy, and also to remain strict with those countries in respect of the criteria, particularly where the issues of the rule of law, democracy and good neighbourliness are concerned."
"It is unwise to treat the Balkan countries as if the race were already over."
"Those countries will first need to prove that they belong in the European Union."
"In addition, the introduction of criteria other than those previously agreed should be rejected, such as differences in religion, the size of the country or of the population, any strategic location, political benefits, the date of membership application, historical relations or economic benefit."
"These are all elements which, naturally, occur to everyone sooner or later, but it would be extremely bad if these were to exclude or relativise the agreed criteria."
"Mr Verheugen mentioned the need for more common foreign and security policy in the light of enlargement."
"What is the Council's position on that?"
"Does it share Commissioner Verheugen's view that we, because of enlargement, should strive towards a common foreign and security policy with all the more urgency?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurostat affair is now a matter of public knowledge; it is a scandal and we cannot erase it."
"What we can do, however, is learn lessons from it."
"Firstly, this means that in future, the Commission must listen to Parliament, the directly elected assembly representing Europe’s citizens, instead of disregarding Parliament’s reports out of a strange mixture of ignorance and arrogance."
"Had the Commission listened, the matter would not have assumed such proportions."
"Secondly, we have an obligation towards our citizens to rectify the things that have occurred during this period, that is, during our, and your, term in office. We have put forward a number of proposals in this context."
"The report will be tabled in this House shortly."
"It has already been adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. Among other things, it raises the issue of the financial regulation, which you have not touched on at all so far."
"For example, it addresses the fact that it is apparently still possible for firms to enter into contracts with the European Commission without being required to disclose details of their financial circumstances."
"There are firms that have their company headquarters in the Bahamas and it is rumoured that some European Commission officials are behind them."
"That must change."
"Directorates-General can currently exist outside the scrutiny of auditors. That must change too."
"Eurostat is a case in point."
"This is not good, and we must change this situation."
"Thirdly, we propose that the financial regulation or the internal rules be amended so that internal audit capacities are subordinate to the Head of Internal Audit."
"Had this been the case, the Eurostat issue would not have occurred on this scale."
"We want a solution, Mr Prodi, and we want it now, not in one or two years’ time."
"We must act now."
"The things that have happened must be rectified, and then we can restore voters’ confidence."
"– Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to President Prodi for coming to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning."
"The plan of action that he presented to us needs some commentary, and I would like, in the first instance, to deal with the continuing failure to sort out the issue of communication between the administration and the Commission – by which I mean the Commissioners, even though I can see how many measures already exist on paper; the September 1999 code of conduct, the ‘Charter for Delegated Authorising Officers’ of December 2000, and so on."
"I do believe that what we need in this area is not new rules, but the application of the ones that already exist, and that is what I want to press for."
"Secondly, it is clear that new mechanisms have to be created to do this."
"President Prodi, let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies, but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed."
"I see little point in this new machinery to collect all the information on possible instances of fraud."
"I see no point in having a body to uncover financial irregularities."
"I do not see that there is any need to set up a management committee as a replacement for OLAF’s Supervisory Committee."
"You have touched on a great deal, and there is good in that, but the issue of whistleblowing still has to be sorted out."
"Reference has already been made to the fact that it is no longer a live issue."
"There is so much for us to do together, and so I urge you, before you issue the communication, to take Parliament seriously, to talk with us, to have a look at the Bösch report, so that we do not go down false trails."
"To do so would harm the European budget and hence the European taxpayer."
"Mr President, I should like to begin, as did the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, by expressing my pleasure at the presence of President Romano Prodi in the meeting of that committee this morning."
"This was a first positive sign, which we cannot ignore, that the Commission is now prepared to listen to us more closely than it has done in the past, and we must therefore note this fact."
"I also wish to note something else that cannot be ignored and that is the fact that the internal hearings, both at central and Eurostat level, have worked well and independently."
"This is an extremely positive outcome of the current reform."
"Secondly, I wish to say that, where Eurostat is concerned, responsibilities must be defined, some mechanisms are working much more slowly than they should, but something is at last happening."
"I also wish to say that I fail to understand why the Publications Service, the body financially responsible for allocating funds to Planistat, has to date taken no action, opened no enquiry and held no one responsible."
"Why has the body that provided most of the appropriations misused by the company CSD – and this is a body that depends on external aid – not been called to account or been subject to any action, with everything carrying on as if nothing had happened outside Eurostat?"
"If the Commission wants to have us believe that it is going to take the principle of accountability seriously, it is absolutely crucial that it adopt measures concerning these two Commission departments. Otherwise, we will not be able to take the Commission seriously."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Commission, have proposed increased stability and security as a priority for your programme, and that is only to be welcomed."
"Among other things in relation to this, you propose taking steps towards the establishment of joint border control."
"For that you have our entire support."
"In so doing, you will ultimately be acceding to our demands, for we have always wanted the same high standards to apply on all our external borders after enlargement, and precautions need to be taken for that to be the case."
"Last week, at a press conference, you again suggested establishing, at the very outset, an agency to take over the work of control and coordination."
"This would be the sixteenth agency, and what we have learned so far about agencies can be summed up by saying that we have forgotten the names of many of them, we have forgotten what they do, and that we are most aware of them at the time of the Budget, when we notice – generally after they have been in existence for only a few years – that the outgoings are mushrooming."
"All that comes into my mind is that we should propose setting up an agency to examine the other agencies’ efficiency and consider whether we need any more of them."
"What we would like is for the means of control and coordination to be set up within the Commission or in close association with it, for the sake of efficient external borders control."
"We need control, we need coordination, we need the efficient use of resources, but under no circumstances do we have any need of an agency."
"My second point is that you say that there must be tough action taken against illegal immigrants and something done to integrate those who are here legally."
"In that you have our full support, but please take action once and for all; see to it that return agreements are in place, not just with Macao or Hong Kong, but with the states from which migrants actually come."
"There is one thing you must not do, and that is, to offer the abolition of visas as a ; instead, provide something that will be more help, namely trade facilities and economic aid, so that emigration ceases to be necessary."
"Mr President, firstly, I want to draw attention to the absence of a number of issues in the social policy area."
"Secondly, I want to stress the need to be careful not to damage our European institutions by blowing up into a major scandal matters which are important in relation to Eurostat but which, bearing in mind the prospective elections, might do untold damage to our institutions if pursued too strongly."
"It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament: the collective rights of employees, social security for atypical workers, protection against individual dismissal, revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive."
"The Commission also seems to be stalling on the other important areas, such as minimum income."
"It has produced a detailed study on the costs of non-social Europe which concluded that, while the so-called costs of social policy are usually immediately visible, the benefits are more difficult to identify and quantify."
"However, that social policy contributes to the quality of the labour market and the formation of social capital."
"In view of the recent coverage of, for example, charges for wheelchairs at Dublin Airport by Ryanair, it is important that the Commission comes forward with the promised regulation on the contract between passengers and airlines, particularly for passengers with disabilities."
"It is obvious from the opening speeches in this morning's debate that the election campaign is already under way."
"I would ask Members to be particularly careful not to undermine the confidence of Europe's electorate by going over the top about scandals."
"It is important to root out corruption, but we should be extremely cautious how we present this to our electorate."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by impressing upon us two mottos for the Commission and for our own work."
"The first is this: ‘Not in the beginning is the reward, but only in consistent perseverance, the setting and achievement of objectives’."
"And the second is this: ‘He who does not take himself seriously will not be taken seriously by others’."
"Although we went into the Convention aiming to make Europe more transparent, to bring it closer to its citizens and to make it more democratic, we have not yet made that a reality."
"The objectives are more relevant than ever."
"So, Mr President of the Commission, he who would make Europe more transparent must be prepared to know his own tasks and pursue objectives in a consistent way."
"What that means is that I am calling for greater earnestness, a more earnest approach to Parliament, to our resolutions, to our aims, to our fears and criticisms and to make our self-image as a corporate body a reality."
"We get more and more proposals that actually ought never to have emerged from the Commission: on lines of credit for consumers; the Chemicals Directive; for the prohibition of discrimination, which flies in the face of economic reality; there is the harmonisation of duty on diesel, which has been thought through sector by sector rather than as a whole."
"I urge you to take up your collegial responsibility; with specific reference to Eurostat and to the statements you have made today, I demand that you take your political responsibility more seriously."
"With the Stability and Growth Pact in mind, I demand that you insist on compliance with the law."
"We read in your programme your call for better coordination of the Member States’ economic and budgetary policies, but I can tell you that we have no need of better coordination; what we need is compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"To do that would make for enough coordination!"
"I call upon you to take initiatives to strengthen the internal market, competition policy and social cohesion."
"If you also put yourself at the head of projects to create a sense of European identity, that will play a part in making European policy domestic policy, so that the internal politics of the Council will not be able to block European projects, for which people at home will blame the Commission and Parliament."
"Mr President, it is true that, with the European elections and the end of the term of office of this Commission approaching, the flow of history cannot be changed in the few remaining months. Nonetheless, the Commission must obviously continue to see its job through to the end."
"In the transport sector, I want to say that important work has been done over all these years: the single European sky, the two railway packages, the liberalisation of port services and the new proposal for the trans-European networks where, of course, I want to point out that the main issue is not so much the legislative proposal as funding, about which I personally have certain doubts."
"In all events, I think that, in the transport sector, the main issue from now on is that we and the Commission need to join forces and convince the Council about certain issues which have been pending for about two years now, so that they can be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible."
"For example, the Meijer report on urban transport is a classic example and, what we need is to use the time from now until the elections in order to advance a number of other issues, such as the harmonisation of certain social dimensions in the road transport sector, the amended proposal for a regulation on action by the Member States concerning the terms under which public services are provided in the rail, road and internal waterway transport sectors and the ban on heavy goods vehicles at weekends, which is also an issue that has been dragging on for a very long time."
"Similarly, as far as regional policy is concerned, although it is not a strictly legislative matter, I want to point out that the Commission needs to present the third report on cohesion as quickly as possible, so that the European Parliament has an opportunity to take a position on this very important issue before the European elections."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us consider the Eurostat affair. I am very disappointed by the measures announced by President Prodi, which indicate that the will to really tackle these problems is absent."
"Above all, I note the absence of changes in structure and personnel, for example changes to the responsibilities of the three Commissioners concerned."
"Let me just remind you how this House, right at the beginning of this Commission’s term of office, wanted to hold fast to the separation of the budget and budgetary control, precisely in order to avoid the conflicts of interest that face us now."
"I find no trace of any serious reprimand for the three Commissioners responsible, making it clear that they were in breach of their supervisory responsibilities and of their duty of care."
"That, Mr President, is something that every ordinary employee, in similar circumstances, has to guarantee in the course of his employment."
"Thirdly, the controls must be made much more effective, as Eurostat is, in my view, a shining example of how all the Commission’s checks and balances can fail."
"It would have been easy for you to take at least one or two of these three possible courses of action, but you have taken none of them."
"What this means, Mr Prodi, is that, for the second time since 25 September, you have failed to draw a line under the affair and regain the trust of Parliament and the public."
"There is one thing that I will not under any circumstances allow you to get away with, and that is your assertion that the reform of the Commission will be completed only in 2004 and that a Eurostat case will no longer be possible."
"Let me tell you that the opposite will be the case, as your reforms and the new Financial Regulation will weaken control still further."
"As a result of the abolition of the independent auditors, the Directors-General possess power to an unparalleled degree."
"Let me ask you this: is that really what you want?"
"Democracy needs control, and an entity as deficient in democracy as the Commission certainly does."
"Mr President I should like to thank President Prodi for coming here today."
"This is the fourth time running I have been here to listen to his presentation."
"Indeed, it is the fourth year running that his Commission has failed to get a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors for its accounts, and the ninth time running that the Commission, as an entity, has failed to do so."
"I am aware that no one in Mr Prodi's Commission accepts political responsibility for anything, but am sure there are members of the Commission who have political antennae and can sense the mood of Parliament when it comes to the problems found at Eurostat and in the accounting system."
"I personally consider that Mr Prodi has weakened his position and the Commission's position by stepping into Italian domestic politics, which is something I am sure he should not be doing."
"I think he makes the Commission slightly more impotent by admitting that Commissioners currently have no political responsibility."
"With Eurostat he has shut the stable door too late, a long time after the horses have bolted, and is looking to blame the messengers rather than resolving the problem."
"However, I would like to talk very briefly about the whistleblowers' charter, which is something I know Mr Prodi mentioned in the Committee on Budgetary Control's meeting earlier today, because his Commission's biggest failing has been the way it has treated some of the whistleblowers."
"The Commission has been a kangaroo court."
"It has suspended those who raise questions and problems and has actually rewarded those who have been involved in covering these things up."
"I also want to be positive, because I know that ten new Commissioners will be coming into your midst as of May 2004."
"As well as wanting to see an independent OLAF, I would like the Commission to consider the possibility of one of those Commissioners assuming responsibility for budgetary control and the internal audit service of the Commission, because the sooner it is separated from the budgetary function itself, the sooner we may start to make headway as regards these problems."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, all the political strategies presented are certainly very attractive, but, in many cases, they could come up against obstacles of varying size if they are not supported by a completely reliable organisational and administrative system."
"The accession of the new countries, which we planned, promoted and achieved all together, must take place within a solid, transparent framework in order to avoid creating major problems for the Community staff, who are already being called upon to take on more work, or damaging the image and credibility of the European Parliament."
"Therefore, the priorities and major decisions must have the necessary support of a Europe which works, which is transparent and, most importantly, which can account for how Community funds are spent and used."
"The Eurostat affair does nothing to further that cause."
"It pained me to hear Mr Procacci, who had not read the OLAF reports or the audit, describing this as a minor incident; if we were to read the reports he would realise that they are extremely disturbing."
"It is therefore the responsibility of the Commission to step up the controls that have proved to be as watertight as sieves thus far, improving the system in such a way as to distinguish between monitoring and controls, on the one hand, and operational management – officials granting authorisations – on the other."
"Furthermore, the Consultative Committee for market operations, which operated under the previous Financial Regulation, has been abolished, and yet it has become clear that many transactions were not made subject to any requirement of economic benefit, transparency or contractual legitimacy, creating a kind of free zone, in which, even after 1999, or maybe especially after 1999, orders could be assigned with only one firm taking part, often where there was a conflict of interests and with unsigned contracts, leading to damage to Community finances, the extent of which it is difficult to assess."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for coming to the House today and also for coming before the Committee on Budgetary Control. I shall endeavour to be brief."
"Mr Prodi, concerning what you have grandiloquently termed the Eurostat Action Plan, I suggest this is merely chapter three of a work in which chapters one and two are lacking. The missing chapter one should have been entitled ‘facts’ and the missing chapter two ‘responsibilities’."
"This chapter on measures to be adopted would be chapter three."
"As I have already stated at the Committee on Budgetary Control, I believe these measures are absurd, curious and outdated."
"They are absurd because the person or body to be controlled is actually charged with informing the controller of possible infringements."
"They are curious because coordination committees are not what is needed to follow up allegations and seek the truth."
"Instead, compliance and immediate investigation of the truth are called for."
"Alternatively, the information should be placed before the judicial authorities. The measures are outdated because auditors have repeatedly stated the need to break away from the guidelines of Directors-General who have control over them."
"Further, this plan does not concern Eurostat alone. It applies generally to the functioning of the Commission."
"Mr President, I believe the sequence is wrong. It should be reversed."
"After all, information does not generate responsibility. Rather, responsibility demands information to be able to cope with commitments."
"With regard to OLAF, President Prodi, I suggest the introduction of some kind of ruling on admissibility. This would allow rejection of long, costly and useless proceedings detrimental to specific institutions or bodies."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you very much for this debate and to thank you for your opinions on the programmes, which, as you know, we have had to restrict, for next year will be a year of limited activity, being the last year of the Commission and Parliament’s terms of office."
"We must take into account the fact that Parliament will have to suspend its work for much of the year and that the Commission will change twice: once in May – although that will only be an expansion rather than a change – and then, again, in autumn at the natural end of its term of office."
"That is why the programme we have put forward is very limited, containing proposals that can feasibly be implemented in 2004; no more than what is feasible, taking into account, not least, the experience we gained in implementing the work programme for 2003, with the good and bad points of that process."
"We have 126 priorities, some old and some new, on which we can guarantee delivery and action."
"These are crucial, major priorities, but, clearly, we cannot guarantee anything in addition to them."
"We are also working, as has been explained, on the Financial Perspective."
"We are a great deal in advance with our work, not least because we were quite aware that the interruptions in the coming year will cause substantial delays."
"The question you are asking is whether the Commission is going to present specific legislative proposals."
"Yes we are: to start with, we present them as the lines of a political project, and then, of course, we supply the facts and figures later on, when the political project has been approved."
"I would, moreover, stress that this Commission has made enlargement its main objective and will present its project for an enlarged Union."
"All the specific legislative proposals will be made by the enlarged College, after 1 May 2004, that is, and then we will have to discuss the timetable for work after that."
"A number of major issues have emerged from the debate, including – and this was raised by many speakers – the issue of the Stability Pact."
"I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will enforce the Stability Pact in the proper manner and according to the proper conditions."
"We are the guardians of a rule which has been handed to us by the governments."
"I still remember the eyebrows of the German Minister for Finance, when I was Prime Minister of Italy, as they frowned at me, forcing me to accept the Stability Pact."
"We have now made it more flexible and, I believe, more workable, and the Commission will enforce it properly in this framework, taking into account the genuine problems but also bearing in mind that the Pact is the basis of our protection of the euro."
"We must establish it as such."
"I would like to address another minor postscript to you as Members of Parliament."
"We are talking about the Stability Pact, but while we are arguing numbers, fractions and decimal points, there are developments taking place in the political arena which I feel give cause for concern."
"I will give just one example: the attempt by Ecofin to bring about what would essentially be the end of the Stability Pact through intergovernmental and extra-institutional agreements."
"This is much more serious than any other issue."
"If this attempt succeeds, it will be the end of that little – which is too little, as I have reiterated many times here before you – economic governance which the Union has."
"It is not a question of any particular country: the entire Ecofin system is, at present, heading in that direction."
"I would like to hear not just the Commission but Parliament, too, speak out loud and clear on this matter."
"Indeed, I do not mean to be malicious when I say that this plot is not completely free of attempts, which we have witnessed in recent days, to divest Parliament of its annual and multiannual budgetary powers, which are already too few."
"At the moment, I believe it is in our common interest not to be excluded from one of the greatest political processes, from one of the most important decisions affecting the work of our Commission."
"I was asked another question on cohesion policy."
"Our ideas will be outlined in a political document which will be presented before the specific proposals for the Financial Perspective."
"I would emphasise two of the areas we are working on: firstly, cohesion will continue to operate in order to prevent the regions which are lagging behind from being marginalised, and, secondly, cohesion will be more explicitly linked to the sustainable growth programme we are developing on the basis of the experience we have gained from managing the Lisbon and Gothenburg processes."
"The same applies – and I am responding to Mrs Frassoni here – to the issue of sustainability with regard to Kyoto and to that process."
"As regards OLAF, there is a key concept: we are on no account trying to turn the Eurostat crisis into an OLAF crisis."
"All the observers with any sense have seen that the information channel between OLAF and the Commission failed to work and is still not working, and it would be irresponsible of us not to do something about this problem."
"Nobody is thinking of removing OLAF’s responsibility for internal investigations: quite the opposite, all investigations must continue to be carried out by an OLAF which is even more efficient."
"We do not plan for any more bureaucratic bodies to be created, a point raised by Mr Barón Crespo and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"In my opinion, we have made quite a simple plan, but, listening to these concerns, I feel it would be right and proper to discuss the matter further, to talk again, for it is not our intention to make the institutions even more complex by adding more structures."
"We merely want to be in a position to gather together all the relevant pieces of information – not all of which were available in this case – from the different parts of the Commission, in order to be able to take a clear, rapid decision on any measures to be adopted so that OLAF can proceed with full knowledge of the facts and we can take a fully-informed decision."
"The decision – of whether or not to open an investigation – will remain entirely at the discretion of OLAF."
"It will be for OLAF to decide, like any investigative body, whether the case is sufficiently important for an OLAF inquiry to be opened or whether it is of purely administrative significance, or whether, quite simply, no action is necessary."
"This will be decided by OLAF."
"In response to Mr Blak, I would like to say that, if we continue to stir up dust, we will not be benefiting anyone, least of all the European citizens."
"We have produced independent, accurate, factual reports which have shed light on all the points and have not revealed evidence of any irregularities after 1999."
"We are looking into other specific proposals which we will discuss with Parliament."
"I will not acceptkangaroo courts or summary sentences: everything is in order where the past is concerned and we are working on more effective measures for the future too."
"I will conclude my speech with two points: as regards services of general interest, which are at the centre of our attention, the programme mentions a sequel to the White Paper because, as things stand, the idea of presenting a proposal for a directive has not been excluded but has not yet been decided upon."
"We are working on it and the decision will be taken in the light of the debate which is currently starting."
"Clearly, if the legal basis is included in the final text of the Constitution, that will be an extremely important factor, for it will make it possible for us to work on this."
"Lastly, a personal response to Mr Poettering: I would remind him, first of all, of the total legitimacy of the document containing my opinions, my experiences and my dreams, too, regarding the future of Europe."
"I have to say that it is also a legitimate part of my duty to express my political opinion,"
"a duty which my predecessors discharged liberally and, in many cases, to a greater degree than I have, taking an intensely active role in party politics, as I consider to be right and proper and increasingly important for the Commission’s development."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats itself, quite rightly, has already mentioned the fact that the results of the political elections will be taken into account when the new Commission President is appointed."
"This has been decreed – as, I feel, is right – because the Commission is increasingly becoming a political organ which takes the general interest into account in its work but which cannot fail to have a public opinion, otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, you would have had no reason to give me your vote of confidence."
"You gave me your vote of confidence on the basis of a political line!"
"I would like to say a word about the content too."
"I am very happy, Mr Poettering, to hear you criticise the Italian newspaper which called you before reading the document, for if it had read it, it would have found there the spirit of our founding fathers and your own words, the words you speak when you are not weighed down by the burden of the Eurosceptics who surround your group, words with which we agree and have agreed many times in the past."
"I want to say to you that I am President of all Europeans, and I have to express my political opinions before all the citizens."
"Therefore, I wonder why the words of such an intensely European programme which are so dear to you, Mr Poettering, and to us all, can cause such concern."
"Because people are frightened by values and projects in which you have consistently firmly believed?"
"– President Prodi, what I am going to say to you I say as a personal ally, as one who shares many of your European ideals, and I say it with regret that you have not gone over the bridge that I have built for you. It is not the manifesto that is at issue, and it is tendentious to reiterate that I, when I gave the interview to ‘Corriere della Sera’ last Monday evening, had not yet read the manifesto."
"I based my criticisms on an agency report, according to which you had given a recommendation to a party political list in Italy, and that is not compatible with your role as President of the European Commission!"
"Let me make it perfectly clear – and Mr Barón Crespo’s statement shows that I cannot be wrong in this – that the office of President of the European Commission is not compatible with being on a list of candidates in the European elections, and that this ought to result in your resignation."
"This comment, though, hung in the air."
"There was the question in your own college of whether you would carry on with your mandate until 1 November 2004."
"Thank God you clarified that, but the mere fact that these rumours could surface is not something for which we can applaud you."
"Mr President, I say this to you very much as a friend, but also in all earnest and also in restrained language: you need the support not only of one side of this House."
"If you carry on like this, we will, in future, no longer be able to support you."
"We need a Commission – this is not party polemics, but my profound conviction ..."
"... we need a Commission at a difficult time, when we face enlargement, at a difficult time in which we have a constitution, and we need neither a Commission nor a Commission President who constantly meddles in the internal political debates in his own country, a country, let it be added, which still holds the Presidency of the European Union."
"President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether the confidence of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats ..."
"... and you call yourselves democrats, when you do not even listen to what is being said?"
"We always listen when your group chairman speaks, and that is good democratic practice."
"I will therefore conclude by saying this: President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether you want us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to be alongside you."
"We want you to succeed because we all share in your success, but you yourself must be prepared to cross this bridge."
"If you are not prepared to cross this bridge, then you yourself must bear responsibility for the consequences."
"Mr President, I should first like to say how pleased I am that a political debate has taken place in this House at last."
"Such a debate was launched this morning, but only four of us were present."
"I should like to respond to the comment made by leader of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This is a curious body with two souls."
"Firstly, Mr Prodi, President of the current Commission, was invested and endorsed by the majority of the groups in this House. I have today reiterated that as my group and I see it, it is Mr Prodi’s duty to lead the Commission until the very last day of his mandate."
"It has fallen to him to steer the Commission through a period of great political importance. Secondly, in his capacity as a European citizen Mr Prodi has a right to express political opinions on the future of Europe."
"He cannot be denied that right."
"Preventive censure must not be introduced."
"It would be like forbidding Cardinals of the Catholic Church to speak of God."
"It simply does not make sense."
"Thirdly, I should like to state my personal opinion, if Mr Romano Prodi, who is both an Italian and a European citizen, decides to stand in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, he should then resign."
"I think that is pretty basic. That is what I actually stated."
"– Finally, we shall hear from 'Cardinal' Cohn-Bendit!"
"– Mr Poettering, I am seriously worried about you, as it was in July last year that Mr Prodi proposed that a list be drawn up this year."
"You woke up to this five months later."
"Your party has made a serious error in taking five months to realise that Mr Prodi is on the political trail in Italy."
"Secondly, I say this because it is absurd that you should set yourself up as a preacher of morality in this matter out of a desire to protect Mr Berlusconi, who, politically speaking, is currently cutting a poor figure as President of the EU."
"I find it intolerable that you should stand up in this House and say, ‘I have built bridges and you have not gone over them’."
"Mr Prodi is entitled to cross the bridges of his choice rather than the ones you build."
"You have to understand that once and for all, my good sir!"
"It is absurd for you to stand up in this House and say, ‘What you say is in fact perfectly correct, and I regret that Mr Berlusconi did not say that."
"That is why you, Mr Prodi, may not say that, as I would rather Mr Berlusconi did it’."
"That is your problem."
"Sort it out in your own group and leave the rest of us in peace, and let Mr Prodi be politically active in whatever way he wants, without constant moralistic attacks by you."
"Mr President, I will be brief because I have lost my voice – and I do not mean politically, I mean physically!"
"It is clear that a battle royal is going on within one of our larger Member States."
"The main protagonists in that battle royal happen to be the current President of the Commission and the current President of the Council."
"It would be unrealistic to suggest that people in such positions have not had a political past, or do not have a political future to look forward to."
"There is a question mark over whether the occupants of those posts should be engaged to such an extent in such a political battle while holding those offices."
"But it would be naïve of us to assume that such battles will not continue, and indeed naïve of this Parliament not to imagine that such people will take those positions."
"– Mr President, this pre-election incident has absolutely nothing to do with my group, which is why I had intended to keep quiet."
"Nevertheless, I feel that this incident reveals something that has long been clear to me, namely that the Commission’s claim to represent the general European interest is a claim on which it is unable to deliver."
"For my part, I would prefer to see the right and left of Parliament opposing each other with this kind of passion over European Union policies, rather than opposing each other over career plans and affairs of state."
"I would like to remind every one of us of the role that the institutions should have and ask them not to confuse their respective roles."
"I am saying this because someone spoke about President Berlusconi, who, until there is proof to the contrary, is head of a government and as such has the right to take political decisions in his country."
"President Prodi has been appointed by the Council and voted in by Parliament."
"We respect him as President of the Commission and we have asked him to be President of the Commission."
"I agree with what Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo said, since the essence of their speeches was the same: that President Prodi has the right to go back to active politics as and when he wishes, but not as President of the European Commission."
"In view of enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the difficulties that we are facing every day in the attempt to make our institutions more transparent for the citizens, none of us can exploit Europe for the purposes of internal politics."
"I hope that what was said today was partly due to exceptional emotional strain and that, in the next few hours, everyone will go back to the job they were appointed to do."
"If anyone wants to relinquish their current role, let them state this clearly: they can take on another role but they cannot have two institutional roles at the same time."
"As regards Mr Cohn-Bendit’s statement, perhaps Mr Poettering does have two souls, but it is better to have two souls than to have no soul at all."
"– The speakers who have addressed this issue this morning have very clear points of view."
"Clearly, these points of view diverge."
"I want to make one appeal: whatever the divergent views, at this moment the European Union is going through an important phase of redefinition."
"The biggest single, immediate challenge in the weeks to come is to find the serenity and wisdom together, across the institutions and with the Member States, to produce for tomorrow's Europe a constitutional treaty that reflects the logic of the work of the European Convention."
"Let us make sure, however diverse our opinions are on the years to come, that over the next several weeks we work together, in the interests of the public, to deliver the first and necessary challenge of a constitutional Europe."
"That concludes the item."
"– The next item is the vote."
". – Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is proposing by a very large majority that this Commission proposal should be rejected, and this is therefore the committee’s proposal for a legislative resolution."
"I would hope that we can vote first on this proposal to reject before we go on to the amendments tabled for the plenary session."
"I would hope we can proceed in this way because, as I understand it, both my own group and a clear majority in Parliament are in favour of this proposal to reject, so there is no point in our voting first on the amendments and only finally on this rejection, as this Commission proposal will very probably be rejected."
"– Mr President, allow me to endorse the procedure proposed by Mrs Kauppi."
"Obviously, rejection goes further than any amendments to a text that the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes to reject."
"So let us vote first on rejection of the proposal, as this will save us having to go through a pointless voting procedure."
"– In preparing the vote I took advice on this matter."
"The House is free to accept or reject a proposal, as amended."
"It is the case, however, that no committee or group has made an amendment to reject the proposal."
"I accept that the rapporteur has just made the suggestion on behalf of the Committee Economic and Monetary Affairs, but since there is no amendment to reject, and there are amendments that need to be put to the vote, I have been informed that according to the Rules of Procedure, I should invite the House to vote on the amendments."
"Ultimately, the House is sovereign to decide to follow the advice of the rapporteur and Mr Goebbels."
"However, I have been informed that because no one has moved an amendment to reject, I am obliged to take the amendments as proposed."
"– Mr President, I am at a loss."
"The vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was clear: we rejected the proposal by a crushing majority and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs therefore proposes rejection of the Commission proposal."
"– A recommendation from a committee is something the House must treat seriously, but it is not an amendment to a proposal."
"Do you wish to make an oral amendment to reject the proposal?"
". Mr President, of course I want to make an oral amendment if that is required."
"I want to make sure you understand that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was almost unanimous in its opinion that this proposal be rejected."
"That is why we should not have to vote on the amendments beforehand: we can vote on them if the proposal to reject does not get a majority."
"– Mrs Kauppi, I fully understand that point."
"I have no wish to contest the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"However, I am obliged to operate according to the Rules of Procedure."
"Having heard Mrs Kauppi's explanation, are there any objections to the oral amendment?"
"– Mr President, together with Mrs de Villiers and Mrs Lulling, I myself have tabled an amendment in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"That amendment was adopted with 22 votes in favour, 2 against and 2 abstentions."
"That amendment has now disappeared."
"I want to know where it is."
"That amendment has been adopted and we now need to vote on it first."
"– Mr Blokland, I do not have a problem with the House, but I have a duty to obey the Rules of Procedure."
"The Rules are clear: if there are amendments, I put them to the House."
"There is no plenary amendment today to reject the Commission proposal."
"I am very sorry, but that is not my problem."
"It is someone else's problem."
"Now I will do my duty and continue with the vote."
"Mr President, I regret the outcome of the vote that has just taken place. We have taken note of the views expressed by the majority of the House."
"The Commission will therefore take appropriate measures pursuant to the framework agreement and to the agreements reached with Parliament. I will inform the College of Commissioners of events in the House today."
"– That concludes the vote."
". – According to the information available, the number of radioactive sources currently in circulation in the European Union exceeds 100 000."
"This figure demonstrates the limitations of the systems set up in the Member States to detect and eliminate these sources which, for various reasons, slip through the monitoring measures that have been put in place."
"These ‘orphan’ sources may also be discovered by individuals who are unaware of the risks that they entail."
"The Commission proposal, therefore, constitutes a justifiable Community initiative, which responds to two main objectives by creating a system of traceability:"
"- to prevent exposure to ionising radiation resulting from the inadequate monitoring of high activity sealed radioactive sources;"
"- to ensure that the safety of sources is monitored, in order to prevent, as far as possible, all malicious use."
"I therefore voted in favour of a text on which political agreement has been reached in Council, and this will enable us to ensure the safe and effective monitoring of high activity sealed sources in the European Union."
". – I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the number of radioactive sources currently in circulation in the European Union calls for particular caution and care in their management, packaging and handling, and it is crucial that those which for various reasons are not picked up by the Member States are detected and eliminated."
"Creating the system of traceability proposed by the Commission could help to prevent exposure to ionising radiation resulting from inadequate monitoring of sources and to ensure that safety is monitored."
"This is an attempt to prevent the malicious use of these sources and to enable them to be monitored in the European Union by facilitating their harmonised management at European level, the ongoing monitoring of their life cycle and their safe exchange between countries of the Union."
"I share the rapporteur’s view of the need to highlight suppliers’ responsibility, as the technical experts, in the life cycle of the various sources they make available."
"I also agree with the compulsory monitoring of potential cross-border movement of the sources in question, both within the European Union and to third countries and to establishing, in line with the judicial and penal traditions of the Member States, a system of harmonised penalties that could be applied in the event that the rules are infringed."
". – The decision to determine the indications that are to feature on signs posted at external border crossing points was taken first in 1994, under the Schengen system."
"This initiative seeks to update these indications and also to set uniform minimum indications for use in signs."
"Mr Deprez’s excellent report warrants our full support and addresses the issue of external borders, which have been the weakest link in the system."
"I wish to highlight four essential points:"
"- opting for the system of separate checkpoints, which is to be welcomed, given the differences in requirements relating to the carrying out of checks on citizens from the Community, from the European Economic Area or from Switzerland and on third-country nationals;"
"- there must be no difference between signs for citizens of the Union and for nationals of countries have the same rights when crossing borders – these signs must be as clear and simple as possible;"
"- the Member State authorities should put up signs written in other languages or using other characters, particularly in multilingual countries, in ones which use an alphabet with special characters or in ones which receive a large number of visitors who use languages with special characters;"
"- this must be applied not only at airports but also at land and sea borders."
". – This is a set of measures on crossing the external borders of the Member States, and which is concerned with checks on individuals at these borders, which I believe to be fully justified."
"The system of separate checkpoints for citizens covered by Community law at authorised points for crossing the Union’s external borders is fully justified."
"Signs must be clear and easy to understand (E.U./NON E.U.)."
"Furthermore, the authorities of countries whose nationals enjoy equal rights to EU citizens, such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, must identify their citizens when these cross borders."
"We must also avoid using words on signs when symbols are sufficiently explicit."
"Lastly, the Member State authorities should be explicitly authorised to put up signs written in other languages or using other characters, particularly in multilingual countries, in ones which use an alphabet with special characters or in ones which receive a large number of visitors who use such languages."
"These measures are suitable for their purpose and I therefore voted in favour of them."
"– We voted in favour of this report, which proposes initiating a procedure to recruit officials from the countries that the European Union needs to integrate on its enlargement, planned for 1 May 2004."
"Nevertheless, we wish to stress that we disagree with the choice made by the European institution to employ these new officials at pay levels that will be lower than those enjoyed by current European Union officials, given that they will be taken on at a time when a new salary scale is being put in place, which will be less favourable to new employees, whatever their country of origin."
"Clearly, it is budgetary decisions that underlie this decision. These are always mentioned when social issues are concerned, but they never enter into play when it is a question of subsidising large European companies or providing military equipment for European defence."
". – As I have said on several occasions, the knowledge-based society is more than a mere aspiration; it is already a tangible reality."
"In this respect, I agree with, support and encourage all actions that seek to provide a practical basis for political statements such as the Lisbon Strategy of 2000 and the Europe plan adopted in Seville in 2002."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, although I am convinced that the specific sums involved should be gradually increased."
"If, as the Commission proposed, the Community funding of projects put forward under the Ten programme will rise from 10% to 30%, with the concomitant reduction in the number of projects approved – since the overall value of appropriations allocated will remain the same – there must be a real increase in the appropriations that are made available."
"It is in these areas and not in whimsical legal texts looking into the future that European solidarity must be grounded and on which we must construct a genuine EU that is increasingly solid and ingrained."
"As the rapporteur observed, various projects ‘whose potential has been recognised’ end up never seeing the light of day due to a lack of funding at implementation stage."
"This is all the more regrettable because we know that some of these projects, such as Health, Learning and Security, could bring enormous benefits to our citizens."
". – This proposal for a decision is intended to provide a response to the administration chapter of the action plan Europe 2005, specifically through the ‘Interchange of Data between Administrations Programme (IDA) to help to create pan-European administration services in order to support cross-border activities’."
"The IDA programmes seek to promote cooperation between national public administrations and between these and the Commission, ‘helping’ to implement legislation, Community programmes, monitoring procedures, ‘and the open coordination method’."
"Surrounding what appears to be a technical programme and its instruments, however, are doubts concerning the attempt to open the way to federalism, to promote European integration and to create the idea of ‘a European public administration’ in addition to the underlying objectives."
"Nevertheless, the communication totally fails to address the issue of ‘Government’."
"Since the Internet can guarantee easy contact with administrations and provide services direct to the citizens, we must always ensure universal access and improve the quality of services. The Internet must clearly not be seen as a substitute for front desk services and nor can we accept its being used to centralise services, which would have direct consequences on service provision and on territorial cohesion."
". – I welcome the Commission proposal and Mrs Read’s excellent work."
"As I have said on previous occasions, a knowledge-based society, which is one of the European Union’s objectives, requires practical actions to promote telematic communications infrastructures – specifically the Internet – promoting interoperable systems and more widespread access to the new technologies for all EU citizens."
"I am also pleased to note the impressive results achieved under the IDA programme – cross-border cooperation and coordination between public administrations."
"Next, I welcome the new programme that will succeed this one, called ‘Interoperable Delivery of pan-European Government Services to Public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens’ (IDABC) – for the period 2005-2009."
"In actual fact, exchanges between national authorities and Community institutions are of crucial importance, both in operational terms – they constitute a valuable source of information and of cooperation for the staff of national public administrations and lead to greater efficiency – and in terms of guaranteeing citizens’ rights, by making the relationship between national and Community public authorities more transparent and straightforward."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"– To justify increasing tax on diesel fuel where it is lower than on petrol, the Commission either puts forward the argument that harmonisation is needed at European level or gives bogus reasons about protecting the environment."
"We rejected this proposal, voting against any amendment that would lead to an increase in tax on diesel."
"We would not see anything wrong with large road haulage companies, which are major diesel consumers, being taxed more."
"It would be logical for them to contribute to paying for the road network that the State provides for them free of charge, putting them at an advantage over rail transport."
"But if this were the aim, it is the profits of these companies that ought to be taxed, so as not to penalise private individuals, including those on very low incomes who are often forced to travel in private cars because of a lack of adequate public transport."
". – Despite voting against the report in question – entirely in line with the voting position set out by the Group of the Party of European Socialists – I believe that this Commission initiative is entirely valid and constitutes an extremely positive step towards achieving the smoother operation of the internal market."
"As I had occasion to mention in the debate on the report, the proposal to reject the directive, tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must be seen as a spur for the Commission to amend the additional elements involved in this proposal for a rejection without discarding the fundamental reasons that underpin it."
". – The Commission proposal seeks to achieve the gradual harmonisation, at a higher price, of excise rates for commercial fuel, and to separate the systems of taxation for commercial purposes from those for private purposes."
"The Commission claims it wants to resolve distortions of competition in the internal market and to protect the environment in line with the ‘polluter-pays’ principle."
"This proposal for a directive should be seen in the context of the strategy presented in the White Paper entitled ‘A European Transport Policy for 2010: time to decide’, which states the desire to redistribute the tax burden between ‘users’ and ‘taxpayers’ and to pass on to ‘users’ the ‘real’ costs of transport."
"In order to achieve this, according to the Commission, ‘graduated charges must be levied for transport infrastructure use and the coherence of the excise system must be improved’."
"In the broader context, the Commission wants to establish, within ten years, a European tax system comprising taxes for vehicle registration and use, an intelligent pricing system for infrastructure and harmonised fuel taxes."
"The proposal for a directive also sets minimum rates of excise duty for unleaded petrol and a central rate for commercial fuel."
"Bearing in mind our disagreements on most of these proposals, we supported the positions of the rapporteur rejecting the Commission proposal, which Parliament accepted."
". – I voted in favour of the rapporteur’s opinion, which mirrors that of the specialised parliamentary committee, thereby ensuring that the Commission proposal was rejected."
"I believe that this proposal, which the Commission justifies by saying that the environment must be respected and that unfair competition in the internal market must be combated, leaves much to be desired in terms of its effectiveness and could have damaging repercussions for the current and particularly for the new Member States."
"We must look more closely at the idea of establishing two categories of tax on petrol and at the guarantee that the tax applicable to private vehicles – fuel for non-commercial purposes – will also be rapidly applied to the tax on unleaded petrol in order to take account of the repercussions that these measures will have for the industrial sectors in question."
"Whilst I am aware that there are cases of ‘gasoline tourism’, I believe that the scale of this problem does not justify total harmonisation."
"Tax competition could even be beneficial, since standardisation would, in most cases, lead to higher excise duties."
"I come from one of the Union’s outermost Member States, and so I can only hope that geography is taken into consideration in future proposals."
"Portuguese truckers are actually unlikely to become involved in ‘gasoline tourism’ in the same way that German or Belgian truckers allegedly are."
"– We are in favour of developing research and thus of funding it."
"Of all the European institutions’ expenditure, it is certainly not expenditure on research and development that bothers us, provided that it does not serve solely as a pretext for subsidising private companies."
"We note, however, that it is research funding, along with social expenditure, that is most readily cut, at least in France, so as to increase aids and subsidies to big business."
"It remains the case that the entire approach adopted in this report is to see research purely as a factor in competition between Europe and the United States or between different companies."
"In fact, the report itself is obliged to note that private companies, being essentially concerned with profit, indeed with short-term profits, are neglecting to invest in research."
"There is actually a contradiction between the search for profit and scientific research in the interests of society as a whole."
"We did not vote against this report because we are in favour of public research benefiting from considerably more resources than is currently the case, but neither did we want to sanction the way research takes second place to the race for profit."
"– The vote on this report gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to that great parliamentarian, Mr Rolf Linkohr, and to acclaim the extraordinary work done by Commissioner Busquin in the course of his term of office, which is now fast nearing its end, to give research a true European dimension."
"From a quantitative point of view, we now need to move up a gear, to start to prepare the seventh FRDP, with a budget of EUR 30 million, and put pressure on those States that are not increasing, or are even in fact decreasing, their research spending."
"On this depend the future of Europe, its independence, its growth and employment in it."
". – The rough figures for Portugal’s current degree of investment in research and development (R[amp]D) are of enormous concern, because total spending, as a percentage of GDP, stands at approximately 0.8% whilst State funding amounts to 65% of the total, with 30% coming from businesses and 5% from abroad (essentially from European funds)."
"Nor must it be forgotten that the future of business investment in R[amp]D depends on developments that are taking place in many other aspects of society, and on changes in the labour force and in the country’s overall development. These are issues that go far beyond science and technology policy."
"The European Parliament report is relevant because it reflects current concerns at the level of development of R[amp]D activities in Europe and the sector’s specific characteristics and needs."
"One aspect that warrants particular attention is the emphasis the report gives to the need to increase investment in the public sector, observing that this is crucial to the progress of R[amp]D in the private sector."
"Although the report is vague on a few points, it basically endorses the Commission’s proposals, and adds some others, specifically increasing funding under the 7th Framework Programme for R[amp]D (to EUR 30 billion); the creation of ‘technology communities’ and the creation of a European Research Council."
". – Sustained and increased investment in research is the best guarantee of success in attaining the targets the European Union has set for itself, which are to create a more economically dynamic, cohesive economic area based on knowledge."
"This will, therefore, be one of the best investments for our citizens’ future."
"This Commission Communication sets more ambitious targets than have been seen to date, by proposing measures intended to bring spending on research in the EU up to a level of 3% of GDP, with one-third coming from public funds and two-thirds from private funds."
"Today, this percentage stands at only 1.9%, which falls considerably short of the percentages seen in the United States (2.7%) and in Japan (3%), and reveals significant discrepancies within the Union itself."
"In order to achieve this aim, annual investment in research will have to be increased by 8%, in addition to the increase in the budgetary allocation that is needed in the context of the forthcoming accession of ten new countries."
"This is also my view and I consequently voted in favour of the report."
"– The Linkohr report denounces the fact that research spending is too low in Europe."
"We are obviously in favour of increasing research funding, but the reasoning in this report becomes unacceptable when it comes to what this increase should be directed towards."
"It never mentions the contribution that research can make to improving living and working conditions or protecting the environment."
"The only reason put forward for funding research is Europe’s competitiveness and stature."
"The method proposed to achieve this is research carried out on a competitive basis, which bows more to the commercial interests of private companies."
"The report notes that not all research activities have the expected positive impact on European economies; it therefore recommends that a European system be put in place to define criteria for effectiveness and success and to evaluate research on the basis of these criteria."
"In fact it is precisely the community of researchers and scientists in France and other European countries that is protesting against the drastic cuts in public funding and against the obligation to direct research towards those areas that will more quickly turn in a profit."
"As we join with them defending the freedom of research on behalf of the general interest, I voted against this report and the dangerous premise underlying it."
"Research is a crucial factor if Europe is to return on a long-term basis to the path of growth."
"I say ‘on a long-term basis’ because it is not a question simply of boosting economic activity in the short term but of guaranteeing in the long term, and in accordance with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, the existence of an innovative and vital European industry."
"That is why I voted in favour of Mr Linkhor’s report, and I hope that this will serve to strengthen investment devoted to research, both in the budgets of the Member States and in that of the EU. It is necessary, however, to remain vigilant and avoid a situation in which, under the pretext of support for innovation, measures are taken that tend to satisfy certain industrial lobbies, often alien to the EU, to the detriment of the very interests of our researchers and entrepreneurs."
"I therefore voted against paragraph 28, the ambiguous wording of which might cause it to be thought that, at the expense of innovative SMEs in the sector and to the benefit of the American multinationals wishing to perpetuate their dominant position, Parliament was going back on the position it had adopted in the framework of studying the draft Directive on the patentability of software."
". – For several years now, the ΕU has been systematically promoting the penetration of big business into a series of sectors in public ownership and under public control (energy, telecommunications, railways, post offices and so on)."
"In 2002, a regulatory framework was decided for telecommunications which imposes full liberalisation, with uniform regulations, in order to prevent acute contrasts, facilitate competition for the new 'players' with the predominant former public corporations which are now strong monopoly companies and ensure the telecommunications monopolies efficiently penetrate the markets of the new Member States."
"The Community decisions have still not been applied in seven Member States, including Greece, against which the Commission has started judicial proceedings."
"This delay shows the inability of the ΕU to impose unequivocal solutions between conflicting interests and the reactions to the clearly negative results of liberalisation."
"The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy laments the delay and threatens fire and brimstone in the event of non-compliance."
"It even goes so far as to call for a ban on price reductions by 'incumbents'."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece not only have no reason to lament, but we also condemn once again the selling off of public wealth and put forward our standard position, which is that there should be solely public services in crucial sectors of the economy such as telecommunications."
"– We obviously voted against this report, the sole justification for which is to admonish those governments that are not quick enough in applying their own decisions to liquidate public telecommunications services in order to open this sector still wider to competition and the race for profit."
"The rapporteur goes into raptures about bringing the benefits of competition into the sector concerned."
"These so-called benefits are past or future job losses, the threat to salaries and working conditions, widespread job insecurity in companies – such as France Télécom in France – that are in the process of being privatised, and the risk of massive redundancies in private companies engaged in a ruthless trade war."
"There may be a wider range of choice for users, but only for those clients capable of paying."
"Telephone boxes are being done away with in very many places where they are not profitable but are needed more than elsewhere."
"The telephone is becoming less accessible or else more expensive, penalising those in social classes with the most modest incomes who most need this service, particularly elderly people."
"Opposed as we are to the privatisation of public telecommunications services, we reject this report and the social decline to which it contributes."
". – We are all excited at the way in which electronic communications and technology are put to use and their subsequent effects on our collective economies."
"The key question these days is not so much one of technology itself but how technology is used in a way which contributes to growth through improved productivity."
"If we are to reap the real and tangible benefits from new and evolving information technologies we need to invest in the re-organisation of companies and in our administrative structures."
"One of the central elements of this investment relates to ensuring that new broadband facilities are available at every opportunity."
"I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner for Information Technology Erkki Liikanen that the number of broadband connections doubled from 9 million in July 2002 to 17.5 million in July 2003."
"I very much support the goal of the European Commission that half of all Internet connections must be by broadband facility by the year 2005 within the European Union."
"European Member State governments are also required to connect all public administrations to broadband usage by 2005."
"I very much support the eEurope initiative which focuses on promoting broadband usage and which concentrates on those areas where the public sector can make a difference."
". – The rapporteur takes the view that ‘Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain’ are ‘holding up the liberalisation process’, by failing to transpose the ‘new regulatory package within the deadline set’, thereby endangering ‘European competitiveness’."
"We therefore congratulate the European Commission on ‘launching proceedings against those Member States who had not transposed the new regulatory package into national law’ and on calling for proceedings to be ‘completed as quickly as possible’ and the Commission is even urged to ‘make use of the broader range of instruments that are at its disposal’ to emphasise the punitive nature of the regulation."
"This position is unacceptable."
"As regards universal service, the rapporteur considers that its funding lacks coherence and finds that this should be open to all operators, including mobile network operators, by means of ‘public tender’."
"As to public service, or even services of general interest, there is hardly a word, apart from some concern about citizens with disabilities."
"This is, therefore, a report that fails to value public and universal service, a report that calls for liberalisation which deregulates further in the name of the primacy of competition and of the supposed economic advantages for businesses of ‘a fully competitive, open market’ in order to realise the ‘Lisbon Strategy’."
"The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to the most serious crisis in its history."
"The policy of widespread privatisation, which is a direct consequence of opting for deregulation and enforced competition, has led to appalling debts on the part of the operators which seek new market shares at any cost whatsoever and construct parallel and competing networks, such as mobile networks, in a questionable waste of resources."
"This situation is accompanied, let it be remembered, by huge job losses and the jeopardising of any notion of public service."
"The report presented to the House by Mr Clegg comes out in favour of taking an additional step in this same direction."
"I cannot but vote against it."
"Another policy is needed, based on the satisfaction of social needs."
"Telecommunications must be defended as a public service, necessitating state supervision of the policy applied and of the choice of operators."
"We defend the following principles: low rates for the services most used by the majority of the population; free services for the poorest people; blanket geographical cover by high-turnover mobile and Internet networks in a public service framework; and, finally, equipping developing countries on the basis of fair and equal relations between nations."
"– That concludes the explanations of vote."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I should like to mention with regard to the Minutes that the statement I made yesterday before the order of business about the Italian soldiers and policemen killed in Iraq also applies to the statement made by President Cox when he opened today's sitting with the same subject and to the minute's silence observed by the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Patakis."
"We have noted your comment and will do the necessary."
"Mr President, I read today in the Minutes for yesterday's sitting that the statement which I made about the situation in the Baltic States and flagrant violations of human rights was made in response to Mr Tannock's intervention."
"That is not correct."
"I started my statement yesterday before the order of business with a word about what Mr Tannock had said, which I qualified, and then I immediately went into the main point of my intervention, which was the situation in the Baltic States."
"I should therefore like to ask for the Minutes to be corrected."
"My intervention was not in response to Mr Tannock's intervention."
"The necessary correction will be made, Mr Korakas."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0385/2003) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on enhancing ship and port facility security."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent wave of terrorist attacks even struck at the Union itself."
"This morning we observed a minute’s silence in memory of the young Italian servicemen who lost their lives, and also in memory of the Iraqi civilians who died. Clearly, no country or sector is risk-free."
"It is important to recognise that whether we like it or not, acts of this kind can take place at any time and place, regardless of the motive behind them. The maritime sector is no exception."
"I would remind you of the case of the cruise liner ."
"Admittedly, that was back in 1985. Subsequently, however, the oil tanker suffered a terrorist attack."
"The Commission’s proposal aims to facilitate effective and harmonised application of the security measures for ships and port facilities endorsed by Member States of the Union in the context of the International Maritime Organisation."
"The proposal is intended to establish a common area of maritime security in which the same level of safety is guaranteed for all maritime movements within the European Union."
"The proposal is in line with the text adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning security in the civil aviation sector."
"In both the maritime and the civil aviation sectors, determined action on security by the European Union is bound to prove to our international partners that we take the whole range of issues involved very seriously indeed."
"The instruments adopted within the International Maritime Organisation only apply to ships engaged in international trade and to facilities at the ports they use."
"It is desirable to extend some of the provisions of these instruments to domestic maritime traffic within Europe. This would help to attain the global objective of security for the maritime transport sector."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that the measures to be applied are in proportion to the possible risks. Priority should be given to passenger transport."
"The proposal goes further than some of the provisions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation. It renders mandatory certain provisions that were only classed as recommendations in the IMO agreement."
"The intention is to guarantee the maximum level of security envisaged and to prevent Member States from arriving at conflicting interpretations. To this end, there is provision for a single national focal point responsible for monitoring security measures for ships and port facilities."
"The proposal also adjusts certain provisions agreed within the framework of the IMO for the benefit of the domestic maritime traffic of Member States. It broadens the scope of application of IMO security measures for passenger ships on domestic routes taking them more than 20 nautical miles away from the coast."
"Cargo ships will also be covered to a certain extent. There is also provision for adjustment procedures regarding ships providing scheduled services."
"I should like to reiterate once again that the IMO is determined that these security measures for maritime traffic shall come into force on 1 July 2004. The main aim of the draft regulation before the House is to ensure Member States of the Union adopt the necessary measures within the agreed time period."
"This will ensure Member States meet their international commitments. It will also ensure that application of these measures is harmonised across the European Union."
"Consequently, I cannot but endorse all action leading to adoption at the earliest possible opportunity without detriment to the content. I realise Parliament and the rapporteur are fully aware of this."
"Cooperation with the Council has been ongoing for several months now, with a view to ensuring the text is adopted at the earliest opportunity, preferably at first reading. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Miguelez Ramos for her excellent work."
"Mr President, the European Commission dealt with the security of passengers on cruise liners in Europe some time ago, in the White Paper on transport. Parliament has also expressed its concerns on security and on the causes of fishing accidents."
"The House called for a high level of security for both passengers and crew. As the Commissioner stated, however, it was following the tragic events of 11 September that the International Maritime Organisation called for new measures."
"At its November meeting the IMO unanimously agreed that new measures should be drawn up for the security of ships and port facilities. Maritime transport of passengers or cargo is deemed to be one of the most vulnerable sectors at the present time."
"These new international instruments will come into force automatically for all Member States on 1 July 2004. It is important to bear this in mind."
"The measures must therefore become part of Community legislation prior to that date, so that experience can be gained regarding their interpretation and harmonised application, and also concerning Community monitoring."
"I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their understanding in responding to the urgency. I must thank them too for the flexibility they showed in dealing with this draft regulation."
"The latter was adopted unanimously, with one single abstention. I am particularly grateful for the work undertaken by those who served as draftsmen of the opinion."
"In my view, this suggests the European Parliament endorses such a global approach. It also suggests the House believes that problems affecting the whole planet are best dealt with by means of measures proposed by international organisations."
"The measures adopted by the IMO only apply to international maritime transport. Nonetheless, the cross-border sector is not the only one under threat."
"The RETT Committee welcomed the extension of these measures at European level, to cover domestic routes and the relevant port facilities. As a result, security standards within the Community will be higher than those provided for at international level."
"Maritime security must be more than a response to the terrorist threat. It must also include appropriate preventive measures to counter threats of all kinds."
"That is why the draft regulation broadens the scope of mandatory measures to include not only passenger ships but also cargo ships such as those transporting containers, chemical substances, gases and crude oil. The port facilities used by these ships are also covered."
"Maritime security has become an issue of grave concern for European citizens, following the serious maritime accidents in European waters in recent years. I have in mind the and especially the ."
"The first anniversary of that disaster is currently being marked. As we speak, in another room in this building, the leader of the regional government in Asturias is presenting the conclusions of a report on this terrible accident in the hope of assisting us in our work."
"The amendment of the SOLAS Convention and of Part A of the ISPS Code involves mandatory provisions."
"Part B of the aforementioned code consists of recommendations, but the Commission is proposing that some of these should become mandatory. The RETT Committee endorses this approach."
"The mandatory measures concern equipment on board and lay down a set of security measures."
"Other measures concern the theoretical and practical training of staff concerned, and lay down clearly the duties and responsibilities of the various actors."
"The draft regulation also provides for some of the recommendations in Part B of the ISPS Code to become mandatory. The aim is to increase the level of security and forestall differences of interpretation."
"The European Commission is to be responsible for verification of the effectiveness of the national plans of Member States and of the activities of the national authorities. The European Maritime Safety Agency will be charged with providing support for the execution of these tasks."
"The RETT Committee paced itself to comply with the tight deadlines imposed by procedures in the House. The Vice-President of the Commission referred to this earlier."
"It is hoped that this range of measures will come into force in July 2004. Simultaneously, we have worked closely with the Council and the Commission with the aim of ensuring that this regulation is adopted at first reading as befits the urgency of the measures to be taken."
"It involves applying the measures to cargo ships as well as to passenger ships. Another concerned setting up a European coastguard service or body before 2010."
"The members of this committee urged the European Commission to table a directive on overall security of port facilities before the end of 2003. The directive should include accompanying security measures applicable in all Community ports."
"I have in mind seafarers, port workers and all professionals required to work in these areas at times. We believe it is essential for the seafarers to be guaranteed training, exercises and practical experience involving the staff responsible."
"We trust the work we have undertaken will facilitate an agreement between the institutions. It would then be possible for this regulation to be applied as from 1 July 2004."
"The European Parliament has done good work. That work can help improve the various aspects of security relevant to maritime transport."
"Mr President, I should like to make a technical comment with regard to Amendment16. The text endorsed by the RETT Committee and which appears as the new Article 3 paragraph 2, subparagraph 2a actually replaces subparagraph 2 of paragraph 2 of Article 3."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her work. This is no mere formality."
"The rapporteur has made it possible for the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to be largely incorporated into the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This meant that there was some purpose to our work in the LIBE Committee."
"Mrs de Palacio endorsed the view expressed in the House previously. It was stated earlier that we are currently surrounded by terrorism and under constant threat from it."
"Consequently, measures designed to combat this scourge of the twenty-first century are now particularly important. I speak too as a citizen of the Basque country where terrorism is a daily event."
"Further, the International Diplomatic Conference of the contracting parties to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea is to be commended."
"It made it clear that any citizen and any form of transport could be attacked. They are all liable to become soft targets."
"It is also important to bear in mind that the Union is due to take in ten new Member States next year. As enlargement approaches it is imperative for us to strengthen all measures relevant to the fight against terrorism and to the protection of our vessels and ports."
"In this regard, the committee’s amendments aimed to provide a minor clarification to the Commission’s proposal. The amendments call for all unlawful acts to be covered."
"In the light of recent environmental disasters, we have also endeavoured to strengthen security measures applicable to the transport of cargo containing dangerous substances."
"Illegal handling of such substances represents a particular hazard both for the environment and human beings. These substances must therefore be included in the scope of application of the agreement."
"I agree with the rapporteur that a focal monitoring centre for maritime security should be set up. Such a centre would be a point of contact between the Commission and Member States as regards monitoring the measures contained in this regulation."
"I also agree with the rapporteur on broadening the scope of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to allow it to fulfil its task of inspection and following up the present regulation."
"This is probably best achieved through a new legislative instrument."
"It is important for this regulation and the Commission’s communication to come into force at the earliest opportunity. The regulation ought to be in place on 1 July 2004."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate the committee and the rapporteur, because the need to develop secure ports and maritime transport is proven to be very great every day."
"And of course I understand the rush on this issue."
"However, I must register a complaint about the fact that a proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for cofinancing the cost of these measures was rejected."
"An OECD study in July 2003 calculated the initial cost of the measures needed at USD 1 279 million in initial investments, followed by USD 730 million a year to maintain them."
"As you will understand, this massive cost, which will be divided between the European ports, will need to be paid, as there is no cofinancing as proposed by the Committee on Industry, by the ports, shipping companies and small and medium-sized companies engaged in fringe activities."
"We therefore understand that the competitiveness of the European economy will bear a disproportionately heavy burden in comparison with other competing economies."
"The fact that it is certain that jobs will be lost and small and medium-sized companies will close has also been ignored."
"I worry that none of this has been taken into proper account and I worry that we are sacrificing this in our hurry to pass the regulation."
"I hope that time will prove me wrong, but I am very worried that these serious issues will cost the European economy a great deal."
"– Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats unreservedly endorses the very fine report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"It is important that the rules drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation should actually be mandatory."
"We had lengthy discussions about whether this was even permissible, as shipping is a global business."
"No, though, we have to transpose the most important points into Community law, that being the only way in which we can really ensure that the IMO rules are promptly applied across the board in EU waters and in European ports, thus protecting the public from the potential dangers arising from terrorism, piracy or other illegal activities."
"We, too, of course, regret having to discuss these issues with relative speed."
"Along with the problem with financial sustainability, which Mr Folias has just addressed, people in the ports are constantly asking whether what we are prescribing is workable, and whether it can be implemented in practice."
"I hope that the Council will work very carefully through the results in practice when these regulations are transposed, but, as the IMO rules are to apply from 1 July next year, we believe it to be important that we should now create legal certainty, and so we endorse the rapporteur’s request that agreement be reached at first reading."
"We hope, however, that the rules devised jointly by the rapporteur and the Council will indeed result in workable and practical regulations in ports, as these are crucial nodal points which we want to make safer without hindering them from functioning."
"They must function, and I hope that we can achieve that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we shall have experienced a term of office in which the dominant theme has been one of security and safety."
"There was, of course, the loss of the on 12 November 1999 and even the attack on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, with implications for the maritime risk."
"There was also the loss of the , the anniversary of which falls tomorrow, 19 November 2002."
"These events will certainly lead us to provide ourselves with regulations ranging from prevention to sanctions."
"The report of our colleague, which I support, leads me to emphasise three points."
"The first is that the freedom of the seas must be controlled."
"The sea can no longer be seen as an arena for individual adventure, for it also presents a risk to other people."
"More careful monitoring and greater discipline are necessary, from the open sea to the port facility."
"Secondly, the EU must put down firmer roots within the IMO, which is something of a maritime ministry for the whole world, just as, for example, the IMF plays the role of a Ministry of Finance. Among the forty or so members who, I believe, form the management board, a dozen are members of the current or future EU."
"It would therefore be worth coordinating them better. Otherwise, it will be that much easier to have recourse to flags of convenience."
"Thirdly and finally, any law must be able to give rise to sanctions."
"Otherwise, it is sterile and ineffective."
"The IMO conventions are not in any way binding."
"I think that action must be taken to ensure that they become so one day and, moreover, efforts must in the same way be made to ensure that the ship’s country of origin takes responsibility for it."
"As long as that is not done, there will still be gaps in our arrangements."
"To summarise: controlled freedom on the seas, organised unity in the IMO and legality respected by all."
"They mark out the path of maritime security and safety, but the path is still a long one."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you for the dynamism you have injected into your work."
"The task of politicians and policy-makers in the field of security measures, in this case in ports and on ships, consists in striking the difficult balance between workability and the desired effect of the intended measures."
"This is a thankless task from the outset, for the port authorities and shipping companies that are required to apply the new regulations will always experience these as a nuisance."
"For the legislator, the question does remain whether security in the maritime sector will actually increase as a result of this."
"So far, this sector has enjoyed a sound reputation where security is concerned."
"If this were to remain so thanks to this package of legislation, the question is whether we in Europe will receive credit for it."
"To wait and see is not an option."
"This is why it is particularly important for this package to be applied promptly, but not at the expense of everything else."
"I find it strange that we in Europe are going further than what we agreed in the framework of the IMO, especially by also wanting to apply the measures to our local shipping."
"It is worth noting that America, which forced this package through in the context of IMO, does not do this itself."
"Why is Europe aiming so high?"
"An administrative burden on our local shipping will lead to goods being transported through Europe with more difficulty."
"This particularly affects the small ports, with only a few hundred thousand euros in turnover."
"More obstacles in the transport of goods means that the transport sector, as a rule, will incur additional costs."
"Additional costs are inefficient, and inefficiency means that the Lisbon objectives are certainly not moving any closer."
"At that rate, we will never be competitive at an international level."
"Meanwhile, ships sail up and down the east and west coast of America, carrying goods, without encountering any port authorities or customs officials."
"In Europe, this will be a different story anyhow, as our internal market does not, unfortunately, apply to our coastal strip."
"Local shipping between the Netherlands and Belgium does not exist."
"This is still considered international, but will thus from now on also fall within the internal market."
"The internal maritime borders should therefore be lifted."
"Finally, I should like to say that, in general, I will be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I will withdraw my Amendment 42 because Amendment 65, tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, is preferable."
"I must also reiterate that I am in favour of the broadest interpretation of the concept of maritime security. Consequently, I welcome the fact that the regulation before us today does contain the preventive measures required to deal with potential risks of all kinds."
"It is now the first anniversary of the tragic incident involving the . That tanker ended up at the bottom of the sea, having caused the worst maritime pollution and environmental damage on record."
"Further, the thousands of individuals who demonstrated yet again last Sunday in Galicia believe that the scale of the damage was so great because those responsible at government level in Spain grossly mismanaged the crisis that arose on the vessel on 13 November."
"This all confirms the urgent need to put in place security plans to ensure future crises can be dealt with a minimum guarantee of success."
"It is also important to monitor application of the security measures and train teams through practical experience and simulations involving staff responsible for the safety of ships, ports and both international and domestic maritime transport."
"We shall support Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ report, because we believe there is an urgent need to adopt all possible measures to prevent further disasters like the one involving the ."
"Mr President, I should like to make three remarks."
"Firstly, it seems to me that we are being called this afternoon to engage in a genuinely schizophrenic exercise."
"With the Miguélez Ramos report, we are invited to transpose two instruments adopted at world level by the IMO, aimed at just the right time at reinforcing the safety of port installations in the framework of the fight against international terrorism."
"With the Jarzembowski report, however, we are invited to adopt, at European level, a directive on market access to port services which, by applying the excellent principle of free competition in a very dogmatic way, is, on the contrary, in danger of undermining the safety of our ports and transforming those that are not so already into veritable ports of convenience."
"Is it to conceal this contradiction that the two documents are not the subjects of a joint debate?"
"Secondly, we have proof that the IMO – which, when spurred on by determined states, is obviously the relevant level for handling matters of international maritime security – is not condemned to weakness."
"The changes made to the SOLAS Convention and to the ISPS Code at the initiative of the United States prove this, as does the raising of the Fipol ceiling, agreed to at the initiative of several European states."
"There must therefore be no let-up in the pressure for responsible maritime transport, notably by creating a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area in the Atlantic and the Channel, as proposed by six European states."
"Thirdly and finally, the Commission is taking advantage of what ought only to have been a transposition into Community legislation of arrangements relating exclusively to international shipping to broaden the scope of a number of provisions to include national maritime traffic."
"It is not certain that this wayward trend, while very obviously increasing the Commission’s supervisory powers, would make an effective contribution to increasing maritime public safety."
"Mr President, the quintessence of the European Union is not the ideals of democracy and freedom pronounced in the report; it is to serve big business, in this particular instance big shipping business. That requires laws and measures as a protective shield for their interests."
"The objective is to increase their excessive profits by abolishing seamen's fundamental rights."
"Once again, with terrorism as the pretext, an effort is being made to impose a regime of spying and policing in ports and on ships, with an extensive network of monitoring and repression, in the aim of striking policy and trade union action and trampling the grass-roots movement underfoot, in the face of the reactions provoked by the promotion of privatisation."
"That is why nothing is said about the real problems and the real threats to maritime security, in other words the health and safety of those working on ships and in ports, the age of the fleet and the 'cut-throat' ports or ports of convenience preached by the privatisation directive."
"Not a word about the responsibilities of big shipowners, who are accessories to the tragic maritime crimes which make them pioneering terrorists."
"Not a reference to the fact that regional decisions about the safety of ships essentially weaken the role of the International Maritime Organisation and undermine the safety rules within the framework of an economic war and race for profit."
"This is a wretched transaction between capitalists at the expense of the safety of life at sea and the marine environment, in the aim of increasing their excessive profits."
"The unaccountability of the shipping business is being strengthened through flags of convenience, the privatisation of shipping registers and the lack of any substantial inspections or controls by state authorities."
"These are the real and major terrorist threats to shipping, not the ghost pirates the European Union is looking for."
"A mass, dynamic, grass-roots movement needs to develop against these policies to grab public assets and impose a mediaeval working regime and slave wages."
"Mr President, having congratulated Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the work she has done, I should like to clarify what this is about, because certain misunderstandings have perhaps arisen."
"What we are doing, at Community level, is to adopt an agreement which all the Member States of the European Union voted for in the International Maritime Organisation."
"The Commission is here today, and Parliament agrees with it, so that we can adopt these measures at Community level, wrap them up and put them into practice."
"What makes this directive different from other similar European initiatives is that here we are being proactive, we are acting before we have a fatal disaster, whereas – as you know – in the past we have acted at Community level after shipwrecks or natural or other disasters."
"In this sense, I think that this is an absolutely positive initiative."
"Nonetheless, are there no concerns? Are there no questions?"
"There are."
"They have been voiced by Mr Folias and by Mr Jarzembowski."
"Indeed, the industry at European level is worried that it will bear the burden of the measures before us, measures which are necessary and which – no one is in any doubt – have to be taken."
"It may be an excessive burden or, in certain instances, it may distort competition, because fewer measures will be needed in some Member States and more in others and the industry may therefore bear an uneven burden."
"That is why, given that the Council was not ready to accept certain amendments which directly addressed the question of funding by the Member States themselves, we called on the European Commission – both because the measures are urgent and because the European Parliament could not persuade the Council to move to the conciliation procedure (and I am glad that the Council accepts that at least) – to adopt an amendment making provision for the European Commission to present a study precisely on competition and the extra costs."
"I therefore call on the Commissioner, because the industry really is worried, to assure us today that the Commission will submit this study as quickly as possible and that it will cover the concerns of industry about the functioning of competition in ports from now on."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish first to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for her excellent preparatory work."
"Security is an important issue in shipping."
"My worry has been that small ships operating domestic services, such as ferries and coastal craft, should not have to be included in what is administratively very cumbersome security action."
"The committee has already given attention to this and the matter should be remedied by the amendments proposed."
"My other worry has to do with the increase in costs for small and medium-sized port facilities."
"If different security-related equipment, fencing and other investments have to be in place very promptly, transport services will have to raise charges and, as a result, ports will lose their competitive edge."
"I hope these two issues will be remedied in the vote and I hope they will also be taken into account when the Commission interprets the implementation of the directive."
"Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, it is indeed very important for our fellow citizens that we are able to offer them the best possible security measures in connection with all forms of transport – air, land and sea."
"Today, our debate concerns sea transport, and I will of course take the liberty of offering my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur."
"With regard to maritime transport security, passenger safety is of vital importance to us, but it is also important to take account of the transport of goods."
"A number of ships do indeed transport dangerous goods and, therefore, constitute perfect targets for terrorism."
"It has also been seen, even independently of any problem of terrorism, that simple natural disasters could have catastrophic consequences."
"Everything that contributes to better protection must, therefore, be welcomed and, once again, very important arrangements are being proposed to us, which I support: a national monitoring centre for security at sea and increased staff training, not forgetting the adequate equipping of ports – so many measures for which we have called many times in this House."
"That is what I think is important, even if I agree with my fellow MEPs in asking for these arrangements to be applied in a balanced and harmonious way, without compromising the actual activity of the ports."
"Clear definitions of each party’s responsibilities are also crucial, which is why I have to tackle the issue of the responsibility of the Member States."
"Are the latter prepared to make maritime security a major theme?"
"Which are the countries that have so far transposed the directives voted on in this House?"
"Which countries genuinely monitor the application of our European regulations?"
"What point have we reached in preparing the European map of ports of refuge?"
"Which states have progressed, and which are dragging their heels?"
"I know that, where France is concerned, arrangements have finally been made along these lines."
"What is the position, and even the decision, of the Council on putting in place the European coastguards I have been requesting for a long time?"
"If another disaster or accident were to occur, would Europe still be incriminated, by having helped make it possible, or will the Member States finally face up to their responsibilities?"
"Commissioner, you have in fact completed a piece of work – and a terrific job, at that – in close partnership with the European Parliament."
"It is time to have this recognised and openly and publicly to tell the truth about blocking by individual nations, about delays concerning what is and is not applied and about what the Council of Ministers really wants."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on her work and on her will to reach quick agreements so that a measure of this nature can be adopted speedily and thus be applied immediately."
"As some of my fellow Members have said quite rightly during the debate on this regulation, in view of the existence of terrorism we are faced with a series of dangers."
"We have adopted measures in this Parliament."
"We have adopted measures on the initiative of the Commission, which, in an active way, has been presenting proposals to us during this legislature for improving security in all forms of transport."
"We have adopted them and we are on the point of adopting them in the field of maritime transport."
"In the field of maritime transport we are concerned with international organised forms of terrorism, but there is also a form of terrorism which causes desolation internally, in cases such as Spain."
"This needs to be combated and measures need to be adopted, and that is what we are dealing with."
"It is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made, but improving our safety, improving traffic safety, improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on her proposals and the rapporteur on her determination and will for these measures to be applied quickly."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, combating terrorism requires global action that takes account of the various threats the world faces today and which are, unfortunately, myriad."
"I therefore share the concerns over the issue of maritime transport expressed by the Commission and by the rapporteur and which are clearly implied in the proposal for a regulation we are now examining, which seeks to enhance ship and port facility security, as part of the war on terrorism."
"Such action would necessarily involve the implementation, throughout the European Community, of the international security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and consequently defining a common European policy in this field. This would entail stepping up levels of protection whilst at the same time ensuring that there are no differences of interpretation amongst the various Member States."
"In this context, I should like to refer to three issues that I believe are crucial."
"First of all, with regard to extending the measures adopted under the IMO on domestic shipping and the relevant port facilities, I wish to highlight the need for setting a timetable that is sufficiently long to enable the countries concerned to comply with the rules laid down."
"The inclusion of national maritime traffic should furthermore take account of the assessment of the risk in relation to the level of danger facing the vessel and/or cargo, and in relation to the vulnerability of the vessel or port facility, set against a cost/benefit analysis."
"Furthermore, as regards implementation and monitoring compliance, which are covered by Article 10 of the proposal for a regulation, I believe that these tasks should be carried out by the competent authorities of each Member State."
"Because Community inspections are necessary, these must be undertaken solely under the regulation’s legal base and always in cooperation with the authorities of each Member State."
"Lastly, I wish to point out that, in accordance with the regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, this body has no power to act in the field of security as such."
"This aspect should be considered in a much-needed revision of this regulation."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we European citizens are concerned about maritime safety and we Galicians in particular, since we directly suffered the extremely serious accidents we are all so aware of."
"The consequences of these accidents oblige us to speed up the adoption of maritime safety measures of all types and to seek consensus between the various political groups and between the institutions – Commission, Parliament and Council."
"We must therefore prevent long legislative procedures in order to respond to the citizens’ demands, reaching agreements at first reading preventing the need to go to the conciliation procedure."
"I congratulate the Commission on the proposal it has presented to us, and our rapporteur on her report, which has achieved unanimity, which is significant, as is the support we are giving to the amendments introduced in relation to the extension to other types of ship, such as those transporting particularly dangerous goods, to those preventive measures of all types, and to global agreements within the world framework of the IMO, as well as with the United States."
"This debate is therefore timely but, I would insist, we must remember that, if we agree on the fundamental issue, as we do in general terms, we must also agree on the form and the procedures, and act with the greatest diligence, as has been reiterated here."
"We must not waste a single second on political discussions which extend the legislative procedures on such sensitive issues."
"The IMO measures within the framework of the SOLAS Agreement are therefore welcome, as will the MARPOL measures be, which not only enhance the safety of ships and ports but which also provide for the imposition of criminal sanctions, which we will have to wait to be debated and approved in this House."
"The European Parliament must be on the front line in this fight and I hope that the recently created temporary committee will continue with this consensus and provide the best possible resources and instruments in this fight and lead it on behalf of the European Union at world level."
"– Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal and I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for her very well prepared report."
"The Commission proposal is especially necessary in order to clarify the new international instruments adopted last year by the International Maritime Organisation."
"The tragic events of 11 September showed that every production sector, mode of transport or building can easily fall prey to a terrorist attack."
"Preventive and protective action is also urgently needed for other threats to security at sea, such as piracy and sabotage."
"It is nevertheless important that the EU does not needlessly rush to adopt measures but instead calmly keeps to the framework of the timetable that has already been drawn up by the IMO, which, as it is, is very rigorous and demanding."
"In today’s changing world I see international cooperation as being of priority importance in order to improve security for ships and port facilities and a far better alternative to the unilateral measures that were adopted earlier on."
"It is in the EU’s own interests to operate in multilateral systems, whilst reinforcing them at the same time."
"Furthermore, cooperation with Russia is particularly important."
"I share Commissioner Bolkestein’s concern regarding the possible negative effects on trade that unilateral security measures would have."
"There is a danger that the unilateral agreements in the container sector made in collaboration by American and some European ports will distort competition."
"In this regard I welcome the current negotiations between the Commission and the United States of America to cover the Container Security Initiative agreements."
"The Commission proposal does not really differ in content from the IMO instruments that have been drawn up exclusively for international shipping."
"For that reason, I think it is questionable whether the same instruments should be interpreted in the EU to apply equally to domestic transport services in the Member States."
"Taking the costs and other difficulties resulting from compliance with security measures such as these into account, I see no need to go any further than the IMO conventions."
"The power of decision to apply measures to individual countries’ domestic transport systems must in any case remain with the Member States, which are best placed to assess the situation."
"It would, for example, be absurd if ferries operating in the internal waters of Finland, with its thousands of lakes, had to endure thorough security checks if there were no particular threats to security anyway."
". – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, once again for the work she has done, as well as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the way in which they have carried out their work and the improvements they have made to the text, since the majority of the amendments are acceptable, although in some cases with a slightly different wording."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Oreja Arburúa and Mr Folias, from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, respectively, for the opinions they have contributed and which have also served to improve the text proposed by the Commission."
"The rapporteurs’ work in close cooperation with the Commission and the Council will allow – I hope – this text to be approved at first reading."
"There are many amendments, which are enormously technical, which are intended, if I have understood correctly, to bring the Commission’s proposal closer to the text resulting from the activities of the Council which for its part has held many meetings on this project, in the presence of experts."
"I am happy that, thanks to this interaction – a kind of almost permanent trialogue throughout the negotiation – we have been able to find a positive response to almost everything."
"I would like to point out, in response to what has been raised by some of the honourable Members, specifically Mr Folias and Mr Hatzidakis, that we accept the amendment which calls for a study focused on the distribution of funding between public authorities and operators without prejudice to the distribution of competences between Member States and the European Community, a study in which the costs of the application of these measures will be analysed, as well as its repercussions on the competitiveness of the maritime sector in relation to alternative transport systems and the European economy in general."
"We will naturally present this study to Parliament and the Council and where necessary we will draw up the relevant proposals in accordance with it."
"Nevertheless, there are five amendments which raise certain problems for the Commission and which I would like to comment on briefly."
"Two of them we cannot accept because they call into question the delicate balance we have achieved with the Council with regard to the extension of these measures to national traffic."
"I prefer those of your amendments which precisely reflect the balance which has been achieved."
"There are three new amendments relating to comitology, which, in so far as they do not jeopardise the role of the Maritime Safety Committee, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002, we will be able to accept."
"Finally, given the complexity of the tasks in hand, the Commission accepts removal of the early implementation of these measures, although I believe it to be essential that each State adopts a national programme for the application of the legislation we are proposing with this Regulation."
"In summary, the Commission can accept 62 amendments in full, 5 partially, and rejects, as I have said, just 2."
"These figures clearly reflect the cooperation which has taken place, which I am glad about and in relation to which I would like to thank once again all the honourable Members for your work throughout these months."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0364/2003) by Mr Jarzembowski on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services."
". – Mr President, Madam Vice-President, in the course of difficult negotiations, Parliament’s delegation has been able to persuade the Council to accept a large number of rules in the interests not only of existing port systems and of the port workers, but also of fair competition conditions in and between ports."
"Even though there were some demands that we could not get the Council to accept, I therefore recommend that all Members of this House should accept the result of the conciliation procedure and express their satisfaction with what has been achieved."
"Considerations of legal certainty for ports, port operators, and port workers mean that the European Union needs its first basic directive on ports."
"Rejection of this compromise would leave unregulated for years matters of vital importance to European transport policy, such as market access within the ports and the conditions under which ports compete with each other, and would therefore open the door to distortions of competition among ports and uncontrollable duplications of their services."
"Let me issue a warning to those Members of this House who advocate rejection: if that were to happen, the Commission would be entitled to examine the situation in each individual port."
"We would do better to lay down basic rules, so that everyone knows from the outset by what rules they must abide."
"In particular, Parliament can count itself very fortunate that the Council has accepted its demand that the definition of self-handling should cover only the deployment of the shipping companies’ own seamen and not of its land-based staff as well."
"In that respect, Parliament has been able to give practical expression to the principal concerns of both the operators of ports and of the people who work in them."
"In order to achieve a compromise, on the other hand, Parliament’s delegation had to abandon its demand for a general requirement for prior authorisation for port services."
"The Council wants to follow the subsidiarity principle and leave this in the competence of the Member States."
"Our side was nonetheless able to gain acceptance for the idea that the Member States should be able to ensure that the competent authority can insist on prior authorisation for the provision of port services, so this is still left to the Member States’ discretion."
"Finally, the Council accepted Parliament’s amendments on periods and conditions for authorisations and transitional arrangements, in which Parliament has ensured that interests in ownership are put on an equivalent footing to leasing arrangements."
"Parliament’s delegation has also achieved acceptance for the requirement that authorisations be amended or abrogated where the criteria for authorisation or for the social security regulations to apply are not complied with in substance."
"It must therefore be noted that we have taken up an unambiguous position on the social conditions of port workers, and have done a splendid job of it."
"The Council also accepted that the Member States have to enact regulations whereby the newly-authorised service providers are obliged to make appropriate compensation payments to former service providers, but – and this is something with which we are not very satisfied – the Council wants this to be restricted to those instances in which the period of validity of their authorisations is reduced as a result of the new directive."
"One can see a certain logic in this."
"In all other cases, the legislation of the individual States is to be applicable."
"One aspect of the overall compromise that Parliament was obliged to accept with some regret was that pilotage services remain within the scope of the directive."
"This was, however, made acceptable by the Council and Parliament’s joint and particular emphasis on the importance of pilotage services in terms of safety and the protection of the environment, and the fact that the competent authorities can, on grounds of public safety, continue to restrict pilotage to one single service provider."
"Parliament eventually managed to delete the limited duration of authorisation for pilotage services, for which the Council had provided."
"I think Parliament broke new ground in managing to get the objectives of the directive extended by adding to them the creation of fair conditions of competition in and between ports."
"To this end, ports and the providers of port services are obliged to disclose to the Commission and to the Member States the financial relations between themselves and public undertakings."
"For its part, the Commission is required to draw the necessary conclusions from this with regard to removing distortions of competition, and it has already indicated its readiness to enact explicit directives concerning the degree to which public funding in ports is permissible."
"I would like to note, by way of summary, that this outcome from the conciliation procedure is a great success for all of us in view of the wholly negative stance initially adopted by the Council."
"I would like, in particular, to thank the Italian presidency of the Council and the Vice-President for enabling us to take this problematic dossier to what I regard as a good conclusion."
"Please permit me to make the following final observation. We are dealing here not only with single issues relating to ports."
"What is at stake here is ability of the EU’s ports to compete, being as they are crucially important as nodal points in the trans-European networks."
"We all share in the task of making these ports more efficient, and so I ask you to accept the outcome of the conciliation procedure and endorse it."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the House and the Conciliation Committee for their work in relation to the proposal for a Directive on access to the port services market."
"Allow me in particular to thank the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Imbeni, and the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for the hard work they have undertaken on such a complex issue."
"The House is being asked to vote on a compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee."
"I would like to say very clearly that the Commission supports this compromise; although I know that certain honourable Members are opposed to it, I would like to ask you to reflect before rejecting this compromise."
"I believe this compromise is essential to European transport policy."
"This compromise does not mean a complete liberalisation of port services, as I have heard throughout the previous debate."
"Far from it."
"All it means is a small degree of openness so that certain types of service can be carried out by means of self-handling, that is to say, only using on-board personnel."
"Ladies and gentlemen, every day we talk about wanting transport which respects the environment and which is sustainable, that we want to promote short sea shipping, so we cannot then vote the next day against a measure which is going to facilitate the development of this type of transport."
"What I would like to say to you is that we must be coherent with the proposals we make."
"The proposal we are voting on, particularly in the form it now takes following the discussions in Parliament, following Parliament’s amendments, following the negotiations with the Council, is a very balanced and very moderate proposal, but it can clearly serve to promote maritime cabotage, something which is essential to guaranteeing a sustainable transport system in Europe."
"We have had three years of negotiations and I simply believe that rejecting this initiative would cause very serious problems for transport policy in the coming years."
"I would like to remind you of some of the aspects of the text which will be put to the vote on Thursday."
"The initial proposal was limited to rules applicable within a given port."
"Well, Parliament firmly insisted on the need to address the issue of competition between ports and this point, which the Commission accepted, has been corrected in the final text, in agreement with the Council."
"The Commission’s initial proposal referred to self-handling with on-board and land-based personnel."
"It is true; we opened up the issue of self-handling for companies with land-based personnel."
"Parliament raised two types of issue: one, the social guarantees to prevent social dumping, an issue which the Commission accepted, and two: restricting even further the margin of this self-handling and reducing it to on-board personnel."
"At the moment we are only talking about on-board personnel."
"It is obvious that this self-handling by on-board personnel is going to function with short distance transport."
"It is not going to function with the great trans-ocean forms of transport because of the type of goods transported and the type of ship used."
"We are therefore talking about something that is key to the development of short distance transport."
"Parliament's position is therefore maintained and self-handling has been restricted to on-board personnel."
"And, furthermore, with the social guarantees I referred to earlier."
"In the initial proposal pilotage was considered a commercial service subject to all the rules."
"Parliament proposed its exclusion and in the end we have reached an agreement which means a degree of openness with regard to pilotage."
"But, let us make it very clear that we are not liberalising the piloting service."
"What we are talking about is, for example – and once again we are talking about cabotage and short sea shipping – the captain who uses a route on a daily basis, or two or three times a week, who knows the route perfectly, being able possibly to obtain authorisation not to require pilotage."
"We are talking about a measure which is key to short sea shippingThis is not going to affect trans-ocean traffic in which the ship docks at the same port once, twice or five times a year."
"This issue only affects those ships which have regular routes, that is, once again, the issue of short sea shipping."
"I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission has been enormously flexible throughout this discussion."
"We believe that some of the measures proposed by the honourable Members have improved the texts – I have not referred to them, because they were not controversial."
"Others, which raised or reflected problems, even of a political nature, we have tried to balance as far as possible."
"What remains in the end is the minimum, but it is a vital minimum, and I would like to insist on this point, vital in order to be able to promote cabotage, essentially cabotage within the European Union."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask for your support, for your vote, for this compromise proposal which was reached the other day in the Conciliation Committee."
"I would like once again to thank Mr Imbeni and of course Mr Jarzembowski for their work throughout this time."
"Mr President, today, with the report by Mr Jarzembowski, whom I should like to congratulate on the lengthy efforts he has made to bring us to this point, we are essentially doing no more than what we did when Parliament called for postal services to be opened up to competition, railway services to be opened up to competition and air transport to be opened up to competition."
"It would be strange if this Parliament, which has been at the vanguard of opening up these services, came along tomorrow and said, for incomprehensible reasons – to me at least – that there must be an exception from this long line of action to open up all these services to competition and that the exception was port services."
"At the end of the day, as Mrs de Palacio said, numerous positions expressed by Parliament were accepted during discussions with the Council."
"Pilotage services, which are an exception, self-handling, which has been restricted to on board ship, competition between ports, where basically Parliament's position was accepted, while the Commission – at the beginning of the procedure at least – was against. Protecting employment rights, where there is an express provision in the directive that we cannot have a lower level of protection than that which exists in each Member State."
"Consequently, I at least honestly fail to understand why certain people continue to oppose what we have achieved which, it should be pointed out, does not make industry absolutely happy, especially the shipowners, who wanted something bolder."
"I, for my part, think that this compromise which we have before us serves the interests of industry to a certain degree in that there are other service providers – it breaks the monopoly and there is greater choice – and it serves the workers, because in this way new companies are being created and new companies mean new jobs."
"Consequently, it is a step forward, which is why we must support the outcome of the conciliation and vote yes."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one can have the same goals, Commissioner, whilst nevertheless pursuing them by different means."
"German ports, at any rate, are currently enjoying impressive growth, and doing so without this directive."
"Things can evidently go the other way."
"This week, this House has had the great opportunity to make it clear that, far from us being the Council’s agent, our primary obligation is to people, citizens and workers."
"Let me remind you: at second reading stage, all of us in this House, by very, very large majorities, joined together in calling for three important things: we wanted the ports’ financial relations to be made transparent and put on a regulated footing, and that has, in part, been achieved."
"We wanted pilotage services in shipping not to be just any port service like tugboats or mooring, subject to the prevalent great economic pressure that there is in ports, and not to be subject to competition but committed to safety."
"Being a special public task, pilotage services do not belong in this directive, but we have not managed to keep them out of it."
"One very important point is that we wanted self-handling to be restricted to the ship and its crew, but with discretionary approval and with decent conditions in terms of social security and labour law."
"Let me quote once again: ‘Self-handlers shall be treated in the same way as other port service providers."
"To this end, self-handlers must adhere to the same standards of social protection and possess the same vocational qualifications as other service providers in the same, or a similar, port system.’"
"That is what the Council rejected; that is what we failed to achieve."
"We cannot, then, describe this as a fair compromise; it is more like kow-towing to the Council."
"If, then, you want the pilots, who guide ships safely into our ports, to continue to have obligations in terms of safety and the environment, then you have to reject what has come out of this conciliation procedure."
"If you want to deny social dumping a foothold in our ports, and want instead to enable qualified workers to operate under good social conditions; if you want social harmony to be maintained in our ports, then you have to reject this directive."
"I am all in favour of looking at these compromises to see if the glass is half full or half empty, but, in this instance, the glass is not half-full of water; it contains just a few drops for Parliament, and I can tell the Council that it cannot be in Parliament’s interest to start by taking up a firm position and then being satisfied with little."
"This is not just about the matter in hand, but also, in this instance, about our conception of our parliamentary function."
"That is why I strongly urge – as does my group – that we reject the whole thing."
"– Mr President, after two and a half years of debates, amendments, demonstrations and votes until well into the night, there is now a compromise proposal before us."
"Not everyone is pleased with it."
"The result is a step forward in the European maritime sector."
"I should like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for the fact that he has still achieved a certain result."
"It will not have escaped anyone’s attention that this topic has unleashed strong emotions; that is quite clear from the dockworkers’ demonstrations here in Brussels, and even in Rotterdam."
"I should like to touch upon those demonstrations."
"The demonstrators have made good use of their democratic right to inform us as MEPs fully and effectively."
"I welcome the idea of demonstrating to press home a message."
"However, it is regrettable if this degenerates into causing destruction, disturbance, threatening people and suppressing other views."
"I have first-hand experience of the uncomfortable feeling one is left with if one adopts a stance that deviates from theirs."
"This is very unfortunate."
"As a result, people are forced into excessive action and mudslinging."
"Despite this, something has been achieved – a legal framework that allows for clear and transparent relations between ports, authorities and service providers, with transparency in the use of public funds to finance ports and the agreement to draft a clear guideline on the reconcilability of state support with European law."
"Pilotage services have been included after all, together with the option of self-handling, which, to my mind, is too restricted."
"Shipping companies have acquired more entrepreneurial room, which they need in order to secure a good return on investments."
"More room means growth and employment."
"More jobs, that is the best social policy, in general."
"In Parliament, we have very little say in the quality of the work."
"We should, therefore, not turn this into our ambition."
"In the Netherlands, where a great deal of port work is done, progress is being made and industrial peace has been reasonably limited."
"In order to remove the concerns surrounding the enhanced self-handling possibilities in shipping companies, quayside service providers and trade unions, I have received written pledges from both the Social Affairs Minister and the Transport Minister, our former fellow MEP, Mrs Peijs, that they want to create new policy to put strict guarantees in place to ensure that Dutch labour law is observed in the ports."
"Pledges of that kind should also be possible elsewhere."
"In short, we are making progress, and the Liberals will be predominantly voting in favour."
"– Mr President, seagoing shipping and ports offer more scope for abuse than many other businesses."
"They involve the handling of cross-border flows of goods between different states, not only within the European Union but also across the entire world."
"Those countries do not only differ in terms of legislation, but, above all, in terms of reward of labour, working conditions, safety and the extent of environmental protection."
"Such differences are eagerly seized on by those who see social dumping and environmental pollution as ways of winning a competitive battle."
"For many years in seagoing shipping, we have known the phenomenon of flags of convenience, whereby ships of European owners are given a registration in a developing-world country."
"As a result, they pay lower taxes, need not comply with many rules and can hire crews at developing-world salaries."
"Enterprises in ownership of EU citizens compete with each other through the international jungle."
"The fact that to date, that jungle in the European ports has been kept outside of the door as much as possible is no coincidence."
"Without extensive battles fought by trade unions and without local port companies, ports of convenience would have taken root a long time ago."
"These are ports with an ever-lower level of pay, safety and environmental protection; ports that can offer only temporary jobs, which are dirty and unsafe and, above all, attract unskilled labourers; ports where much of the work can be done by people from the developing world who are not admitted to Europe for other on-shore work."
"In a competitive battle of this kind, ports that service a common hinterland will destroy each other."
"The winner will always be the most anti-social, the most environmentally-unfriendly, the most unsafe, and consequently, the port of greatest convenience."
"If the European Union wishes to harmonise rules for port labour, these must be geared to eliminating unfair and dangerous competition per group of ports that serve a common hinterland."
"This problem is particularly acute for the ports surrounding the North Sea, from Dunkirk, in France, via the Belgian and Dutch ports to Hamburg, in Germany."
"Railways, rivers and canals connect those ports with largely the same industrial areas and with cities brimming with consumers."
"For a long time, those ports have been trying to steal each others’ customers by means of large government investments, low rates and a great deal of stealth."
"In the previous part-session, this Parliament stated that something should, in fact, be done about this by means of a port directive, one that would offer the highest level of protection for registered and qualified port labour across Europe, and which would prevent shipping accidents as a result of faults during loading, as happened with the Danish freight ship in February."
"A port directive of that kind would be in keeping with a number of recent environmental measures of the European Union that are aimed at making it more difficult to dump shipping waste and freight residues at sea and, in time, at keeping away single-hulled tankers from European ports."
"Instead, the Commission has proposed a directive that leads to the opposite."
"By hindering, or reducing, existing protection of registered port labour against unfair competition at Member State level, this competition is only set to increase."
"Maybe the port handling costs of goods will be reduced as a result, but these only formed a negligibly small part of the production costs in most cases anyway."
"Parliament corrected these plans both at first reading two years ago and at second reading in March."
"Admittedly, this correction did not go as far as the trade unions wanted, and scope for abuse remained, but the parties involved with different interests appeared to be able to live with this to some degree."
"That is no longer the case since the Council of Transport Ministers refused systematically last summer to adopt those corrections."
"During conciliation, the parliamentary delegation initially appeared determined to persist in the view previously adopted by Parliament."
"This applied not only to the groups of the Left, but I also heard this from Christian Democrats and Liberals."
"On 29 September, most of those objections had suddenly evaporated."
"In exchange for a further study into competition and a text which juggles with the words ‘may’ and ‘must’, eight of the fifteen Members have surrendered what Parliament had achieved."
"The fact that a directive is coming into being was suddenly more important than its exact content."
"The ultimate proposal is very reminiscent of Spanish and Italian acts concerning monopoly ports with a small hinterland around the Mediterranean."
"The application to other parts of Europe will lead to more industrial disputes and abuse, particularly in the North Sea ports."
"On various occasions, port labourers in the present and future Member States have made it clear in great numbers that they find this unacceptable."
"Under these conditions, the directive is counterproductive and should therefore not be adopted."
"This proposal should be rejected on Thursday."
"– Mr President, much as I should like to thank the rapporteur, the Commissioner and others for the work that they have done, it has not yielded the desired outcome."
"The Green Paper on ports was clear, because it was determined to tackle competition among ports, particularly unfair competition and the implications of this unfair competition on the environment when new terminals are built."
"Ultimately, we ended up with a directive on competition in ports and the opening up of markets to new service providers."
"Examining what has come out of the conciliation procedure, we have to say that the balance is not favourable."
"It does not include the compulsory authorisations that had been requested for new service providers with regard to social, environmental and other requirements, such as safety."
"A definition of self-handling is missing, because reference is made to own crews, which leaves plenty of scope in current labour relations at most ports."
"Enough has been said about pilotage."
"Transparency too, so adulated by Mr Jarzembowski, is in our view, a step forward, but it does not come close to what we had previously asked for."
"All in all, the proposal is unacceptable, certainly bearing in mind the ILO treaties with regard to poor working and labour conditions, and safety."
"There is a considerable risk of these ports turning into ports of convenience."
"Taking all views into consideration, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance reject this compromise as a proposal that fails to strike the right balance."
"Liberalisation is not a panacea and, as Mrs de Palacio suggested, rejecting the proposal does not pose any problems whatsoever to others."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise obtained in the conciliation committee in September no more satisfies us than the previous readings did."
"In view of the very close vote – eight votes in favour and seven against – we are not alone."
"Mr Jarzembowski has, however, brought all his considerable powers of persuasion to bear."
"Although we were automatically in agreement with the search for increased efficiency in order to face the challenge of becoming competitive in a globalised economy, we did not want this to be done in any old way, with a single and final objective: the total liberalisation of port services."
"Technical, social and environmental security must in fact remain the objective to be preserved, whatever the reform implemented."
"Now, if pilotage has been, on the surface of it, preserved from unbridled competition, the freedom given to each state seems to us to be too great and to contradict the notion of public service, a characteristic that the services in question are acknowledged as possessing, whether by the states themselves or by the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"Where self-handling is concerned, social and environmental security could, in the same way, be impaired by shipowners directly employing their own equipment and their own staff, who would be inexperienced, untrained and employed on a casual basis."
"It is unlikely that employees’ social protection and the constraints of optimum security count for very much faced with the search for financial profitability obtained through cheap labour."
"Whereas the whole chain of services – pilotage, mooring and unloading – requires professionals skilled in these types of activity so as to avoid any risk of accident, self-handling would involve a levelling down of the services provided, as well as of professional qualifications and environmental security, and would also entail a social cost linked to job losses."
"In conclusion, we reject the creation of ports of convenience and self-handling at terminals."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Flanders, thousands of Flemish dock workers’ families are anxiously waiting this week to see how next Thursday’s vote on the liberalisation of port services will turn out."
"In Flanders, thousands of people are anxiously waiting this week to see whether they will have a job in a few months’ time."
"That, and nothing else, is the bottom line of the report we are debating again today."
"The fact is that, for thousands of Flemish dockworkers, liberalisation in this context means nothing more than unemployment and social misery."
"By blindly believing its own ideology and ignoring any serious consultation with the parties involved, the Commission proves once again that it could not give a damn about the subsidiarity principle with which the prophets of the ‘Europe of milk and honey’ have bombarded us since Maastricht."
"Indeed, in the context of this issue, the Commission is tampering with traditions which, for decades, have made the name and fame of the Flemish ports across the world."
"With Thursday’s vote on this report, Europe is at risk of wiping out tens of years of social peace in the Flemish ports in the name of an ultra-Liberal ideology, which is at risk of creating the opposite of what it intends to do."
"The liberalisation of particularly energy and rail transport has shown in Flanders, for example, but also in Great Britain, that it can also adversely impact on competition, job quality and the provision of services."
"Liberalisation of this kind could have pernicious consequences for our ports, their competitiveness, their employment and their provision of services."
"However, it is not too late."
"I hope that on Thursday, all MEPs, whatever group or persuasion they belong to across the political spectrum, will consider the precarious situation of the dockworkers in Antwerp, Zeebrugge and Ghent, but also in the other European ports."
"I therefore hope that there will be a massive vote against this report."
"Commissioner, you began the debate on the by explaining to us that the maritime environment was an area of uncontrolled freedom, a kind of jungle that needed to be subjected to rules."
"What was the case where security was concerned is, unfortunately, all the more the case in the social sphere."
"We all now know that crews are particularly mixed, both in terms of nationalities and also of social and geographic origins."
"In these conditions, self-handling amounts to introducing the social jungle of the maritime sphere into our ports."
"Naturally, the problem it presents is basically one of monitoring compliance with the social rules of both the recipient country and the port."
"Who will argue convincingly that, because they have stepped out into a port at which their ship has just called, two Filipinos, three Malays, two Argentinians and one African engaged in self-handling will respect the same social rules that apply in the country in which that port is located?"
"Naturally, that is how dock workers – and not simply dock workers but also dock work companies throughout Europe – have realised that the desire was now to engage in competition through social dumping, that is to say by resorting to the social break-up of an entire profession, whether it be public or private."
"That is why we cannot agree to set the fox to mind the geese."
"What is necessary, rather – and all the populations would understand this – is that a genuine assault be made upon the anarchy that prevails when it comes to flags and crews reduced to slavery and that it be ensured that all of the rules are applied, rules that are totally circumvented by the majority of countries in the International Maritime Organisation which, as everyone knows, are pirate countries, no less than the shipowners who are nationals of them are pirates."
"If the ability existed to restore order and also to harmonise the fiscal and social conditions in all our own countries – and this is valid not only in the maritime sphere but also in that of heavy goods vehicles – then, certainly, a directive such as this would acquire credibility, and it would then be possible to talk about fair competition."
"Unfortunately, it is, rather, a form of social break-up that you are proposing to us and, in these conditions, we cannot take the risk."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, thank you for the work that you have done, but I will not support the compromise, because I see this compromise as lacking an essential link, namely that authorisations should be used in EU ports."
"We had approved this in Parliament at second reading, but it is not included in the compromise."
"A competent authority is entitled to apply for an authorisation, but it is not required to do so, and I see that as a key issue."
"Both at first and at second reading, I worked hard to improve the article on authorisations, even with the help of the Commissioner in a number of areas."
"Both at first and at second reading, we managed to improve this licensing system."
"Despite this, Mr Jarzembowski, I have a feeling that we could have gone a little further during conciliation, and that we perhaps should have spent all of our time creating a better text on that score too."
"I am, in any case, in favour of free port services."
"In my opinion, everyone should be able to offer their services there, but these free services should be counterbalanced by a licensing system which should be regulated in such a way that we can make our own demands in the areas of environment, public services and, last but not least, social legislation."
"In the Flemish ports, relations among dock workers, employers and dock installations have deteriorated a great deal over the past eighteen months."
"Whatever the result of next Thursday’s vote may be, this worsening situation will need to be addressed with or without a directive."
"I would therefore ask everyone involved to gather around the negotiating table in order to discuss the future of our ports and to ensure that it is not jeopardised, with or without a directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is, indeed, not the first time that this directive has been debated."
"I continue to think that it is a liberal directive that has one sole priority: the reduction of costs, to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services."
"Indeed, the major problem lies with self-handling."
"Even with self-handling restricted to on-board crew and always assuming that, as remains to be seen, this will have no effect upon the social legislation of the Member States, ships’ crews or specially taken-on workers will, as you pointed out, be able to carry out loading and unloading operations in place of current qualified staff."
"Whether one likes it or not, self-handling amounts to allowing social dumping, even if it is now accompanied by references to security and to staff being qualified."
"Such a system would be dangerous to people because it would permit practices prejudicial to security: insufficient qualifications, ignorance of the locality and of instructions, a lack of understanding of the language and insufficient training."
"Any shipowner would, in this way, be able to call upon cheap labour, which would be dangerous for the ports and their environment."
"This problem also affects professions other than dock work, particularly those of the inshore and other pilots excluded in the first version and those connected with towing, which are subject to constraints in relation to the port authorities."
"I would add that, because the Council did not hold back the authorisations that had to be requested by the owners before having recourse to self-handling, the result will, as my fellow MEP Mr Savary said, be the introduction of the law of the jungle into the whole sector."
"Uncertainty is in this way being brought to bear upon all the qualified staff who until now have contributed to port security: the dockers who fulfil a very important economic task in difficult conditions by preserving security; and nautical services such as inshore and other pilotage services, universally recognised as services of general interest."
"All these sectors should be considered as essential partners contributing to the objective of maritime security and sustainable development."
"The proposal submitted to us cannot but have serious social consequences in the ports, and where employment too is concerned."
"There has been no genuine consultation of the interested parties."
"We are today being asked to vote in favour of a text that is rejected by all the professionals working in the ports."
"This is, it has to be said, a curious conception of democracy."
"Yesterday evening, here even in Strasbourg, employee representatives again met the groups to explain to them their points of view and to sound the alert."
"I think we must not remain deaf to this alert."
"These people have arguments we have to listen to."
"In conclusion, I am anxious, finally, to say that I think it is impossible to reflect upon this directive by removing it from the context of our debates on maritime security."
"Our Parliament has come out in favour of a temporary committee of inquiry on the ."
"We have had a lot of discussion in this House of the various measures in favour of maritime security and, Commissioner, you have put forward rational proposals."
"Personally, I never forget that, in the various meetings I was able to have on the French coast, all the maritime professionals always insisted, following the damage caused by the , that security began in the ports."
"You spoke about coherence."
"Having said that, I find there is incredible incoherence in taking, on the one hand, positive measures concerning maritime security and, on the other hand, effectively destroying these with the decision on self-handling."
"In the interests of security, employment and the sustainable development of the European ports, we have to reject this document."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our ports are of enormous importance to our prosperity, and they form the linchpin for world trade."
"Unfair competition among ports should therefore be avoided, and we can imagine a directive to this effect, but it has not been drafted yet."
"However, the fight should not lead to a lack of security, social dumping and environmental pollution in ports."
"Self-handling that has been proposed in this forum, even in its watered-down version, constitutes a serious infringement of this."
"In this light, the European Parliament would have liked to make self-handling dependent on a real compulsory authorisation and omit the pilotage services from the competitive battle."
"It is therefore very unfortunate that neither the Council nor the Commission acted upon the compromise that was struck in Parliament."
"Despite two and a half years of discussion, the camps are diametrically opposed to each other."
"We are in favour of a breach in social tradition in our ports."
"After the ships of convenience, we are now also being faced with ports of convenienceThis fear is not only present among port workers, but also among those who are concerned about social peace in our ports, which is being jeopardised by your directive, Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"This push for liberalisation is currently presenting more risks than benefits in our ports."
"We will therefore vote against it, and do so emphatically."
"Mr President, I very much identified with Parliament’s position at second reading."
"If I compare this with the end result of the conciliation procedure, it is evident that the agreement with the Council focuses on elements other than those regarded as the most important by Parliament."
"By accepting commitments concerning studies into competition, we have actually attained competition within ports."
"This exchange is anything but fair."
"This agreement is an unfair distribution of joys and burdens across employers and employees."
"Other transport sectors have demonstrated the need for minimising the risks in the area of social maladministration."
"This has not happened here, although there is a need."
"I take the view that a general authorisation obligation would serve this purpose much more effectively."
"Given our aspiration to adopt sustainable transport policy and systems for businesses, staff and society alike, I am thus unable to support the result that the committee is tabling here today."
"Mr President, the truth is that, as has been quite rightly pointed out, we have dedicated two and a half years of work on an important and critical issue which, as we can see, inspires great passion."
"I am genuinely surprised by today's debate, because it appears that we are pitting the social Europe of the nineteenth century against a form of capitalism and the Mafia activities of the Chicago of the 1920s in our ports."
"And in fact what we want is precisely the opposite."
"This is the twenty-first century."
"We want a modern and effective social Europe."
"We want sustainable ports, which are competitive and able to provide an alternative to other types of transport."
"What we are being presented with does not give us this of course, but it is a small first step, much less than what many of us expected."
"That is the Europe I believe in."
"The Europe of the nineteenth century, the Europe which reflects the Chicago of the Twenties, is not my Europe."
"Perhaps some people want that. Perhaps that is what some people want to maintain."
"Naturally, we are not going to support it and we are going to vote in favour of conciliation."
"I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on having maintained the objective of modernising our ports, the will of the rapporteur and the will of certain parliamentary groups which have defended, despite the absolutely unacceptable pressure they have received from certain workers in European ports, the modernisation and competitiveness of our ports."
"– Mr President, there is a world of difference between the words ‘must’ and ‘may’."
"The Directive that is now in front of us following conciliation states that ports may introduce a system of authorisations, and then, in particular, for ports doing loading and unloading work themselves."
"The Jarzembowski report, which we adopted earlier at second reading, still states that ports introduce a system of authorisations."
"A significant part of the compromise text differs from the text adopted at second reading."
"The difference between ‘may’ and ‘must’ has significant implications for ports and dockers in Europe."
"A non-compulsory authorisation system promotes unfair competition, which can harm quality of employment in the ports that do have a good authorisation system."
"Surely that was not the intention of this liberalisation."
"Second-class ports would remain, and the unfair competition resulting from this could harm quality of employment in the well-organised ports."
"One point has always taken priority in my party, the Dutch Labour Party, and that is our minimum."
"The scenario of ports doing loading and unloading themselves must be well regulated by means of a good authorisation system that applies across the board."
"This was conceded in the conciliation procedure."
"There is now to be no compulsory authorisation system for self-handling."
"In short, genuine harmonisation on a key issue such as ports doing their own loading and unloading is out of the question, as a result of which there can be different regimes in different ports."
"It has thus become a bad example of liberalisation."
"It is remarkable, however, that the EU is able to lay down detailed rules for all and sundry in many situations, but has proved unable to do so in this case, where job quality is concerned."
"We have to explain that once again to those people whose interests are at issue here."
"It will surprise no one, therefore, having heard my speech, that my group has no choice but to vote against this directive."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his hard work regarding this matter."
"The proposed compromise is a cautious step towards opening up the market in port services and increasing transparency in ports."
"The compromise is not the best possible one, but is nevertheless an acceptable solution."
"Including pilotage services within the scope of the directive is problematic, especially in areas that are sensitive in terms of safety at sea and the environment."
"The compromise honed in the conciliation procedure is, however, acceptable in this respect."
"It is important to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of ports as transport hubs in the development of the transport system throughout the Union."
"Opening up ports to controlled, healthy competition and increasing their transparency will improve their competitiveness and levels of efficiency, which will increase the use of combined and maritime transport."
"Maritime transport is vital for overseas regions and it offers a more environmentally friendly alternative in congested areas."
"This compromise is a cautious step in the right direction."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat amazed."
"You, Commissioner, have argued that we will, by means of this directive, influence transport policy towards sustainability."
"I would very much like to remind you what sustainability means."
"It was specified at Göteborg that sustainability is an equilateral triangle of the economic, the ecological and the social."
"Let me just ask you a simple question: in what way were you promoting sustainability when, by means of this directive, you are jeopardising safety in ports?"
"It can make for worse damage to the environment and does nothing to improve the protection of it."
"In what way are you strengthening the social element when you allow self-handling, which means that the ship’s crew, who have been travelling on it for so long, now, in addition, have to load and unload it?"
"Qualifications and the reduction of working time do not come into it."
"Mr Hatzidakis’ argument that new jobs will be created is crazy."
"I beg you, if the same jobs are done by people who already have other things to do, that reduces jobs rather than encouraging the creation of additional ones."
"It also goes against the Lisbon agenda if we want to achieve full employment by 2012, but keep going in the opposite direction."
"I have to tell you in all honesty, Commissioner, that I really would have expected you to look at these aspects from the right angle."
"What you said was completely one-sided, and, as you said, it indicates that you want to let liberalisation advance."
"If that is what you see as your objective, then it is in order for you to just say so."
"Then it will be perfectly clear that we can never find a common denominator, because, for you, liberalisation means nothing more than cutting costs in the economic sphere."
"You may well claim that it is about that, but I do not, and nor does my group."
"Turning to the port workers and the pilots, you have, in the course of the debate we have had – and Mr Jarzembowski knows this too – met some of our expectations, but not others."
"At the end, after the conciliation process, absolutely none of the people affected are on your side – none whatever!"
"Yesterday, we were again visited by the port workers, whose 21 000 signatures make up an extraordinary amount for this occupation, and you do not even take note of it!"
"That means, I believe, that this directive, rather than promoting safety and social standards and thereby putting competition on a single footing, is achieving the precise opposite."
"For that reason, we can do no other than reject it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we do want more transport by sea, but not if it is unsafe."
"As many speakers have already said, this Directive is indeed bad news for dockers, because there are no minimum social standards that are enforceable throughout the EU."
"In fact, this is a bad example to the world."
"We as Europeans are always trying to outdo others with our social standards."
"If this is adopted, however, we shall be promoting negative globalisation and social disintegration."
"Anyone who thinks that the present text still presents a chance of putting a brake on the downward spiral is mistaken."
"That will soon become clear, because competition between ports is ruthless."
"Without strict conditions, self-handling will be the kiss of death for ordinary dockers."
"This text is bad news for pilots, too. On the contrary, we want more compulsory pilotage."
"Risks are ever-increasing on account of the shipping routes becoming busier, and also of maritime personnel being less well trained."
"The off the Flemish coast was a chilling example of this."
"There have also been more than 60 near collisions."
"There must be more competent pilots on board, therefore. To make savings on this is to make savings on safety, and to play with lives and the environment."
"Mr President, if the European Parliament is to be taken seriously, it must stick to its previous decisions and vote against the outcome of the conciliation."
"None of the important changes adopted by Parliament at second reading of the Commission’s proposal can in any way be found in the conciliation document."
"For example, the right to demand on a national basis that collective agreements be adhered to has been completely disregarded."
"Furthermore, liberalisation now also extends to include the pilots."
"If Parliament votes in favour of the proposal, the shipowners will interpret it themselves and be free to decide at whim whether to use seamen or port workers, just as entrepreneurs and shipowners will be able to sit loose to hard-won rights and collective wage agreements."
"Both will be free to choose whom they want to work for them, and they will be able to use unorganised and underpaid labour for loading and unloading ships, rather than use well-trained port workers who, through agreements, have secured their entitlement to the work and to proper conditions."
"The consequence will be unemployed port workers, together with ports of convenience consonant with our now seeing ships sailing under flags of convenience."
"Liberalisation is also partly responsible for undermining port security at a time when major investments are otherwise being made in securing the ports against terrorism."
"In Denmark, it is not only the case of the 1 500 or so port workers that is on the agenda."
"It is the Danish model for agreements that is in danger."
"That is the principle involved in how far the EU should go in harmonising, and intervening in, wage and working conditions."
"It is quite conceivable that other groups of workers will be up for consideration."
"It is therefore important for a line to be drawn in the sand."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has been made to waves, and these are still lashing my part of northern Germany, rising indeed to a great height, and it is difficult to speak in just about 120 seconds about an issue that will affect the structure of our European ports and coasts as a whole."
"I am fundamentally convinced of the advantages of creating a clear, open and transparent common legal framework."
"I am convinced that competition between ports demands the continuation of a purpose-built framework and of certain rules, not least for the sake of the workers and of our environment."
"This, then, is the great objective towards which we are progressing together."
"Members of this House, led by the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, have got seriously stuck in to the readings and have framed a large number of amendments to make the objective a clearer and fairer one."
"A conciliation procedure is not a walkover, and I know from experience that you never come from one with a full bag of goodies."
"Nonetheless, we have to rigorously examine what has come out of conciliation, and each of us must carefully consider whether we can be satisfied with it and whether we can defend it to the people back home."
"As I see it, the Council has moved far too little."
"It is the Council that must take responsibility, and I have to say that I am particularly thinking of the German Government when I say that."
"On Thursday, then, will be the hour of decision."
"Every one of us will have to face questions: What is now the real situation as regards balance?"
"What about compensation payments and adjustments?"
"Let me remind you of Article 12."
"I have to concede that, time and time again, I find myself admiring Mr Jarzembowski’s negotiating skills, but, even so, in this instance, I cannot forget the interests of many small ports, coming as I do from Cuxhaven, which is one of them."
"Some global players may be satisfied, but I am not."
"I do not want to leave it to the nation states to sort out the compensation payments in a way that is as yet unclear, particularly as nothing has been laid down."
"That may be just a point of criticism, but it is a decisive one."
"I admit that I am still struggling with the directive, and with myself, but will the people at home understand that?"
"Mr President, we are debating a proposal for a directive the content of which is ambitious."
"I wonder whether we all agree on the importance of ports in terms of organising European transport."
"I believe not, that everybody has a different approach."
"Mine is that ports are fundamental to the organisation of European transport, and I am not referring to maritime transport, but to transport as a whole and, essentially, road transport."
"One of the questions arising from this organisation of maritime transport is – this question has been asked here – whether or not it is sustainable to try to regulate and liberalise ports."
"When we talk about whether it is possible to operate a sustainable transport system it is clear that, if we do not accept that one of the conditions for the sustainability of transport is a huge increase in the capacity of ports, we are moving in the opposite direction."
"I would therefore argue that it is absolutely essential that ports take on an infinitely greater role than the one they play at the moment, and that the environmental contribution of that transformation would be so immense that it would allow us to a large extent to resolve the great over-burden, the enormous insecurity, which is much greater than anything that can be resolved in the field of ports, and the great pollution which is currently generated by other forms of transport."
"But we are divided on a directive which in theory pursues a reasonable objective, decided on by Parliament, which is to liberalise the various transport sectors."
"I have defended Mr Jarzembowski on numerous occasions, saying that he is a constant, determined, efficient and intelligent Member of Parliament, but, on this occasion, I must say that his approach as rapporteur has been erratic and, as a result of this constant change in position, we have come to a situation of genuine confrontation in relation to a directive on which Parliament should be united."
"I would therefore ask that, if this directive is approved tomorrow, we continue to improve it, and that, if it is not approved, we begin to work on the next one on the basis of all the information and with greater realism than we have demonstrated so far."
"Mr President, I should like to explain why, tomorrow, I shall vote against the compromise proposal from the conciliation committee."
"The amendments adopted by Parliament during its reading of the report were a serviceable compromise between those who want a total liberalisation of port services and those who think we should take account of our workers."
"Unfortunately, little remains of Parliament’s amendments, which means that European port workers will face an uncertain future if the compromise is adopted."
"If we accept the compromise, port workers will lose their jobs, simply because seafarers on ships calling at EU ports have been allowed to handle cargoes."
"In that way, the EU will lose a large number of jobs."
"We do not want ports of convenience, just as we do not want ships sailing under flags of convenience."
"In Scandinavia, we have seen examples of port workers refusing to handle goods from ships on which the working and wage conditions were not in order."
"Now, an attempt is being made to get rid of this solidarity by means of a bad piece of EU legislation."
"Those campaigning for liberalisation say that not so many people are in any case employed on modern ships and that the Port Directive will not therefore mean fewer port workers."
"It is, however, precisely because there are not especially many people employed on modern ships that we should leave it to the competent port workers to ensure that cargoes are handled properly."
"Parliament’s demand for certification has, moreover, been squeezed out of the wording of the directive in the course of the conciliation committee’s work."
"We are now therefore opening the door to poorly trained labour that may jeopardise port security."
"When we talk about security in EU ports, there are two considerations to be borne in mind, namely the security of people who work in the ports and the security of the goods handled."
"I myself come from a seaport in Denmark, and I am very familiar indeed with the problems."
"We have solved them by cooperating with the larger neighbouring ports."
"We divide up the amount of goods and, in that way, ensure optimum use of the different ports, at the same time as preserving free competition."
"I would call upon everyone to vote against the compromise, for where would the unemployed port workers go?"
"What training opportunities do they have?"
"To my fellow MEP, Mrs Langenhagen, who was in some doubt as to how she should vote, I have to say that she should vote according to her conviction and not follow group discipline."
"It is too bad that group discipline is allowed to decide these matters."
"There is, therefore, only one way, namely to vote in accordance with one’s convictions."
"If, moreover, the port workers are to be given help, we can give it them by voting against this bad document from the conciliation committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I cannot agree with the aspects approved in the conciliation meeting between Parliament and the Council with regard to the Directive on the liberalisation of the port services market."
"I find it unthinkable that anybody should be prepared to risk security in airports by establishing private free competition and more than one service provider for air traffic control."
"Similarly, I believe that for reasons of port traffic safety, pilotage, towing or mooring, or even loading, must be provided by a single body, providing each service, which guarantees adequate coordination of all its staff."
"In this regard, it is notable that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already approved a law in the Spanish Parliament which allows for self-handling for this type of service on the part of any shipping or brokering company and takes it for granted that this crazy liberalisation will be approved by this European Parliament."
"I hope this is not the case and that the Spanish legislative is more prudent in the future and does not move forward ‘like those from Pozas’, as we say in Bilbao."
"Mr President, the Directive on port services, in its current form, is difficult to assess."
"The European Commission’s aim was the liberalisation of port services, but little of that remains."
"A drawback of the proposal was the risk of social dumping arising."
"Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, has been working actively towards eradicating the problems with the proposal."
"Such legislation as remains is evidently the maximum achievable, even though there is room for improvement."
"I asked myself, therefore, whether I should support this result or not."
"If I compare the result of the Directive with the status quo regarding the legislation on European ports, I conclude that it is better to adopt this proposal than reject it."
"In a nutshell: it does have its advantages, and the risk of social dumping is slight."
"In addition, the Member States are able to take effective measures to prevent problems, where that is still necessary, by means of legislation."
"In the Netherlands, a ports act is to be tabled, which will improve the situation for Dutch dockers."
"The main advantage for European ports is the existence of a legal framework that enables clarity and transparency in relations between port authorities and service providers."
"I also welcome the recognition of pilotage services as specialised services."
"I attach great importance to transparency in the financing of ports, which plays a necessary part in the creation of a level playing field with regard to state aid."
"I see this Directive as the beginnings of European legislation in this field, and envisage that, given productive dialogue between all the interested parties – port authorities, service providers and workers’ organisations – we can continue to work on improving the legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give my express support here to those fellow Members who said earlier in this debate that one of the important reasons that this Directive – this compromise – is unacceptable to us is the whole arrangement regarding self-handling."
"The fact that the compromise gives the Member States freedom of choice as to whether or not to introduce authorisations for self-handling – this form of subsidiarity – makes the whole authorisation system a hollow shell – this much is now clear to everyone."
"After all, if a Member State is not obliged to introduce an authorisation system, pernicious competition will inevitably follow, which will have a negative impact on working conditions, on the social protection of dockers, on safety in ports."
"Shipowners will very quickly seek out those ports that do not have an authorisation system."
"By that I do not mean ports in Italy, because they have an authorisation system, nor those in Spain, because they, too, have an authorisation system, but ports that have a rather casual approach to job protection and safety."
"I think that, if we want to open up port services to competition on the internal market, we must firstly and most importantly lay down rules for social and ecological etiquette that apply to all countries without exception."
"Secondly, there is the fact that this Directive gives the Member States free rein to cast pilotage services, too, onto the market."
"That is going much too far, in my opinion."
"Pilotage services have an essential safety function."
"This compromise will be responsible for pernicious competition via social dumping, and unsafe working environments in our ports."
"In addition, it is a slap in the face for all those dockers who have demonstrated against this Directive several times and who, furthermore, just this morning handed our own President of the European Parliament more than 20 000 signatures to make it clear that they disapprove strongly of this Directive."
"I therefore call on all those fellow Members who are still in two minds – from the Netherlands or Italy, perhaps – to reject this Directive, this unsatisfactory compromise, and to set to work on a satisfactory arrangement, one benefiting not only the ports, but especially the dockers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although the outcome of this conciliation procedure differs from the Commission’s initial proposal, it is still quite negative. We cannot, therefore, support the text that has been proposed since, in addition to its emphasis on liberalisation, its position on the issues of self-handling and pilotage is far removed from that advocated by Parliament."
"In fact, on the basis of this position, by means of what is known as ‘self-handling’, the shipping company could provide one or more port services for itself, provided that it uses its own seamen and equipment."
"Furthermore, the proposal does not stipulate that authorisations shall be compulsory, and the Member States would find it hard to restrict these activities, except in special cases."
"This situation will cause serious problems for the job stability of port service workers, will hamper the coordination of interactive on-board and on-shore operations and will help to create conflict and a breakdown in solidarity between the established workforce in ports and ships' crews."
"Safety problems might also arise for facilities and workers, since the seamen might not be familiar with the specific characteristics of the port."
"Parliament had suggested that pilotage services should be excluded from the scope of the directive, but the conciliation text states that the competent authorities may, for reasons of public safety, recognise the mandatory nature of pilotage and maintain the service themselves or award the service directly to a single provider."
"This means that pilotage might also be undertaken on a self-handling basis, with the potential consequences for maritime and environmental safety that this entails, and this is something we cannot accept."
"With the various options given to the Member States for imposing more restrictive rules if they wish, there is a possibility that, in future, we will have ports of convenience, in which everything, or almost everything, is permitted, with the inevitable consequences for competition between ports and for maritime safety itself."
"Hence our vote against this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be rejecting this Directive, as it is high time we created a social Europe as well as an economic and financial Europe."
"We must call a halt to all the practices that result in the subordination of social rights, health, safety and wellbeing of workers to the laws of an ill-considered liberalisation."
"For that reason, the Verts/ALE Group says a wholehearted ‘no’ to this Directive on ports."
"Dockers in Antwerp, Rotterdam, and also Hamburg or Genoa must be given the guarantee that ships will be unloaded in a professional, safe manner throughout the EU under pay conditions that are not pushed down by social dumping."
"Since there is to be no compulsory system of authorisations, the balance is abundantly clear."
"Parliament’s requests at second reading were not met."
"Hence, the European Parliament must now also reject the Directive in its entirety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the points of view in this dossier are well known."
"This week, the European ship has to decide which port to enter."
"To liberalise or not to liberalise, that is not the question as far as I am concerned."
"What is important is how we liberalise and whether we do it humanely."
"The Conciliation Committee came to an agreement on this, and I admit that some of the sharp edges on which people can get hurt in a liberalisation process have been filed off, including by limiting self-handling to seafaring personnel."
"It is just unfortunate that it was not just that little bit more, then I, too, could have reconciled myself with the text."
"As has already been said repeatedly by fellow Members, there was indeed a majority in Parliament in favour of imposing compulsory authorisations for service providers and self-handling."
"The word was ‘must’."
"Unfortunately, Parliament’s lead was not taken, and the agreement did not move on from ‘may’."
"If the Member States diverge in the way they use the possibilities they are given, there is of course a risk of distortion of competition."
"The fear of distortion of competition in itself can also lead to lax regulation."
"We do not like that idea, and therefore I do not agree with this draft text."
"We know that St Nicholas is not due until December, but I sincerely hope that we can prevent the dockers from being left holding the baby, or in this case Black Peter, as early as this week."
"I have sympathy for those who earn their living in the ports."
"I shall therefore be voting against the draft."
"Whatever the result of the vote, I should like to address the Belgian dockers with the following request: do not in any event rest on your laurels, as not even the rejection of the text will mean that your problems are at an end."
"You know that a discussion has been underway for some time on the question as to whether the Belgian ports act – known as the ‘Major law’ – is in accordance with the treaty rules on the free movement of services."
"I strongly advise you good people to take control in this sphere in good time, before others have to set to work on it."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the debate they have both facilitated."
"I think that this European Parliament should be proud that every point of view has been heard and every point of view considered."
"The original text was, quite rightly, heavily opposed and indeed heavily amended."
"It looked at ports through the wrong end of the telescope."
"Rather than competition between the ports it focused on competition within the ports – a little like single market legislation to increase competition within a supermarket rather than between supermarkets."
"It failed to tackle unfair state aids or the lack of transparency of accounts."
"In particular it threatened the successful United Kingdom model of ports, some of which, in my region, are amongst the busiest and indeed I would say the most successful anywhere in the world."
"To be fair, some of these deficiencies have been addressed, but conciliation failed to successfully address many key concerns."
"It failed to exclude self-handling or to ensure compulsory authorisations – the 'must or may' issue – and it failed, in particular, to exclude marine pilots from the scope of the directive."
"However, this is not about what is in it but rather what is not in it."
"There was no real action, in my view, to tackle transparency or unfair state aids."
"This Parliament should also be concerned that there is no consensus either within Parliament or with society outside."
"I am aware of the wide range of views, both for and against."
"However, I am concerned in particular that we do not have the support of port workers themselves."
"British Labour MEPs are also very concerned that important British groups are objecting to this proposal, and we should all be concerned when British marine pilots and, in particular, British ships' officers are recommending that this proposal be voted down on safety grounds alone."
"I said at the beginning of the process in 2001 that this proposal should be rejected and sent back to the Commission."
"Given that our key concerns remain, British Labour MEPs are going to be consistent."
"We owe it to British jobs, the future of investment in our ports and above all safety to reject this proposal."
"Mr President, by rejecting the text that has been proposed to us on port services, I am expressing my personal opinion but I am also acting as a mouthpiece for the objections that have been expressed by a large number of trade union organisations."
"This project, known as self-handling, will allow ship owners to carry out any port service using their own personnel and equipment."
"It also opens the way for all sorts of abuse by the crooks involved in maritime transport."
"Indeed, the directive does not of course force ship owners to pay their personnel the current salaries of dockers, nor even to respect labour legislation."
"Ship owners can make workers, who are taken on without guarantees, work for low pay and subject them to whatever working conditions they want."
"This will result in secure employment in port areas being axed and an increase in the number of workers with insecure jobs, who are badly paid, over exploited, inexperienced, with all the threats that this entails for the environment and safety."
"We reject this directive."
"Its enforcement would threaten all those that earn a living from port services; it would increase the risk of accidents and pollution."
"We also reject it because it puts workers from different professions – seamen and dockers – into competition with each other – in order to make conditions harsher for both groups, for the sole benefit of ship owners."
"Opening up port services to competition stems from the same retrograde mindset as opening up rail transport, air traffic control, postal services or telecommunications to competition."
"We are opposed to it."
"Port services, like all services used directly or indirectly by the entire population, should be public services and protected from damage such as competition and the race for profit."
"– Mr President, I have just one minute, and I intend to use that minute to say that I do not under any circumstances wish to contribute to Europe’s obtaining so-called ports of convenience."
"I must therefore vote against the Conciliation Committee’s joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services."
"I am not opposed to either economic liberalisation or liberalisation of the regulations, but I do not consider the intention of the directive to be present in the proposal now being tabled."
"The intention has already been erased."
"I do believe, however, that what remains may lead to social dumping."
"In the Nordic countries, we have worked for a long time to bring about good rules and working conditions in shipping and to resist social dumping."
"It should not be profitable to register ships in countries other than their own or to employ people under bad conditions."
"Competence in the ports and the safety of those who work in them must be guaranteed."
"By rejecting this proposal, the European Parliament is defending workers and the social and labour law regulations governing port workers."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, a great deal has been said and, frankly, I would like to ask all the Members a question."
"We are talking as if, by adopting the compromise text before uswe are running the risk of plunging from paradise to purgatory, if not even to hell, where port services are concerned."
"Frankly, without the directive that we are about to vote on, there would be nothing stopping the individual Member States – as has been the case thus far – from adopting national legislative measures to open up the market in port services without any legal framework."
"I am one of those that have fought hard and I remain convinced that authorisation should have been made compulsory."
"We did not succeed in obtaining this, but we do have a directive that refers to subsidiarity, to what the Member States could have done, however, and that lays down reference criteria for authorisation which fully protect social, security and environment rules."
"Of course, this is true if an individual State wants to make authorisation compulsory."
"Without the directive, however, the Wild West would have been a lot wilder"
"We all know what the initial proposal was and how it was worked on."
"We all know the limits that were set for self-handling,the provisions that we abolished, those which provided for a type of Wild West without any regulations for new ports, for new sections of ports or for port sections not open to commercial services."
"These are the reasons why, for example, all the workers’ unions in my country, Italy – CGL, CISL, UIL – are asking us to adopt the compromise text."
"We are not going from paradise to purgatory."
"As regards what individual States could have done, I have the feeling that we have not yet reached paradise, but that we have probably climbed up from hell to purgatory."
"Mr President, purgatory is just as painful as hell, but you do not stay there permanently – I am told."
"The key issue here is the self-handling at EU ports."
"As somebody who comes from an island Member State which exports 90% of its production, I am deeply concerned at the lack of mandatory authorisation included in this directive."
"It must be painful for the Commissioner and Mr Jarzembowski to see such wide-ranging opposition to this proposal as there is here today."
"However, they should withdraw this proposal, return to the drawing-board and ensure there is mandatory self-handling which would provide for prior authorisation and would include criteria relating to employment, the social aspects, professional qualifications and environmental considerations."
"There is no way around this."
"Therefore I appeal to you to show common sense and return to the drawing-board."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian system of port services is functioning to everyone’s satisfaction."
"Neither the port authorities, nor the employers, nor the dockers are looking to change this system."
"It was achieved via social dialogue and, if necessary, is adapted via social dialogue to the situation of the various other Belgian ports."
"This social dialogue offers employers a guarantee that their requirements, too – as regards employment, social services, safety and quality – will be included in a social agreement."
"One result of this system is that the port of Antwerp is number one in conventional loading, and that is the most labour-intensive loading activity."
"Antwerp has earned that ranking despite the fact that its dock work is perhaps a little more expensive than in other ports, but, on the other hand, this dock work is very productive, very safe and of excellent quality."
"The shipowners are not demanding a different system."
"How is the EU’s involvement perceived by the Belgian port authorities, the dockers and the Belgian politicians?"
"In the first place, they do not see in it any improvement for them."
"The reverse is true."
"They are seeking in the Directive possibilities of preserving the present system as far as possible via Belgian legislation."
"Secondly, they find that all of this is being arranged a long way from their home territory."
"They are accustomed to proceeding via social dialogue."
"Thirdly, they believe that the Directive was based on the ports where the regime is least strict, where poorly organised, poor-quality dock work is carried out."
"Commissioner, the correct procedure would have been to subject European port activities to compulsory authorisations regulating the most important elements in the field of the social framework, safety, training, organisation of work and environment."
"A compulsory system such as this would have not only made self-handling possible, but also offered guarantees of a stricter operating procedure in all the European ports."
"The ports that already have effective regulations and a safe system are actually being penalised in favour of the much laxer attitude of other ports."
"We should have gone in the opposite direction."
"For all of these reasons, I shall be voting against the Directive: out of conviction."
"I am a confirmed European, but, in this dossier, European intervention is moving in the wrong direction."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a parallel has repeatedly been drawn between the problem of ports and port services and the problem of airports and airport services, and the issue of security has been raised as a crucial reason for rejecting the current text, essentially security relating to the issue of pilotage and also with regard to the issue of self-handling in general."
"I would like to say that I believe it is a mistake to compare air traffic with self-handling."
"I do believe it makes sense to compare openness and competition in port services with that in airport services."
"At the time, this also provoked all sorts of arguments and it was said that it was going to jeopardise security in airports."
"This has not turned out to be the case."
"On the contrary, what we have seen has been greater activity and more opportunities for everybody in airports."
"Liberalisation has been proposed and today aircraft maintenance services in airports are liberalised."
"At the time it was said that this would pose enormous risks in terms of aircraft safety."
"There are currently companies which resolve certain issues themselves."
"Other companies, on the other hand, employ third-party service providers."
"There are various possibilities, and this reduces costs for aviation – and the honourable Members are the first to benefit, as are all we citizens of the European Union – and none of this has meant an undermining of security in aviation."
"What we have had is more activity, more employment and more opportunities."
"And that is what we are proposing."
"Air traffic is equivalent to maritime traffic."
"On the entry to the majority of large ports, there is maritime traffic, which is controlled by means of totally modern systems."
"We are not talking about liberalising and implementing the various controls of maritime traffic in ports, nobody is proposing that."
"Let us not mix up things which cannot be mixed up."
"Let us make comparisons which make sense."
"The liberalisation of the aircraft maintenance service has not in any way undermined the security of aircraft."
"Is any port authority, or any government of our countries going to take a decision which suddenly means that a ship hits a jetty or fills airports with inappropriate waste or that there is an accident?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are operating within certain frameworks which guarantee the viability of a liberalisation of this nature, which allows greater competition and port activity, greater opportunity and capacity for ports, greater development of cabotage and therefore greater development of maritime traffic, in order to decongest other types of transport which are currently completely congested."
"What is so worrying in Belgium?"
"It has the legislation left by the previous Belgian Minister in relation to ports."
"They are not going to have to change it."
"They may have to make some modifications."
"And they will have to justify why pilotage, self-handling, is carried out."
"The reasons for which self-handling can be restricted are ‘safety considerations or requirements resulting from environmental rules’ (Article 10), amongst others."
"Furthermore, Article 16 states that ‘the provisions of the present Directive shall not in any way affect the national rules in the field of professional qualifications and training requirements, employment and social issues provided that they are compatible with Community legislation’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether we have read the same text."
"If we look at the issue of pilotage, it also says that – we know that pilotage has a very important component and that it therefore requires certain types of supplementary guarantee: ‘the competent authorities may recognise the obligatory nature ...’."
"It is true: they will be able to."
"If there is really a security risk, do you believe that any national authority is not going to recognise the obligatory nature of pilotage?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are talking about risks which do not exist."
"Another issue is the pressure from the dockers’ unions."
"This is another matter which is politically very important and is very respectable, I do not doubt, but let us remember that we are talking about pressure from a specific group, it is one of the examples always used in certain economics and sociology books, because they have been very well organised for a very long time."
"What we have is a problem of pressure or of relationships with these unions."
"That is another matter, ladies and gentlemen."
"Do not mix it up with security problems, however."
"Let us not talk about something which is not the case."
"I could accept you saying to me: ‘there is a political problem, we need the support of the unions, they are against it and we cannot vote for it’."
"I would have no objection."
"I would say that that is politically entirely understandable, but do not tell me that it is a security problem."
"It is not."
"At least I believe there is no such problem, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is not a security problem, but a political problem."
"Let us call things by their name and therefore take on, each and every one of us, our responsibilities."
"Because I believe that if we deal with this political problem involving the dockers – which I believe not to be justified because there will be more work for them and more opportunities in our ports if we approve this directive – we will be able to achieve greater efficiency in our ports and this is crucial in order to promote cabotage."
"How are we really going to develop more cabotage in the European Union if we do not improve the performance and efficiency of our current port services?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a deadlock here which is preventing us from going any further and we need this cabotage."
"In the next 10 years we need European cabotage to increase its capacities by at least 40% because anything which does not go by sea will go by road."
"We also need the railways to increase by 40%, but cabotage must take up at least 40%, even a little more, in order to take the burden off the roads."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the dockers are very respectable, I agree."
"However – and I would ask you once again to reconsider the issue – it is not a problem of security we are discussing here, but a problem of union forces."
"We are currently dealing with the problem of a form of transport which is genuinely sustainable over time, an efficient form of transport which we need in the European Union for our competitiveness and also for our citizens and for the development of all our countries and for the improvement of the environment."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"Whatever the result is, we will continue working once again and I will continue to count on your support, as I do generally in relation to all the initiatives I present."
"– The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is Question Time (B5-0414/2003)."
"We will take questions to the Commission."
"Is the Commission confident that the ISPS Code (International Ship and Port Security Code) of 2002 will be implemented in the EU on time (1 July 2004) and that all non-EU jurisdictions, especially major flags of convenience, will be in a position to enforce its conditions?"
"– Mr President, on 12 December 2002, the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO’s) diplomatic conference adopted a new Chapter XI-2, on special measures to promote maritime safety, as part of the IMO’s SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) Convention, together with a new code named the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), which seems to be of fundamental importance to the establishment of a global maritime safety system."
"On 2 May 2003, the Commission presented the European Parliament and the Council with a Draft Regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security."
"The purpose of this draft is to introduce these new instruments into Community law, together with the necessary interpretative provisions."
"On 9 October 2003, the Council (Transport) unanimously adopted a general approach to this draft."
"The European Parliament will abstain from voting on it at first reading on 19 November 2003."
"In view of the evident progress made with the work by these two institutions, the Commission hopes that this document will be adopted as quickly as possible so that the Member States are given the opportunity, by no later than 1 July 2004, to fulfil the international obligations into which they have entered within the IMO."
"1 July 2004 is also the deadline for vessels flying flags other than those of the EU Member States."
"The IMO has no intention of granting more time in which to implement these measures."
"In common with the United States’ authorities, the Commission agrees with this analysis."
"In accordance with the relevant regulations of the ISPS Code, it will therefore be possible for any vessel that, after 1 July 2004, does not comply with the safety arrangements laid down in these international instruments to be refused access to any port in a state that is a member of the IMO."
"Mr Nielson, there was a long debate about this earlier this morning and you must accept that there is very little time between now and 1 July 2004 for all ships and ports to comply with the requirements of the ISPS Code, especially with the lack of total clarity at the moment."
"The financial risk to businesses that cannot comply with the code is enormous."
"What about flags other than European flags?"
"Even if our own Member States comply, could there not be a substantial risk that many other ships will not be complying by then and will not therefore be allowed into European ports?"
"Has the Commission tried to make any assessment of the impact on European and even world trade if there is not full compliance by 1 July 2004?"
". – Having had the opportunity to listen to the previous debate, I feel confident that the necessary changes will be manageable within this time."
"Ultimately we will face the problem that it is one thing to have the right to deny access to our ports for ships that do not comply, but that, at the same time, the global spread of this whole idea will be a very strong disincentive for ships under other flags to continue to flout the standards."
"Thus it is a highly meaningful and necessary thing to do."
"In its internal market strategy for the period ending in 2006 and the green paper on services of general interest, the Commission plans a far-reaching liberalisation of public services."
"All the indications are that this is also intended to extend to the water supply."
"Does the Commission really intend to liberalise such an important sector of services of general interest as the water supply?"
"How does the Commission intend to justify for the benefit of the citizens concerned such a radical encroachment upon sovereignty with regard to the use of countries' own water resources?"
". – As announced in the Internal Market Strategy: Priorities 2003-2006, the Commission is presently analysing whether there is scope for improving the efficiency and performance of the water sector."
"This analysis focuses in particular on how the current competition and internal market rules should be applied to this sector."
"The Commission does not wish to rule any options out at this stage, including the possibility of further legislative measures."
"As part of its fact-finding, the Commission has sent detailed questionnaires to current and future Member States with a view to gathering information on the legal and administrative rules and requirements within which the water sector operates."
"The Commission has also held informal discussions with regional and local authorities, business and citizens' organisations, and enterprises involved in the sector."
"The analysis is still ongoing, so it is too early to draw conclusions."
"Once the analysis is complete, the Commission will, of course, present its findings and set out its views on any possible additional steps to be taken, in full respect of Treaty guarantees for services of general economic interest and of environmental provisions."
"– It may perhaps have escaped your notice, Commissioner, that in Austria this issue has for some years now been a cause of immense commotion, which has resurfaced in the last few weeks."
"All the provinces, all the parties and also the major daily newspapers are in agreement; rebellion is everywhere in the air."
"Water, as you know, is life."
"Austria is still a very agricultural country, and if you so much as hint to a farmer that his water is going to be taken away from him, then war is on the cards."
"I cannot imagine Austria ever agreeing to the liberalisation of the water supply, and I hear similar things from other countries, such as Germany and the Nordic countries."
"Will the Commission, in the face of this vehement resistance, seriously rethink the liberalisation of this area?"
". – The line is that the options are open."
"We are analysing this at the moment and I think it is futile at this stage to speculate on conclusions."
"It is difficult for people from third countries seeking refuge to enter the EU."
"In recent times, we have witnessed appalling disasters in which people searching for a more secure life have met with death beyond the EU's borders."
"We must stop the trafficking of human beings and those individuals making huge profits from the misfortunes of others."
"An interesting proposal has been put to the Commission with a view to reducing the market for people smugglers and making the EU more accessible for people from third countries."
"What is the Commission's view of a system whereby refugees would be able to apply for a special asylum visa at Member States' embassies and consulates around the world?"
". – The Commission has long shared the view that there was an urgent need to explore ways of offering rapid access to protection without refugees being at the mercy of illegal immigration or trafficking gangs."
"That is why we commissioned the study on the feasibility of processing asylum claims outside the European Union against the background of the common European asylum system, published in December 2002."
"The study analysed the possibilities of the Europe-wide use of protected entry procedures in regions of origin and examined how such procedures could allow a non-national to approach a potential host state outside its territory with an asylum claim and be granted a permit to enter that country."
"The Commission has since noted, in its communications of March and June 2003, that protection capacities in the region of origin need to be consolidated and protection requests dealt with as closely as possible to needs."
"This might involve regulating access to the European Union by establishing protective entry schemes and resettlement programmes."
"Such measures could also facilitate more orderly arrival in the European Union."
"The Thessaloniki European Council asked the Commission to explore all parameters, in order to ensure the more orderly and managed entry of persons in need of international protection into the European Union and to examine ways and means of enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin."
"Before June 2004 we shall be presenting a comprehensive report suggesting the measures to be taken."
"Meanwhile, the current presidency hosted an experts' seminar in Rome on 13 and 14 October which further explored the European Council's mandate, focusing in particular on resettlement and protected entry procedures."
"The advantages and disadvantages of the methods of dealing with protection discussed there will be further examined in the report called for by the Thessaloniki Council, which I just mentioned."
"The Italian presidency intends that the November Justice and Home Affairs Council should adopt Council guidelines based on the conclusions of the Rome seminar, in order to provide the Commission with the necessary political guidance to prepare the report we shall be producing next June."
"Parliament will be asked for its opinion after the report has been published."
"– Thank you very much for your answer."
"The problem with the current regulations governing asylum applications lies not with the regulations themselves and with our letting in too many refugees because, in Europe, we have both the resources and a moral responsibility to receive people in need of protection."
"Instead, the problem is the people smuggling through which unscrupulous traders entice people to try to make their way in by unlawful routes."
"Our own regulations, which make it difficult to apply for, and obtain, visas, also mean that there are more and more traffickers in human beings."
"That is not how we should arrange matters."
"The Council has also produced inhumane proposals for border forces and for free zones in third countries where we should keep refugees seeking asylum."
"That is not something of which I approve."
"I believe we should have an arrangement that strengthens the asylum procedure."
"One method is contained in the proposal that has been submitted by the researcher Gregor Noll and about which I have put my question."
"It is a proposal I believe is well worth examining."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what advantages and disadvantages he sees in the researcher’s, Gregor Noll’s, proposal that asylum should be sought in the EU countries’ embassies around the world."
"It would be interesting to hear the answer to that question."
". – I share your view that it is quite clearly necessary to develop an asylum system that prevents those in need of international protection from being victimised by criminal gangs."
"One of the ways to address this objective is to enhance protection in the region, and to allow people to ask for asylum in the embassy of one of the Member States."
"As the honourable Member knows, some Member States are already doing this."
"Resettlement schemes are already ongoing in at least five Member States."
"We are now studying experience gained in this area to identify the advantages and disadvantages involved in order to make a proposal to allow all Member States to use the same scheme."
"I hope that in the June 2004 report I will be able to put forward concrete proposals in this respect."
"– On 16 January 2003, the Commission announced its authorisation of the ’ distribution system called ‘Supplier of Choice’."
"This authorisation was given after made amendments to the original ‘Supplier of Choice’ draft presented to the Commission."
"A summary of the amended ‘Supplier of Choice’ had been published in November 2002 in the Official Journal and interested third parties were called upon to present their comments."
"As Mr Corbett stressed, when the Commission authorised the ‘Supplier of Choice’, it committed to monitoring the market and reserved the right to reopen the case should changes in the factual or legal situation as regards any essential aspect of the agreements lead it to modify its present view."
"The Commission intends to fully make good its commitment."
"It will therefore continue to supervise use of the ‘Supplier of Choice’ in order to ensure that Community competition rules are respected."
"To this end, the Commission will pay heed to any business that claims that these provisions have been violated and that their business has suffered as a result."
"Despite the fact that it has already received some information regarding the specific use of ‘Supplier of Choice’, the Commission does not yet have all the details in this regard."
"This is why the Commission intends to use the powers given to it by the regulation on the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty in order to collect information that will allow it to adopt a position on the issue, in full knowledge of the facts."
"In the weeks to come, therefore, requests for information will be sent."
"When the Commission has examined the information that it has received in this way, it will decide what action to take regarding the case in question."
"While I thank the Commissioner for his reply, perhaps he would tell us how many formal complaints he has received in recent weeks from within the diamond sector about the supplier of Trisystem?"
"I welcome the fact that he is going to look into this in detail and gather all the relevant information."
"May I invite the Commissioner to take account as well of the remarks made by the chairman of the De Beers company itself, Mr Oppenheimer, in a recent address to the Harvard Business School alumni conference held in Cape Town."
"Mr Oppenheimer stated, and I quote ‘we make no pretence that we are not seeking to manage the diamond market, to control supply, to manage prices and to act collusively with our partners in the business’."
"May I suggest to the Commissioner that this is a remarkable admission to make. It was made in March 1999, just a few months before the launch of the supplier of Trisystem."
"May I invite the Commissioner to take account of this admission when he investigates the best-known world monopoly still in existence, which has still not been investigated by the Commission using its competition powers."
". – As regards Mr Corbett’s last remark, I will take the liberty of drawing his attention to the fact that the Commission, and, in particular, this European Commission, has begun to pay close attention to these issues."
"As regards the question relating to complaints, I can say that the Commission has indeed received complaints regarding the ‘Supplier of Choice’, that will be looked into according to the standard procedures that the Commission follows in applying Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty."
"As regards the number of complaints, Mr Corbett, as well as their origin, of course, the Commission considers that the principles of good administrative management impose on it an obligation of confidentiality regarding precisely their number and origin."
"Of course, if a business that presents a complaint to the Commission considers it appropriate to make this public, then it is fully entitled to do so."
"– As the author is not present, Question No 37 lapses."
"Question No 38 by Claude Moraes (H-0660/03):"
"Subject: Reconstruction of Iraq"
"Could the Commission please detail the current situation of its assistance to the reconstruction of Iraq?"
". – As Parliament is aware, the Commission communication adopted on 1 October 2003 proposed that EUR 200 million from the European Union budget be earmarked for reconstruction assistance in Iraq in 2003 and 2004."
"I am glad to say that, with Parliament's help, this pledge was announced at the Madrid Donors' conference on 24 October 2003."
"A successful conference, raising more than USD 33 billion from over 70 countries was only the first step towards reconstruction."
"I remind you that the Commission communication set out four elements that are essential to the success of the reconstruction process: improved security, measures towards a political transition to an Iraqi government, the establishment of a multilateral umbrella for reconstruction, and cooperation on the part of Iraq's neighbours."
"We have seen progress on three of these elements, but on security considerably more progress is needed for rapid implementation of the Commission's assistance for reconstruction to proceed."
"For 2003 we have two goals: to help bridge the transition from the humanitarian phase to reconstruction, and to support the UN in fulfilling its mandate under Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1511."
"The EUR 40 million we have proposed for 2003 is therefore intended to provide for assistance to flow as rapidly as possible to support Iraq via the UN and its specialised agencies."
"I can report that, building on the work done to date by ECHO, a first package of EUR 29 million has been set aside for the UN's work in water and sanitation, health, education, employment and income-generating schemes: all areas in which the UN has been active and where the UN's 4000 local agents are still working."
"This should be ready for disbursement to the UN by early December 2003."
"A further EUR 11 million will be committed by the end of 2003 to support the UN's work on local and regional governance, civilian administration, legal and judicial reform, the media and human rights."
"In addition, we have set aside EUR 2 million – on the horizontal demining budget line – to help address the huge problem posed by land mines and unexploded ordnance in Iraq."
"In 2004 the International Reconstruction Fund facility proposed by the World Bank and the UN in Madrid should be established."
"We therefore expect to channel the lion's share of the EUR 160 million proposed via this facility to support areas such as social safety nets, institution- and capacity-building, macro-economic management, the strengthening of Iraqi civil society and the protection and promotion of human rights and democracy."
"How the Commission decides to divide allocations between the UN and the World Bank will be based on the sectoral experience and comparative advantages of the two organisations."
"This will, however, also depend on whether conditions in Iraq have in fact improved and on the prospects for implementation by UN bodies, NGOs and Iraqi ministries."
"The reality is that there are still many difficult question marks."
"I thank the Commissioner for that very comprehensive answer and congratulate all those in the EU who have come to the aid of the Iraqi people at a very difficult time."
"I have two brief supplementary questions."
"One is to ask the Commissioner's view on how he sees the aid emanating from the Madrid Conference fitting in with our other aid commitments, particularly in areas in Africa and elsewhere where there are conflicts which receive less media coverage but in which people are still suffering."
"How does he see those conflicts being resolved?"
"Secondly, what is his view of the implementation of existing humanitarian aid during the humanitarian phase?"
"Is he satisfied with that aspect, given the political pressures from individual Member States on the whole approach to Iraq?"
". – Firstly, on a positive note, the rigid manner in which we allocate money to different geographical envelopes means that money is not being moved from somewhere else into Iraq."
"The EUR 200 million is money that has, so to speak, been 'vacuumed-up' in the neighbourhood."
"Thus we are not taking money away from what we can and should do in Africa because of what we are doing in Iraq."
"The question of what we do in other conflicts is a big question which we do not have time to go into today."
"As to the second supplementary question, I can report that of the total EUR 100 million for humanitarian assistance to Iraq mobilised for this year, we have made a detailed commitment for about EUR 70 million, and expect that most of the remaining money will be committed towards the end of the year."
"In terms of actual spending and implementation, we have, in spite of all the difficulties, been able to stick very closely to the plan and expectations."
"It has to be noted that the actual work we are doing there is carried out by local people working for us or for the organisations we use as implementing agencies."
"We are still able to do something meaningful, but keep a low profile for obvious reasons of security."
"However, looking at things on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis, the humanitarian effort to date has been a wonderful achievement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to take this opportunity provided by the Rules of Procedure to ask precisely the questions that I tabled previously."
"What is the Commission’s position on the requests made by the occupying powers in Iraq and on the serious situation Iraqi society is now experiencing?"
"What measures does it consider should be adopted to support the UN’s action in Iraq?"
". – It follows clearly from the previous response that we see the United Nations and the World Bank as our main partners in delivering assistance to and also for reconstructing Iraq."
"We are not working hand in hand with the occupying power."
"The transitional authority is there and it also has responsibilities for security, law and order and so on. This authority, therefore, is part of the background within which everyone in Iraq must work."
"As I said, however, the partners through which we are channelling money are primarily the United Nations and the World Bank."
"– As they deal with the same subject, questions 39 to 45 will be taken together."
". – Mr President, the Commission recalls that, according to its terms, the EU-Israel Association Agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel."
"Therefore products obtained in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment when entering the EU and proof of preferential origin issued by Israel for those products cannot be accepted by the Communities customs authorities."
"In a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in November 2001, the Commission informed the customs authorities of the Member States and European importers that Israel issues proof of preferential origin for products coming from places brought under Israeli administration such 1967."
"As a follow-up to that notice, the customs authorities of the EU Member States are screening all imports from Israel in order to identify the unlawfully issued proofs of origin and return the proofs of origin concerned to Israel in accordance with the verification procedure provided for in Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement."
"The Israeli replies, in the context of these verification procedures, do not distinguish between production in the settlements and production in the territory of the State of Israel."
"According to Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement, entitlement to the preferences is refused if there is no reply to the request for verification within ten months, or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the proof of origin in question or the real origin of the products."
"It falls within the competence of the national customs authorities to determine, for each and every individual consignment, whether, under those provisions, the elements of fact and law allow refusal of the preferential tariff treatment."
"Refusal of the preference gives rise to a customs debt which the customs authorities of the Member States must recover, since, under Community law, they are responsible for the collection of the custom duties which are the Communities' traditional own resources."
"The EU takes every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of the imports of products from the Israeli settlements and considers that this issue should be resolved before amending the EU-Israel protocol on rules of origin for the extension of the pan-European cumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries."
"As to the creation of qualified industrial zones in the EC's trade relations with Jordan and Israel, the Commission is at the stage of carrying out a technical analysis and no conclusions have been drawn."
"If an additional question is put forward here, asking why the Commission has not formally proposed the arbitration procedure which is part of all this, I would respond by saying that arbitration is, indeed, a possible measure planned in our Association Agreement in case there are differences in interpretation."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has so far taken the necessary steps to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community."
"In this regard, it should be noted that launching this procedure requires the unanimous assent of the Member States."
"I am not satisfied that the Commissioner has given a full reply to all the questions."
"Clearly – and he acknowledges this himself – it is the Commission that is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and, therefore, the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement."
"What the Commissioner has said is that he is leaving it up to the Member States to pursue those areas where preferential access has been granted illegally."
"Bearing in mind that it is the Commission that is ultimately the guardian of the Treaties, what steps is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States fully apply all these criteria?"
"As previous speakers on this issue have indicated, the individual Member States have not implemented the criteria properly."
"What action is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States are properly applying the laws in this regard?"
"If they are not, what action is it taking to penalise them?"
". – I anticipated the question by expanding my initial answer to make it clear that unanimity is required in order for the Commission to use the next instrument available as a legal follow-up."
"That is the answer I have to hang on to. That is what describes the situation."
"There is another solution."
"The Commission could notify the customs authorities that instead of using a very incomplete list to identify which of the goods may come from settlements and which may come from Israel, they should send all the Israeli goods back and ask Israel to verify all the goods that are labelled 'made in Israel'."
"Would the Commissioner be prepared to do that?"
". – One way would be to pursue this problem in a manner that is legally sound and efficient."
"Another way would be to go for an all-out escalation, which the step mentioned here would definitely look like. I do not see that happening in the foreseeable future."
"In fact, I am referring back to Mr Cushnahan’s and also to Mr Sandbæk’s questions."
"Among other things, I asked the Commission if it really does provide the Member States with sufficient legal and technical means to identify goods that are entering illegally."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his suggestion for the next question because it would be interesting to discover which countries, for example, instead of requiring observance of the agreements, are endeavouring to ensure that the agreements and the interests of the European citizens are not respected."
". – I do not have a list of those countries."
"This must be followed up in a careful manner."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the rules of origin are very clear, but the problem is that they are not respected by Israel."
"For years, Israel has continued to treat illegal settlements established in occupied territory as if they were within its own territorial limits."
"Even when the formerCommissioner Mr Marin was in charge of these issues, there were discussions with the Israeli authorities."
"That goes back six years and nothing has changed."
"This is why there are several of us asking you to act and to tell us what you intend to do."
"Are you, for example, going to ban all new provisions on the cumulation of origin in trade agreements with Israel or not propose any at all?"
"Are you going to name any Member States before the Court of Justice?"
"These are the questions, to which we would like you to give clear replies."
". – I certainly share the concern about how this matter is developing."
"I would also add that I find it quite ironic and a great contradiction to be erecting a wall across what is purported to still be one entity in terms of origin."
"I do not think it is possible here to move on to a detailed discussion of the steps that might be envisaged, but this exchange of questions and answers does clarify the issue."
"Mr President, misuse of rules of origin must result in repayment of duties."
"If this does not take place, we shall have not only a fiscal, but also an ethical problem."
"My question is as follows: has the warning notice to importers had any effect on the Member States that have a rather casual approach to the rules of origin?"
"After all, we are shaping a common market, and access to that market has to be properly regulated."
". – I do not have any statistics to show how this looked before the message was sent to the Member States, or how it looked afterwards."
"We know that the problem remains, and that is enough, in my view."
"Mr President, I, too, subscribe to the analysis of the fellow Members who spoke earlier."
"Two questions remain, as far as I am concerned."
"One is that we spoke about a technical analysis."
"Am I to conclude from this that that technical analysis will provide more insight into the origin of the products?"
"Is it possible to say when that analysis will be finished?"
"I should also like to reiterate the question as to why the Commission does not bring a Member State before the Court of Justice if it is clearly in breach."
"After all, it cannot be said that we do not have the necessary measures."
"There are always measures in place to declare Member States in breach."
". – The remarks I made on technical analysis relate to the creation of qualified industrial zones in the European Community's trade relations with Jordan and Israel."
"I concluded those remarks by saying that the Commission is now at the stage of carrying out a technical analysis."
"No conclusions as a result of that have yet been drawn. The work we are doing in this respect is likely to fuel our determination as we move ahead."
"When does the Commission expect the final conclusions to be drawn?"
". – The precise answer is that I simply do not know."
"What steps is the Commission taking to tackle the issue of debt cancellation for low-income countries?"
"With regard to the Irish Government’s endorsement of 100% cancellation of the debts of the poorest countries, which recognises the need to attend to countries suffering from a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and also calls for a greater degree of accountability to be placed on human development issues when assessing the amount of debt a country is able to repay, what is the Commission’s view of such a debt policy?"
"Is it foreseeable that the Commission will take formal steps to establish a European policy of debt cancellation for low income countries, and when in the future could this be expected?"
". – The Commission considers that addressing developing countries' debt problems is an important means of achieving the Community's development cooperation policy objectives."
"The Community is actively participating in the current Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative with more than EUR 1.6 billion pledged up to now: EUR 680 million on its own claims as a creditor and EUR 934 million as a donor to the HIPC Trust Fund."
"The Commission would also like to recall that this participation represents much more than the minimum required by the HIPC initiative."
"Indeed the Community, as a donor, is a major contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, accounting for almost 25% of the total resources."
"Over and above its expected participation as a creditor, the Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million for the settlement of all the special loans that would remain due from least-developed ACP countries, after they have benefited from the full application of the HIPC terms."
"It is also worth noting that most of the EU Member States have announced their intention to cancel 100% of the bilateral debt, beyond the HIPC terms."
"This means that any further debt cancellation in HIPC countries will relate largely to multilateral institutions, non-Paris Club official creditors and the private sector."
"At this point in time, it is also clear that the HIPC initiative has to be considered as a first important step towards long-term debt sustainability and that it will not be sufficient to ensure the beneficiary countries meet the Millennium Development Goals, especially in countries badly affected by HIV/AIDS."
"Moreover, the adverse economic effects of HIV/AIDS are now much more clearly recognised than they were when the HIPC initiative was launched, and the Commission agrees that it must consider HIV/AIDS when also discussing long-term debt sustainability."
"In the framework of the EU-Africa dialogue, the issue of Africa’s External debt has been part of the agenda since the Cairo meeting."
"The Commission has followed up actively the discussions between the Chefs de file (France and Germany) and the African Union representatives."
"At the latest ministerial troika meeting of the EU-Africa Dialogue, held in Rome on 10 November, which I attended together with the Irish Foreign Minister, it was agreed that discussions and the corresponding report of the issue of Africa's External Debt should be prepared as a matter of priority and that the experts meeting within the enlarged Troika should be held in the first quarter of next year."
"Finally, the Commission has recently launched, as an element of the EU-Africa dialogue, a study on debt relief beyond the HIPC initiative, with the main objective of providing a solid base to assess the situation after the full application of the HIPC initiative."
"This study should provide key elements for shaping, in coordination with Member States, the Union’s future debt policy."
"The Commission expects to be able to share with Parliament the results of this study by early next year."
"I would add that the complexity of doing something with multilateral debt is much larger and makes anything there much more difficult politically in terms of burden sharing internationally, compared to the handling of bilateral debt."
"Most donor countries that take their responsibility as a donor partner seriously have in fact more or less cancelled all the outstanding bilateral debt."
"For the Commission it is important to note that our share of all this as a creditor is very limited, basically because we are a grant donor and do not lend money to our partners."
"The Irish Government is currently the only EU government currently 100% in favour of the cancellation of the poorest countries' debts."
"Unfortunately, that government does not seem to be very prominent in promoting that policy, even though it was adopted back in July 2002."
"Many people and organisations would like to see this policy promoted during the Irish presidency."
"We would also like the Commission to support this."
"In the UK, the British Jubilee Debt campaign are trying to mobilise politicians to support this."
"When we talk in Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation about trying to help developing countries, it has been recognised that cancelling the debt would be one of the most sensible ways of ensuring that we can actually help these countries."
"The debt is grossly unfair."
"These countries are being exploited under false pretences."
"The only way forward for any just society in this day and age should be to promote the policy that the Irish Government has endorsed."
"We would like to see that happen during the Irish presidency and we would like to see the Commission come on board too."
"Commissioner, you have not given any guarantee that you would support this policy."
"If, for example, we can get the majority of the Member States to support this policy and to adopt it, then of course we would like to see the Commission support it as well."
". – I tried to explain this."
"The bilateral debt is relatively easy for the donors to manage; it is their own decision."
"The Commission is not in a position to tell individual Member States what to do."
"We have played a crucial role in the most difficult area, namely taking meaningful action on the multilateral debt, and in doing so we have gone far beyond our role as a creditor."
"What Ireland is doing is fine."
"However, I have to say that in 1995, when I was the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, we announced something similar for the least-developed poor countries."
"My hesitation about broadening the scope of debt cancellation to, for instance, middle-income countries, is based on the consideration that if we do that we will take money from the least-developed and poorest countries and give it to countries that are relatively much better off."
"That is not so easy to do in practice."
"What Ireland is doing is commendable and it might inspire other countries to do something similar."
"However, the Commission cannot tell Member States to do that."
"Would the Commission agree that supporting the capacity of ACP Parliaments to participate in deliberations, particularly on the EDF and EPA negotiations, should be a priority?"
"How does the Commission propose to fund efforts to build parliamentary capacity?"
". – Under the Cotonou Agreement, good governance is recognised as a fundamental element of the ACP-EU partnership and as an area for support in the framework of our development cooperation strategy."
"The total amount earmarked in the 9th EDF National Indicative Programmes for support to projects and programmes in the field of governance represents around EUR 640 million, corresponding to about 10 % of the overall allocations for the national indicative programmes."
"Part of these allocations can be mobilised for projects aimed at strengthening the capacity of the parliaments of ACP countries."
"A total amount of EUR 38.5 million is already committed, within existing governance programmes, for specific actions of support to the parliaments of ACP countries."
"In addition, two new financing proposals, focused on support to ACP parliaments, are scheduled for approval this year: one for Madagascar (EUR 1.9 million) and one for South Africa (EUR 10 million)."
"The delegations will be made aware of the possibility of supporting specific activities designed to increase the awareness and information of national parliaments on the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, if requested by our partner countries."
"In addition, the various programmes geared towards strengthening the trade negotiation capacities of the ACP, including the ongoing EUR 10 million and EUR 20 million all-ACP facilities for WTO and economic partnership agreement negotiations, are also relevant as regards the promotion of training and awareness in relation to the role of parliaments in these matters."
"We are encouraging members of national and regional parliaments to participate in various trade-related workshops, seminars etc., organised in this context."
"The Commission has already contacted the European Parliament in the past with a view to helping them build up a network of ACP parliamentarian correspondents in order to enhance their involvement in trade matters."
"We are interested in doing everything possible in this area."
"The 9th EDF financial protocol provides EUR 4 million to allow for the participation of parliamentarians from ACP countries in the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which is a key institution of the Cotonou Partnership."
"A new financing agreement is currently under consideration, using the entire allocation under the current Financial Protocol."
"It will provide this support over a period of two-and-a-half years."
"The strengthening of the structure of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which now includes three thematic standing committees, necessitates additional financial resources to allow for effective ACP participation."
"To take into account these additional needs, the European Commission intends to propose a decision of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers to increase funds for the JPA to an amount of around EUR 6 Million, in accordance with Article 8 of the Financial Protocol."
"All these initiatives should make it possible for national and regional parliaments to access some of the resources needed to ensure their effective participation in cooperation."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for a comprehensive and wide-ranging answer."
"It is always good to hear that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is receiving much-needed extra funding considering the new work – with the committees in particular – that we are engaged in."
"Would you agree with me, Commissioner, that support for parliaments is an area of our governance and democracy activities which has been somewhat neglected in the past?"
"For instance, for the country strategy papers, I can find no evidence that parliaments were consulted in any meaningful way, although civil society and NGOs were quite rightly involved."
"Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians are really thirsty for information, particularly on the EDF and on following the EPA negotiations."
"I am interested in the fact that some countries are already putting into their national indicative programmes a priority for parliamentary training and capacity-building, but out of 78 countries, if we are honest only a handful have made that kind of priority clear."
"I would like to know exactly how we can encourage national authorising officers and others to make this priority clear so we can ensure that accountability of parliamentarians is part of the process that we are engaged in."
"It seems to me that they do very little challenging of the executive in terms of questioning, financing and so on."
"I would also like to ask what exactly you suggest that we, as parliamentarians, can do in cooperation with the Commission to ensure that governments make parliamentary activity more of a priority."
". – It would be difficult to find a better organised lobbying group to promote exactly that than the institutional Joint Parliamentary Assembly itself."
"If you cannot do it with the help of those friends, then I might not be able to help you either."
"My worry is more related to the weak character of the inclusion, consultation or real participation of parliaments in the debate at national level, and in the decision-making process regarding national strategies."
"It is a great step forward that we are investing so heavily in engaging civil society, but to create a civilised society, parliaments are necessary, otherwise NGOs tend to see themselves as neo-governmental organisations because they have been hurt and parliaments – and especially oppositions – are kept in the dark."
"I keep returning to this in my discussions. I always make this point when I am informing our ACP partner countries that now we have this ability to fund NGOs, civil society and non-state actors."
"However, the role of parliaments should not be forgotten."
"We have similar views on this and we should continue to help each other in this work."
"It is stated that in the second part of question time each Commissioner will answer for half an hour."
"The poor Commissioner has spent more than half an hour on this section and I suggest we now move on to the third part of question time."
"– I agree with you."
"You cannot move onto the third part."
"You are aware that the custom is for the third part not to be replied to orally and, in fact, the Commission does not bring replies. We therefore had to distribute the available time between the Commissioners present."
"Since Mr Monti has spoken for less time, Mr Nielson is very kindly speaking for longer."
"This is the custom in the House, it is common law."
"It is the precedent which is always applied."
"Furthermore, the Commissioner is replacing Mr Patten."
"That is why he is speaking for longer."
"Can the Commission rule out the possibility of EU funding also being used to subsidise organisations in developing countries which in another area of their work participate in programmes employing abortion as a means of population planning or even involving compulsory abortions?"
". – I apologise if this is getting boring, but the notion of the college means that I can speak on behalf of all my fellow Commissioners if necessary."
"In reply to Mr Posselt, the specific formulation of the question means that a categorical answer could be ambiguous."
"However, I can say that in selecting the beneficiaries for Community funding, the Commission considers and assesses the main activity for which the funds are requested."
"Generally, the Commission funds clearly-described projects and programmes."
"I would add that compulsory abortions – to which the question refers – as a means of population planning is not seen as a feature in the work of any of the organisations the Commission is funding."
"– Mr President, I have a quite specific supplementary question for the Commissioner."
"There are recurrent debates in this House about what precisely is meant by the expression ‘reproductive health’, and that also features in our choice of organisations."
"I just wanted to ask you, Commissioner, whether the expression ‘reproductive health’ includes abortion or excludes it."
". – We are not able or willing to add or subtract anything from the internationally-established Cairo consensus."
"This also covers the discussion Mr Posselt is trying to push forward."
"As part of this Cairo consensus, it is clear beyond any doubt that coercive abortion as an instrument of family planning is explicitly rejected."
"We can play around with this and say that abortion occurs for different reasons: it could be voluntary, and take place after counselling."
"Maybe Mr Posselt will see that as something to oppose and take up politically."
"However, the Commission is sticking to the Cairo consensus: that is the basis on which we work."
"We are extremely careful to ensure that we do not walk into uncertain territory, precisely because of the sensitivity of this subject."
"You will have to take my word for it, Mr Posselt, that we are very careful about sticking to the balance and substance of the Cairo consensus."
"– Mr President, the Commissioner stated that the Commission is very cautious in its relations with reproductive health programmes."
"How will the Commission, however, ensure that women in less developed countries also enjoy an essential human right, the right to make decisions about their own bodies and the right also to make choices regarding abortion?"
"In other words, how will the Commission support NGOs that protect such alternatives as these and their projects in developing countries?"
"I think it is very important that women in less developed countries also have a right to abortion and a right to consider it an option."
". – That is precisely what this whole problem is about."
"The Cairo consensus defines, as a result of a huge international discussion, the balance in the policy."
"That is why we talk about reproductive health and sexual rights, and it is quite a big theme."
"We support governments and organisations within the UN system and others which are indeed assisting women to protect their rights and safeguard their lives in any area relating to reproductive health."
"I would not like to make any choices on this matter."
"It is necessary to maintain a balance and I am proud of the work we are doing in this field."
"– Several Members have asked for the floor, but only two supplementary questions can be asked and I am allowing them in the chronological order in which they were requested."
"– Mr President, I would like to put another question to the Commission. Are there programmes designed to support women who do not want to have an abortion?"
". – There is a big misunderstanding here."
"Abortion is not seen in any of the organisations we are supporting as an instrument in family planning."
"Abortion has to do with a woman's situation."
"There is a human rights element to this choice."
"Women must be supported whatever the choice they make, but that is why this is cumbersome and is very demanding on resources."
"One week after the local elections in Albania, the Central Elections Commission has decided to repeat, on 16 November 2003, the elections in four constituencies (the municipalities of Piluri, Dhermi, Qeparo and southern Himara), citing irregularities during the election process of 12 October 2003, in spite of the fact that in two of the four cases the irregularities cited occurred after the finalisation and certification of the results."
"As a result, there are legitimate concerns that these actions are intended to overturn the results of the local elections, which were 65% in favour of the Unity for Human Rights Party candidate as against the opposing candidate from the socialist party."
"These concerns are heightened by the criminal prosecution of five Albanians of Greek origin who participated in the elections and are accused of issuing anti-Albanian propaganda and putting up foreign symbols."
"What steps does the Commission intend to take, particularly within the framework of the Stability and Association Process between South East Europe and the European Union, to ensure that democratic process is complied with in the elections due to be held again in Himara on 16 November 2003"
". – According to preliminary reports during the repetition of the local elections in the Himara region on 16 November, a number of irregularities and incidents took place."
"Apparently those events have not allowed the normal conduct of democratic elections in the area and of course the Commission regrets this."
"The Commission is currently waiting for further information on these events and is attentively following the handling of the situation by the Albanian authorities."
"The Commission will take any step it considers appropriate following a detailed analysis of the situation."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"As you said, unfortunately the irregularities – which provoked my question in the first round – were repeated during the elections in Himara the other day, with a real orgy of violence, injury, bombings against candidates and so on. I am delighted that, as you said, the Commission will be following the situation attentively in order to take suitable steps within the framework of any cooperation between Albania and the European Union, especially as the Greek minister for foreign affairs, Mr Papandreou, presented the matter to the Council yesterday, albeit somewhat belatedly and after the event, and Commissioner Patten fully shared his concerns."
"– This is not a question, Commissioner."
"I imagine that you take note of this statement."
"I would like to thank you for the almost 60 minutes you have spent with us this afternoon."
"Mr President, on a point of order and by way of follow-up to Mr Newton Dunn's point of order, I have been sitting here listening with great interest to what Mr Nielson has said, but had a specific question to put forward in part three."
"Since you invite oral questions for Commissioners for parts one, two and three, why is it that after the second half hour we did not revert to the first question of part three?"
"Why is it that those of us with questions one, two and three in part three will not receive oral answers?"
"I find it a discourtesy to colleagues."
"If our turn is never to be reached, we should be told to put down a written question to the Commissioners."
"If we can only have answers from the Commissioners who are available on the day – Mr Monti and Mr Nielson in this case – then why invite questions to any Commissioner?"
"Why have a section, under other questions – part three – which should have had half an hour, and then ignore it?"
"I fail to understand this, and with respect find it a discourtesy to colleagues."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a lack of courtesy."
"As you will appreciate, I have had to read the Rules of Procedure, Rule 43, the annexes, the guidelines, the precedents, the history of Question Time, the casuistry and I can assure you that the second part is dedicated to specific questions to Commissioners and they take up one hour, which can be divided between three or between two."
"When the Commission classifies the questions in the third part, this means that they are not going to be replied to orally."
"If you believe it to be appropriate, and you probably do, we can send out a circular explaining it."
"There are questions in the second part which are not replied to either because there is not sufficient time and this is not a lack of courtesy."
"I would insist that the third part is not scheduled to be replied to orally."
"I would state this clearly and it has always been the case."
"I have had to study this very carefully and for the benefit of the Members, so to speak, we have discussed it in the Bureau and if necessary I will produce some written comments on the Rules of Procedure and I will send it out."
"But it is not a lack of courtesy."
"In any event, I am very grateful to Mr Newton Dunn and the honourable Member for having raised the need to clarify this issue."
"In fact in the Commission there are no specific Commissioners who come to reply to questions in the third part, there are Commissioners who come to reply to the questions put to them and they therefore come to this sitting."
"As for questions of special importance, they are in the first part, classified in a different manner."
"Finally, having explained this, I am at your disposal in case there is any other explanation to be given in writing."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 91 will be reply to in writing(1)."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
". – Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes the work of the rapporteur, Mr Mussa, and the members of the two committees involved, who have managed to reach unanimity in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on a comprehensive and high quality report."
"Fighting cancer has been one of the Commission’s major public health priorities."
"Each year cancer is diagnosed in about 1.6 million Europeans and kills around 950 000 people."
"Estimates suggest, however, that the lives of about 75 000 Europeans could be saved annually if best practices of cancer screening were made available to all citizens across the European Union."
"Even more lives could be saved by extending these recommendations to the acceding countries."
"The Commission’s proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening and Mr Mussa’s report show a clear sign of shared commitment to that end."
"The purpose of this proposal is to make recommendations for mass screening programmes on a sound scientific basis."
"It aims to achieve further reductions of cancer-specific mortality in all Member States by establishing general principles of best practice, as recommended by cancer experts."
"In addressing these questions, we must however remember that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care fall under the competence of the Member States."
"That is why the Commission’s proposal addresses the issue through a Council recommendation."
"However, I should stress that these issues are essential preconditions for the success of any screening programme."
"The proposal foresees a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes, on the basis of information to be provided by Member States, no later than the end of the third year after the date of its adoption."
"This report will be used to consider the need for further action."
"In the follow-up the Commission will take a particular interest in the two main areas of the scientific developments."
"First, the new tests which would improve or possibly even replace recommended methods, such as combining the pap test with testing for infection with high-risk human papilloma viruses or in other words, HPV testing, and, second, the new tests for cancers in other organs, such as PSA testing for prostate cancer."
"Thank you again for your continued support on this important public health issue."
". Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have made a valuable contribution to the drafting of this report, which is important in both scientific and social terms."
"As I have already had the opportunity to reiterate on other occasions, I believe that public health should increasingly be treated as a matter of primary importance in European policies, not least in view of the forthcoming enlargement."
"This recommendation is the first step towards the harmonisation and coordination of policies regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
"Sadly, cancer is the main cause of death in industrialised countries, affecting patients, families and operators themselves."
"The socio-economic impact is therefore enormous, not just in terms of the cost of treating and supporting patients but also in terms of the emotional strain involved."
"In addition to the human tragedy, the situation causes a continual decrease in the proportion of the healthy population whose productivity and know-how are the mainstay of European society."
"We can deduce from the most recent statistics that the average age of onset of these diseases is getting lower and lower: the younger the patient, the more aggressive the disease."
"Thus, the possibility of treating cancer undeniably depends on how early it is diagnosed; besides, late diagnosis of cancer requires aggressive and invasive forms of treatment, which are costly and have a high psychological and social impact."
"Although the Member States are responsible for health policies, through their national health systems, it is unthinkable that such an important prevention campaign, in both the social and public health spheres, should remain a national or regional project dependent on the economic and cultural potential of each country."
"The impact of this disease on society should be borne and coordinated at European level, guaranteeing equal opportunities for treatment and therefore good results across the board."
"The current capacity for radical treatment in oncology seems to depend more on the opportunities for prevention, based on epidemiological and etiopathogenetic knowledge and early diagnosis, rather than on surgical techniques and radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy."
"For example, we might take the example of gastric carcinoma, for which the five-year survival rate ranges between 95% in patients with an intramucosal carcinoma to less than 10% in patients with an advanced invasive carcinoma, despite therapy."
"On the one hand, a correct and adequate screening needs a maximum capacity for identifying even the smallest lesions (sensitivity) and a good capacity for distinguishing them from benign lesions (specificity) and to ensure that the diagnostic investigation is non-invasive for the patient and itself entails an almost zero risk of damage, since the procedures are, by definition, carried out on asymptomatic individuals, who are only potentially ill."
"Of course, the new instruments for early diagnosis, before being offered at European level, should be examined and validated carefully by means of trials."
"Last but not least, the excellence of ‘good practice’ in screening should be checked by analysing the mortality figures collected in all Member States and preferably entered in a European databank."
"Financial resources must be mobilised to increase the number of diagnostic centres and ensure that the workload entailed in screening does not jeopardise the quality of the testing or increase waiting times, which would lead to a deterioration in the quality of care for patients already suffering from cancer."
"It is therefore essential that European action is organised on four fronts: firstly, information and health education for European citizens; secondly, carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth; thirdly, periodic checks on the quality of screening; fourthly, research into the applicability of new screening methods."
"This recommendation will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease."
"The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming etiological fact that one European in four has or will have a malignant tumour in the course of their lives."
"Finally, in addition to European-level screening there ought to be guidelines for the treatment of diseases."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, something like one in four Europeans die of cancer, but thousands of people could be saved every year if high-quality early detection programmes were in place in every Member State."
"We all know that."
"That is why I very much welcome the Commission’s initiative in recommending to the Member States that they introduce screening, the need for which is confirmed by scientific evidence."
"I see it as absolutely scandalous that, for example, only eight Member States have to date started to offer national programmes for mammography screening to all, even though, according to WHO, this cuts the mortality rate by up to 36%, and even though the quality guidelines for this were presented as long ago as 1992."
"Commissioner, I regret that I cannot avoid issuing what is both an appeal and a warning."
"If we are to really take this Council recommendation seriously, you cannot at the same time allow all the screening networks to be forced to close down their operations."
"At the end of the day, it was the work of the European Cancer Networks that led to this Council recommendation."
"If you, the Commission, want to have real credibility in the fight against cancer, then you have to find a permanent place for screening in the new action programme on health."
"We must not allow a recurrence of what happened this year, when the word ‘cancer’ no longer appeared in the action programme’s work plan, which – as you know all too well – eventually, and inevitably, resulted in support for all the screening networks being discontinued."
"Commissioner, we will still, in future, need the European networks to draw up new guidelines and improve existing ones, for only by these means will we achieve equally high standards of screening across the EU."
"In addition, though, we need the networks to support the new Member States, where, as is well known, action is even more urgently needed."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Mussa sincerely for his flawless cooperation with us all."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"One in four people in Europe dies of cancer."
"The suffering caused is enormous, not only for those hit by the disease, but also for their families and friends."
"As terrible as cancer is, however, it is possible to survive it."
"That does mean, however, that the disease must be detected very early, since that leads to a considerable reduction in the number of deaths from it."
"It has been demonstrated that there is a link with the screening programmes, and that is why it is so important for us MEPs, too, to hold detailed discussions on reports such as this, based on sound data supplied by the Commission."
"I must also compliment the Commission on the report it presented."
"I should actually recommend that the Commission circulate that report widely."
"It should be compulsory reading for all policy-makers, because it reveals that preventive action saves lives."
"The European Union has an enormous task ahead of it."
"We must ensure that the available expertise is not wasted."
"I therefore concur with Mrs Jöns’s words a moment ago on the cancer networks."
"We must also keep innovating."
"That means that we must not just persist with old, classical tests."
"Combining a number of things that, according to this report, have been proved or are currently being proved, will enable us to do a much better job."
"I am thinking of not only the HPV test, but also the test for prostate cancer in Luxembourg and the test for colon cancer."
"Given that we also still have a European research programme, of which health forms a major part, we can do a good deal more for European citizens, particularly if the Commissioner and all of us really put this at the heart of our policy."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Karin Jöns for her work in this area."
"Karin recently visited Scotland to talk to the Eastwood constituency Labour party's cancer care group."
"They became interested in cancer care issues when one of their members died from cancer."
"They saw at first hand what cancer can do to someone they know and care for, but, most importantly, they decided to take action to improve the care cancer patients receive in their local community."
"Everyone knows somebody, either directly or indirectly, who has been or is being affected by cancer."
"One in four Europeans will die of cancer."
"Among men, lung and stomach cancer are the most common cancers worldwide, and for women the most common cancers are breast and cervical cancers."
"If we are going to tackle one of the biggest causes of death in the EU and the world, cancer screening is a critical tool in our battle against the disease."
"According to the World Health Organisation, we know enough about the causes of cancer to prevent at least one third of all cancers, cancers that are largely preventable by stopping smoking, eating healthy food and avoiding exposure to carcinogens."
"For those who are affected, detection is critical and screening is essential."
"The earlier cancer is detected, the better the survival rate."
"The proposal to have mammography screening for breast cancer for women aged 50 to 69, faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer in men and women aged 50 to 74 and pap smear tests for cervical abnormalities between the ages of 20 and 30 are steps in the right direction in securing the health of Europeans and they should be welcomed."
"As Amendment 33 suggests, we need to look at the promising new screening tests currently under evaluation, especially the HPV test and a test for prostate cancer, as well as considering mammography screening for women aged 40 to 49."
"We must rely on clinical evidence and evaluation to back up recommendations for the acceptance of new tests."
"Sadly, although I am supportive of HPV tests, I cannot support Amendment 34."
"As soon as the tests are complete, I look forward to us recommending the full inclusion of this process in screening tests."
"However, screening cannot be seen in isolation."
"Cancer networks and cancer registries are also vital in monitoring the impact of screening the population and changes in incidence and survival and mortality."
"Public education and information are essential."
"If you look on the Internet and type the word cancer, you will get 18 600 000 hits."
"E-health and communication are essential in the world that we live in."
"In conclusion, the recommendation before us today will help us in the battle against cancer."
"Too many people in Scotland, Britain, the EU and the world, die from this disease."
"We must do all we can to detect, treat and care for people with cancer."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten mentioned before me that one in four Europeans die every year of cancer, that is almost one million people: alarming figures that mean that we have to be ambitious regarding prevention."
"What we have before us today is a recommendation."
"Of course, we know its limits, but this cannot stop us from being ambitious, I have said it and clearly too."
"This, I believe, is what we are endeavouring to do in the committee and I would like to stress briefly the main points that were improved on the original text."
"First of all, lowering the recommended age for mammography screening for breast cancer from 50 to 40, was, I would say, obvious in light of the statistics on prevalence and current practice in several Member States."
"Then, combining the cervical smear (pap test) with the HPV test to detect cervical cancer."
"This is a crucial addition since human papilloma virus kills 12 800 women every year in Europe."
"Figures published by experts show that the introduction of the HPV test would help to reduce this number of deaths by at least a third."
"Allow me, in passing, to commend the Czech Republic because this accession State is the only State in Europe that currently reimburses for this test."
"Thirdly, and we are now moving on to the male population, the introduction of screening for prostate cancer with the PSA test."
"This is also a matter of urgency: prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men and the second cause of death after lung cancer."
"It can be permanently cured if it remains localised in the prostate."
"This blood test is very simple, routine and should be recommended from the age of 50 years in our text."
"I would also just like to say how important it is that everyone, including the less well informed, has access to screening, which is why I wanted to recommend mobile screening campaigns here."
"It is also in this same general mindset of informing the public that I would like to conclude by stressing, over and above the precise recommendation and before screening, the importance of primary prevention when talking about cancer."
"Health education, diet, the fight against smoking, sport, moderate exposure to the sun, like many measures at national level and behaviour at an individual level, will enable us to prevent these avoidable cancers from developing."
"Mr President, if there is one certainty about cancer it is that early diagnosis increases the chances of cure."
"Screening is therefore vital, in particular for people exposed to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances."
"Equality of access to screening programmes also needs to be guaranteed for all."
"To this end, awareness campaigns, which seek to inform the public, are imperative."
"The Mussa report recalls these basic principles, and we will definitely vote in favour of this text."
"The report also proposes to create cancer registers to target, in the first instance, population groups that show a high incidence due to environmental factors or those linked to dietary habits."
"This route is fundamental, because we need to go further."
"Screening, which is certainly essential, is in fact only a secondary prevention measure."
"We need to act beforehand, to assess the influence of factors such as nutrition, environment, and life style, and to try to reduce their importance."
"That is real prevention: eliminating the causes or the circumstance propitious to the disease rather than trying too late to cure them."
"I am extremely concerned by the latest statistics that show that lung cancer linked to smoking has spread, in particular in women, and also cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate, that are directly linked to the influence of hormones."
"We need to bring to the fore the determining factors in the development of these cancers: endocrinal disturbances, dietary hormones or others."
"In the same way, the increase in prostate cancer in certain groups of farmers is directly linked to the use of pesticides."
"In addition, it has been proven that pollution, electro magnetic waves or other chemical factors increase the risk of some cancers."
"Just remember the problem linked to asbestos and the 70 years it took to manage to ban it; only now are our hospitals seeing the full consequences of it."
"We need to tackle these problems at the roots and extend public health policies to other areas if we really want to fight cancer in Europe."
"Mr President, cures for cancer are still being sought, but year by year we see progress."
"The formerly unmentionable disease has, to some extent, overcome the stigma, not least because of advances in medical science, giving hope to patients and families."
"These depend on early diagnosis, which comes from screening."
"The extension of screening needs, as Mr Mussa said, to be based on science."
"I and my colleagues very much welcome his report."
"There are so many questions about cancer."
"Concerning breast cancer, screening is well advanced."
"We must look at how we can extend that to other age groups."
"We must investigate how we can persuade more men to be aware that breast cancer is a matter for men as well as women and come forward to be screened as well."
"Bowel cancer is a new area for screening, with new tests available."
"Again, the issue will be how we can educate people – especially men – to come forward to be screened."
"For cervical cancer, the pap smear has proved its worth."
"Now we need the HPV alongside it."
"I very much support Mr Mussa's amendments in this regard."
"Lung cancer is the most deadly."
"Worldwide, 1.3 million people have lung cancer; 80% of these people die within a year of diagnosis."
"We need more PET scanners."
"We only have five in the United Kingdom."
"I understand that there are 60 in Germany and 150 in the United States."
"We need to highlight these disparities."
"For prostate cancer, there is screening and the PSA test."
"There is a demand for these, as we have heard."
"We should do these tests if and when the evaluation shows its worth."
"We need the cancer networks."
"We need the information campaigns highlighted in the amendments that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and I have tabled."
"Screening means diagnosis."
"Diagnosis means lives saved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have already said that one in four European citizens, approximately one million a year, will die of cancer, one of the main causes of death in the European Union."
"Your proposal to the Council on cancer screening was supported and backed by the representatives of all the political groups in the European Parliament."
"The rapporteur said that younger and younger people are suffering from various new forms of tumours."
"Information for and health education of citizens on the prevention and timely detection of symptoms which give danger signals, together with reliable screening, have brought about positive results, such as, for example, with breast cancer, which affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age."
"Even with those new forms of tumours which cannot be completely cured, a greater chance of survival and better quality of life are now assured."
"I thought it advisable to strengthen the Commission proposal with amendments intended to give citizens equal access to screening, treatment and monitoring services, based always on best practices."
"Similarly, the need for counselling for those who ultimately contract cancer is proving to be a basic parameter in the final outcome of the disease."
"Even saying the word 'cancer' is avoided in numerous countries."
"Citizens react with fear and panic to anything to do with cancer."
"We can change fear into productive awareness and care."
"Only thus will we limit deaths and illness while, at the same time, having a positive effect on all the other social repercussions."
"To close, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur on his essential interventions in the original proposal."
"Mr President, while I appreciate the Commission's proposals are an attempt to find best standards and establish common best standards across Europe, that will have to be done on the basis of Member States agreeing to cooperate in this area."
"It will require political commitment in many countries going far beyond the current commitment in terms of political will and financial investment in cancer testing and treatment."
"Reports have shown that up to 90% of the people diagnosed with breast cancer can be cured if they are diagnosed early enough."
"It has been established that up to 100% of cervical cancers can be cured and prevented if proper testing is carried out in the correct age group along with FPV testing."
"Clearly this is an area where huge progress can be made in preventing mortality and also a lot of pain and suffering for the individuals concerned and for their families. It is important to have this debate."
"I just want to give some statistics on the Irish situation specifically, not because I want to criticise the Irish Government but because, if we are to get cooperation across the board in this area, it is necessary to show how bad the situation is in some countries."
"For instance, less than 4 000 of the 12 000 patients who require radiotherapy in the Republic of Ireland each year receive it."
"Public patients face a three-month delay for radiation treatment they have been told is both necessary and urgent."
"The first five-year analysis of cancer trends in the Irish National Cancer Registry, published in February 2002, showed that 50% of patients with lung cancer received no cancer-specific treatment; 7% of those with leukaemia were not offered chemotherapy; two-thirds of patients in the Republic with last-stage stomach cancer received no cancer-specific treatment."
"Regional variations and the availability of radiotherapy have a particular impact on poorer patients, since many cancer sufferers have to travel long distances and stay away from home for long periods."
"The Republic's two radiotherapy units are based in Dublin and Cork, so, while 39% of patients nationally have radiotherapy for breast cancer, only 24% living in the west of Ireland have it."
"Unfortunately things are not getting any better, because funding for those services has been cut."
"That is the kind of situation we are faced with."
"I appeal to the House to support the report before us and for the Commissioner to make it clear to all Member States where these appalling statistics apply that they must get to grips with this issue and save lives."
". – First, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Members of this House for their comments on this report."
"I can reassure you that cancer prevention still figures very high on my agenda."
"As some Members have rightly stated to me in writing, after 15 years of continuous European Community efforts and involvement, this represents a significant and visible success for the Community in an important area of disease prevention and health promotion for European citizens."
"Work on cancer, including screening and surveillance, will be taken forward by the Commission."
"The cancer screening recommendation will be taken forward by Member States' authorities and the Commission, once it is adopted by the Council."
"Funding will be through ongoing projects within the previous 'Europe Against Cancer' programme and through the new public health programme."
"For 2003, a number of cancer-related projects have been identified for funding."
"Under the current contracts, a fourth edition of the European guidelines for quality assurance in mammography screening and the first comprehensive edition of European guidelines for best practice in cervical cancer screening will be finalised in 2004."
"The Commission has already enhanced the prevention of diseases, including cancer, in the new health programmes draft work programme for 2004."
"The draft specifically provides for a reference to cancer under the first and third strand objectives."
"This will enable cancer surveillance applications to be fully considered."
"Project proposals on the status of best practice in the Member States, as well as in acceding countries, would also be covered."
"In the light of the views expressed today, the Commission intends to review the situation of cancer prevention even further with regard to the public health programmes work programme of 2004."
"We will then have to decide how to best underpin the Commission's role in cancer prevention, while implementing the Council recommendation on cancer screening."
"As the matter is especially important for acceding countries too, we are considering a meeting between experts from these countries and cancer screening experts, in order to ensure that the achievements of the cancer networks benefit the new Member States as well."
"The points raised in the report and during the debate today have demonstrated clearly the importance of the issue."
"In the report of the Committee on Environment, Health and Consumer Protection, 33 amendments are proposed."
"A further amendment was tabled for the plenary session."
"The Commission can in principle support 11 amendments, namely Amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 22."
"In addition, we partially support four amendments, Amendments 1, 29, 30 and 32."
"In addition to general improvements in the wording of the text, the acceptable amendments concern, for example, improving compliance and equal access for European citizens, as well as enhancing the role of the Commission in following up the implementation of the Council recommendation."
"The Commission cannot, however, support the remaining 19 amendments."
"Amendment 25 cannot be supported, as all rules and regulations on data protection in the Member States must be in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC."
"Exceptions, for instance for medical registries, must be in accordance with Article 8 of the directive."
"Thus the amendment would simply reiterate the 'acquis communitaire'."
"In addition, Amendments 5, 13 and 34 cannot be supported."
"They refer to tests that have not been successfully evaluated in randomised controlled trials."
"Finally, Amendment 33 cannot be accepted."
"Even though it makes the necessary distinction between evidence-based tests and new tests currently under evaluation or new variations of recommended tests, these new tests are already sufficiently covered by Articles 6(c) and (d)."
"To mention a few specific ones would immediately raise the question as to why only those tests have been singled out."
"– Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0353/2003) by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on Establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency (COM(2003) 63 – C5-0058/2003 – 2003/0032(COD))."
". – Mr President, network and information security has become increasingly important, with growing use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies."
"In today’s society, much depends on networks and information systems."
"Yet, in order to fully realise the advantages of the information society, people need to be able to trust the system."
"It has become clear that we have to make a common effort to strengthen network and information security in Europe."
"In 2001 the Commission presented a communication on a policy framework and in February 2003 a proposal to establish a European Network and Information Security Agency."
"Now, nine months later, we are about to witness a first reading agreement on ENISA."
"Let me take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, for his thorough work, as well as the political groups which have helped to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Council."
"It is very positive that there has been such a strong will to negotiate and to reach an agreement."
"The European Parliament has contributed a lot to this process, as it has to the important telecom-related legislation over the past three years."
"I am happy that Parliament has been able to overcome a number of difficult issues and to reach this compromise."
"The compromise has to be confirmed today and tomorrow by this House, in order for the Telecom Council on 20 November 2003 to adopt a political agreement which would allow the Agency to start at the beginning of 2004."
"That is what the European Council called for last spring."
"I want to thank Parliament for the support it has given the Commission."
"This support has enabled the Council to make concessions on the involvement of industry by introducing a permanent stakeholders' group."
"Although not fully in line with what the Commission wanted in terms of composition and voting rules for the Management Board, the compromise proposal has made the management of the Agency considerably lighter and given the Executive Director the main management tasks."
"The Commission has looked carefully at Parliament's compromise amendments and can accept them."
"The present text from Parliament has clarified the objectives and tasks of the Agency."
"It will be a learning process to transpose the tasks into a more operational set of actions, but I am happy to see that there is wide agreement on the general lines of what the Agency should do."
"As for the composition of the Management Board and its voting rules, the Commission would have preferred a reduced composition, together with an extension of the simple majority voting rules."
"We consider that the extended management board with two-thirds majority voting rules is a potential obstacle to the smooth functioning of agencies."
"In this specific case the Commission has, however, decided to accept a deviation from the proposed framework for regulatory agencies of December 2002, although that should not be considered as a precedent for future agencies."
"This Agency will operate in the sensitive field of security and it urgently needs to be put in place now."
"I hope Member States will do their best to participate in the Management Board in order to make the Agency work successfully."
"This Agency is a major step forward for Europe or at least for eEurope."
"Member States have shown a willingness to cooperate actively on this issue in order to strengthen the internal market and to help the European citizens, businesses and administrations make full use of the networks and information systems."
"This will be a signal both to stakeholders in Europe and to countries outside the Union that we take the issues of network and information security seriously and that Member States and the Commission, with the support of this House, are ready to act."
". – Mr President, the Presidency is aware that communications networks should be seen as key, vital infrastructure in modern economies and, as such, should be protected: their protection and their security is a matter of public interest."
"Personally, as Mr Gasparri’s representative – who has, I am sorry to say, been detained in Italy today due to the grave tragedy that has struck our country, and is involved in paying our last respects to the soldiers killed in Iraq – I would like to confirm the Presidency’s past and ongoing commitment to the issue of security of networks and information."
"The European institutions have, moreover, shown that they are aware of the urgent need for joint action that will enable the Agency to actually be operational from the beginning of 2004, as the Heads of State or Government recommended to the Spring 2003 European Council."
"The Internet and communications technologies are certainly the innovations that have most characterised our society in recent years and that have influenced how the overwhelming majority of human activities are carried out."
"However, over and above the obvious advantages, these technologies have introduced a series of problems into our society that are linked to the poor reliability of the instruments used."
"Security requirements have changed rapidly over the past 20 years, in line with the development of networks and computers, which are ever more omnipresent in public and private life."
"Broadband connections give the user the possibility of having a permanent connection to the Internet; new wireless applications allow access in practically any place and the possibility of connecting almost anything to the network – from personal computers to household appliances – continues and will continue to develop people’s use of the Internet."
"Controlling security has become a difficult and complex task and the user is faced with problems of the availability, integrity, authenticity and the confidentiality of data and services on a daily basis."
"The complexity of technology means that several components and elements have to interact and makes human behaviour a crucial factor."
"Apart from being a source of malfunctions, computers and networks can, however, also be subjected to attacks on information systems."
"Today, an attack on an information system can put entire nations in serious difficulty."
"To reduce the likelihood of such an event, every country needs to take effective action to improve the security of its ICT infrastructure; given the cross-border dimension of the problem, however, structures need to be defined in which national experiences can be gathered together and become common heritage."
"The experience of recent years has taught us that sharing experiences and information, and, more generally, international cooperation, are the most efficient weapons for creating a mentality of security in the information society."
"During its term in office, the Presidency has, therefore, made every effort to try to address this issue."
"The proposal for a regulation that Parliament is looking at today is the result of greater agreement, by the institutions, on the need for a joint approach at European level regarding security of information."
"A convergence of positions was arrived at following an increase in concern from both the public and the private sectors regarding crime and even phenomena that are only potentially dangerous linked to the new technologies."
"The more communications networks become features that are essential and central to the functioning of our modern markets, the greater the endeavours we will have to make to ensure and create a secure, protected environment for those operating at the different levels."
"One of the Agency’s objectives is to create a joint committee in Europe for issues relating to information security, which is necessary to guarantee the availability and security of networks and information systems in the Union."
"From this point of view, the Presidency upholds the importance of creating a new culture of security, in which such a concept is not just taken to mean a cost for operators to bear, but as a real and genuine opportunity for market development, also to be achieved by boosting consumer confidence."
"The Agency should be able to facilitate the enforcement of Community measures on security of networks and information."
"The assistance provided by the Agency will help to implement Community legislation in this area, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"This will strengthen the ability of the Community and of the Member States to react to problems of security of networks and of information systems, as well as to the development of the information society in general."
"The actual model proposed by the Agency is innovative."
"In fact, it is based on the knowledge that measures in the area of security of networks can only be tackled in close cooperation with all actors in the world of communications: with market operators and with users of communications services."
"Our institutions have the opportunity to render an essential service to the public and to the European agencies by creating this Agency, for the consensus we hope for at first reading is possible, which is an indication of a great sense of responsibility and of deep understanding of the sensitive nature of this matter."
"The negotiations were laborious and complex, but the positions of the Council and Parliament were gradually reconciled, evidence – and I repeat – of a great sense of responsibility."
"I hope, therefore, that, in a few days, we will be able to celebrate the adoption of this regulation."
"To conclude, I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen, the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, and Mr van Velzen, Mrs Mann and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, as well as, of course, all the other members of the committee."
". – Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the security of information systems is a major concern of today and a subject of discussion in modern and vulnerable societies."
"Power supply networks, water supply and sewage, traffic control, hospitals – everything can be thrown into chaos any time, any place."
"The Bastel virus this autumn was perhaps the first where business lay behind the destruction it caused."
"The hackers or crackers used it to aid a shady business, chiefly pornography, one presumes. Stealing sensitive information on ordinary people is also obviously a crime, when you think about it."
"Various sorts of violation of people’s privacy can happen on an absolutely massive scale."
"This sort of thing has to be tackled."
"Its lack of security is becoming more and more a barrier to the development of the networked society."
"Last year 75% of European companies had no information security strategy."
"Less than 2% of investment in information technology is put into information security."
"In two companies out of every three information security is as yet not considered a strategic issue."
"The Data Protection Act should have entered into force in the Member States in October."
"Under this law unsolicited email cannot be sent without the specific consent of the receiver."
"Spam accounts for more than half of all email, and, for many, more than 90%, as is the case too with many of us in this House."
"The credibility and reliability of email are now being wrecked."
"We voted on this subject in this House last year."
"At the time almost half did not regard spam as a problem."
"They opposed this idea of getting someone’s permission first."
"Now that will not be enough either."
"Now the operators will also have to clean up content."
"That will result in problems for the freedom of personal communication."
"Security clearance is very much on the increase as our lives become more and more involved in networks and communications."
"With broadband we are on line the whole time."
"The wireless Internet will be the obvious hunting ground of the troublemaker."
"It will be a nuisance for all: private individuals, companies and society."
"The problem over security is made worse by the fact that in a complex environment many components and partial systems have to function together."
"The human factor is also a risk."
"Information security thus affects everyone everywhere."
"Information security is a political question, and that is why we have to resolve it."
"That is why, moreover, we are in an exceptional hurry here to create this agency for Europe, the European Network and Information Security Agency."
"Without security the Lisbon objectives will not be implemented."
"Information insecurity would lead us into an age of piracy."
"Three types of measure are in progress."
"We have enacted laws relating to electronic communications and data protection."
"The Commission is drafting principles for judging and sentencing cybercrime and looking at ways of improving information security, and one of these ways is ENISA."
"I want to thank my colleagues, the Council and the Commission for their excellent levels of cooperation."
"It shows how we have now understood what this situation means."
"ENISA will be a centre of excellence that coordinates, analyses and gives advice."
"It will work very closely with the public and private sector."
"The Agency will promote the development of risk assessment and risk management methods."
"International cooperation will be indispensable."
"The Agency must be located somewhere where there are already viable top information technology communications systems, including wireless."
"The world’s top operations centres must be located there and we must be able to find Europe’s most highly skilled people there easily."
"As rapporteur I have worked in favour of a compromise, which is that the Management Board should have representation from all Member States."
"At the same time it will not get involved in day-to-day work, which will be the domain of the Executive Director, the staff, the Advisory Board and the working groups."
"There is no doubt that a large Management Board will be a necessary forum of cooperation and a factor in creating direction."
"Voting rules are slightly problematic."
"We can return to them in a few years’ time."
"The Agency will work for the benefit of the Member States, where levels of information security vary considerably."
"The role of companies in our compromise is a strong one, thanks to Mr van Velzen, because they of course possess most of the networks and expertise."
"I also wish to thank Mrs Mann, who has also keenly promoted this move."
"The compromise package has been adopted by the committee, the Council and the Commission."
"I expect that we will recognise our responsibilities and vote in its favour tomorrow."
"It will lead to better security, to employment and to greater development."
"– Mr President, it looks as if, on 1 January 2004, we are going to be given a European Network and Information Security Agency."
"I welcome that."
"The agency is an important factor in securing the networks and the information society."
"We must hope that, on this occasion, the ends justify the means because there are, unfortunately, a number of things to complain about in the outcome."
"The fact that Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement in the course of the first reading entails, in this case, losses for both Parliament and the industry."
"The agency’s management board has become too large, with a representative for each Member State, and the industry has had to give way, together with other areas of civil society."
"My amendment, which was aimed at bringing about transparency in the application and appointment procedure, will no doubt acquire significance in the longer term."
"The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was united in supporting it, but it disappeared in the course of discussion through an administrative mistake by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"In other words, the Council’s wheeling and dealingwith authorities that infringe legislation, and vice versa, continues without any democratic scrutiny."
"I have a couple of messages for the Commission and the Council prior to the jointdeclarationthat is now to be drawn up. Guarantee long-term transparency in the application procedure."
"Exploit and develop the EU’s cooperation with the United States and other third countries."
"Ensure that network security is achieved in accordance with the common guidelines that have already been approved in a Council resolution and that have been signed by ten of the Member States, together with six other countries."
"Develop the EU guidelines around what individual Member States are already applying."
"Last week, a delegation from Parliament visited Washington and experienced on the spot what should become our future style."
"An EU singing from the same hymn sheet should facilitate our foreign relations, especially with the United States."
"Through this agency, we can now jointly develop data protection in all its different dimensions, and that is good."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, very many thanks to my fellow MEP Mr Paasilinna for his excellent, constructive cooperation."
"In fact, we have not seen otherwise, as this has already occurred with a great many dossiers."
"I should also like to say to the Italian Presidency that a very peculiar procedure has taken place."
"I have never before seen the Council ready when Parliament has yet to make a start."
"We have had to do an enormous amount of work together in order to succeed, and, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Italian Presidency, we have indeed achieved that compromise."
"This situation must not be repeated on any account, but we must all learn from it."
"The importance of the Agency is clear."
"The Commissioner has just pointed it out."
"Mr Paasilinna cited some data, and I shall not reiterate it."
"I should, however, like to draw attention to the article in last week’s with the headline: ‘Blackmail by internet as gangs target sites’."
"What was it about?"
"Ordinary extortion demands are made, then you have to pay a certain amount and you will be left alone."
"So this is where we have got to."
"We are talking about damage to industry running into millions."
"Very often, physical infrastructure, too, is targeted."
"We always think that it is financial institutions that are involved, but top of the attacks list are the electricity networks."
"As an Italian, you know what it means when a light goes out."
"A huge number of attacks have been committed on the physical infrastructure."
"I am very pleased, therefore, that there is now clarity as regards the location of the Agency."
"It is now ultimately a case of helping the Commission and the Member States with a colossal mobilisation of industry."
"Fortunately, the Agency has also been given an executive role."
"It is obvious that industry, too, must play a part as far as possible. When all is said and done, Member States do not have ownership of security."
"Much has already been said about the Management Board, and also about the voting rights."
"Privately, I still cannot explain why two-thirds of votes should be needed."
"We still have not solved this mystery surrounding the Council."
"I am extremely pleased that prevention has become one of the tasks."
"After all, how can you talk about security without mentioning prevention?"
"On the subject of transparency, I should like to ask the Italian Presidency – and I do expect an answer to this – whether you are now prepared to let the Member States that put themselves forward for the Agency do that out in the open, so that everyone knows which country the Agency wants."
"Will you not let that take place behind closed doors in the Council?"
"I challenge you to provide that transparency."
"My conclusion is that this is a first step: no more and no less."
"In practice, it will turn out to be inadequate and badly in need of revision."
"It is very important, however, that the Agency is put in place, and therefore my group gives its unqualified support to this Agency and to the amendments."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too would like to begin by congratulating Mr Paasilinna."
"I believe we have achieved a good compromise."
"In the many speeches that we have already heard, it has been described as a compromise, but as one that will indeed bring us, in the coming year, a European agency to deal with security issues throughout the Internet and its infrastructure."
"I believe that it was on this basis that we then all decided to simply try and reach a compromise that would take us through the first five years, although we were always aware that, after those five years, we would make a real attempt at creating genuine European structures and doing away with the problems that will now be inherent in the Agency."
"These have to do with voting rights, but also with the issue raised by the Member States, which will now, in fact, be represented by one person each."
"I nonetheless believe that, faced with the challenges in this area, each and every one of us will really try to determine what this agency’s tasks are."
"I have confidence in the promises made by the Italian presidency of the Council, and I think it will remember them even after five years."
"I hope that we will then all work towards making an early start on the audit that we have planned for – as early as after three years, if my memory serves me correctly – so that we can then make a start on rethinking the structures and defining the tasks more precisely."
"It is with reference to that, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I would like to put a question to you. Will you actually be coming back to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to discuss these tasks with its members as soon as you know how they are to be catalogued in collaboration with the Member States?"
"The fact is that I suspect that this is not just about issues of security in the infrastructures – Members have already mentioned data security – but also about many other aspects that are equally affected, and initiating another wide-ranging discussion of these issues could be very interesting."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and also the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, I am happy that a compromise has been reached, although the Council’s position did surprise me."
"The Council cut the Commission proposal down to the bone and initially tried everything possible to prevent the efficient functioning of this Agency."
"A start has been made, however."
"Nothing now stands in the way of the creation of a European agency, and I hope that the Council does not impose another blockade on the issue of finding the right seat for the Agency."
"It is important that initiatives developed by Member States and businesses with regard to network security are well coordinated at European level."
"After all, it is cross-border problems that are at issue here, and the jurisdiction of the Member States stops at the border."
"In addition, I am pleased that a role, if only an advisory role, is being reserved for industry in the composition and functioning of the Agency."
"After all, industry is the most important player regarding ownership and operation of networks, and we lay down the rules that determine that industry has to guarantee the functioning of the network."
"We must then also fill in the specific details."
"It is also important that, with this Agency, a body is established that can negotiate with other international players."
"In that way, the Agency can contribute to maintaining a healthy transatlantic relationship, which is essential in the sphere of security in general and network security in particular."
"It is incomprehensible to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party why the Council remains committed to a two-thirds majority of votes as the basis for decisions by the Management Board on, among other things, the work programme and the appointment of the Director."
"This does make it very difficult to take proper decisions efficiently."
"Efficiency – what efficiency?"
"In any case, it is good that a compromise has finally been reached, and so the ELDR Group will support the report by Mr Paasilinna."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to be speaking here tonight with many colleagues who have worked on this report."
"I am here on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which strongly supported Mr Paasilinna in its opinion, and I would like to thank him as rapporteur and my colleague Mrs McCarthy, who was the draftsman for the opinion that I also worked on."
"From the perspective of those of us who work in the field of the internal market, it is important to emphasise that this is one of the reasons cited in particular for setting up the Information Security Agency."
"It is becoming increasingly apparent that questions about the security of computer networks and confidence in them are very much in the minds of the people we want to encourage to take up electronic commerce and enjoy all the benefits of the broadband infrastructure, whether accessing commercial or public services."
"Therefore this new centre of excellence to significantly step up cooperation between Member States in this area is of vital importance."
"It is essential for the competitiveness of the European economy and for the development of the information society – something that I know you, Commissioner, are very keen on – that we should start to pool our resources and address these crucial issues."
"It is a tribute to my colleagues who have worked with the Italian presidency and with the Commission that we have managed to get an agreement."
"Speed is of the essence."
"However, we must not allow speed to compromise the search for excellence."
"I know you, Commissioner, will be looking for the best possible people and the best possible operating structures to put in place so that this agency really can contribute its expertise as soon as possible."
"Because it is a best-practice agency – and this is something we particularly emphasised in our report – it has to adopt the best possible practice in its own security and the way it operates its own systems, to set an example to everybody else."
"I am sure that all of us look forward very much to working with the new agency and seeing it contribute to the undoubted success of information society measures that we have supported so consistently in this House."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Paasilinna, on an excellent report."
"The Internet, as we have heard, is no longer a new phenomenon."
"Today, more than 90% of companies and 44% of households in the EU have an Internet connection and more than two-thirds of Europeans use a mobile phone."
"Our everyday systems are controlled by computers and communication networks, from public transport systems to the water that comes out of our taps at home."
"It is no surprise, then, that security in this area is a huge concern for our citizens and businesses."
"I must admit that I have reservations about creating new agencies willy-nilly."
"However, I have to say that I totally support the establishment of this one."
"Nevertheless, I wish to make three points, which are also questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, the issue of differing security standards."
"Given that at present the 15 Member States are all at different stages of combating cybercrime, how does the Commission plan to tackle this obstacle and ensure effective implementation, especially once we become a Union of 25, when the real challenge will be to harmonise security standards across Europe?"
"Will the Agency have sufficient clout to ensure that Member States take the recommendations and advice of this Agency seriously?"
"Secondly, on the issue of cross-border cooperation, it is a fact that there is no systematic cross-border cooperation between the current Member States."
"We know that security is a difficult and complex task, encompassing all sorts of issues like availability, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of data and services."
"How does the Commission intend to get public and private sectors and businesses and consumers to work together?"
"How does it intend to promote security in these areas?"
"Thirdly, security requirements are constantly evolving as networking in the community and computing develop further, electronic communications become more widespread and hackers become more adept at foiling security systems."
"We need to ensure that we in Europe have the highest possible level of security."
"How will the Commission ensure that this Agency does not fall behind new technologies and that it leaves no stone unturned in the fight against cybercrime?"
"Finally, I hope the setting up of this Agency will lead to some rationalisation within the Commission, because often when we set up agencies it also means some sort of streamlining within the Commission."
". – First, in reply to Mrs Gill's remark on security standards, we have proposed the establishment of the network security agency so that common standards can be found."
"Second, the participation of private sector businesses and others will be taken into account."
"This is something that Parliament has long been pushing for."
"Mr Paasilinna, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mrs Mann all spoke very convincingly on that issue tonight in the presence of the Italian presidency, and we are very proud of that."
"There seems to be a strong body of opinion in favour of what the Commission proposed earlier."
"Keeping up with changing technology will always be a challenge for us."
"The information society technologies programme, however, is one area where we can help: research programmes are ongoing in that field, and there is also the stakeholders' group."
"I hope that the European Network and Information Security Agency will be a kind of 'hub of hubs' in this area, where the best knowledge can be exchanged."
"Once again I should like to thank Mr Paasilinna, Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Mann, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Harbour and Mrs Gill."
"I should like you, Mr President, to pass on a message to the Bureau that these people deserve a chance to have a debate on the information society during the daytime."
"Since I have been in this House this has never happened before 9.30 p.m. at the earliest."
"This gives the impression that 'future' issues are discussed in the evening and 'past' issues during the day."
"Could this change, even just once, before the European elections?"
"I trust that you will pass on this modest wish."
"With this team you could run any file in Europe, and they deserve to do this during the day from time to time."
"I got a little emotional there but I should now comment on the amendments!"
"The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments as voted on 17 November 2003 in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"None of the other amendments can be accepted."
"– Your modest request, Commissioner, is not as dangerous as the one that was put forward by a famous author."
"I will, therefore, certainly put this to the Conference of Presidents."
"Here, Members applaud when they hear certain proposals put forward that are deemed appropriate."
"They should not, however, turn to those presiding over the meetings but to the chairmen of their groups, because it is the group chairmen, at the Conference of Presidents meetings, who decide what time issues are debated."
"Mr President, I have put a very pertinent question to the Italian presidency."
"Would you allow the Italian presidency to answer it?"
"– I am quite aware that you put a question to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I was about to ask if he intends to answer or not."
"As regards the request that was put forward, I can only reply in the affirmative."
"Indeed, there is clearly such a real need that we must certainly take on board this request for transparency."
"– The Members will hold you to that statement, which is very important."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
". – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the work they have put into the first reading report."
"Our proposal aims to ensure consistency in dealing with shipments of waste."
"We need to ensure environmentally sound management in relation to both shipments within the Community and exports from the Community to third countries."
"It is focused on implementing the 2001 OECD decision, pursuing international harmonisation, which means respecting the internationally agreed obligations in the Basel Convention, addressing problems encountered in the application of the regulation since its adoption ten years ago and enhancing the structure of the regulation."
"In relation to shipments within the Community, I share the concerns expressed about standard dumping in waste for recovery."
"The Commission proposal and the Communication on a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste clearly recognise the problem."
"However, our response is a long-term solution at EU level, whose main elements are, firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPPC Directive and, secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham or fake recovery and clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations."
"In relation to exports from the Community to third countries, I support the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment to further sharpen the regulation by making reference to both EU legislation and certain internationally-agreed guidelines, in particular those on ship recycling."
"Let me conclude this introduction by saying that it is important that we do not allow environmental standard dumping, either when we ship waste internally within the Community or when we export it from the Community to third countries."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 15% of heavy goods vehicles on European roads are transporting waste."
"The reason for this is the existence of differing market conditions."
"Not all Member States have bans or taxes on the dumping of waste."
"As a result, a great deal of waste is being transferred to other countries."
"This runs counter to the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency that apply to waste disposal under the Waste Framework Directive."
"Shipments of waste can only be refused if the waste cannot be recovered in the importing country."
"A lengthy debate has arisen on the subject of when something can be considered to be recovery."
"The problem in this whole debate is that waste recovery is not necessarily more sound in environmental terms."
"Clear criteria for recovery must therefore be developed."
"The European Commission acknowledges this problem by remarking, among other things, that there are few Community environmental requirements for waste recovery operations."
"There is no prospect of a solution to this problem, however, unless the Commission makes proposals as part of the Thematic Strategy on Recycling."
"It is currently the Court of Justice that determines what constitutes waste recovery, and this is unacceptable."
"In addition, the amendment of the Waste Framework Directive has been far too long in coming."
"We are not behaving responsibly towards the waste sector if we await the whole, protracted, process of amending the Waste Framework Directive."
"Clarity is needed in the shorter term."
"Since the problems arise primarily in connection with the shipment of waste, it is an obvious course of action to spell out these additional conditions in this Regulation."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that, until the European Commission formulates these conditions, the Member States should have the option of imposing their own conditions on waste recovery."
"In addition, it is my view that it must be possible to refuse shipments of waste if a minimum percentage of recovery and a minimum calorific value are not observed."
"A misunderstanding persists as to these grounds for refusal."
"If there is the possibility of refusing a shipment of waste on environmental grounds, this does not imply that refusal is compulsory."
"Some position papers incorrectly state that shipments of waste are banned."
"Articles 12 and 13 of this Regulation are not talking about a ban, but about the fact that shipments of waste may be undertaken by mutual agreement."
"The reuse of silver, even if it is less than one tenth of a per cent, shall thus remain possible."
"Exports of waste should only be permitted if they lead to recovery or final disposal in the short term; and not, therefore, exports of waste that are destined for what is termed ‘interim recovery’ or ‘interim disposal’, as far as the Committee on the Environment is concerned."
"In practice, a great deal goes wrong during the mixing, sorting and storing involved."
"It can no longer be ascertained where the waste has gone and what has happened to it."
"Waste that is well sorted and quantifiable, and is really recovered or disposed of in an environmentally sound way, can indeed be exported, therefore."
"In line with this, the Committee on the Environment proposes a ban on the export of unsorted household waste."
"After all, we do not transport our sewage to other countries."
"My final point concerns the implementation of this Regulation."
"We must not give in to those Member States that are failing to invest sufficiently in this."
"For this reason, I do not support Amendments 95 and 98 by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which introduce implied permission for the country of import."
"Prior mutual written agreement is necessary for the purposes of transparency."
"There are Member States that do not have their house in order at the moment."
"They themselves admit that they cannot control shipments of waste."
"In this regard, the Member States concerned must bring about change instead of complaining about the administrative burden."
"In summary, price competition on the European waste market is acceptable, but eco-competition is not."
"What the Committee on the Environment does not want is exports of waste that lead to an environmentally less sound alternative."
"After all, this Regulation is not intended to facilitate trade in waste, but to enable environmentally sound waste management."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by saying that this is a good proposal from the Commission which furthermore is coherent in general terms."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this great work, although I do not agree with some of his points of view, because many of the amendments he has presented are aimed at restricting the free movement of waste."
"And waste, whether we like it or not, represents goods and must be treated as such, even if we regulate the aspects which may affect the environment."
"The transport of waste in itself is not an environmental problem."
"The problem is rather the management of this waste, but this is an issue which does not fall within the scope of the present regulation."
"The Committee on the Environment has approved the removal of Article 133 as the legal basis for the proposal, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in favour of this change of legal basis."
"However, the PPE-DE Group is opposed to the removal of the legal basis relating to commercial policy."
"I would like therefore to expressly ask the Commissioner to give a clear opinion on this issue."
"It is particularly important to establish clear rules for the transport of waste by ship and, in this regard, Mr Blokland has presented Amendment 92, which we support, because it resolves the problem of ships which are exported in order to be scrapped."
"However, Amendments 37 and 44 eliminate the principle of Community self-sufficiency established in the framework directive on waste and establish a single principle of national self-sufficiency."
"We are not going to support them because they are contrary to the provisions of the framework directive on waste itself."
"With regard to the amendments which prohibit provisional recycling operations, we believe that they make no sense, particularly in cross-border regions within the European Union."
"We take an identical view of the amendments which establish criteria to define what must be considered recycling."
"The definition of these parameters is not the subject of this regulation and, if any of the amendments in this regard are approved, the PPE-DE Group will vote against the report."
"We call on the Commission, however, to modify the annexes to the framework directive on waste in order to make it clear, once and for all, what recycling is, since we cannot continue to hide behind the judgment of the Court of Justice in accordance with which the Commission interprets its own Directives."
"Judgments are not law, they are specific cases and, for the moment, all they are doing is contributing to a situation in which the agents involved in the management of waste are carrying out their activities in conditions of legal uncertainty."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission's proposal and the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to that proposal, which seeks to improve the existing regulations on the transport of waste, particularly the transnational transport of waste."
"We recently had the problem of ships sailing from the United States to the UK for dismantling and recovery and when some of them arrived, it was discovered, as we had pointed out here in the European Parliament, that there were no facilities in the UK to do the work under European Union law."
"They are now lying there during the winter, to be returned to the United States, creating a further risk to the environment."
"I welcome the proposals in this report to tighten the definition of waste recovery, to encourage Member States to solve the household waste issue self-sufficiently."
"I would draw attention to the fact that we in the Republic of Ireland have introduced a 15 cent surcharge on supermarket plastic bags, which has been enormously successful in dramatically reducing the number of plastic bags being issued by supermarkets."
"This has had a significant impact on the amount of waste."
"We still have a huge waste problem in Ireland."
"There is huge resistance to incineration because of health fears, unreasonable in my view, but the fears are there."
"We have to concentrate on reduction and I hope that this new proposal will help to take us in that direction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his sound, clear report."
"After 28 years, environmental dumping is still a major problem."
"One reason for this is that environmental standards are not the same everywhere, the main reason for this being that there is great disagreement over what recovery actually entails."
"There is a lack of clear criteria."
"The European Commission has blundered here."
"It should have taken the initiative in providing clarity many years ago."
"Sadly, however, the Commission gave in to pressure from the waste industry, which prefers to continue to dump waste."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg has now made a couple of rulings in this legal void, but these do not provide a definite answer either to the question as to what exactly constitutes recovery and what does not."
"Incinerating everything is not recovery, in the opinion of my group."
"Sadly, that is now the case – by definition."
"Recovery implies a usefulness that is not present in the incineration of newspapers; recycling paper is much more useful."
"Obviously, once paper has been recycled five to seven times it can no longer be recycled, and then incineration could indeed be useful."
"Even the incineration of sewage sludge is deemed useful – by definition."
"It is highly doubtful whether that is advisable, however."
"If the sludge has leaked out, that would perhaps be useful, but definitely not if it is soaked in water."
"We must now hold this political debate. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has done so."
"Tomorrow we shall also be voting on amendments."
"Since the Commission has not provided any clarity, we shall have to do it."
"It makes no sense to wait for a thematic strategy before thinking of introducing further legislation."
"We would then be five years down the line."
"We should try to fill this gap now – for better or worse."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr Blokland for his report on the proposal before us, which deals with shipments of waste and the various procedures and control regimes they must follow, the requirements of which are to be determined by the type of waste shipped and the type of treatment that would be applied to the waste at its destination."
"It deals with different levels of control, depending on the risks posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal."
"Under the proposal, shipments of all waste destined for disposal and shipments of hazardous and semi-hazardous waste destined for recovery will be subject to the requirement of prior written notification and consent."
"The tacit consent allowed under the current regulation will be abolished."
"Non-hazardous or what is termed 'green list waste for recovery' would remain subject neither to notification nor consent."
"In other words, the present requirements would remain for green listed waste."
"There is no doubt that a greater administrative burden will fall on waste companies exporting waste across EU borders and on competent authorities of dispatch."
"The Commission claims that there should be no major economic cost."
"I would like the Commission to tell me specifically whether or not an economic impact analysis was done in relation to this particular proposal, to back-up their claim in relation to the economic costs involved."
"Nevertheless, the harmonisation and tightening up of procedures is generally very welcome from an environmental protection perspective."
"It is also proposed to clarify the amount and extent of the coverage of the financial guarantee or insurance to be approved by the competent authority of dispatch; all competent authorities are to have access to it and it must also cover possible storage charges."
"The latter is particularly welcome."
"The amount of guarantee or insurance is currently the subject of some debate."
"Perhaps the Commission could comment on that."
"It has been generally agreed that a consistent method for calculating this should be developed."
"The Commission has presented a draft outline on how this might be achieved."
"Ireland is a small island nation, effectively without any recovery or incineration facilities."
"We will be dependent on the orderly shipment of waste for the foreseeable future."
"I broadly welcome this proposal, but no matter how well-regulated the system is, there will always be risks, culminating in accidents such as the one in April this year, when a German-registered ship, the , ran aground on the tip of Cornwall."
"It was carrying 2 200 tonnes of shredded car waste from Cork in the south-west of Ireland to Lübeck in Germany."
"Mrs Jackson gave me a plastic bag of this waste, recovered by the environmental NGOs when they were cleaning up the beach in Cornwall."
"That is one of the risks that will always be with us."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report."
"The particular issue I would like to focus on is recovery."
"A number of people have referred to the European Court judgment."
"It is long overdue for the Commission to clarify exactly what 'recovery' is, because it is an issue that crosses into the packaging directives and a number of other EU directives as well."
"It does not take a genius to work out that recovery does not mean incinerating waste."
"This is an appalling waste of resources."
"We should not allow Member States to move in that direction, particularly those that do not have incineration at the moment."
"I am speaking in particular about my own Member State, which would like to have the opportunity to build incinerators."
"When one considers the lobbying regarding the Blokland report, a lot of it is from people who operate incinerators and want to ensure that they remain economically viable."
"It is quite clear that if incineration is allowed to be classified as recovery, then there is an incentive to burn and dispose in this way and that creates a disincentive for governments to get their act together."
"This is a very bad example to set to other Member States joining the European Union."
"In my own country in particular, the Irish Government looks for derogations right, left and centre, despite the fact that it has made no effort whatsoever to provide the public in Ireland with the possibility to have effective recycling possibilities or to create recycling industries."
"We are throwing away a large amount of jobs by allowing the waste to be burned."
"This is not an economical way of dealing with waste in the long-term nor it is good for the environment or public health."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of waste is one of the subjects that interests people most, as it has a tangible effect on them."
"Waste management and promoting the recycling and recovery of waste can have a direct impact on people’s everyday lives and welfare, as well as their enjoyment of their surroundings."
"The explosive growth in the volume of waste in the future will be both an environmental and a health problem for an enlarged European Union and its citizens."
"Nevertheless, in many Member States regulations for waste management, the prevention of its build-up, recovery and recycling have not been implemented yet in any serious way, and national laws are often unsatisfactory."
"I myself belong to a band of happy citizens who live in a country where the national strategy on waste is sufficiently ambitious and dealt with excellently."
"Finland’s waste problems at national level cannot, however, be shrugged off, because, as with environmental disasters, waste knows no limits either."
"The Commission proposal to clarify regulations on shipments of waste and clinch a deal on common rules for the waste markets is sorely needed."
"The authorities need clear legislation to improve waste recovery and steer waste management in a more environmentally friendly direction than before."
"It is also particularly important that the minimum requirements for environmental standards applied to third countries adhere to the internal legislative logic of the Community and are not based on any merely vague guidelines."
"I am also worried about the welfare of vulnerable sea areas and the environmental risks they face."
"The protection of Europe’s only internal sea, the Baltic, has long been a priority for the Finnish state."
"I regard it as important that the proposal in question should include the EU’s regional waters, which need protection from the threats posed by waste traffic."
"It is important to note that ships and other means of transport by water can be classed as waste."
"The Basel Convention has not taken separate account of this, and it is therefore important to raise the matter here and now so that any loopholes can be closed."
". – Mr President, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept 26 amendments fully and a further 23 amendments in principle or in part."
"Certain amendments to Article 13 on objections to waste for recovery pursue national solutions rather than solutions at Community level, and these amendments are particularly aimed at addressing the issues of so-called standard dumping in relation to waste destined for recovery by allowing a number of further justifications for objecting to shipments destined for recovery."
"As we all know, the problem relates to the fact that waste for recovery travels almost freely within the single market and, at the same time, waste treatment that respects higher standards is often more costly than conventional waste treatment."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we can allow competition on costs but not on environmental standards."
"However, we are legally obliged through the Treaty to safeguard the environment while also respecting the rules of the internal market."
"A solution can therefore be best found at Community level and should be based on three main elements."
"Firstly, the establishment of standards at EU level through the extension of the IPC Directive; secondly, the establishment of guidelines regarding sham recovery and thirdly, clearer distinctions between the different recovery and disposal operations."
"I agree with those who say that it is not easy to see a solution until this long-term solution is found or established, but we in the Commission definitely recognise the problem and the need to discuss a possible solution in the meantime, and this will be part of the process from now on."
"Another issue of concern to the Commission is the proposed banning of the interim treatment operations."
"Amendments 13, 14, 34 and 41 propose banning shipments of waste for interim treatment operations and define recovery and disposal operations as only covering final treatment and not interim operations."
"The Commission believes that an outright ban would both lack environmental justification and would conflict with the Treaty."
"Further, the Commission believes that it is essential that the horizontal definitions of recovery and disposal operations as established in the Waste Framework Directive are adhered to within this regulation."
"Establishing different definitions would be both inconsistent and unnecessarily complicated."
"This issue of consistency with existing legislation also arises in other amendments."
"Certain amendments to Article 13 aim to establish criteria to classify a treatment as recovery and address the issue of sham recovery."
"In fact, such criteria could be among several deemed relevant for the distinction between recovery and disposal in general, which is a horizontal issue which should be settled in the context of the Waste Framework Directive rather than in the specific context of this regulation."
"Even though the Commission might not entirely disagree with the substance of the proposed clarifications, there is a strong argument for consistency in the lists in the annexes and if changes are required they should, as a first step, be introduced at their point of origin."
"Another element regarding Annex V, namely that of giving priority to the EU hazardous list above the Basel non-hazardous list in relation to the so-called Basel ban on exports of hazardous waste from OECD to non-OECD countries, can be supported – Amendments 69 and 70."
"Let me just make a brief comment on the question of the double legal basis."
"As the explanatory memorandum establishes, the primary objective of the regulation is protection of the environment."
"That main objective has been maintained in the new proposal and the legal basis is in Article 175 of the EC Treaty: environment."
"However, as regards the provisions of Titles IV, V and VI on exports out of, imports into and transit through the Community to and from third countries, it can be argued that these are rules which pursue an overall and general environmental objective, as well as rules on international trade."
"Environmental rules, therefore, also apply to the trade regime and are linked to it."
"Therefore, the legal basis as regards the specific provisions in these three titles is Article 133 of the EC Treaty."
"Amendment 95 proposes to allow tacit consent in relation to shipments of hazardous waste for recovery."
"As is also stressed in the explanatory memorandum, this is not acceptable to the Commission."
"Firstly, we have to apply the precautionary approach to shipments of hazardous waste within the Community and, secondly, we have to respect the Basel Convention's requirements in this respect."
"The Basel Convention is very clear and leaves no room for interpretation."
"Written consent for shipments of hazardous waste must be applied."
"The Commission supports the amendments which pursue the same goal as the Commission proposal, namely the promotion of EU standards and certain internationally-agreed guidelines in the country of destination outside the Community."
"The guidelines added to the list – the ILO guidelines on ship-breaking and the OECD guidelines on personal computers – can also be accepted."
"Lastly, with regard to impact assessment, there is none."
"However, the system of notification and information is a well-established one."
"There is no specific impact assessment."
"– Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0354/2003) by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication ‘Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection’ (COM(2002) 179 – C5-0328/2002 – 2002/2172(COS))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following many legislative initiatives, recommendations and studies, the European Commission has promoted a thematic strategy for soil protection."
"The first point of reference – which I believe to be fundamental – is that the soil is a limited source of wealth, the basis of agriculture and production, of food and support for the landscape."
"However, perhaps because the horizon always seems infinite, society finds it difficult to understand and accept that it is a limited resource and we therefore have to protect it like any other resource."
"This document not only deals with the protection of the soil, but also the conservation of the earth and the landscape, it is intended to guarantee the safety and health of citizens and prevent all types of risk."
"I therefore congratulate the Commission on its work."
"It is a well-produced document, the departure point is coherent and it represents many years of work and I believe that work is continuing in this direction."
"Although the text does not have regulatory status – and I would like to stress this – it is a background document which will lead to many actions, directives and recommendations and lays out the key issues which affect the future of the conservation of soils and the landscape."
"It is what we might call the Commission’s invisible lever which it sometimes uses to create thinking and attitudes in relation to problems."
"As a thematic strategy it intends to implement a scientific policy and carry out much more firm, consistent and coherent work than has been done until now."
"It intends to detect the cause-effect relationship, the impacts."
"We also take this approach, we recommend a recognition of the different nature of each soil, of its distinct typology, of the diversity of soils and the application of measures, solutions and methods suited to the site and the characteristics of the location."
"As we have said many times, sustainable development requires a made-to-measure approach and all scientific work has to be appropriate for the reality."
"This means that we are entering a complex area and that the Commission accepts the difficult challenge of implementing a policy on soils which recognises the diversity of each place, each region and each climate."
"What is Parliament contributing?"
"Parliament insists on the need for referenced and official catalogues and it provides the Commission with several mandates so that, as soon as possible, it may provide a model for catalogues which can be produced in all regions and all countries, which is accessible, geodifferentiated, and always in computerised and compatible form."
"These catalogues must include a biography of soils, typologies, structures and other variables as well as the uses, possible risks and historic, landscape or cultural values, highlighting the risks of any nature."
"I would urge the Commission to develop the draft INSPIRE Directive for the establishment of an infrastructure for a European area of information, which is essential as an instrument for developing these areas and which, at the time, was approved by three Directorate-Generals."
"I would recommend much more precise research in certain fields."
"We insist on the need to exchange information and research on the use of agriculture."
"There are many forms of agriculture, and most of them are beneficial to the soil, to its conservation, to prevent erosion, to the maintenance of organic material."
"I believe the time has come to put an end, scientifically, to the common belief that agriculture is bad for the soil."
"There are many good forms of agriculture and we must identify them and support them, especially if we want to introduce this issue into the CAP."
"Research programmes are recommended which offer solutions and not just diagnoses and classifications, as has been the case until now."
"I would like to focus on two issues, which are innovative: the commitment to studying the desertification and the relationship with the variables which cause it, such as climate change."
"I believe that Parliament must continue to insist on relating water to desertification, the problems of the aquifers, the need to provide new resources, the need to look after these climatic spaces and the advance of the desert."
"With regard to sealing relating to territorial plans, I would say that although soil sealing and the advance of urbanisation – which in many cases is excessive and uncontrolled – and the loss of soil we are experiencing – which is sometimes dramatic in certain places – is a subsidiary issue, the Commission must, in this case, show new leadership, use these invisible levers which it exercises in certain fields, presenting proposals for good practices."
"It must insist that there can be no possible conservation of soil unless we include it in land management."
"All good plans and all management plans must include a catalogue of soils and an assessment of them, because that is the only way to prevent floods, to prevent building in storm drains and in Habitat or Natura areas."
"And in this regard we will support the Commission."
"It is necessary to implement a soil policy which can really deal with the issue of regional support and support from the States."
". – Mr President, I thank the European Parliament and, in particular, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, for the preparation of this report."
"With this, the consultation process on the first phase of the soil thematic strategy will be concluded."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's broad support for the general approach, main objectives and deliverables presented in the communication."
"This includes the development of a communication on major soil degradation issues such as erosion, contamination and organic matter, as well as a proposal for a soil monitoring directive."
"The European Parliament recognises the Community dimension for many of the soil degradation processes Europe is faced with."
"Parliament underlines that soil degradation processes are progressive and often go unnoticed, sometimes for many decades."
"This distinguishes soil from other environmental components and goes some way towards explaining why air and water policies were developed earlier."
"The Commission shares the view that any approach to soil protection must take account of the considerable diversity of regional and local conditions that exist across Europe."
"The European strategy for soil protection does not mean a standardised, one-size-fits-all approach."
"The Commission fully agrees that it is vital to apply an integrated approach to soil, based on sustainable development."
"The multifunctional and cross-sectoral approach to soil is of primary importance."
"The economic and social implications of soil degradation are therefore an integral part of the soil thematic strategy."
"The numerous detailed comments, requests and additional proposals contained in Parliament's resolution will be fully taken into account in the future development of the soil thematic strategy."
"In this context the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the knowledge-based approach."
"The Commission will examine the detailed proposals for a soil catalogue, soil mapping and zoning, which should be geared to solving specific soil degradation problems."
"We also recognise that it is necessary to gain greater understanding of soil biodiversity, the nutrient and water cycles and the issues related to the use of compost."
"The Commission welcomes the important role attributed to agriculture and forestry in revitalising soil – in particular, the call to make cross-compliance compulsory for all payments under the common agricultural policy; the integration of specific measures for soil and water protection into the CAP; the localised diagnosis of the impacts of CAP reform on soil health; and the definition of patterns of agriculture and forestry, in line with soil characteristics."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's request to bring land use into line with soil characteristics, to integrate soil protection objectives into spatial planning strategies, to prevent the indiscriminate sealing of land and to prevent the bisection of ecosystems, waterflows and landscapes by road and urban infrastructures."
"The Commission recognises the need to develop more leadership in Europe in the area of spatial planning."
"The Commission fully subscribes to the role attributed to soil protection in the context of major processes such as biodiversity decline, climate change, desertification, coastal erosion and forest fires."
"The Commission recognises, in particular, the need for additional action to combat desertification in Europe and will consider Parliament's urgent call for an immediate communication and Community action programme on desertification."
"In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament's resolution as an important input to our work."
"We can now further direct our work on the development of the next stage on the soil strategy."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, as human beings, are extremely dependent on water and air, but also on the soil."
"We live on it and we live off it, we travel over it, we wonder at its beauty: reason enough to treat the soil with care."
"As a Member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to discuss a number of aspects of that care."
"Firstly, it is good to establish that the soil has a less international nature than air or water, which are always moving."
"Although the Member States have similar problems with their soil to a certain extent, the cause varies."
"With this in mind, there is reason to fear that a centralised approach will not have the desired result for all the Member States."
"A European approach must therefore emphasise the exchange of information, knowledge and best practices."
"It is not clear to me from the present text of the communication whether the Commission has actually even chosen this direction."
"Secondly, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines rightly points out the adverse consequences of transport for the soil."
"Soil compaction and sealing are major adverse effects that infrastructure has on the soil, with consequences for the viability and condition of that soil."
"Those effects must therefore be minimised and the strain on the soil thus reduced."
"The promotion of modes of transport that have less or no impact on the soil, such as inland water and coastal water transport, presents an opportunity for doing this, as does the use of less harmful materials in the construction of infrastructure."
"Finally, the Community should also assert its influence directly in the construction of infrastructure by incorporating the interests of the soil into projects in which the Community is investing."
"We are satisfied with the present text as regards the specific transport aspects."
"Unfortunately, a lack of clarity remains regarding the level of the general protection of the soil and the form this should take."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, for her report."
"It has already been pointed out that this is a very important issue: soil is a vital component for our existence."
"Regarding coastal erosion, I was rapporteur in this Parliament some time ago on coastal zone management."
"The issue of land use was outside the scope of that report."
"However, in relation to coastal erosion, a number of elements need to be taken into account, particularly in relation to developments that take place along our coasts."
"Some coastal erosion is related to nature and is thus outside our control, but quite a lot of coastal erosion is a result of irresponsible planning and development."
"Inland erosion and desertification again come down to the use of our land."
"The issue of over-grazing in Ireland has caused a major problem in relation to soil erosion in the west of Ireland and also in some other places."
"Forestry is an issue which has caused major problems in relation to soil erosion throughout the European Union, particularly in the southern part of Europe."
"These are things that can easily be solved by looking at the way we use land."
"In relation to farming, we need to look at the long-term consequences of the kinds of chemicals – such as pesticides and herbicides – used in the soil."
"As the last speaker said, soil is vital not just in terms of beauty and aesthetic value, but also in terms of our survival, the survival of farming communities, and even the survival of those that to a certain extent have contributed to the major problem in relation to soil."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission for focusing on this issue, because like water and other issues, it is extremely important."
"Mr President, this draft directive raises several problems."
"Indeed, several European policies as well as several directives, such as the IV water directive or the sixth environmental programme, deal with soil protection."
"A similar issue appears in the Forest-Focus programme."
"A whole range of projects and directives on environmental responsibility also address this issue."
"What is the point, furthermore, of defining soil at European level, of drawing up a scientific soil catalogue by 2007 with harmonisation of scientific data on soil, other than to note their diversity, which is already known?"
"What is, moreover, the point of making a diagnosis on the impact of CAP reform when it has been adopted?"
"In our opinion, a simple recommendation would suffice and would avoid once again penalising the farmers that are already severely affected by CAP reform."
"Let us simplify and rationalise the current texts, and let us finally align European subsidies with the objective that we have followed, by encouraging techniques that are favourable to soil protection and to preserving the wild fauna, such as non-labour and direct sowing techniques."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0365/2003) by Mr Lisi, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (PE-CONS 3665/2003 – C5-0435/2003 – 2001/0257(COD))."
". Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, to begin with, I would like to refer briefly to the legislative history of this measure."
"The tragic accidents that have affected the chemical industry in recent years and, above all, the people living near these sites and the surrounding area could only attract the European Union’s attention."
"Areas such as Baia Mare, Aznalcollar and, above all, Toulouse and Enschede, have become synonymous with environmental human tragedies, to which we have to respond clearly."
"It is in this sensitive context that the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/82 of December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances."
"This proposal was the product of in-depth scientific work and we are pleased to acknowledge the Commission’s desire to tackle the shortcomings of the previous directive with a constructive mindset that has enabled us all to send a clear message to both the chemical industry and the people."
"We will make every effort to ensure that, in future, adequate control measures are adopted and respected."
"At first reading I, together with other Members, explained the reasons why this strong signal is needed from the European Parliament, and, together, we adopted an approach, which we confirm today, of ensuring that the accidents which have occurred to date do not happen again, guaranteeing protection for the citizens and the workers at these plants and providing substantial protection for the surrounding area."
"As you are aware, the Council achieved a common position which incorporated the essence of many of Parliament’s concerns."
"It is true that, after this second reading, there are still some grey areas, although I believe they have been clarified by the conciliation that we carried out which is now awaiting Parliament’s approval."
"I will mention briefly the main points on which the Conciliation Committee reached a compromise: the first concerns mining activities."
"The compromise that we reached seeks to guarantee complimentarity between the directive in question and the Directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries, which is at its first reading in Parliament."
"The scope of the ‘Seveso directive’ is thus extended to operational tailings disposal facilities when used in connection with the processing of minerals."
"As regards training of staff, in this sector we insisted from the outset on the importance of adequate training of staff in the prevention and management of possible accidents."
"This idea was confirmed in the Conciliation Committee and Parliament obtained provision for adequate training to be given not only to staff at establishments in question but also to sub-contracted staff at these establishments."
"As regards a third aspect, maps showing risk areas, Parliament has repeatedly called for provision for illustrated maps to inform the public concerned of risk areas and the extent of the risk, as it believes that this is a simple, clear means of informing all those who could be affected of the potential risk in the event of an accident."
"An agreement was reached in the Conciliation Committee which provides for these maps or images – equivalent representations – to be included in safety reports and to be made available to the public."
"My penultimate point concerns potassium nitrate."
"Specifications and new thresholds for potassium nitrate, proposed by Parliament, were adopted by the Council in the Conciliation Committee."
"This amendment will prevent farmers using a type of potassium nitrate that is not classified as a fuel from being unduly listed as being subject to the security measures provided for in this directive."
"The last point regards the database for land-use planning."
"The compromise reached in the Conciliation Committee regarding a database for risk data and risk scenarios – a database which seeks to assess the compatibility of industrial sites with sensitive areas – calls on the Commission to draw up the necessary guidelines for the creation of such a database within three years, whilst, at the same time, preserving the necessary subsidiarity in the face of the diversity of situations."
"I will end, Mr President, by thanking the Commission and the Members."
"I feel that we have reached a satisfactory agreement together which takes into consideration all the demands that were expressed, especially the main objective that I mentioned at the beginning, the need to send our fellow citizens a clear message."
"Lastly, a technical note: Mr President, in Annex I (I) in particular points 5 and 6, there are definitions that could give rise to ambiguity."
"I would ask you to note that the correct version is the English version."
"– The situation is rather complicated and so your statement will need to be repeated tomorrow, before the vote."
". – Mr President, the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided not only to broaden the scope of the Seveso II Directive in the light of the accidents in Baia Mare, Enschede and Toulouse, but also to strengthen its provisions."
"The new directive now covers chemical and thermal processing operations in mining as well as all operational tailings disposal facilities containing dangerous mining waste."
"Furthermore, its scope was tightened with regard to explosive and pyrotechnic substances as well as ammonium nitrate."
"Taking into account the results of two studies carried out by the Commission, the directive also includes more carcinogenic substances, and the qualifying quantities for substances toxic to the aquatic environment have been significantly decreased."
"Moreover, and particularly due to requests by the European Parliament, the directive has now been strengthened in a number of other areas such as information for the public, training for emergencies and the involvement of subcontracted personnel."
"Its provisions on land-use planning were reinforced, including a mandate for the Commission to develop a European database to be used for assessing the compatibility between Seveso establishments and sensitive areas."
"The new directive now also obliges industrial operators to produce risk maps showing areas that might be affected by a major accidents."
"Last, but not least, Member States are required to provide the Commission with minimum data on all Seveso sites on their territory."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Lisi, the rapporteur, on his work, as well as all Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this legislative process."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Lisi for the excellent work that he carried out on this subject, which is so sensitive."
"As Member for Toulouse, I can tell you, how much, two years after the event, the tragedy of the explosion at the AZF factory remains extraordinarily present in the town, in the minds and often even in the flesh of the victims of the disaster."
"Together with the mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste-Blazy, we had to act quickly and provide local solutions in light of this tragedy."
"If we do not want this tragedy to happen again in the future then more needs to be done and legislation is needed."
"This is what our institution did in taking up this issue as of 3 October 2001."
"In this regard, I particularly welcome the fact that the constructive collaboration between the Commission, the Council and Parliament enabled a consensus to emerge from the second reading on the issue of ammonium nitrates and that, from then on, in potentially hazardous factories, the thresholds for authorised nitrates were raised to a level so that they would perhaps have been able to avoid the Toulouse explosion."
"In several areas, the work carried out at third reading and in conciliation provides for new steps forward with new precautionary measures, and in our legislative action we did of course bear in mind security of employees working in potentially hazardous factories."
"Training measures designed for these people are therefore necessary and even essential. As Mr Lisi said, however, they should not be limited to workers in potentially hazardous factories; they should be extended to sub-contracted employees."
"Extending training for their benefit does not seem to me in any way a pernickety measure thought up by bureaucrats, but on the contrary, a protective measure."
"I welcome the outcome that was achieved in the Conciliation Committee on this point."
"It is also our duty to respond to the legitimate concern of the people to be better informed on these issues."
"The industrialists concerned must, on their own initiative, move towards greater transparency of their actions."
"To a certain extent, the European Parliament wanted to contribute to informing the public more by producing a map showing risk areas."
"This is a step forward, but still people need to be informed, on the ground, of the existence and accessibility of these security documents."
"Mr President, of course I am aware, as are the people of Toulouse, of the fact that this report does not give absolute protection against industrial accidents."
"Absolute protection cannot exist, by definition, but I am also completely sure that this House, in taking up this issue quickly and in providing greater protection rules, will have proven how much Europe can respond when it has to, to the immediate concerns of our citizens and this is why I would like to thank you."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0386/2003) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 (COM(2002) 729 – C5-0027/2003 – 2002/0297(CNS))."
". – Mr President, the Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 FMD crisis."
"In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should submit, as quickly as possible, a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats."
"According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an ear-tag or a tattoo linked to the holding."
"The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings."
"The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double ear-tagging to ensure that identity is retained where one ear-tag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document."
"Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases."
"The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, allowing for the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of disease."
"Furthermore, it will facilitate accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community."
"The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied in practice."
"This is supported by the results of the Commission’s large-scale pilot project – the IDEA Project."
"However, the implementing measures required for a fully-functioning system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be developed."
"The proposal, therefore, provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006."
"I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States."
"The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions in free range, and to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to 6 months of age, intended for direct slaughter."
"The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to farmers of introducing the new system."
"The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States."
"In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems."
"On this basis the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between 1 euro (for traditional ear-tags) and 3.7 euro (electronic identification) per sheep per year."
"The proposal foresees that the Commission shall, if necessary, submit to the Council a report on the experience gained concerning electronic identification."
"This report could be accompanied by proposals amending, if appropriate, the date by which electronic identification should become obligatory."
"I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities, but these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary."
". Mr President, there is complete agreement among the Council, the Commission and Parliament that we need to improve the traceability of sheep and goats."
"This was the clear conclusion of the experience derived from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease."
"There is also agreement that the eventual aim should be a cost-effective electronic identification system."
"The proposals from the Commission, which are the subject of this report, bridge the gap between present practice and the agreement to introduce electronic methods."
"The proposals envisage a complicated control system based on individual identification numbers and the recording of all these numbers when sheep and goats are moved."
"The proposals would certainly achieve the objective."
"Regrettably, they do not take into account the differing methods of sheep and goat rearing in the Member States: the difference in farming conditions from mountainous regions to lowland pasture or the differing sizes of sheep and goat herds, which can vary from a handful to thousands."
"They fail to take into account the differing numbers in the Member States, which can range from a few hundred thousand to millions."
"More seriously, the proposals would impose an impossibly costly and labour-intensive recording system where sheep numbers are large."
"The proposals are based on the current passport method which is used to trace the movement of cattle but, sadly, ignore the differences between cattle and sheep."
"The proposals fail to take into account cultural differences which, in other circumstances, we would be seeking to encourage."
"If the proposals were to be implemented they would threaten the future of sheep rearing in Europe as we know it."
"I suppose that getting rid of sheep is a sure way of getting rid of disease."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development simply asks, in this report, that the differing factors should be taken into account."
"Primarily, the committee unanimously wants batch control systems to be allowed as well as individual control, and for the Member States to be able to apply both systems according to circumstances."
"Batch systems can work."
"They do so now for pigs, though I would not claim that there is no difference between sheep and pigs."
"The committee amendments – which the Commissioner managed not to refer to – make detailed and effective rules for both systems of traceability."
"Common sense and economics should dictate which is used."
"Regrettably, Commissioner Byrne does not seem to have been listening to what has been going on in the Committee on Agriculture."
"I would like to end by quoting Commissioner Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, who recently said: 'We want farmers to spend the bulk of their working days in the fields and not filling out forms.'"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for the very good job he has done on this report, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for bringing forward a very practical report."
"That is the key to the whole thing because, as Mr Adam has said, we very much want to be able to trace sheep movements."
"However, we have to realise that in the UK alone there are 35 million sheep and there are probably up to 100 million individual movements of sheep."
"The idea that every sheep could be recorded with a 14-digit number when it is being moved is completely ridiculous."
"Let me take you through a scenario."
"A thousand ewes with 1 200 lambs are taken to the hillside."
"Six months later those sheep return and some of them have lost their tags."
"The Commission still insists that they should have the same individual number."
"I say to Commissioner Byrne quite clearly – and I am sure he realises this because he is an intelligent man – that the idea that the lamb will have the same tag is absolutely ridiculous."
"We have to realise that if you make the law an ass, it will be seen as an ass and we must be very careful to bring in legislation that is practical."
"Our committee has voted for batch movements of sheep and it is clear that if those batches are moved you will be able to trace where they have been."
"If there is a problem with scrapie in sheep then the whole flock will be slaughtered, so individual numbers are not necessary."
"Provided that the holding number is on the tag, that is all that is needed."
"As we move forward into electronic systems, we have to be absolutely sure of the cost to the industry of introducing this."
"We also need a system that will be practical."
"I have seen systems demonstrated in hotel rooms, but they have to be demonstrated on the hillside in pouring rain, to farmers and shepherds who can easily deal with that system."
"All of these things have to be practical, because we need the sheep and lamb industry."
"I recently visited New Zealand, which has a lot of sheep."
"Sheep are necessary to the European Union, and we must be careful not to price ourselves out of that industry."
"I would urge the Commission to look at our report practically and wake up to the idea that we have got it right."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his work."
"He has produced a wonderful report and, throughout its production, he has shown great skill in introducing all those aspects which could improve it and make it more flexible."
"As has already been said in this debate, the identification and traceability of goats is an essential element in the control of animal health and, also, of course, food safety."
"The problems of identification in this type of livestock are very significant; the movement of livestock which can take place within one year, which has an enormous influence on the problems of traceability, or the way in which the lives of this type of livestock are spent, which hinders adequate registration and identification by means of the current systems."
"We therefore believe that it is very important to establish a sufficiently long transitional period during which we can adopt flexible measures in order to reach a date, naturally, when the electronic identification becomes obligatory for all the countries of the European Union."
"It is very important that we understand that the additional cost of an electronic identification system must not be an additional cost which solely and exclusively falls to breeders, but which must be taken on by society as a whole, since it is society which will benefit from the implementation of such a system of traceability and identification as ambitious as the one being proposed to us."
"Mr President, the original Commission proposal may just be possible in the context of the small number of sheep or goats kept in an enclosed field, although even here there are concerns in relation to animal welfare."
"By contrast, the Adam report recognises the practicalities of hill farming and of managing flocks on a large scale."
"It also recognises, as the beef labelling regulation failed to do, that the requirements of traceability for the purposes of disease control are different from those involved in providing information for consumers."
"The possibilities of using individual and/or batch identification, the simplification of coding and alternatives to double tagging, as proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, are all very welcome."
"Although I would prefer not to have had any date specified for the introduction of electronic tagging, I am glad that the committee has recommended a year's postponement and a real cost-benefit analysis, as well as calling for the EU – not farmers – to bear the financial burden involved."
"Trials of the equipment to be used will also be of major importance."
"Can the chosen identifier be securely and safely located as far as the animal is concerned?"
"Will both placing the identifier and using the electronic reader be feasible on difficult terrain and in adverse weather?"
"Will the reader be robust enough to withstand these conditions?"
"These are issues on which farmers are rightly looking for reassurance."
"I hope it will be afforded to them."
"I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and on the fact that it received the unanimous support of the Agriculture Committee."
"I hope for a similar outcome in tomorrow's vote."
"I join colleagues in urging the Commission to accede to our views."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Adam, who has worked very hard on this report."
"From our initial Committee discussions it was evident that these proposals had been drafted with little, if any, appreciation or understanding of the sheep farming industry."
"Many of the Members who have visited sheep farms, or who are indeed farmers themselves, have become increasingly exasperated by the Commission's blind approach in this regard."
"I have been visited in Strasbourg this week by a group of farmers from Wales who would be happy, if they were allowed, to bring sheep with ear-tags into the Chamber to give the officials an idea of the impracticality of what is being proposed."
"Like me, they want to improve traceability in this sector to avoid any future spread of disease, but this must be achieved in a realistic way."
"In Wales, which has the highest concentration of sheep in the EU, you could not realistically at present expect to convince a traditional hill farmer, with an average age of 58 and an average annual income of EUR 10 000, of the benefits of investing in new and complicated technology, the set-up costs for which have been estimated at EUR 15 000."
"I urge the Commission to take on board the report's major recommendations, to come back with a comprehensive cost analysis for these proposals and to acknowledge the effectiveness of recording batch movements of sheep until such time as electronic identification becomes a viable and practical proposition."
"– Someone applauded in the public gallery."
"I would remind you once again that visitors in the gallery are always welcome, but they cannot intervene in any way, either to express agreement or to express disagreement."
"Mr President, since Europe has such large numbers of sheep and goats it is necessary to introduce an efficient system for the identification of animals, which, at the same time, does not impose an administrative burden on producers."
"The IDEA project, implemented a few years ago by the European Commission, demonstrated that it is possible to implement an individual electronic identification system in the European Union."
"The proof that the system is viable can be found in the fact that Spain, a country which, together with the United Kingdom, has one of the most significant herds in the European Union, has just gone ahead with the purchase of a million devices which are placed in the digestive system of ruminants for the differentiation of the different genotypes of sheep and goats."
"Following the foot and mouth crisis, which decimated the United Kingdom's cattle stocks, it is urgent that we implement an individual identification system like the one which is being discussed, in order to try to prevent the recurrence of this type of veterinary epidemic."
"As a former chairperson of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament because we have been able to achieve compromise positions in the report approved in the Committee on Agriculture."
"I would like to point out that, at the end of the work carried out by the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, the European Parliament expressed its support for individual identification, a position which was taken up by the European Commission."
"The report we will vote on tomorrow contains two compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which respect the interests of the European Union's producers."
"One of them relates to the age from which the identification of animals must be carried out."
"According to the compromise achieved, this is six months for intensive breeding and nine in the case of extensive breeding."
"The second compromise amendment, presented by the rapporteur, sets the date of July 2007 for the introduction of electronic identification, which sends a clear message to both breeders and the industry manufacturing the devices necessary for the electronic system."
"I therefore hope that the results achieved in the Committee on Agriculture are fully adopted in plenary."
"However, I would like to express my support for the technical modifications introduced by our shadow rapporteur, in the only amendment which has been presented in plenary, relating to the document on the transport of animals."
"I would also like to end by congratulating the rapporteur, who has made the effort to achieve compromise and to work in favour of identification and therefore in favour of cattle breeding."
"Congratulations, Mr Adam."
"Mr President, yesterday I had the great honour of sharing a platform with the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, when we both addressed the CBI national conference in the United Kingdom."
"Mr Cox referred to the real concerns that exist in the UK, by saying that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are now committed to the concepts of developing subsidiarity and no disproportionate regulation."
"If that were so, we would have to look at these proposals within that context."
"Nobody challenges the need for better identification, but the truth of the matter is that the UK Government itself has calculated that the cost of introducing this system in the UK will be just short of GBP 100 million, a cost of between GBP 13 000 and GBP 16 000 per farmer."
"We heard from Commissioner Byrne that the EU has made its own estimate."
"I have more faith in the calculation of the UK Government than I have in the calculation of the EU authorities."
"The fact of the matter is that the committee has been unanimous in its view."
"The speeches that we will hear this evening will be unanimous in their view."
"They will be in favour of better identification but also of proceeding by way of practicality, flexibility, looking at operating different methods within Member States, and of having identification – certainly within the United Kingdom – on the basis of batch control numbers."
"I say to the Commissioner that there is unanimity across this Parliament, from Mr Wyn, my political opponent in Wales, to Mrs Attwooll, who is from another party in the United Kingdom and Mr Adam, from the Labour Party."
"We are all unanimous in this view."
"It is a view that the Commission should take on board."
"So far, I have not been terribly encouraged by the stance adopted by the Commission."
"Mr Adam has done a great deal to achieve unanimity, and I congratulate him on that, as other speakers have done."
"We have the facility of trying to persuade Mr Adam, if there is no movement on the part of the Commission, to consider having this report referred back to committee."
"I hope the Commissioner will be in a position to respond positively to the amendments that have been proposed by the committee."
"However, if the Commission simply closes the door on us, then I for one will be among those who seek to persuade Mr Adam tomorrow to ask for this report to be referred back to committee so that we can stress to the Commission that it must be a listening Commission – not just when people appear before the CBI in the United Kingdom but also with regard to the daily work we do at Parliament."
"Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an exceptionally good job."
"I have known Mr Adam for over 14 years and he did not deserve this – he deserved better."
"He has done a tremendous job on what was a terrible proposal in the first instance."
"The truth is that this will not work at ground level."
"I am totally in favour of what has been said about batch or flock identification."
"That will work, can work and is controllable."
"Anything other than that is totally irrelevant at this stage."
"I will be totally in favour of electronic tagging, when we have the technology and when it is cheap enough."
"However, it has to be clearly assumed that that is something for the future."
"The Commissioner has to take on board one other very important point: the question of who pays, because sheep farmers cannot afford this."
"They have been battered for far too long."
"They are surviving in atrocious conditions to provide lamb for consumption in the European Union."
"To put this burden on them is totally unacceptable and for the producer it is unworkable."
"I have a lot of respect for the Commissioner, but I have to say to him that it would be extremely helpful if his officials could put forward proposals after getting out of their glass ivory towers in Brussels and going to see the conditions people actually have to work and live in."
"Do you know what it is like at lambing time?"
"Has anyone got a clue what it is like to lamb a flock of sheep day and night?"
"Many farmers do not even sleep for days."
"This does nothing for the industry."
"We are over-regulating the industry; we are strangling agriculture by our regulations."
"At the same time, I am told that in the United Kingdom, if you buy a chicken sandwich, 85% of the chicken comes from Brazil or Thailand."
"Where is it traceable to?"
"How can there be traceability there?"
"The agricultural industry cannot take any more of this."
"I urge the Commissioner to reflect on what has been said here tonight."
"This is sincere and from the heart."
"This is the people talking."
"I urge you to reflect and agree with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and give us more time to get a proper identification system that will work."
"Mr President, the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 graphically and horrifically underlined the inadequacy of Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals, including sheep and goats."
"Therefore I broadly welcome proposals for a regulation reinforcing the provisions of that directive."
"I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, Neil Parish, for the excellent and cooperative work they have done to bring us to this point."
"I fully support the position adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposals before us."
"In theory all Member States favour an individual identification system, but there are two camps."
"Firstly those countries generally in favour of the proposals which, apart from France, tend to be the states with lower sheep numbers, including Ireland, and secondly those which maintain it would be completely impractical and too costly to implement an individual system in advance of electronic identification."
"This latter group includes Spain, Portugal, Greece and very definitely the UK, where there are huge numbers of sheep and geographical factors amplify the considerable concerns of the sheep industry."
"The Council presidency has now presented a compromise on the original proposals, which would drop all recording of individual sheep numbers until such a time as an electronic recording system is in place, and secondly would introduce compulsory electronic identification for sheep and goats from 1 January 2008, subject to a Commission report on implementation by June 2006."
"Thirdly, it would allow a derogation from compulsory electronic identification for Member States with flocks of less than five hundred thousand."
"The official Irish position, ironically, is that we are in favour of individual identification on a manual basis because we introduced such a system in June 2001."
"We are normally the ones making justified complaints, and now I fully support my UK and Spanish colleagues and the case they are making on their particular circumstances."
"However, in Ireland we are not in favour of the double tagging proposed, because this would result in a higher workload for flock owners and significantly increase the associated costs, such as tag replacement, without adding any value to our current system."
"At the moment in Ireland, a permanent sheep tag costs 30 cents."
"Two such tags would be 60 cents, before taking labour costs into account, plus the replacement rate, which by definition is very high in sheep because of their grazing habits."
"We have already been through the pain barrier and currently have an individual identification system in place."
"That gives us full traceability of sheep on an individual basis from the farm of origin to carcass."
"This system was introduced to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control and is at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety."
"Most importantly for us in Ireland, it gives us a considerable advantage in relation to the export market."
"We do not want to go backwards and replace our current system – that is the official line, speak to the farmers if you want to hear what they have to say – with what amounts to no more than a flock identification system that will not give full traceability."
"The compromise system would not allow the movements of an individual sheep to be traced."
"It would not provide any basis for scrapie control or genotyping, which has to be based on individual identification."
"At this stage, Ireland is seeking an accommodation within the proposal to retain certain aspects of its current individual identification system pending the introduction of a compulsory electronic system."
"As colleagues have said, let us harmonise the objective but not necessarily the methodology."
"The long-term objective should be a cost-effective electronic identification system."
"In the meantime, there should be batch numbers for those countries who want them and individual tag numbers for other countries, like Ireland, depending on the scale of operations and the geographical factors involved."
"– This has been the most impassioned debate of the evening."
"Commissioner, did you close the door in someone’s face?"
"I think that everyone is awaiting your reply."
". – Mr President, I have taken careful note of the various arguments made and I appreciate the efforts put into this, especially by Mr Adam, to contribute to the overall goal of reinforcing the system of identification and registration of sheep and goats in the Community."
"I have sympathy with the farmers' situation, but I should like to remind the House – as Mrs Doyle did – of the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, which proved that individual identification was necessary."
"Mention has been made of the costs involved in this."
"Advice I have received regarding the estimates given by one Member State points out that these costs are not accurate."
"The costs we have put forward are much closer to the likely outcome of the situation."
"The Commission can agree to Amendment 3 with regard to the stage of development of electronic identification, but the Commission cannot agree to Amendment 3 with regard to the introduction of electronic identification on a voluntary basis."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 17, 18 and 23 with regard to the postponement of the entry into force of the reinforced system until 1 July 2005."
"In view of the evolution of the discussion in Council, the Commission could agree to Amendment 17, with regard to deferring the age of tagging in general until 6 months."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 6 and 27, on the submission of a report on the experience gained with regard to the implementation of electronic identification."
"However, the Commission cannot agree to submit a new legislative proposal with a view to the general introduction of electronic identification on 1 July 2007."
"Neither can the Commission undertake field trials as foreseen by Amendment 21."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 4 and 7 concerning the role of the Joint Research Centre."
"However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 1 or 2, as reliable registration cannot be achieved through electronic identification only."
"The Commission can agree to the linguistic Amendment 12. However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendment 28, as this issue is covered by general rules."
"The Commission can agree to Amendment 14, as the responsibilities of the transporter shall include the assurance that animals are properly identified and registered."
"The Commission can also agree to Amendments 20 and 32, as regards the provisions of the mark, but the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 19, 31, 32 or 33, as animals shall keep the same identification code when means of identification are replaced so as to ensure traceability."
"The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 30 and 32, by which animals shall be identified by an eartag or a tattoo in one ear only."
"The double tagging is essential to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost."
"The second eartag can be replaced by an electronic identifier."
"The Commission can agree to Amendment 34, accepting that eartags may be made of metal or plastic and may consist of one or two parts, taking into account approval by the competent authority."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 25, 26, 39 and 40."
"However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 22 or 24, as the competent authority shall establish the database including the procedures for submission of data."
"The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 35, 36, 38 or 41 with regard to batch-recording as the general system."
"Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases."
"Therefore, a general system based on batch-recording is not acceptable."
"Batch-recording does not achieve the results that are required by this proposal, bearing in mind that the batch may well be broken up again and again, in which case traceability becomes quite impossible."
"This is something that many people in the House will remember when we recollect the difficulties that were presented to the authorities in a number of Member States, including, in particular, the UK, in seeking to achieve good traceability at the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease crisis, where three weeks passed before there was effective identification in some cases."
"That was in a context, as far as I am aware, where 19 farms were infected by the disease from the time of the announcement of the movement order restriction to the implementation of that movement order restriction: only a matter of hours, not weeks."
"The Commission cannot agree to Amendments, 5, 13 or 29, as Community financing is not foreseen."
"I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities, but I shall stress that these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary."
"For full clarity and transparency I will circulate a succinct table of the Commission's position in respect of each of these amendments to facilitate matters for you in the vote tomorrow(1)."
". Mr President, it is unacceptable that the Commission has two opportunities to speak and the rapporteur only one."
"However, it must be said that despite all the rigmarole of what the Commission would or would not agree to, the fact emerges that the Commission is not prepared to budge at all on the question of batch control."
"I take it that is the Commission's position."
"As far as the fundamentals of this report are concerned, the Commission has not moved an inch."
"That is what we will have to consider when we vote tomorrow."
"– Each group and each Member will, of course, consider how to act in the vote carefully."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.(2)"
". – General electronic tagging of sheep and goats is a modern system which will basically consist of permanently identifying each small animal so that they can be recognised, wherever they are, and their health can be monitored without any doubts."
"However, this sort of marking, without Community funding, will place a great financial burden on sheep and goat farmers."
"Especially in Greece, where sheep and goat farming employs the farmer's whole family, day and night, 365 days a year, with no Christmas or Easter break and with an unacceptably low financial result in relation to the effort made and the capital invested, such an unreasonable and unfair financial burden would force numerous farmers to abandon their work and the countryside and would tragically reduce the animal stock."
"At the same time, handicrafts which only make cheese from ewe's and goat's milk would close, with the result that unemployed cheese-makers would join the unemployed farmers, reducing the production of unique Greek cheeses based on ewe's and goat's milk such as feta."
"Bold Community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this."
"At the same time, however, the general introduction of electronic tagging of sheep and goats by 1 July 2006 is considered very rushed for Greece, where there are more sheep and goats than in the other fourteen Member States together, which is why this deadline should be extended by at least a year."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 20, 25, 26, 34 and 40."
"The Commission can accept the following amendments as part of the compromise package: 3(1), 6, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 32(2), 37 and 39."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3(2), 5, 13, 14, 19, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32(1), 33, 35, 36, 38 or 41."
"Mr President, I have learned from Guatemala that Ricardo de León Regil, the candidate for the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, was brutally murdered on 16th of the month."
"Ricardo de León Regil was a doctor whose work was widely recognised and valued."
"He was a victim of the violent situation which developed in Guatemala in the past and which is becoming more acute now that the election process is under way."
"The people of Guatemala, like other peoples in Latin America, have been tragically tried by foreign intervention and exploitation by the local oligarchy."
"The people of Guatemala have been forced to follow the path of armed struggle in order to defend their fundamental rights."
"Their hard fight led to the peace process and the government which emerged promised to promote certain reforms."
"Six years later, not only have these reforms not been promoted, but poverty rules, while the leaders of the people are being murdered by paramilitaries who go unpunished."
"Together with my condemnation, I should like to ask you to approach the Guatemalan authorities so that this heinous crime is fully investigated."
"I am certainly pleased to do that on behalf of the House, Mr Alyssandrakis."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to speak about the internal organisation of Parliament."
"I asked for access to these buildings for a , a person who is working with me on a voluntary basis, and the request was refused."
"The reason I was given was that only accredited assistants are allowed access to the Strasbourg buildings outside part-sessions."
"I feel this is a particularly absurd decision, Mr President."
"The fact that we have two places of work is already absurd; for the Strasbourg site then to be completely closed to any possibility of work outside part-sessions for people who are not necessarily European Union employees, people officially registered as assistants, seems to me to be excessively bureaucratic."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to do something about this kind of rule which has been established and get it changed."
"Mr Cappato, it is probably too early in the morning to start me on the subject of the two places of work, but concerning the specific request you make, I will ask the services today to make contact with you to try to examine the details of the case."
"In consultation with you, we will endeavour to come to an appropriate solution that complies with the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements – progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference including budgetary aspects."
"I should like to inform colleagues in the House that over the past several weeks I have been making intensive political visits to a number of the capital cities of the countries whose Finance Ministers, at Ecofin, had sought to enter through the back door and remove from Parliament the delicate balance we had negotiated through the Convention."
"This is an area where we, as an institution, need – to borrow a phrase – to 'put down some red lines'."
"This is important for this Parliament, not for corporate reasons."
"It goes to the very heart of the role of parliamentary democracy, of representative democracy and of public accountability."
"The power of the purse has been a key defining issue in the history of parliamentarianism as it has evolved and we cannot countenance in this Parliament any institution by going backwards in the name of European progress for tomorrow."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to return to this House for an exchange of views on the developments that have taken place in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference since my last hearing on 5 November, directly following the IGC Ministerial Meeting of 18 November and just a few days before the Naples Conclave."
"I feel I must begin by reiterating that the overall approach of the Italian Presidency remains that which my government has expressed many times in this House and in the context of the IGC itself."
"We remain convinced that an ambitious agreement which meets the needs and expectations of an enlarged Europe can only be achieved by a text which strays as little as possible from the Convention's draft."
"Periodic meetings with Parliament and with representatives of the national parliaments, as well as requests arriving from various European civil society structures, are confirmation of this conviction."
"Some Member States within the Intergovernmental Conference seem, at times, to want to take a different direction and to be seeking to reopen the debate on many aspects of the Convention’s draft."
"I would, however, like to express a tentatively positive view in this regard."
"For the legitimate purposes of negotiation tactics, some countries are maintaining reserved positions and insist on requesting changes – some of them substantial – to the balance achieved by the Convention."
"Nevertheless, no Member State has called into question the objective – which is also an imperative political need – of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion within the timeframe suggested at Thessaloniki and confirmed at Brussels in October by our Heads of State and Government."
"The very way the IGC is progressing is confirmation, moreover, of the intrinsic value of the Convention’s draft: we have observed, on almost all the points discussed thus far, that a revisionist approach seeking to amend the Convention’s draft text does not lead to consensus on alternative solutions but just widens the gaps between opposing positions."
"It is my opinion, therefore, that, as we enter the final straits of the negotiations, each country will recognise the common benefits of an ambitious constitutionalisation of the integration process, despite the minor, specific sacrifices that some provisions may involve."
"During yesterday's meeting, we debated, in particular, the role of the Union Foreign Minister and the issue of the revision of the Constitutional Treaty, taking note as well of a number of recommendations from the Danish government concerning the protocol relating to the opt-out clauses by which that country benefits with regard to Justice and Home Affairs."
"The first point had already been addressed in previous meetings of the IGC."
"The Presidency decided, therefore, to present a number of specific proposals based on the following principles: preserving the ‘double-hat’ formula devised by the Convention, with the clarification that the independence of the Commission Vice-President/Foreign Minister concerns the aspects associated with their Commission responsibilities and does not concern Council activities (for example, implementation of the common foreign and security policy and the Presidency of the General Affairs and External Relations Council); specifying the implications for the Foreign Minister in the event that the European Parliament were to adopt a motion of censure against the Commission; laying down explicitly that the President of the Commission cannot call for the resignation of the Vice-President/Foreign Minister without the agreement of the European Council; strengthening the provision giving the Vice-President/Foreign Minister the responsibility of ensuring consistency between the CFSP and the Union's external relations."
"The presentationof these points – fully in keeping with the approach defined by the Convention – was welcomed by many Member States."
"Of significance is the fact that the Presidency's proposals are headed in the right direction, including for those delegations hostile to the Convention’s text."
"Clearly, a definitive agreement on the duties of the future Foreign Minister cannot be taken out of the context of the agreement on the overall future institutional framework of the Union."
"This is a matter to which we will return in the context of the Ministerial Conclave of 28-29 November and, subsequently, in the concluding session of the IGC at the level of Heads of State and Government."
"The solution envisaged by the Convention for future revision of the Constitutional Treaty is based on two fundamental principles: the need for unanimous adoption and ratification for the formal revision of all the constitutional provisions, and the existence of , both general and specific, that, in clearly defined sectors, allow voting rules to be changed, to make the transition from unanimous to qualified majority voting, or the legislative procedure to be changed, moving from special to ordinary, which ensures absolute parity between the Council and the European Parliament, subject to the common agreement of all Member States in the European Council, consultation of the European Parliament and prior notification of the national parliaments."
"The Presidency has proposed some adjustments to these mechanisms defined by the Convention, in order both to increase the involvement of the national parliaments in the process of activating the escalator clauses and to confirm the option of making the procedure for revising the Constitutional text less unwieldy with regard to a limited number of specific sections of the third part of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Indeed, as Parliament has rightly pointed out, the procedure laid down by the Convention seems excessively rigid and is in danger of making the enlarged Union incapable of updating its own constitutional regulations even where minor provisions are concerned."
"Yesterday's exchange of views confirmed that positions remain divergent on this point."
"Nevertheless, we must persevere in our efforts to find common ground for an agreement which, taking the Convention as a starting point, reconciles the need for timely, effective involvement of the parliaments, essential for democratic legitimacy in a Union of States and citizens governed by the rule of the law, with the need to prevent rigidity in revision procedures that could impede the future development of a Union which now has a large number of Members."
"In the course of yesterday's meeting, the Danish Foreign Minister drew the Conference's attention to the question of the Protocol governing the participation of Denmark in the Union's Justice and Home Affairs activities."
"Indeed, the new structure of the Constitutional Treaty – which leaves behind the dysfunctional, outdated pillar structure – requires the revision of this Protocol, which was drawn up when judicial cooperation in criminal and police matters was still subject to intergovernmental procedures."
"On the basis of the recommendations of the Danish government, in the next few days, we will draft an updated version of the Protocol that will have to fulfil a number of key requirements: adequate adaptation of the present ‘opt-out’ system to the legal framework that emerges from the Constitutional Treaty; the option for the Danish government to adopt an ‘opt-in’ formula in future on the basis of its own constitutional rules; compatibility of the Protocol with the pursuit of effective Union action in the field of justice and home affairs, to which the Convention text rightly attributed central importance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the eve of the decisive phase of the negotiations underway in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In the forthcoming Naples Conclave, the Presidency will be presenting the text of the draft Constitutional Treaty reviewed by the group led by the Council’s Legal Service with the input of all the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"This impressive legal fine-tuning operation has produced an excellent result, improving the overall editorial quality of the Constitutional text as compared with the content approved by the Convention."
"Again in Naples, the Presidency will submit a comprehensive proposal on the points which are still causing dispute in the constitutional negotiations in an effort to bring the positions of the Member States closer together."
"The basis for this action will, in any case, remain adherence to the Convention’s draft, which may be adapted, supplemented, clarified and elucidated, where necessary, but which can on no account be rewritten."
"I would like to stress here, on behalf of my government, our determination to avoid watered-down compromises and to seek high-minded, noble solutions which are worthy of the democratic, open and transparent dialogue which took place in the Convention."
"We are aware that the task we will have to carry out between now and the deadline of 12-13 December is sensitive and complex."
"However, we have faith in the ability of Member States’ governments to meet the European citizens’ expectations of a more cohesive, authoritative and inclusive Europe: the expectations that Parliament has succeeded in interpreting so effectively, first in the Convention and then in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, in which it has been fully involved."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission views the progress of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference with a feeling of growing concern and disquiet."
"It is, of course, normal for the shape of a genuine compromise not to emerge until fairly late on in an intergovernmental conference, but what is not normal is for us to have an Intergovernmental Conference at which every meeting throws up more questions than it answers."
"The Commission totally shares the view often heard in public debate that the very success of the Intergovernmental Conference is now at stake."
"I support the observations of the Italian Presidency."
"The IGC is now moving into a crucial phase, and one thing is quite clear: we need to prevent the overall compromise worked out by the Convention from being damaged in a tug of war between the interests of individual Member States, and we need to protect the institutional balance arrived at over 16 months of debate."
"Let me remind you that there was a good reason why this draft Constitutional Treaty was worked out by a Convention, and not, as is usually the way, by a conference of diplomats and officials."
"It was the result of the shock caused by the Nice process."
"We need to be fully aware that we cannot steer a course towards a summit at which the Heads of State and Government once again sit together night after night nitpicking over the figures, only to achieve a result that they themselves find shocking."
"We accepted the Treaty of Nice – and both Parliament and the Commission had reservations about it – because we needed it."
"We needed that treaty in order to bring the massive historical project of enlargement to a conclusion on time."
"I believe, however, that no one in this Chamber believes that the Treaty of Nice would be adequate to really make a European Union of 25 or 27 Member States genuinely viable."
"We all know that we need a better treaty, and that time is pressing."
"That is why the Commission is anxious for the work to be brought to a conclusion on time."
"The enlargement process will be completed by 1 May 2004, and by then we need to have reached political agreement on how we are to work together."
"As regards the work now ahead of us, as the Commission sees it the main issue is to maintain and defend the considerable progress represented by the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"In our view, the key progress made relates to the double majority, the introduction of the 50/60 rule, the extension of the use of majority voting, and giving the European Parliament a stronger role in the legislative process."
"Given that overall the Constitutional Treaty represents a very carefully balanced compromise, each of the various sections in it must also be seen as striking a balance with its own internal logic, the details of which cannot be put at risk."
"With reference to the discussion at yesterday's meeting of Foreign Ministers and to the statement we have just heard from the Italian Presidency, I would like to make the dual role of the future EU Foreign Minister very clear."
"If we want to guarantee that the Union's foreign policy actions and its internal policies are coherent, it is essential for the EU Foreign Minister not only to have a mandate from the Council, but also, as Vice-President of the Commission, to be an integral part of the Commission, with full voting rights."
"A Foreign Minister with, as it were, guest status within the Commission cannot play the required role here."
"Any sort of special status for the Foreign Minister within the Commission would not sit well alongside his double legitimacy."
"The finely balanced outcome of the Convention is also reflected in the three components of the Union's finances: own resources, multiannual financial framework, and the annual budget process."
"Anyone concerned about a successful outcome from the Intergovernmental Conference should be careful not to unpick these agreements again."
"In this area the Commission totally supports the idea that the Convention's draft also needs to be protected against the interests of those who see their national responsibilities as being pre-eminent, to put it very delicately."
"The Italian Presidency referred to a very important point that I would like to specifically support, namely the simplified treaty amendment procedure."
"The Commission sees this as being essential."
"The Union should not let itself be forced into a constitutional corset that could become too tight for it in just a few years' time."
"I believe that the Italian Presidency's proposals point in the right direction."
"Finally, I would like to make one more comment about the political difficulties we will face if the Intergovernmental Conference reaches a successful conclusion, something we all hope for and support."
"We will then find ourselves in a situation in which a very far-reaching, very complicated and very fundamental treaty will have to be ratified in 25 Member States, and will have to overcome the hurdle of a referendum in a good many Member States."
"No one would be surprised if it proved quite difficult to clear this hurdle, particularly in the new Member States."
"We need to be aware of that."
"I would also like to ask honourable Members to have some sympathy for the position of the new Member States in the Intergovernmental Conference, a position that sometimes attracts criticism."
"I hope you will understand that it has not been all that easy for the governments and parliaments of the new Member States, just a few weeks after successful referenda on membership of the European Union, with referendum campaigns based on the Treaty of Nice, to have to explain to their electorate now that the basic principles of their accession to the European Union are about to change again."
"In saying that, I have the interests of my Polish friends in particular at heart, as they are adopting a very robust position on majority voting."
"It seems to me that there has been a misunderstanding during the public debate in Poland, to the effect that what is at stake is the relative importance of the individual Member States."
"That is not the case."
"The new arrangements are based on the principle that all the Member States are equal in status."
"A decision is only valid if it is supported by a majority of the Member States, which means that each and every Member State has the same rights, and that Poland has the same rights as all the others."
"The second factor – the concept that this majority must also represent a majority of the population of the Union – provides the democratic legitimacy needed for such a process."
"The larger we become, the greater our responsibility will be, and the more important the substance of the decisions we have to take, the more necessary democratic legitimacy will be."
"That is the heart of the matter here."
"I hope that in the time remaining this point will influence the debate in Poland."
"Finally, I would like to say that in reaching a compromise it will ultimately have to be taken into account that this draft Constitutional Treaty has to be ratified in 25 countries."
"I am mentioning that with particular reference to the debate about the size and composition of the Commission."
"I would like to reassure this House that the Commission backs Parliament when it comes to translating the essential architecture and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty into reality, and to achieving the correct relationship between the Community method and the sovereignty of the Member States, and between action at national level and the democratic legitimacy of the Community institutions."
"The Convention's draft points in the right direction."
"The Commission will do everything in its power to make sure that this process is pursued to its conclusion."
"Mr President, I believe we are all happy with the quality of this Parliament’s delegation to the Convention’s contribution."
"Today, our only points of contact are our two representatives within the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to ask you the following question, Mr President: do you believe that the little arrangements behind closed doors within one of our groups contribute to consolidating the authority which our two representatives require within this Conference?"
"Why, Mr President, has the group you belong to not represented the candidature of Mr Duff, which would have had a certain legitimacy, I believe, in terms of representing us in this Conference?"
"Mrs Berès, I shall make some comments in respect of the point of order you raised, but first I turn to our colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I thank him for the leadership he has shown on behalf of the European Parliament through the work of the Convention and as our representative on the IGC."
"We deeply appreciate that work."
"Second, Mr Méndez de Vigo recently tendered his resignation as Parliament's representative on the IGC."
"I was informed of that and I believe I did my duty correctly."
"I took that information to the Conference of Presidents."
"There, we exchanged views on what the response should be, and the Conference of Presidents – with an accord short of unanimity but nonetheless an accord – decided to appoint Mr Brok as Parliament's representative."
"This was done transparently, in accordance with the procedures."
"Views not far removed from those you raised in your point of order, Mrs Berès, were expressed; there was a plurality of views at that Conference, and a plurality of positions as regards the different group leaders."
"Nonetheless, there was sufficient momentum to confirm the appointment of our colleague, Mr Brok, to that position on behalf of Parliament."
"I underline 'on behalf of Parliament'."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that yesterday's meeting made it clear that agreement by December is achievable."
"I say that because ultimately there are only a few issues that are really controversial, and they are unlikely to be resolved next year either."
"We should therefore encourage the Italian Presidency to maintain its present course and to stick as closely as possible to the text produced by the Convention, because that text represents a balance that would be hard to replicate."
"The same also very much applies to the document to be presented in the ministerial conclave next week."
"I believe that subject to that condition there is a chance of bringing the IGC to a successful conclusion."
"Nevertheless, we need to recognise that opposing forces are still at work attempting to prevent this."
"That is something that we have already discussed here in connection with the Legislative Council."
"However, this House, too, has quite rightly taken a number of decisions this week about European budgetary rights, as you have pointed out, Mr President."
"In both cases – as regards the Legislative Council, which is to prevent any transparency and allow the national bureaucrats to carry on working as before, and as regards undermining Parliament's rights in relation to the budget – I am reminded of a series of films, the second of which is called ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The empire I am thinking of is the empire of national ministerial bureaucracies."
"In the third film in the series, good triumphs over evil, so there is a good chance that we can avert this danger."
"At the last but one meeting the Italian Presidency took the appropriate steps to safeguard our budgetary rights, and I hope that position will survive through to the end."
"Nevertheless, one thing needs to be made very clear: both legislative bodies must meet in public; we owe that to Europe's citizens in the name of transparency."
"And it also has to be accepted that budgetary rights are the key rights of any parliament, and war will undoubtedly be declared if changes are made to those budgetary rights that are unacceptable to Parliament."
"I am sure that will also be borne in mind."
"Then there are the so-called questions of power: voting rights in the Council, the composition of, and voting rights in, the Commission, and associated issues around the composition of the European Parliament."
"I am very conscious that this is probably something that the Heads of State and Government will be unable to sort out until the last night."
"However, there are a few issues we need to keep in mind, such as whether the threshold should be raised from 60 to 66, and other issues relating to the Commission."
"When it comes to overall willingness to compromise, there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is efficiency."
"It must be evident that the Council's ability to reach decisions in an enlarged Union must be guaranteed, and that is why the Convention proposed what it did, a fact that we must not lose sight of."
"We criticised the Treaty of Nice because we considered that the voting procedure in the Council was not adequate for an enlarged Union, and that must have been clear to our Polish friends from the outset, Mr Verheugen."
"People in the accession countries cannot now say that the details and mechanisms of the Treaty of Nice were presented in their referenda, and cite those as a source of legitimacy in the context of the discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"If this is to succeed, efficiency must always be a priority, combined, of course, at all times with the required degree of democratic legitimacy."
"I sometimes worry deeply that many governments do not think, ""How can the European Union achieve a majority for a required decision?"" but rather ""How easily can I block a decision?"""
"That kind of thinking is a cause for concern, and we should try to resolve this."
"With regard to the office of Foreign Minister, which was mentioned at our last sitting, I would like to point out that we are talking about a triple role, and not just a double one."
"The Foreign Minister would wear three hats: Member of the Commission, High Representative of the Council and President of the Council."
"All three need to be combined if this is to work."
"This House would not be happy about an arrangement whereby he was not a full Member of the Commission."
"It is extraordinarily important for him to be a full Member of the Commission, because only in that way is it possible to achieve true democratic control and a democratic appointment procedure, and the legitimacy which this House confers."
"Nor do we wish to see the Commission losing any of its foreign policy influence, if full responsibility is not given here for the area for which it is currently responsible, which would also mean Parliament indirectly losing responsibility in this area."
"For that reason we shall be lobbying hard for these three aspects to be interlinked."
"The Foreign Minister must also preside over the Council of Foreign Ministers, because only in that way can we simultaneously achieve coherence and continuity, and because only then will it really make sense to create this position in this way."
"Lastly, I would like to make a comment about the review clause."
"I would like to remind you that the proposal put forward in the letter from Mr Amato, Mr Duff and myself should in fact be addressed again."
"There should be an opening, with the exception of the ""Changes in Competence"" and ""Charter of Fundamental Rights"" areas, which must, of course, continue to be covered by the existing procedure."
"However, we should remember something that was considered in the Convention: a review clause with opening and at the same time a secession clause."
"The only thing now outstanding is the secession clause, and I think that something is amiss here, and that we still need to consider that."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken good note of the complicated statement of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"To put it clearly, what you want is for the text not to be touched."
"Amongst other things, it cannot be touched: if 80% are in agreement and then there are 150 amendments which are not supported by a sufficient majority, your duty is to maintain it."
"Furthermore, we must remember the governments that were present and participated in the Convention."
"The problem is that they have now locked the doors and left Parliament and the Commission outside."
"The members of the Convention from the Socialist family met last week and we reached the conclusion that we do not want any backtracking in relation to the Convention."
"We expect there to be progress and improvements – we agree on that – and our priorities are: firstly, that the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be called into question; that the secular nature of European integration is a founding principle, and, in this regard, we believe that the text of the Constitution is absolutely correct and must not be modified."
"We also believe that the legislative powers, not only of Parliament but also of the Council, must not be weakened in the legislative field or in the budgetary field, and we believe that the legislative Council must be maintained."
"We also believe that the economic and social governance of the Union should be turned into a reality, which means that the progress made in the first part of the Constitution should be reflected in the third part, dedicated to the Union’s policies, and furthermore that the legal basis for the protection and development of public services must be maintained, and then it will be able to be enshrined in a framework law."
"With regard to the issues which you have pointed out and which were dealt with yesterday, the Foreign Minister must be a member and Vice-President of the Commission."
"With regard to the review, you yourself have said that the Danish Government – and Denmark was the home of Hamlet – after opting-out, wants to opt-in."
"We must not close doors; we must provide the possibility of review."
"With regard to an issue which was raised yesterday by President Prodi, which is highly topical, we believe, specifically with regard to the budgetary powers – and we address this to Ecofin – that it is time for Ecofin to have a Community culture."
"Perhaps we should give the Finance and Economics Ministers a copy of the Treaties."
"We cannot systematically act on an intergovernmental basis."
"Furthermore I would like to stress that Parliament, with regard to the budget, is as responsible, or even more so, as the Council, and we have demonstrated this repeatedly."
"It is unacceptable to try to modify the Treaties by this means."
"I believe we should protest and demonstrate our indignation very clearly to Ecofin, which has taken ten years to accept the Delors plan for infrastructures."
"Why has this been paralysed for ten years?"
"Why does Ecofin have power over the European Council?"
"I believe that this issue is absolutely fundamental for all of us."
"Mr President, I will end by mentioning a topical issue, the issue of enlargement."
"I would agree with the comments of Commissioner Verheugen: I would say to our current members, because they are already here, that we voted for the Treaty of Nice in Parliament because we wanted enlargement, not because we liked the Treaty."
"We never liked the Treaty of Nice."
"But what we cannot now say is that France and Germany understand each other, after centuries of concern for Europeans because France and Germany were enemies."
"I believe that we should show the minimum of coherence."
"I would ask the Commission to maintain its approach in order to demonstrate that nobody is privileged with regard to pacts, and I am referring to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I believe, Mr President, that that message should be made absolutely clear to the Conference."
"Maintain your position so that we may have a Constitution for all Europeans."
"I shall add one remark on the issue of the budget."
"Mr Barón Crespo is correct to point out that since 1988 – when we signed an interinstitutional agreement with the Council on financial perspectives – in terms of discretionary expenditure adjustments, the Council has outspent Parliament by a ratio of three to two."
"This Parliament has acted with responsibility when given responsibility."
"Mr President, thank you for stealing one of the points I was just about to make. I thank you for your fight to save parliamentary prerogatives in the matter of the financial system."
"On a personal note, I am most grateful for Mrs Berès' moral support."
"However, the Conference of Presidents has made a decision, which I accept, and I offer my full support to Mr Brok, whose work and qualities we know."
"The Council presidency has confirmed its intention of presenting a global compromise before the 'conclave' meeting in Naples."
"One hopes that this is a wise decision."
"Experience would suggest that it is not at the level of foreign ministers, still less officials, that the final deal will be cut."
"The great patriotic questions that so obsess some of our Member States, such as a percentage point here or there on their voting weights in the Council, can only be resolved at 4 a.m. on Sunday, 14 December, by the top guys."
"What the foreign ministers appear to be clever at is unpicking the essential ingredients of the Convention's proposals."
"Yesterday several of them challenged the famous clause, which permits the steady development of the Constitution and of a decrease in the number of exceptional, non-normal decision-making procedures."
"But there have been many previous examples of this approach in previous and existing Treaties."
"Therefore, their consolidation into a single general clause is clear, simple and straightforward."
"The presidency is quite right in standing firm on this issue and the issue of the Foreign Minister and defending the proposals from the Convention."
"It knows that the European Parliament is right behind it."
"We also support the efforts of the presidency to open up the issue of the future revision clause."
"However, there can be no trade-off between the two, the clause and the softer revision procedures needed for a Constitution to work well and fluently in practice."
"Apologies for stealing your lines in advance, Mr Duff!"
"Mr President, we are approaching the term initially set for the work of the IGC."
"The Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us of the main sticking points still remaining: the membership of the Commission, the duties of the Foreign Minister, the definition of the qualified majority in the Council, the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and the procedure for reviewing the Constitution."
"These are not minor issues."
"Some of them involve the distribution of powers between institutions and Member States, others involve the highly sensitive issue of national identities and others are aimed at not locking ourselves within almost unchangeable institutional structures."
"Anybody who imagined that this type of friction would not arise in my opinion was guilty of a lack of realism."
"For my part, I am in no way surprised nor disturbed by these conflicts."
"If they were the only obstacles to be overcome in order to be able to celebrate the success of the Conference, then I would say, as the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, has done in other places, that today we have a solution to 95% of the problems."
"Alas, that is not the case."
"Because there is clearly a dimension of this draft Constitution which appears to be as taboo for the Heads of State and Government as it was for the President of the Convention."
"They are the Union’s policies and, in particular, what I called on 3 September, on talking with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the constitutionalisation of the liberal model or, to use another register, the establishment, in a fundamental law for the future Europe, of a genuine act of allegiance with NATO."
"The Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies."
"It is not me who says this; it is the Commission, in its communication of 17 September on the Constitution."
"However there is never any questioning of the Union’s policies, which represent three quarters of the draft Treaty."
"Do you believe therefore that there is unanimity on this point within public opinion?"
"That would clearly be foolish."
"I will perhaps make some of you laugh by referring, to this end, to the European social forum which has just taken place in the region of Paris."
"It would be a great mistake, therefore, to take an ironic or indifferent view of the appeal that has just been addressed to the Union."
"Hundreds of debates involving 50 000 young people from every part of Europe has demonstrated their thirst for knowledge, for understanding, for change and for concrete action, expressing, at the same time as totally rejecting the liberal model, a profound desire for Europe."
"How should we respond to this?"
"In view of the continuation of all the Community acquis on the single market and of the Treaty of Maastricht, they will not be satisfied with a subparagraph 2 of Article 3 which promises paradise on earth."
"They call for genuine changes, and it is on this basis that large numbers of the public demonstrate their sympathy."
"In certain countries, such as France, the debate, which did not exist until 3 September, when we raised right here the problem of the hidden face of the draft Constitution – which you have mentioned, Mr President – has continued to spread and deepen ever since."
"To the extent that there are numerous observers in these countries who do not rule out the possibility of a victory for the ‘no’ in the event of the ratification of the Treaty by means of a referendum."
"As a general rule, you will tell me, we have not reached that point."
"For the moment calm still reigns within public opinion in numerous countries."
"Well!"
"Should we rejoice at this?"
"We should not trust still waters."
"The silent unease of today risks creating landslides in the elections of tomorrow."
"I much prefer a rather disordered response, though showing generosity and solidarity, and without any chance of things become worse."
"This is why I would like, on behalf of my group, to appeal to those of you who shared this approach."
"Europe has for too long been built from the top."
"That is no longer the case today."
"We must demand vigorously that the calls from our societies be heard and taken seriously."
"We have little time left to react and give sense to the European project in the eyes of our citizens."
"– Mr President, the Convention was set up because the Heads of State and Government themselves had failed to make the European Union more democratic, more transparent and more efficient."
"National governments took part in the Convention’s public discussions and have rubberstamped the end result."
"Now, however, safely behind the IGC’s closed doors, they feel free again to modify the outcome."
"For example, there is an amendment that aims to change the annual budget procedure so that the lowest amount will automatically apply in respect of budget items on which the Council and Parliament have failed to reach agreement."
"The Dutch Government is justifying this by stating that in so doing, the Council and Parliament become equal, for indeed, whoever suggests the lowest amount, then that amount is final."
"At the same time, the Dutch Government claims, with a straight face, that it is fighting for Parliament’s full budgetary rights."
"One of two things could be at work here."
"Either the ministers do not understand the implications of their proposal and are therefore not that intelligent, or else they are trying to fog this issue to such an extent that they need not give public account for destroying Parliament’s democratic right to reject the budget, a right that has obtained for almost thirty years."
"In which case they are leading everybody up the garden path."
"Another painful area is the financial perspectives for the multiannual budget."
"They have been in place since 1988, but in the form of interinstitutional agreements."
"Parliament can breach such an agreement at any time, and thus has an important means of power at its disposal."
"The financial perspectives will now be included in the Treaty."
"As a consequence, this means of power will be taken away."
"What is worse is that some governments, in imitation of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, would like Parliament, from now on, to have only an advisory right when the multiannual budget is laid down, even though we are now equal partners."
"Not only Parliament, but also our own ministers competent in all the different fields are at risk of falling victim to the undisguised takeover attempt on the part of the Finance Ministers."
"I find it bizarre that these national ministers still have not caught on to this."
"Let me give you an example."
"If the European Parliament and the Culture Ministers have an agreement on a European multiannual cultural programme, then the Finance Ministers can ultimately wipe this off the table simply by suggesting a lower amount and demanding that legislation be adapted to the budget instead of the other way round."
"Who exactly is calling the tune in Europe?"
"The legislative authority that Parliament has acquired could become an empty shell when it has little power to ensure that sufficient funds are available to implement legislation."
"The Heads of State and Government are threatening to replace thirty years of budgetary right by the omnipotence of the Finance Ministers behind closed doors, and this shows little evidence of democracy or transparency."
"Mr President, I should like to express my support for the Italian Government in its efforts to conclude the EU Treaty negotiations by the Council meeting on 13 December."
"We all recognise that this is an ambitious timeframe, but it is one that can be met."
"The draft Treaty by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention lays the groundwork for the enactment of the new European Union Treaty."
"Needless to say the EU governments negotiating this new Treaty have individual concerns and reservations relating to certain aspects of that Treaty."
"The negotiations focus on two central elements."
"The first relates to institutional reform and the second to policy matters."
"From an institutional viewpoint, it is important that there is equality for smaller Member States with regard to representation on the European Commission."
"There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament."
"However, the European Union must be sensitive to the needs of individual Member States when it comes to foreign policy matters."
"The European Union should not have overriding power in the area of dictating taxation policy across the territories of the European Union."
"Decisions on taxation policy are best left to individual Member States."
"That is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments."
"There are serious challenges facing the European Union in the field of justice and home affairs."
"We need to cooperate more closely to combat organised crime and international terrorism."
"We need to work more closely together to combat the scourge of human trafficking."
"However, I do not believe it correct for all decisions concerning justice and home affairs matters to be taken by qualified majority voting."
"This is because of the sensitive issue of differences between legal systems within the European Union at this particular time."
"Mr President, to return briefly to the speech by Mrs Berès just now, I believe it is particularly clumsy – to put it mildly – that the European Parliament is represented in the Intergovernmental Conference by two Members of the same nationality, that is of German nationality, which demonstrates a point which had often been raised during the Convention, the overrepresentation of Germany within the European Parliament, which is undoubtedly one of the most dangerous consequences of the Treaty of Nice."
"I confess that I do not know how the Conference of Presidents takes its decisions, but the fact that this point, which does not seem to be secondary, had not been mentioned, seems to me to be regrettable in terms of the image of Parliament and of Europe in the years to come."
"While it is difficult at this stage to pass judgment on the IGC, I nevertheless believe that we should share the Commission's concern, since it seems to me that we are moving from Charybdis to Scylla."
"The Convention tried hard initially to study the content of European policies – economic, social, monetary, foreign – and then finally settled, it is true, for a modest institutional compromise."
"Having said that, I believe that in comparison, the Intergovernmental Conference is moving even further away from the concerns of the European citizens and becoming a kind of free-for-all on quotas of votes and seats, at the very same time that the European citizens are in the process – and this has not escaped you, Mr Wurtz mentioned it – of turning more directly against Europe and contesting the very foundations of European integration, as we have seen with this European social forum which I would personally have re-named ‘European Sovereigntist Forum’, given the debates which took place there."
"Finally, we talk a lot about the , which are in fact dark tunnels, in which the last prerogatives of the national democracies are going to get lost."
"I would, though, like to return to an incident which took place yesterday in order to demonstrate a little to this Parliament the extent to which it can appear schizophrenic from time to time."
"One group, the largest in our institution, has reprimanded Mr Prodi for his involvement in Italian politics, despite the fact that all the representatives of this Parliament have argued, during the Convention, for the President of the Commission to be elected by Parliament and that consequently it should be possible to campaign."
"I remember that this issue was mentioned several times."
"In fact, it would be interesting to be able to campaign for Prodi or for Aznar during the European elections."
"Yesterday, Mr Prodi simply anticipated a decision which I believe to be regrettable, which consists of politicising the role of President of the Commission."
"Mr President, the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the IGC, held on 18 November, has in particular dealt with a very important problem which the Convention had never really discussed: the revision clauses of the draft European Constitution."
"Some people have proposed a move towards reducing the obligation for unanimity in the case of certain revisions, in particular that relating to the third part of the draft, which relates to the Union’s policies."
"Those revisions are unacceptable to the majority because they would impose changes to the constitutional act on minority peoples."
"Unanimity must be conserved and differentiated cooperation must respond to any possible situations of deadlock."
"I would stress also that this third part contains essential provisions; that it has hardly been looked at by the Convention and that the Intergovernmental Conference looks likely to take the same route."
"All of this demonstrates well that this huge ambition to rewrite all the Treaties in one go risks leading to the endorsement of contested policies without real democratic debate."
"The meeting of Foreign Ministers has also examined the numerous clauses, specific or general, of which there are many in the draft."
"We reject these clauses that seek to bypass the official review procedure, which will rule the national parliaments out of the procedure and will make it even less transparent in the eyes of the citizens."
"Clearly, things would be different if each national parliament considered separately, or each population by means of a referendum, had the formal right to opposition."
"Mr President, this new revision of the Treaties should have been aimed at resolving the democratic deficit, at bringing Europe closer to the citizens and re-evaluating the role of the national parliaments."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is taking this approach, since it is likely to accept the Convention’s draft in its entirety, which does not deal with the real problem of democracy and which moves Europe further away from its people."
"We would appeal to it to put this right: there is still time before the compromise of 28 November."
"Mr Antonione, the Presidency’s position seems to be quite clear and is essentially in line with Parliament’s position; that is precisely why the brokerage endeavour seeking to bring about a high-minded, noble compromise that is in harmony with the text adopted by the Convention must be supported; the overall balance of the text cannot and must not be altered."
"Mr Frattini’s statements on the speech you made in this House give us great hopes, as stressed by Mr Brok, of the final outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference: I remain, therefore, one of those who are passionately optimistic."
"I am sure that we will achieve the goal towards which we are all working;"
"I am absolutely convinced that no one will have the courage, no-one will want to risk being held politically accountable for giving Europe a heart attack and shattering a long-held dream."
"Mr Antonione, I believe, however, that it is right to bring to the Presidency’s attention a number of issues, which really do require some thought."
"Firstly, the role of the European Parliament."
"It would be a serious mistake to limit the role of the House which represents the peoples of the Union;"
"I believe that the provisions of the text adopted by the Convention are appropriate and should not be altered."
"Secondly, the composition of the Commission: the accession countries – representatives of which are in this Chamber – have great hopes of the Europe of the tomorrow."
"We must not let them down by keeping them out of the Executive."
"That is why it is right for there to be a Commissioner with full rights for each country, at least during the initial phase of tomorrow’s Europe."
"Now, Mr Antonione, for a matter which has been the subject of much debate, and I feel that its importance must not be underestimated by the House."
"I feel – I am absolutely convinced of this, and not because I am a strong supporter of the Church – that the preamble to the Constitution should include an explicit reference to Europe’s Judeao-Christian roots."
"We must not deny a fundamental part of our history, we must not deny our deepest roots, we must not renounce the Europe of principles, we must not renounce this explicit reference, precisely because we want – and many countries understand this – secular institutions."
"This has been taken on board, Mr Barón Crespo, by the German Chancellor, the Social Democrat, Mr Schröder, who has decided not to block a proposal which seeks to make the individual, the central importance of the individual, the central importance of the citizen, the focus of tomorrow’s Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen said that some of what we are hearing about the discussions gives us cause for concern."
"I can certainly confirm that my own group feels that way, particularly as regards the impact on one of the fundamental rights of a parliament in a democracy."
"Discussions are taking place on budgetary rights, the essential right of any parliament, which represent the origins and the starting point of any process of democratisation: the right of Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the people, to make decisions on financial resources."
"The very foundations of this right are being attacked."
"I admit that we were not all happy about the outcome of the Convention, because we had, of course, expected more."
"We had hoped for more democratisation, so as to provide greater transparency for Europe's citizens about who is responsible for what, where the money comes from and how it is spent."
"More transparency is needed here, and the public have a right to expect it."
"In accordance with the outcome of the Convention, we have a financial framework that sets an upper limit and therefore puts a cap on expenditure."
"This framework will in future be set by the Council, subject to the approval of Parliament."
"That means that there is a predetermined planning procedure."
"When it comes to income, the Council has the last word."
"Nothing has changed there."
"We have criticised that, but that is how it is."
"As regards expenditure, and this is the small step forward that we have identified, in accordance with the Convention's draft the final decision is to be taken by Parliament."
"This is now being attacked by some Member States and also by the Finance Ministers."
"What is this all about?"
"The message that gives is that this House is not able to make objective decisions on behalf of the public."
"What impression do these governments' representatives expect to create in six months' time at the next European elections, if they do not trust their own candidates to vote responsibly on expenditure at European level?"
"We have already heard the criticism that parliaments do not know how to deal with money."
"That has always been the case down the centuries."
"But we have never heard it before from a democratically elected government referring to a democratically elected parliament."
"This is something new, and it really is intolerable if you take a look at the facts."
"The rate of budgetary increases approved in some areas – well over 8% in one area decided by the Council, agricultural expenditure, compared with the maximum increase of 2.5% envisaged for the overall budget – do not suggest that the Council, which up to now has been able to decide on its own, is particularly thrifty."
"Just look at the Council's administrative budget for next year."
"The Council is claiming an increase of 20.8% for itself, more than any other institution, in order to build up and enlarge its administration."
"We, on the other hand, have always kept within our upper limits."
"We do not need any coaching on how to manage the funds that Europe's citizens entrusted to us properly."
"We will hold our ground across the board if anyone tries to undermine Parliament's fundamental democratic right to set the budget."
"They will soon find out that no parliamentarian who takes his job seriously will go along with that."
"As Mr Brok put it, that really would be a declaration of war on this House."
"I would like to thank the presidency for saying that it wishes to respect the outcome of the Convention and to fight for its implementation."
"I would like to thank all those national governments that are supporting that."
"But I warn all those who are toying with the idea of attacking this right that they are opening themselves up to accusations that they do not want to use the Constitution to extend democracy in Europe, that they do not want to strengthen or further democracy, but that they want to bypass it and undermine it, by depriving Parliament of one of its central rights."
"Mr President, Mr Antonione, Commissioner, the democratic deficit in the EU is, in fact, often talked about."
"Decisions are taken behind closed doors by a circle of ministers, without ourselves, as citizens, being guaranteed political influence via an open debate and without ministers being held directly responsible to the voters for the decisions they make."
"That is the deficit that we in Parliament must make up, and Parliament’s influence on the budget and budget control are crucial in this area."
"It is, of course, not the governments that we see taking the lead in demanding reforms and better management of EU finances."
"It is Parliament that does this."
"The proposal by the finance ministers, whatever status it may have, involving a desire to uncouple Parliament from the budget process, is therefore a very embarrassing attack on democracy, and I hope that the EU Heads of State and Government will acknowledge this and reject the proposals."
"I hope that they accept the Convention’s proposal concerning the budget procedure, for it is balanced in a way with which they can be satisfied. At present, Parliament has, of course, real influence, both upon the annual budget and the financial estimates."
"Under the Convention’s proposal, we should be surrendering a little of the latter form of influence, for we can, at present, say at any time that we do not accept the multiannual budget framework but are returning to annual budgeting, for that is what is specified in the Treaty."
"Parliament has voluntarily entered into multiannual agreements, and we can accept these agreements in future becoming law, but on condition that we are given influence over the financial estimates and, of course, on condition too that we are given influence over the agricultural budget."
"That is the balance in the Convention’s proposal."
"Parliament gives something and receives something in return."
"I also look forward to the Danish Government’s denying press reports that it would support one of the finance ministers’ proposals, namely the proposal to introduce unanimity in the European Council when the financial estimates are adopted, for that cannot be right."
"We are in danger of deadlock in which the work of reform, including the reform of agricultural policy, is blocked."
"Denmark’s point of departure is that the European Parliament must have greater, not less, influence over the budget."
"This is something on which we must stand firm."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, before enlargement was on the cards, the debate was already being held in Europe of whether or not this issue would stand in the way of deepening."
"That debate has now faded and we have, in fact, all become enthusiastic about this enlargement."
"However, if the IGC debates go the same way, and if people really want to undermine the power of the European Parliament, which is very limited as it is, the question will once again be raised of whether Europe is not being hindered by this enlargement."
"In the past, the IGC has not managed to establish efficient, transparent and democratic structures, and at this rate, if the results of the Convention are now being brushed aside, we are at risk of ending up in a debate that is altogether different."
"It is a disgrace that people should want to undermine the power of the European Parliament in the budgetary field."
"A number of questions remain."
"Mr Verheugen, the protection of minorities was a condition for accession, but how will we protect the minorities once they form part of the European Union?"
"This question remains unanswered because this issue has not been solved for current EU Member States either."
"How will the European Union deal with the regions that have legislative powers but cannot intervene in matters that are regulated at European level and are nonetheless of vital importance to them?"
"Scotland and the fisheries issue spring to mind."
"How can this be referred to the Committee of the Regions, given that that Committee is totally inadequate in terms of composition, power and functioning?"
"Consider, too, the activities of Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Committee of the Regions is not the answer to the regions’ laments."
"It should be reformed or else abolished."
"Mr President, Mr Antonione, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these debates of ours, of course, follow the emotional cycle of the ICG itself and what we are experiencing now, therefore, is basically a feeling of expectation, and our attention is fully focused on the ministerial meeting that will take place in Naples on 28 and 29 November, where a proposal to overcome the difficulties and the points of difference and controversy with which we are all familiar will be presented."
"In this context, I am also extremely curious to see how difficulties in guaranteeing the principle that all Member States are equal will be overcome, especially as regards the composition and workings of the Commission, how the primacy of national constitutional law will be ensured and, to be specific, the fact that no Community law must provide a derogation from the constitutional law of the Member States. I would furthermore be curious to see how we would overcome the understandable obstacle that raised its head recently in the clauses, as I had predicted it would and which comes as a breath of fresh air in terms of a general clause and, above all, when it also affects essential core issues of sovereignty."
"I hope that this conceptualising is productive and above all that, ultimately, we do not stray from the agenda that has been announced."
"There are now areas of considerable concern, for example, it has been said that the aim of this reform is to bring Europe closer to the peoples and the citizens but the outcome that has been announced means the end of the rotating presidencies, without providing any satisfactory alternative."
"It has also been said that the purpose of the reform is to enhance democracy, transparency and awareness of the legislative process – aims with which I agree – and yet what we now have before us is the ‘requiem’ announced by the legislative Council, which would represent a return to a totally secretive legislative process, hampering public and parliamentary control. as well as constituting a regrettable further attack on the budgetary process."
"We fervently hope that a reform of the Treaties will only take place if it is a sound and potentially sustainable reform."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, it may be that we have the promise of clearer positions."
"This morning, both the Council Presidency and the Commission’s speeches were more specific and took a harder line: could it be that they are indicative of what will happen in Naples?"
"A Europe with clam sauce or a more-or-less Neapolitan pizza which will be served up to the European public for next year?"
"At this juncture, taking into account the hourly developments like the finance ministers’ initiative, maybe the Council Presidency should review things in Italy with some urgency, if these are Mr Tremonti’s contributions, and also, moreover – and nobody has mentioned this, not even the general affairs ministers – the Italian and European shift of position on Israel just a few hours ago."
"I suppose we will take note of it but only in a few hours’ time, I fear."
"At this point, we would like to give two pieces of advice or express two hopes."
"For the forthcoming European elections, why should we not devise a political – I repeat, political – initiative and hold a European consultative referendum?"
"You will win it and you will also be able to raise awareness about the subsequent institutional referenda that will be held."
"On the other hand, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, are you, maybe, looking into the possibility of doing something new before 15 December?"
"Are you trying to resolve the most serious problem which you seem to have, giving more power – with a US or UK flavour – to the Commission President?"
"It is not a question of having 15 or 20 or 25; quite the opposite, it is a question of focusing less on ethnic representation and more on issues of programmatic, cultural and political representation."
"Have a little more confidence in yourselves rather than continuing to try and produce more rules, extensions and derogations, a strategy which is typical of canon law, not of secular law or the kind of law which creates rules which all can follow, including in the customs of society in general."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Commissioner Verheugen for his address."
"He very helpfully reminded us that we had the Convention because of the shock of Nice."
"I recall that earlier this week, Mr President, you and I were addressing a meeting of the CBI in the United Kingdom and I made the same point then."
"This whole process is one that goes back to the Nice Treaty and the shock of the outcome of the referendum in Ireland – I do not ask you to comment on that, Mr President."
"What we talked about at Laeken was engaging with European citizens and explaining what Europe is about to citizens who are feeling remote from Europe."
"Yet the headline in the last week was: 'Campaign launched to save Constitution'."
"MEPs are reported to be so concerned about the activities of national governments in the IGC that they felt it necessary to take to the streets in defence of the Convention's plans."
"We have heard in the debate today that the Convention must be defended against something wicked that is called national self-interest."
"Those who have launched this campaign will find it rather difficult to rally the electorate to their cause; according to a recent opinion poll, 61% of the European electorate have never heard of the Convention at all and in the UK 83% of people have never heard of it."
"What people in my country and the rest of Europe want is a referendum on the Constitution."
"In a Eurobarometer poll published last week of the people polled in the 15 Member States and 10 accession countries wanted a referendum."
"In the UK that number is 86%."
"Mr Duff is amongst them: his party also wants a referendum."
"He and I might differ significantly about the implications of this Constitution, but as democrats we should be in a position to argue our case with the people and to see what the outcome of that debate should be."
"What message is being sent in my own country by the continued refusal to listen to the people whose interests we are elected to serve?"
"I should like to clarify a couple of points relating to the Convention."
"I would be grateful for clarification from the Council on the position outlined by the Maltese Prime Minster, who said recently that there had been some agreement from those countries that do not have to hold referenda that they will not allow referenda."
"That is not a democratic situation."
"I am very grateful to President Prodi, who has accepted that the Constitution amounts to a big change from the basic concept of nation states, a position confirmed by the German, Spanish and French Governments but denied by my own government."
"Finally, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr President, you and I heard a UK minister putting forward the view that there was nothing to worry about."
"A former UK minister said that in the United Kingdom the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have as much legal force as the . The is a comic for children in the United Kingdom."
"I rather think that this Constitution proposes something different."
"That is why I believe that the people should have a say in it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would specifically like to thank the Italian Presidency for all its efforts to ensure that the result of the Intergovernmental Conference closely reflects the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"It will have our support, and it will also have the support of some governments, but far too few up to now."
"We would like to see this group growing larger."
"Nevertheless I share the concern expressed here by Commissioner Verheugen and also by you yourself, Mr President-in-Office."
"I share your concern but I do not want to go into individual proposals."
"I am concerned about something more fundamental that is amiss in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The majority of ministers have not so far proved equal to the task before them."
"That is the simple truth."
"There is no will to shape things in the Intergovernmental Conference, but rather a blocking mentality, and that cannot continue if we are to achieve a good result in December."
"Almost without exception, the proposals being made represent steps backward as compared with the Convention's draft."
"Every time, during every discussion, the IGC does not build on the result of the Convention, it goes back on the Convention."
"The ministers are in the process of making things that have been dealt with simply in the draft Constitutional Treaty complicated again and detracting from their clarity and simplicity."
"The rejection of the Legislative Council is just one example of this."
"They are refusing to give the Constitution the flexibility it needs."
"In fact they are going even further, by dismantling the small number of modest links that we incorporated and blocking them, so that unanimous agreement is to be required again for the medium-term financial perspective, and the European Parliament is being deprived of budgetary rights."
"In this way they are not just going back on the Convention's draft, they are even going back on the European Parliament's present rights."
"That is unacceptable."
"The majority of governments do not understand that a Union with over 25 Member States needs to have a new basis."
"They are not taking the result of the Convention seriously as a compromise that really is already a compromise and strikes a balance between North and South, large and small, and East and West in the European Union."
"We hope that the governments will abandon their blocking mentality and remember that they should be a force for shaping the future of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress two points."
"On the one hand, that Ecofin’s proposals represent a step backwards with regard to the current situation in accordance with the Treaty of Nice."
"And on the other, that the financial perspectives must be accepted by the European Parliament and that Ecofin's proposals simply establish a consultation with Parliament."
"Democracy is also a way to manage disagreements and today the European Parliament has the final word on more than 60% of the annual budget in the event that no agreement is reached with the Council."
"In Ecofin’s proposals a kind of automatic mechanism according to which the lowest quantity proposed is accepted replaces the political will of the institutions."
"Ecofin’s proposals destroy the balance achieved in the Convention, and the European Parliament, knowing this, accepted a formalisation of the financial perspectives in the Constitution, restricting its own budgetary powers, because its power to reject the multiannual framework and to be able to decide against the Council's position by a very high majority of its Members, in the event of a disagreement in relation to the annual budgetary procedure, was recognised."
"Ecofin's proposal to adopt the lowest quantity proposed in the event of there being no agreement removes any incentive to reach agreement."
"Whoever proposes the lowest quantity is bound to win."
"It is not that this limits the budgetary powers of Parliament, but that it turns the whole procedure into a mere Dutch auction."
"My political group had great difficulties and held many discussions in relation to accepting the Convention's final proposal in the field of finances."
"All the eloquence of Mr Méndez de Vigo was required to convince us that this proposal represented a fair distribution of powers."
"It would not be advisable today to have to begin the whole process again."
"This would jeopardise the trust between institutions and would strip Parliament of its capacity to have a say in the drawing up of the Union’s budgetary policies."
"My political group calls for the whole of the finance chapter of the draft Constitution to be taken as an indivisible and non-negotiable whole."
"Mr President, I am addressing the representative of the Presidency, Mr Antonione."
"Mr Antonione, I do not doubt the sincerity of your intentions but some of the expressions you used – I might almost way which slipped out – concerned me greatly."
"You said that some Member States, or government representatives, are standing firm on their requests for change for reasons of negotiating tactics."
"There is a fundamental misunderstanding here: the Intergovernmental Conference was not supposed to be a negotiating forum, governments should not have been allowed to adopt positions already presented in the Convention – as Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok pointed out – positions already rejected by the Convention because more convincing solutions with wider backing had been found."
"I am not saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should just have blindly approved the Convention’s draft, as, moreover, the Heads of State and Government were wise to do in the case of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights; I am saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should purely have checked for shortcomings and contradictions in the Convention’s draft, as it should be doing now, and discussed how to overcome them."
"You also said that the Italian Presidency’s position is clear: it advocates a text which departs from the Convention’s draft as little as possible."
"However, that concept of ‘as little as possible’ is entirely open to interpretation and discretion."
"We need to be clear: woe betide the IGC if it meddles with the Convention’s most important innovations: the powers of the European Parliament, particularly in budgetary matters; the double majority system; the Legislative Council; the appointment of the Foreign Minister."
"Do not put the European Parliament in a position where it has to reject the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and call upon the national parliaments not to ratify the Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of these weeks we are shaping the future Constitution of the European Union, and I would like to add that never before has the public had such an opportunity to participate in and influence the creation of a constitution as during the Convention, and we made that possible by means of a European Parliament initiative."
"What is at stake here is not only effectiveness and transparency, but also greater parliamentarianism, accountability and accessibility for the public. In other words, not only the Union's future sustainability but also its ability to cope with enlargement is at issue."
"At this point I would particularly like to emphasise once again that the overall outcome of the Convention was, from Parliament's viewpoint, of course painful in many respects, but ultimately it was a balanced compromise that we are willing to accept in the greater interest."
"Mr President-in-Office, if there is talk about doing away with the Legislative Council, then let me make a perfectly serious observation: if the accession countries had a legislative body that functions as the Council does at present, then those countries would have been refused membership of the EU, because they would quite simply have failed to meet the basic requirements for legislative process, transparency and parliamentarianism."
"That is why we are insisting on the Legislative Council."
"A great deal has already been said about budgetary rights."
"On this issue, I also believe that the agreements whereby the final decision on own resources is taken by the Member States, whereby the Council decides on the multiannual budget framework after consulting and gaining the approval of Parliament, and this House has the final say on the annual budget plan, all that is ultimately a compromise."
"It is not acceptable for the informal Ecofin summit at Stresa to attempt to undermine long-standing parliamentary rights, to torpedo them in fact."
"Any attempt to restrict Parliament's rights in this area will come up against the combined and energetic resistance of a large majority of this House."
"That is why I am counting at this point on the presidency adopting a pro-European position, and to take on the faint hearts and the backward-looking members of the Council in order to achieve a satisfactory solution."
"Mr President, since I am in agreement with the comments made by Members from my group and several other groups, I wished to use my one minute of this interesting debate to draw attention, like Commissioners Vitorino and Barnier, to a specific issue: the risk of returning to unanimity on such a sensitive issue as judicial and police cooperation on criminal matters."
"I have been in this House for almost ten years and remember perfectly well the problems we had before the Treaty of Amsterdam and the total deadlock which intergovernmentality subjected us to in this field."
"Today, a degree of progress has been made in terms of effectiveness, but unanimity is still a very significant burden."
"It is also logical that the lack of parliamentary control – because in this regard we have lost out, the national Parliaments exercise no control over this field and nor do we – creates fear, because we are dealing with a very sensitive area, but the solution is to make decisive progress towards codecision."
"The Constitution makes it clear where and how we must intervene."
"We must show courage in order to offer the citizens an area of security which is also an area that defends freedom."
"MrPresident, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps it is a happy coincidence that the final word from Parliament today will be heard on the content of the Constitution for social Europe."
"One of the major steps taken in the draft constitution drafted by the Convention on the future of Europe were the provisions on the social face of Europe, for social Europe."
"The Convention's preoccupation with this issue is particularly important because it emerged not from the Laeken agenda but from the initiative of the members of the Convention themselves, and rightly so. Because the peoples of Europe are much more interested, I believe, in the announcement of the objective of full employment, in strengthening social dialogue and in reinforcing the legal basis for public utility companies or for public health, than in whether there will be 13 or 23 Commissioners or if Europe will have 1 or 2 ministers for foreign affairs."
"The Intergovernmental Conference will need to respect the Convention's text."
"It will need to intervene to improve one thing."
"To harmonise the wording between the first and third part of the draft, because we cannot talk of full employment in article 3 and of a high level of employment in part three. '' [nothing really changes] must not become the slogan of this Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking you for the requests that you have made in the context of this debate and to say, as I have done on other occasions, that we consider them precious contributions to the work that the Presidency is doing in order to reach an objective that I think could be considered – judging by what has been said in the overwhelming majority of speeches by the Members of the European Parliament – of common interest."
"As regards the specific issues, quite frankly, I believe that today's speeches have retraced our debate of last week, so there have been no new developments and I can only reiterate in exactly the same way some points upon which I have already given my response."
"The Italian Presidency does not accept any intervention from Ecofin – to be quite clear and specific on an issue that you have raised – since it believes that no Council, not even Ecofin, is entitled to present amendments."
"If a representative of the Intergovernmental Conference wishes to table proposals which might also emerge from the Ecofin debate, it will do so on behalf of the government that it represents but not on behalf of Ecofin."
"I believe, therefore, that, from this point of view, my answer must be the same as that I gave in the past meeting."
"As regards our commitment to safeguarding the fundamental role of the European Parliament, and of parliaments in general, I continue to stress that we believe this to be an essential point."
"On a more general note, as regards the issue of whether proposals made by governments can be discussed, I have to say that it is difficult to imagine the Presidency totally and absolutely refusing to consider proposals that governments may wish to present."
"Frankly, I do not believe that is possible."
"Moreover, it is not as if your representatives – the representatives of the European Parliament to the Intergovernmental Conference – acted any differently from the Presidency; it is not as if the two representatives had got up and walked out because some governments wanted to reopen the debate on issues already discussed in the Convention."
"This is a phase of negotiation – I reiterate to Mr Napolitano – that I frankly believe to be normal and natural."
"I cannot see how else we could proceed."
"Rather, I want to stress that the work you are doing in support of our undertaking not to depart from the spirit and from the recommendations that emerged from the work of the Convention is fundamental."
"Surely, however, it cannot be imagined that the Intergovernmental Conference is meeting simply to ratify work that has already been completed, valuable and important though that work is, which some governments clearly feel could be improved upon."
"The IGC is proceeding in this direction and I genuinely hope that, with everyone's efforts, we will be able to achieve that important, valuable result which, I repeat, is a legacy we all share."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment briefly on two contributions that I thought were particularly important."
"First, I would like to respond to Mrs Maes."
"I believe that she made a very important point during the debate when she said that it is now also necessary to demonstrate that enlargement is not a problem for deepening."
"This is a very old issue and it has certainly not yet been resolved yet, and I would like to take this opportunity to say once again to our future Member States that it is now up to them to demonstrate that these fears are unfounded, and to show that enlargement and deepening can perfectly well go hand in hand."
"I must say, however, Mrs Maes, that the example you chose was not a particularly apt one."
"The new Member States were not involved in the attempt by the Ecofin Council to limit Parliament's budgetary rights."
"They really did not play any part in that attack, but that does not affect the fundamental problem."
"The second person I would like to respond to is Klaus Hänsch."
"I think he is quite right in his analysis that what we are presently dealing with is a question of political will. It is not as if the problems are insurmountable."
"It is not as if any major new issues have emerged in the debate over the last few months."
"Everything that we are now considering was discussed thoroughly and in detail by the Convention, and after an in-depth discussion a decision was taken which we are convinced everyone can live with."
"I would like to leave you with one final thought: we need to become aware what the alternative is."
"You always need to consider what would happen if we cannot achieve anything and the Constitutional Treaty fails."
"That would imply more than the failure of any other legislative project."
"It would mean the failure of something absolutely central to the integration project, and the consequences would not just be legal ones."
"It would be a fatal mistake to imagine that we could then just continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"If the Constitutional Treaty failed, it would create whole new political scenarios in the European Union, which could even have a disintegrating effect within the Union."
"That is why we bear such enormous responsibility, and that is why it is so important to bring this project to a conclusion."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen."
"The vote on the motion for a resolution will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The representatives of the European Council and of the European Commission have not concealed their concern about the disagreements which have emerged at the Intergovernmental Conference within the framework of the discussion about the new 'Constitutional Treaty' of the ΕU."
"However, the disagreements are about completely secondary issues which do not change the reactionary nature of the text."
"They are concerned about the role of the foreign minister, without any of them contesting the militarisation of the ΕU and its cohesion with ΝΑΤΟ."
"No-one is concerned about the further cession of national sovereignty, but they are concerned about exactly how the power is to be redistributed."
"Not a word against the deification of the 'market economy' or against the strengthening of repressive mechanisms, while the European Parliament is only worried about the role reserved for it."
"In other words, everyone is fighting their own corner."
"In all events, some concern is being expressed about the outcome of the referenda (where they are being held), which shows they are worried about increased grass-roots dissatisfaction, despite the misleading propaganda and the results of the referenda so far."
"The peoples do not need a 'Euro-Constitution'; they hardly even need a European Union."
"They must step up their fight to defend and broaden their rights and demolish the structure being constructed by the exploiters in order to finally change society."
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Euromed."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to illustrate to this House the results we expect from the sixth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference, which will be taking place in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003."
"Even before taking over the six months’ presidency of the Council of the European Union, Italy had a clear understanding of how big a part the outcome of the Naples Conference would play in the overall assessment of its Presidency."
"Indeed, within the overall external relations framework of the new enlarged Union, relations with the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean continue to occupy a significant place and act as a firm point of reference."
"From the outset, the Barcelona Process has provided a means of measuring the state of health of these relations, often serving as a metronome regulating the pace of the dialogue between the two shores of our common sea and acting, therefore, as a force regulating – and, above all, driving forward – the dialogue itself, insofar as this has been possible in view of the events in the Middle East over the years."
"In the run-up to the Naples Conference, Italy has been able at all times to count on the fruitful cooperation of all the partners, who, without exception, have demonstrated in recent months that they share our deep expectations that Barcelona VI should genuinely be a time of unmistakable reinvigoration of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"This need for reinvigoration is rooted conceptually in the Valencia Action Plan approved under the Spanish Presidency in April 2002."
"It was confirmed by the ministerial conference in Crete last May under the Greek Presidency and has been taken by us as a clear indication of the mandate to give shape to the common undertaking to place the Barcelona Process on a more solid footing."
"This seems even more necessary today, when the Union enlargement process on the one hand and the situation in the Middle East on the other are giving rise to a strong demand for Europe on the part of the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"The European Union has, in the meantime, already given an initial vigorous and cohesive response by launching the new neighbourhood policy, in which it sets out a new unified concept for its external relations with neighbouring areas. It has also launched a more incisive policy on respect for human rights and democracy which, thanks, not least, to the substantial contribution made by the Commission, is already being implemented."
"It is in this new and promising context that the Italian Presidency intends to discharge its great responsibility fully by putting every possible effort, and all the energies that such an event requires, into the Naples Conference."
"This reinvigoration that we have in mind will only, however, be worthy of this name – it will, in other words, be qualitative – if it is able to restore to us a vital, dynamic Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"This exercise must not just involve officials and policy-makers but must ultimately be addressed to public opinion in our countries."
"It is worth specifying at this point that ‘a solid footing’ means something very simple in this context: giving the Barcelona Process the instruments, structures and mechanisms that will bring the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership into contact with public opinion, giving it the ability to have a positive impact on everyday life and to support and respect the various different viewpoints."
"It is only in this way that a genuine, strong partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean can be consolidated."
"In this perspective, the outcome that we, the 35 Euro-Mediterranean Partners, hope to see emerge from the Naples Conference is an enhancement of the Barcelona Process through three new instruments designed to bring the Partnership into closer contact with the keenest aspirations of civil societies in the region."
"I am referring, firstly – and I am particularly pleased to be able to do so here today – to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which will be given a place with consultative functions in the Barcelona Process; secondly, to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations; and, lastly, to the new institutional and operational structure that the Partners will be deciding on for the future of the Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Fund, which was set up within the EIB just over a year ago to promote investment in the private sector – in particular small and medium-sized enterprises – in the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"We are certain that these measures would give the Partnership a powerful boost, allowing it to forge ahead independently and giving it a capacity for action generated by the demands of civil society as conveyed through the parliamentary channel, by virtuous circles nourished by the mutual respect that synergistic interaction between cultures can instil, and, lastly, by a financial institution that is increasingly in tune with the specific needs of beneficiary countries and endowed with a wider and better organised range of instruments through which to act."
"These are the underlying reasons and concerns to which the three key priorities set for the Ministerial Conference in early December correspond, priorities which we have interpreted in the light of the building of a reinvigorated partnership between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The events of recent months have shown this to be increasingly essential if conditions of peace and political, economic and social stability are to prevail in the region."
"In this respect, the formal inclusion, with consultative functions, of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in the Partnership framework is vitally important, since it is the Assembly, first and foremost, that will be entrusted with the task of bringing the Barcelona Process closer to public opinion and thus making good the participation deficit and, even more importantly, the communication deficit that the Barcelona Process has undoubtedly been labouring under thus far."
"We see the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue as a structure that – combining pragmatism with a sense of perspective – can act as a catalyst on all the initiatives seeking to develop dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of the ‘Guiding Principles for the Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations’ approved by the Crete Conference."
"The Naples Conference itself will have the task of sanctioning the creation of the Foundation and, we hope, makingthe choice of location official at the same time."
"Finally, we consider it to be fundamentally important to improve the operation of the FEMIP by tailoring its instruments more closely to the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses and the private sector."
"Naples will be focusing mainly on these issues, but there is more: the Conference will have the added objective of confirming the undertaking to develop the Partnership in political and security matters as well, introducing fuller cooperation on the ESDP and more in-depth dialogue on the particularly thorny issue of terrorism."
"As regards the economic dimension, Naples will – amongst other things – provide an opportunity for convergence and evaluation of the results of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Trade held in Palermo in July 2003. It will also give us the chance to consider the outcome of the first Euro-Mediterranean Conference of the Ministers for Agriculture which will be held in Venice on 27 November, and the Conference on Investment, Infrastructure and Energy which will be taking place immediately before Barcelona 6, on 1 and 2 December 2003."
"The social and cultural agenda will, inevitably, largely be taken up by the debate on the Foundation but it will certainly provide an opportunity to assess the progress made since the launch of the regional programme on Good Governance and the Strengthening of the Rule of Law, which is a crucial factor for the future of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the fields of justice, policing and immigration policy."
"The debate on this last issue, in particular, will underline the importance of adopting a balanced approach to the management of migratory policy, which, if properly oriented, could make a positive contribution to the socio-economic growth of the entire region."
"Again with the objective of bringing the Partnership closer to public opinion, the Naples Conference will welcome the launch of cooperation between the regional authorities in the countries on the two shores of the Mediterranean, a process in which the forthcoming interregional conference in Palermo will be an important landmark."
"Moreover, Naples should also take note of a mechanism for the involvement of civil society, the special Forum that will be held in that city on the eve of the Conference. The Forum will be open to a wider range of participants and be structured coherently in such a way as to increase the impact and profile of the exercise."
"Finally, the Conference will record the conclusions of the meeting of the bodies representing the social forces which has just taken place in Malta under the auspices of the European Social Committee."
"All this will be included in the powerful message which, we trust, will be sent out from the Naples Conference."
"To achieve these objectives, we are working to ensure that the positions of all the Euro-Mediterranean Partners on these issues converge at this event. We are doing so in a spirit of pragmatism and following a strategic approach that should make it possible to reconcile diverse interests in order to build and nurture – in the new conceptual framework of the Wider Europe – a more solid relationship between the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"On this point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can say that we are on the right road."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is a good opportunity to talk about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, better known as the Barcelona Process – a few days before the Mediterranean conference of foreign ministers in Naples."
"Through its opinions and resolutions adopted ahead of foreign ministers’ conferences, Parliament has made important contributions to the development of this Partnership."
"It was the driving force in fostering cooperation between the parliaments of the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the working party has now reached agreement on a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Commission looks forward to welcoming it in Naples as an advisory body and as one of the institutions of the Barcelona Process."
"What role is it to play?"
"It is the view of the Commission that the Assembly will effectively promote respect for human rights and democratisation in the region."
"The communication which the Commission published on this subject in May was welcomed by Parliament and the Council."
"We will now be discussing with our Mediterranean partners the action plans that will be implemented with MEDA Programme funding to bring about concrete improvements in human rights and democracy in all partner countries."
"The Euro-Mediterranean area is one of the regions of the world that are probably the most seriously affected by the risks of the twenty-first century, be it terrorism, trafficking in human beings, drugs, the problems of globalisation or environmental hazards."
"It is important for Europe to show solidarity with its neighbouring region in this situation."
"Solidarity by helping our partners to face these challenges in a way that is compatible with respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"But we cannot achieve more than our partners themselves want."
"That is why political reforms must be an essential part of the plan."
"The new new neighbourhood strategy that will be debated in this House this afternoon sets out very precisely what we can do to get greater progress in political and economic reform in the region."
"I do not want to say anything about that now, as there will be ample opportunity this afternoon."
"I would like to point out that we have made progress on a number of fronts, which will be evaluated in Naples, and on which further progress will have to be built."
"I would also like to point out that North-South integration alone is not enough."
"We must also continue to support integration between our partners."
"Here, too, there has been progress in some areas but I am sure we should encourage them to further efforts."
"Let me say in conclusion that intercultural dialogue must play a special part in our entire concept."
"The importance of intercultural dialogue was recognised very early in the Barcelona Process and it has found expression in joint programmes to assist the development of cultural heritage, audio-visual co-productions and youth exchanges."
"In the run-up to the Valencia conference of foreign ministers, the Commission put forward the proposal, which was finally approved, to complement these programmes with an independent Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations."
"I am very pleased that we are close to agreement and I hope that agreement can also be reached at the Naples conference on the location of the Foundation."
"All the candidates, Rome, Valetta and Alexandria, have points in their favour and I do not want to express an opinion on them here, only to point out that it is important that the Foundation should be able to begin work by the middle of next year."
"It will make an important contribution to raising the profile of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and increasing its visibility and importance for the population."
"Mr President, the transformation of the Parliamentary Forum on the agenda for the Naples Summit on 2 and 3 December into a Parliamentary Assembly will be an extremely significant political development, as the House has seen from the ACP experience."
"The Parliamentary Assembly is an instrument for political cooperation which both reminds the Member States of their responsibilities precisely through parliamentary measures and gathers strength for new measures."
"The next step in Naples must be swift action on the part of the Council to implement the decisions already taken during the Valencia Ministerial Conference, especially the initiatives based on culture and dialogue between societies – both bilateral and multilateral initiatives – in order to reinvigorate the neighbourhood policy which is the key to the balance and development of the Mediterranean area."
"The transformed institution will, moreover, have to adopt a working model for which we can all see the need."
"Our decisions must be put into practice for, in this area, we must admit that we have failed somewhat."
"If we consider the Barcelona process, Meda, Meda II and the Valencia Conference, and the past and present expectations raised by these developments, it may be that we have failed somewhat in implementing all the decisions taken."
"A great deal of work has been accomplished but, without a doubt, there is still some to be completed, and the Assembly is clearly the right body to verify whether we have observed and achieved the objectives we set ourselves, particularly as regards the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, for a genuine, coherent, effective Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must fully incorporate not just the social and economic dimensions but respect for and promotion of human rights as well."
"Point by point, we would like to mention a number of developments that must be included on the agenda and seen as priorities. Firstly, a programme for supportive cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean in the fight against terrorism and international organised crime."
"We need to introduce specific measures to stem this flow of – often forced – migration, which is a tragedy for mankind."
"Secondly, we need to verify the forms of development of the section provided by the EIB for the Mediterranean and the Middle East as an instrument for supporting the goals set by the new strategy, with the financial participation of other Mediterranean countries;"
"I would point out that this Assembly expected a bank to be an active operator in the area."
"Thirdly, we need to insist on the development of south-south relations."
"In my opinion, the Agadir agreementis an important means of creating a genuine free trade area."
"Fourthly, the procedures of the MEDA regulation need to be streamlined in order to increase the effectiveness of the project."
"Mr President, Mr Antonione has already pointed out that the Assembly which is to take place in Naples is extremely important in terms of the decision to turn the Parliamentary Forum into a genuine Assembly, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures."
"I believe that, alongside our work on these goals, we must reassess the Euro-Mediterranean policy in the context of the more general neighbourhood policy, which, at last, places the eastern dimension on the same level as the southern dimension."
"This is the signal we must send to our consultative partners and we want the regional dimension of the Barcelona Process to be strengthened in the action plans to address cultural and human relations, economic and trade aspects, social aspects, rights and security."
"I believe that we should preserve the complex nature of the Partnership, which has become very condensed and one-dimensional, focusing purely on free trade."
"As regards human rights and democracy, I feel we must stress that these are not just options; these dimensions must be integrated into the strategy and, above all, incorporated into our approach to combating terrorism, for, in order to combat terrorism, we have to break not just the vicious circle of terrorism and war but the vicious circle of terrorism and consolidation of authoritarian regimes as well."
"In doing this, I believe it is possible to launch democratisation processes with due regard for human rights in these countries too, as called for by the fundamental United Nations development agency report, which we should take as our guide in relations with these countries."
"Mr President, I would firstly welcome the policy of good neighbourly relations proposed by the European Commission and the report which will be discussed this afternoon, as a basic instrument for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"I would also welcome the initiative to turn the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a parliamentary assembly."
"Please allow me, Mr President, to refer specifically to the relations which should be established or improved with a State of the southern Mediterranean."
"I am referring to Libya, where I recently had the opportunity to chair a delegation from my parliamentary group."
"The United Nations Security Council's sanctions on Libya were lifted in September and work is ongoing on resolving the issues relating to the compensation for the UTA aircraft and the attack on the discotheque in Berlin in 1989."
"Libya is present as an observer in the Barcelona Mediterranean process and has not been integrated into it."
"As the Prime Minister, Mohamed Ghanem, said, Libya is taking the route of progressive privatisation of its economy and putting an end to state control."
"It is also prepared to increase its fight against illegal immigration, which is taking place throughout the length of its 2 000-km Mediterranean coast."
"In any event, it will be difficult for the fight against illegal immigration to be carried out if there is no effective cooperation with the States of the European Union and in this regard, we believe that the European Union must reconsider its relations with Libya."
"This cannot naturally take place without demanding, furthermore, respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty and also the abolition of amputations, which are practices which still exist in that country, at least in a legal sense."
"Mr President, it is first of all impossible to ignore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since it is dramatic for their populations, and also prevents any development of the Euromed partnership."
"Only a fair and lasting solution can allow peace to be established in the region."
"Only an end to the Israeli military occupation, the destruction of the wall of shame and the creation of the Palestinian State beside the Israeli State, will lead to peace and put an end to the unbearable and murderous chain of events suffered by the occupied Palestinian population as well as the Israeli citizens."
"A glimmer of hope has been offered by the so-called Geneva accords, negotiated over more than two years by the delegations led by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabbo."
"It would be appropriate for the Foreign Ministers meeting in Naples to offer their support for this plan which demonstrates that there are interlocutors on both sides seeking a fair peace, in contrast to what the politicians, in particular the Sharon Government, ceaselessly demonstrate."
"The Euro-Mediterranean framework may be a valuable asset in terms of contributing to the establishment of a climate of trust allowing genuine dialogue."
"A first signal would consist of high-level delegations from both the Union and from the Arab countries in particular attending the official signing of these agreements on 1 December in Geneva, on the very eve of the ministerial conference."
"Another undeniable sign would be for the Union to apply all its efforts to persuading the Quartet to support this initiative as well."
"With regard to the conference’s tasks in general, the fact that Europe is concerning itself with its future neighbours, particularly in the south, is a good thing, as is the announcement of a Foundation for dialogue between cultures, the creation of which still depends on the allocation of financial resources."
"Nevertheless, the orientations proposed by the Commission in its preparatory communication are still worrying."
"It is not certain that the new neighbourhood policy is sufficient to instil ‘a new dynamism into the Barcelona process’, since the approach of simply integrating these countries into the great European market means imposing liberal formulae on them, without taking account of their specific characteristics or the serious economic and social problems they are facing."
"Since this model is being increasingly criticised, and since even the French proposals for a relaunch of the partnership mention ‘consequences which could have a serious destabilising effect’, the Commission is not challenged at any point."
"Without taking account of the impact study of the free trade area which it itself has launched, it is moving in the opposite direction by enhancing the reciprocal liberalisation of agricultural and service exchanges."
"As for the call to turn to the private sector, it still falls far short of the needs of the Mediterranean countries."
"This short-term thinking is extremely dangerous."
"All of this means that we need joint construction in the Mediterranean, otherwise the almost constant stigmatisation and humiliation which the Arab-Muslim world, in particular, is subjected to, in addition to inequalities, can only feed religious fundamentalism or the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups."
"I will end with two further challenges: we must put an end to the obsession with security and establish freedom of movement."
"With regard to human rights, we should establish genuine specific mechanisms."
"I would like to express my solidarity with Radhia Nasraoui, the Tunisian lawyer, who has just begun a new hunger strike."
"Mr President, it was in Barcelona, the capital of my country, that the process of bringing the peoples of the two sides of the Mediterranean closer together began, eight years ago now."
"At that time, let us remember, the declaration at the origin of this process gave us great hope."
"Today, unfortunately, things are very different."
"The international context has seriously deteriorated and one of the theatres of crisis, one of the most important, is located precisely on one of the coasts of this sea across which we propose building bridges."
"What in Catalan we call , that is, disenchantment, is today the general dynamic."
"The living conditions of the peoples of North Africa have not improved in any respect."
"The Andalusian coasts regularly wash up the bodies of unfortunate North Africans who have fled misery in their notorious rafts."
"This human tragedy will only come to an end if we deploy all the necessary means to help these people to establish their own social, cultural and economic development."
"Here, excessive liberalism is quite simply murderous, and I am not sure that the creation of a free trade area will be the solution to these evils."
"Neither have we seen any real progress towards democracy and the promotion of civil society."
"Our individualist societies are constantly refining individual rights."
"That is all very well! But we must not forget collective rights."
"Please allow me to mention here the issue of the Western Sahara."
"I have the feeling that the market here could affect the legitimate rights of these people to self-determination, despite the promises of the United Nations."
"The legitimate representatives of the Saharan people now accept the new draft solution advocated by Kofi Annan’s special envoy."
"Morocco, the occupying power opposes it."
"We must demand that Morocco accept this plan before anything else."
"Mr President, I believe we can say with satisfaction that the European Parliament has worked to ensure that Euro-Mediterranean relations are a priority with the European Union’s foreign policy."
"This very afternoon we are going to deal with the strategy for a broader Europe – the Napoletano report – in which we point out the strategic importance of a more solid and global relationship with our Mediterranean partners and neighbours."
"Within this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers Conference in Naples is going to conclude an objective which has long been pursued by this Parliament, which is the transformation of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum into a genuine assembly."
"I believe that this represents a clear message in favour of strengthening this relationship in all areas and it must have a fundamental objective, which is to guarantee that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation functions correctly, because this new assembly will allow for the monitoring of the correct application of the European Union's association agreements with each and every one of our Mediterranean partners and that monitoring has been widely requested by the European Parliament."
"Given the broad content of each of these agreements, which includes clauses of a political nature, which go beyond the purely economic elements, the task of the assembly in practice would be the political control of relationships between each side of the Mediterranean."
"From now on, I believe we must make progress in four areas."
"Firstly, facilitating freedom of exchanges."
"The closer we get to establishing an area of free trade, the more we will contribute to economic and social development, facilitating the emergence of positive synergies."
"Secondly, on the definitive implementation of a Euro-Mediterranean cultural foundation, and I hope that this conference will adopt specific decisions in this area."
"Thirdly, we must combat human-trafficking mafias more decisively, and this involves more active participation in the fight against illegal immigration."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe we must not forget countries which are not part of the Barcelona process – I am referring to Libya and Mauritania."
"Parliament’s delegation for relations with the Maghreb is going to make them a priority in its efforts over the coming weeks and months."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that I believe there are reasons for us to be happy with this impulse, which will be given institutional shape in Naples, and which will allow us to work on new initiatives."
"Mr President, I believe that this debate must be seen in relation to the one we are going to hold this afternoon on relations with the new neighbouring countries."
"I believe we are at a key moment to relaunch those aspects which have made least progress in relation to the Barcelona agenda."
"And of these I am concerned in particular with the cultural and human fields."
"I believe we must make a great effort here."
"There is a field in which we could make this effort, if we are able to work on it in all its complexity: movement of people and immigration."
"We should try to make immigration a factor which strengthens relations and the stability between countries of origin and destination."
"We should create positive dynamics which could have an effect in economic terms, introducing concepts such as ‘mobility’, which is more suited to our times than the rigid and bureaucratic rules with which we intend to manage immigration."
"We should reintroduce onto our agenda the concept of ‘co-development’."
"We will be able to do a lot of work in this field, creating European Erasmuses or supporting local cooperation in many fields."
"On the basis of this global perspective, we could effectively combat illegal immigration and its most horrendous aspect, which has brought us horrifying images, such as the arrival of bodies, one after the other, on our coasts."
"We could combat illegal immigration organised by human traffickers."
"A new agenda, based on the proposals of the Commission and the Greek and Italian Presidencies before Thessaloniki, in relation to immigration and the countries in which it originates, could strengthen the human and cultural pillar of the Conference."
"Furthermore, so that the people who live amongst us can be a factor in stability and the promotion of our values, we must also work on our integration policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to place the emphasis on an important aspect of the preparation of the Naples meeting and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Italian Presidency on having paid particular attention, as is very logical, to the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union’s policy."
"It is a question of enhancing and applying the Euro-Mediterranean investment and association fund, based on credits from the European investment bank, in order to facilitate private investment and private enterprise."
"As chairman of the Mediterranean Committee of the European League for Economic Cooperation, for years I have been analysing the economic causes of the backwardness of the third countries of the Mediterranean in order to eliminate the imbalances with the European Union."
"This is a key aspect, that is, ensuring growth based on entrepreneurial spirit and taking advantage of the potential in those societies is fundamental in order to eliminate the existing imbalances."
"We believe that the fight against imbalances, against economic and social backwardness is largely based on economic development founded on entrepreneurial and private initiative and I therefore propose that particular attention be paid to this and that we follow recommendation no. 7."
"Mr President, from the Barcelona process until today, the whole of the Mediterranean basin has been convulsed by a series of problems, which are not only unresolved, but which in some cases are getting worse in an alarming manner."
"From the Middle East conflict to the insoluble situation in the Sahara, from the total lack of control of immigration, with the almost daily tragedies on the coasts of Andalusia and the Canary Islands, to which we can add human trafficking, drug trafficking and fanatical terrorism, which is not only being endured by some of our neighbouring countries, but which is using all its resources to also transfer itself to our European territory, these are some of the serious issues which we should be concerned about, very concerned about, at the Naples conference."
"We have common problems and also mutual responsibilities and each party must take on those responsibilities."
"Immigration, for example, can only be resolved if, as called for in the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, the countries of origin and receiving countries take on joint responsibility for controlling migratory flows and combating the organised mafias which promote illegal immigration."
"Border control is the task of both sides, not of just one."
"Development cooperation?"
"Whatever is needed and more."
"But the political and administrative structures of the Mediterranean third countries must behave transparently, and must respect human rights in order to promote easy and productive parliamentary and political dialogue such as that which must take place in the new assembly we are discussing today, so that this cooperation is effective, something which is unfortunately not the case in some of those countries, and I will not mention them by name, Mr President."
"Mr President, since the reunification of Europe is about to become a reality, even though, as we know, there is still much to do, we are witnessing a page of history being written."
"Now we have the Mediterranean on the next page."
"To turn the Mediterranean into an integrated whole containing almost 900 million men and women is our challenge for the next 30 years."
"In order to respond to this new challenge we need genuine ambition and instruments for dialogue."
"This instrument for political dialogue, which we need, is the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the Naples Conference must enshrine its birth, because only political dialogue can forge a genuine balanced, in-depth and lasting partnership."
"It is for that reason that the Euro-Parliamentary Forum has been in place since 1998. But with its informal configuration, it has remained a passive witness, overly dependent on the ups and downs of international events, and hostage to the conflagration in the Middle East."
"In Naples, this forum must become a genuine parliamentary assembly in order to acquire a new democratic legitimacy, in order to fulfil its role completely as an instrument of dialogue for peace, stability and regional development."
"I am convinced that it will be more than that, because it will also be a new departure point for all Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"This is the opportunity to create a new ambition for the South."
"The Union appears to have finally realised this, today, by trying to give form to what is known as the concept of neighbourhood."
"We must not, however, be mistaken in our objective."
"To distinguish and honour these good neighbours may mean that they will never be part of the family."
"It is no longer the time for a fool’s bargain for the South."
"The free trade area and the credo ‘Everything but institutions’, which prevailed until now within the context of Euro-Mediterranean relations, have been left behind."
"At political level, we must implement the future framework for Euro-Mediterranean relations, a free Union inspired by the Council of Europe, founded upon common objectives and shared values: common security, secularity, the rule of law and democracy."
"At economic level, we must launch a genuine Marshall plan for the Mediterranean with a view to genuinely establishing this shared prosperity, which was already included in the Barcelona declaration."
"With an eye on the clock, Commissioner Verheugen has declined to speak again."
"We regret that and thank him for it at the same time."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party and European Democrats, I should like to ask for the vote on Mrs Smet’s report to be moved to the first part-session in December."
"The reason is that the translations into various languages of paragraph 13, which will be incorporated into the report, arrived very late and the political groups wish to have the possibility of tabling amendments or calling for a separate vote."
"This proposal could not be made in the time available to us, because we followed the procedure under Rule 110a, which is why we are asking for the vote to be moved to the first part-session in December so that we would have the facility for various groups to request a separate vote on this paragraph."
"– Pursuant to the rules of procedure I will ask if anyone wishes to speak in favour of this request for a report and if anyone wishes to speak against."
"Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I think that the procedure followed was absolutely right and that today’s vote should not be postponed."
"In other words, we should proceed to vote on the report."
"We therefore do not accept Mrs Kratsa's proposed postponement."
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House of the problem that I came across yesterday."
"I had requested the use of the press briefing room from 3.30 p.m. to 4 p.m. to talk about the case of the Catalan separatists who were on trial in the morning before the European Court of Human Rights on the subject of allegations of torture by the State…"
"– I am sorry, Mr Mayol i Raynal, but the rules of procedure are very strict: your request should be made to the College of Quaestors and not to the House."
"If you have information to present to the House then you have time slots for that at the beginning of the sitting."
"I cannot interrupt the vote for an explanation of this kind. I hope that you will forgive me."
". Mr President, I would just like to inform the House that, in order to avoid confusion between chemical formulae and abbreviations, the English version of Annex I, part I is the correct text."
"– Do not worry, Mr Lisi. The language services will be informed."
". Mr President, I would clarify that some amendments voted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have been withdrawn, as shown on the list."
"I refer to Amendments Nos 11 and 12."
"– Indeed, it is, in principle, indicated on the lists."
"A significant part of Amendments Nos 11 and 12 has been withdrawn and does not form part of the so-called compromise package."
". Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of Parliament's views on this issue and takes them very seriously indeed."
"The institution is carrying out a thorough examination of the matter and of the appropriate internal procedures."
"On that basis my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, will be making a recommendation to the college of Commissioners in the near future."
"She wants me to assure you that we will fully respect our commitments under the framework agreement."
"You will be informed promptly of the Commission's decision."
". Mr President, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Its aim is to improve traceability in the event of an outbreak of disease, such as the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease."
"The committee believes that batch control systems should be allowed as well as the individual control system proposed by the Commission."
"This is the main point of difference with the Commission."
"The committee's proposal means that Member States will be able to adopt systems that are in keeping with their own sheep farming methods."
"During the debate last night, Commissioner Byrne did not move any closer to the committee's viewpoint."
"We agree on the need to improve traceability, but the issue dividing us is that harmonisation of the objective does not necessarily mean harmonisation of the method."
"By contrast, the Italian presidency has been extremely helpful, and the Council is now very close to the committee's position."
"For these reasons, after intensive procedural discussions this morning, involving the political groups and especially Mr Parish, the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur, we agreed that we should now conclude this matter during the Italian presidency."
"The strongest political signal we can give is that we should follow the unanimous vote in committee by a unanimous vote for the report this morning."
"– Very well, I infer from your statement Mr Adam, that this cancels any request for referral back to committee."
"We shall therefore proceed to the vote, as you requested."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that, in the context of inter-parliamentary relations, the Knesset Delegation for relations with the European Parliament, lead by its chairperson, Mrs Blumenthal, is visiting the European Parliament."
"In wishing Mrs Blumenthal and the members of her delegation a warm welcome, I would like to stress the importance that we attach to such a visit, in particular, given the current situation."
"The tragic events with which the Israeli and Palestinian people are faced on a daily basis, make the resumption of dialogue between these two parties – a dialogue that the European Parliament has always encouraged – more necessary than ever."
"This is why, and without wanting to go into detail about the conflict that has been affecting your region for too long, I hope that the meetings that you will have with Members of the European Parliament will be fruitful and that they will be able to contribute to better reciprocal information, so as to better bring about conditions, in which just and sustainable peace will finally be able to put an end to this interminable conflict that affects your region and which, day after day, causes the deaths of too many innocent victims amongst the Israeli and Palestinian populations."
"Mr Cappato, we are now voting and I would prefer to continue if that is acceptable."
"Especially after the announcement I have just made, I do not want to reopen the debates."
"–Given the time, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we postpone the votes."
"They will resume immediately after the formal sitting."
"I give the floor to Mr Chichester."
"Mr President, there is a little confusion as to why we have been asked to vote twice on this particular Karlsson report for rejection."
"Could you clarify the situation?"
"– Very well, you will have all the explanations you require."
"For the moment I shall suspend the sitting for a few minutes pending the formal sitting."
"(1)"
". Mr President, we now come to the vote on Amendment 24, the famous Nisticò compromise."
"There are some translation problems here."
"I would like to point out that the English version is the correct one."
"– We have taken note of your comment, even though I am not sure that the language of the sitting is English."
". Mr President, unfortunately I have to report that my efforts to reach a compromise that might also have met with agreement in the Council have failed."
"I must therefore unfortunately distance myself from the outcome of the vote and ask my fellow Members to vote against the report."
"– Very good, we will take note of your declaration, Mr Liese."
"The Moderate Party’s delegation to the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the report on women's rights and EU international relations."
"For us, it is obvious that men and women have the same rights."
"The best way of achieving prosperity in the world is through free trade."
"It is good that the EU sign trade and development agreements with other countries."
"We also think it good that these agreements include clauses concerning democracy and human rights so that the agreements can help improve the situation for the people of these countries."
"We do not wish this report to be interpreted in terms of the European Parliament being in favour of trade boycotts against those countries that do not fully comply with the agreements’ clauses concerning democracy and human rights."
"Trade boycotts generally harm vulnerable people in poor countries."
"The report basically focuses on the ACP countries, as a result of the Cotonou Agreement and on the countries of the Mediterranean, as a follow-up to the Barcelona Agreement."
"In particular, it addresses physical violence in Muslim countries, such as genital mutilation, mutilation with acid, public castigation, stoning, so-called 'crimes of honour', forced marriage and burnings."
"The other regions of the world are ignored."
"The proposal that calls on the Member States, when considering applications for refugee status, to take into account persecution and/or the fear of persecution which may be suffered by women on account of their gender is to be welcomed and fully deserves our support."
"We support the report's call to Member States to adopt specific legislation that bans genital mutilation, but we would draw attention to the need for an active policy for the social inclusion of these communities, particularly in the fields of housing, health, education and training."
"Discussions with the relevant institutions and NGOs working in third countries with the aim of gathering information on violence against women must be backed up by greater assistance and by better development aid programmes, specifically to ensure women's emancipation."
"Mr President, Mr Lisi’s report concerns the control of major-accident hazards involving the circulation of dangerous substances, particularly where the mining and transport of these products is concerned."
"I certainly could not vote against the report and so I voted for it, but I wonder and I put it to Mr Lisi: might not the euro be a dangerous substance which ought also to be classed as a dangerous substance against which we need to be protected when it is circulated?"
"Without wishing to shock you, Mr President, I am afraid that, in Italy, the circulation of the euro has brought an increase in the expenditure of all the workers and pensioners because its cost is significantly higher."
"I support this report by Mr Lisi recommending the adoption of a joint text agreed on in the Conciliation Committee and updating the Council directive on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances."
"We are particularly pleased that the following amendments by Parliament have been accepted, seeking:"
"- to extend the scope of the directive to cover hazardous substances such as potassium nitrate, which was the substance that caused the explosion at a factory in Toulouse in 2001, the death of thirty people and the injuries of around two thousand;"
"- to improve the training of all staff working in a potentially dangerous establishment, including all subcontractors, with priority to be given to initial emergency measures to be adopted in the event of accidents;"
"- to improve the information given to the public, with particular emphasis on establishing a database for land-use planning that will enable the compatibility of dangerous sites with sensitive areas to be assessed;"
"- to ensure that operators of dangerous plants draft publicly accessible safety reports, containing maps, images and equivalent descriptions;"
"Given the introduction of considerable improvements in the common position, which led to much greater progress than could have been predicted at second reading, I support..."
"Mr President, last night, I dreamt once again about Mr Fatuzzo the sailor who worked on a cruise ship sailing between New York and the Bahamas from 1963 to 1965."
"Since I had to express a view on Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ report on enhancing ship and port facility security, no one better than myself as a sailor in 1963 was qualified to give good advice."
"The advice I received, however, is that there needs to be another amendment: in other words, why does Mrs Miguélez Ramos not call next time for pensioners drawing their pension for the first time to be given a free cruise?"
"The objective of this Regulation is to transpose into Community law amendments adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and integrated into a new chapter of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as a consequence of 11 September 2001 and of the need to protect vessels and to improve maritime security against possible attacks."
"This will ensure that the international measures adopted in the IMO for national maritime transport are implemented in a standard manner throughout the European Community."
"These amendments to the SOLAS Convention and to part A of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) contains mandatory provisions that are open to differing interpretation and adaptation by the Member States."
"Part B of this Code consists of recommendations, but the Commission proposes that some be made mandatory provisions."
"Member States will only be able to adopt specific provisions on ports that only occasionally serve international traffic, although provision is made for a possible exemption from the obligation of security checks prior to entry into a port for ships engaged on a scheduled service within a Member State or between two or more Member States, and these must adopt a national plan to implement the provisions of the regulation."
"The report furthermore establishes a single national authority responsible for the safety of vessels and of port facilities, it makes the Commission responsible for checks and assessments and entrusts the European Safe Seas Agency with the task of assisting the Commission in performing these duties."
"The Commission presented the proposal now before us in order to incorporate into Community law the provisions adopted by the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation, the definitive version of which was adopted in London (December 2002) by the International Diplomatic Conference of the Governments that are signatories to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS Convention of 1974)."
"This is an extremely important convention."
"In practice, the principles applied to air transport are transferred to maritime transport, with the Member States having to draw up national maritime security plans that lay down security standards and appoint a competent national authority, which will be the sole authority responsible in this field and will have the specific task of guaranteeing the security of vessels, by issuing certificates."
"I am aware of the enormous vulnerability of this sector and taking account of the security measures advocated by the report for vessels and port facilities, as constituted by the vessel/port interface, but not for ports themselves properly speaking, I urge the Commission to persevere with its desire to present a legislative initiative to regulate protection of Community ports."
"I share the rapporteur's concern about the financial implications of these safety measures and I support her call to the Commission to present a study of this matter."
"I voted in favour."
"– Where security is concerned, there can be neither exemptions nor lax tolerance."
"Maritime transport needs to be dissociated from the laws of maximum profit and another International Maritime Organisation created capable of respecting social needs, workers and the environment."
"There need to be more regulations and more coercive international laws, and a ban placed on the system of ports of convenience."
"The loss of the oil tanker scarcely a year ago, together with its human, social and environmental consequences, remind us each day, from La Coruñato Calais, of these necessities."
"My priority in this area is not the fight against terrorism but that against the maritime hooligans."
"I have supported all the amendments aimed at including in the regulation the strengthening of security measures in Community ports, at covering all the personnel concerned, not only seafarers but also all professionals working on a casual basis in port areas, and at extending the scope of the regulation to include ships transporting containers, petroleum products and dangerous materials."
"For these reasons, I have voted in favour of this report."
"Mr Paasilinna’s report calls for a European information network security agency to be established, clearly and, in particular, combating information, computer and electronic communication line piracy."
"However, I believe, Mr President, that Mr Paasilinna would have produced a better report if there had also been an amendment providing more security against pirates who take money from workers, money which the workers should have been able to keep for themselves for their pensions."
"It would therefore be better if there were measures to combat the piracy of information networks and to combat theft of pensioners’ money."
"– The agency that the Council is preparing to put in place is charged with ‘network and information security’."
"Its founders are mainly preoccupied with what they call ‘the business community’ and by protecting this little world against ‘cyber crime’."
"Certain elements of the aforesaid ‘business community’ will probably enjoy financial spin-offs from this matter, for the agency will call upon their services to deliver information security."
"We obviously have nothing against better information security."
"Since, however, the protection of business secrets in relations between private companies is not among our preoccupations, we have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of this proposal."
"Improving the security of networks at Community level, be they public or private, is becoming increasingly necessary, primarily because of the concerns of citizens, businesses and economic operators in general as a result of the genuine 'explosion' that the Internet has experienced."
"The almost infinite amount of information available on the Internet, and its amazing capacity for transmitting data, have given users easy and frequent access which, as we know, makes fertile ground for criminal activities, often designed to damage the system, calling into question its reliability and security."
"The Commission proposal states, in particular, that ‘the Agency shall facilitate the application of Community measures relating to network and information security."
"The assistance it provides shall help ensure interoperability of security functions in networks and information systems, thereby contributing to the functioning of the Internal Market’."
"I fully agree."
"I also believe that this Agency must be designed to actively seek solutions to the problems arising from cyber crime, which means, of course, looking very closely at the particular situation of risk and greater exposure with which our children are confronted."
". –Theproposal for a Council recommendation on cancer screening is particularly important for informing and educating the public, raising awareness about premonitory symptoms, timely diagnosis and more effective treatment."
"Alongside proposals for mammography screening for women aged 50-69, for faecal occult blood testing of people aged 50-74 and for cervical smears for women aged 20-30, other urgent actions are needed."
"One of these is special programmes in selected workplaces in which, because of the environment, there is a serious risk of cancer."
"Another action is special programmes and diagnostic tests in universities and higher education in general, so that watching out for cancer becomes a forced 'routine' from a young age."
"– Cancer is a terrible disease that affects millions of Europeans and other human beings on the planet."
"I have always said, and I repeat, that, in terms of research funds and of methods of treating patients and supporting the terminally ill, society makes insufficient efforts to combat this disease, given its scale and seriousness."
"Screening is part of what is required, and I therefore support this, but it does not solve all the problems."
"Once the disease has been diagnosed, it has to be treated so as to cure the patient."
"Around one in every four Europeans (totalling approximately one million per year) will fall victim to cancer."
"This is an enormous burden, both in human terms, for cancer sufferers and their families, and in terms of the resources used in the diagnosis, treatment and care of this disease."
"Consequently, the fight against cancer through the programme 'Europe against Cancer', set up in 1985, has been a long-standing European priority."
"In the opinion of the rapporteur, my friend and colleague, Mr Mussa, who in the debates received the enthusiastic support of the shadow rapporteurs of all groups, ‘it is consequently crucial to develop the action undertaken by the Union through the following means:"
"(a) information and health education for European citizens"
"(b) carrying out forms of screening which have already proven their worth"
"(c) periodic checks on the quality of screening"
"(d) research into the applicability of new screening methods."
"The Commission's document will allow Europe to take unified action against what is a widespread, cruel and socially destructive disease."
"The urgent need for strategic action to combat cancer at European level is demonstrated by the alarming epidemiological data’."
"In this context, my vote was not only favourable but also enthusiastic, hoping that this recommendation will be adopted because, although it is not legally binding, it is a real political priority."
"I roundly congratulate Mr Mussa on his excellent report on an issue that is a matter of grave concern to us – cancer and its early detection."
"This is a terrible disease, which is one of the main causes of death, directly affects many citizens, and consequently also affects their families."
"We also know, in particular through studies that have been published, that around one in four Europeans will fall victim to cancer."
"Although this is a recommendation that is not legally binding, this proposal must be seen as a political priority."
"An indication of this is the overwhelming vote in plenary: 528 in favour and only 6 against."
"I also wish to express my satisfaction at all the support obtained in the specialised Parliamentary committee for this proposal, specifically through the proposals for secondary prevention measures that facilitate early diagnosis and which, consequently, involve therapies that are less aggressive and more bearable."
"I also welcome the very clear commitment to promoting an aware and unafraid attitude to screening programmes, and also the commitment to the information campaign designed to teach people how to diagnose themselves."
"Mr Adam’s report, Mr President, deals with the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals."
"I voted for the motion: it is certainly good to register the development of sheep and goats too, but the wish expressed to me by a pensioner citizen is that Europe would also concern itself – and I hope Mr Adam will do so soon – with the registration and preservation of pension contributions paid in by workers, contributions which often, frequently – as least, this happens in Italy and, I fear, in other European States too – get lost somewhere in the process, disappear, resulting in the workers receiving lower pensions than they are entitled to."
"We must therefore ensure that years of work are registered and monitored throughout a person’s life."
"This proposal for a regulation seeks to provide a response, in the current framework, to the need to record and trace the movements of sheep and goats in order to improve identification of affected animals in the event of an epidemic."
"This is the system that the European Parliament itself recommended, in its resolution of 17 December 2000, on the basis of the report by the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease, specifically the priority nature of identification."
"Although important, these measures do not resolve the problems facing our agricultural model."
"What is needed, in particular, is to reduce the transport and specifically the export of living animals to the absolute minimum, to combat the disappearance of local slaughterhouses, to encourage local production and short distribution channels, to combat the policy of under-investment in veterinary inspection services and to take account of the problems arising from abolishing internal borders."
"This regulation raises three important issues for producers, particularly small producers: the proportionality of the administrative and bureaucratic burden, the feasibility of meeting the deadlines set and payment of the costs."
"The report proposes some simplification of the system, such as extending deadlines, Community involvement in the future electronic identification system and Community funding of the total set-up costs for individualised identification systems."
"Only in this way can we avoid seeing the number of producers leaving the sector increase."
"The proposal for a regulation sets out a system of individual and batch identification and for the species in question, providing an opportunity for using electronic identification."
"The intention is to improve the system of identification and to create a computerised system for recording the movements of sheep and goats so as to allow rapid and precise traceability, which is crucial to monitoring diseases and potential problems or incidents affecting public health."
"Since the effectiveness of this technology has not been properly tested in all the Member States, and since it is not practical or economical to apply it in all situations, I believe it is important that the Commission produces a report on the experience gained in this field, which would analyse the economic repercussions of the electronic identification system before it is introduced on a universal and mandatory basis."
"I share the rapporteur’s concern at the adequacy and feasibility of the proposal that has been made, I agree with the amendments he has tabled and I can vouch for the concern he has demonstrated for with the large specialised workforce, which is rapidly ageing and has a very low level of income. These farmers face having to leave the profession because of the increased costs borne by producers, and this is reason enough for the Union to cover the costs of introducing the individualised identification system."
"I voted in favour."
"The report demonstrates the need for a common registration system for sheep and goats, using a database and similar to the systems that exist for cattle farming and pig farming."
"A majority of the European Parliament wishes, however, to make an important distinction where this system is concerned, namely in the way it is funded."
"The existing systems are funded from fees, whereas the desire is to fund the new system concerning sheep and goats from Community funds."
"For this reason, I have voted against the report as a whole."
"At a stage when the EU faces the demand for reform of the common agricultural policy, it is unfortunate that Parliament wishes to impose further costs upon the common EU budget."
"Recitals 5b and 17a, in particular, make it clear that the costs should be met by the EU."
"Recital 5b reads: ‘The entire cost of introducing the new electronic identification system should be met from the Community budget since this is a food safety and control measure affecting the whole production chain and since it is the producers who will have to put into operation and manage the system’."
"Mr President, with this report, Mr Blokland calls for freedom of movement in Europe for waste – urban waste, industrial waste – and I voted for the motion."
"However, I would be pleased if European pensioner citizens were to be considered worthy of at least as much freedom of movement as is given to urban and industrial waste."
"As you know, those who receive a welfare allowance, such as hearing- or visually-impaired people or citizens who need constant assistance, lose the right to draw their disability allowance if they travel in Europe outside their own national state."
"I would therefore prefer the directive in question to address the movement of pensioner citizens as well as waste."
"– The shipment of waste is fundamental to the fight in which we, the developed countries, are engaged to maintain economic development and protect the environment."
"I therefore subscribe to the line taken by the Blokland report."
"I nonetheless rebel against the obstacles that impede the recovery of waste, which – supported by the Court of Justice’s judgement in case C-228/00 – will penalise my country’s cement manufacturers."
"Thirty-six per cent of the alternative sources of energy used for the manufacture of cement comes from waste, which basically comes from neighbouring countries."
"If such shipment of waste were jeopardised, there would be dual emission of pollutants from Belgian cement works; that is to say, pollutants from waste and those originating from the fuel used in the cement works."
"This dual emission would be costly and harmful to the environment."
"Moreover, cement works would be vulnerable to job losses in regions already badly affected (Objective 1)."
"That is why I am against the amendments opposing recovery."
"To make use of the precautionary principle when the answers are known is an admission of powerlessness to control pollution."
"That is certainly the case when it comes to intermediate waste sorting centres, banned because they are unable to monitor the precise destination and traceability of the waste in question."
"Although progress has been made since the last report, all the Member States were late in responding to the questionnaire (Portugal and Ireland by more than a year)."
"Progress has been made on drawing up waste management plans, although some countries do not have such plans or are not implementing them, and consequently various legal proceedings have been opened as a result of failure to comply with the directive."
"The aim of stabilising waste production to 1985 levels is not affected, because reduction measures have not been defined by the Member States and/or by the Commission, which is urging the Member States to step up the separate collection of recyclable materials and to have sufficient recycling and recovery capacity as well as waste incineration capacity with energy recovery without better processing alternatives."
"We broadly support the positions put forward in the report and the measures proposed, particularly those that would lead to countries being self-sufficient in waste processing and to the directive being complied with and revised, in particular as regards conditions for the recovery, disposal, control and use of waste based on minimum criteria that take account of the environmental impact of these operations; regulations on gaseous or other emissions must be equal for all processes."
". I fully support the European Commission in its very strict approach to regulating the shipment of waste on EU territory and in EU waters."
"Likewise, I commend the rapporteur for his excellent work on the matter."
"Many of his amendments go towards tightening up even further the rules and controls."
"We are all aware of the devastating consequences on our environment – as well as on animal and sometimes human life – that can result when adequate controls are not in place for the transport of waste products."
"In recent weeks we witnessed the attempt to bring a flotilla of decrepit decommissioned US warships through EU waters."
"I hope that appropriate legal measures will prevent the remaining 'rust buckets' laden with hazardous waste from crossing the Atlantic to be dismantled in the UK."
"Indeed, unless we prevent this deadly cargo from setting out on its journey, it will pass within a very short distance of the south-east coast of Ireland and my constituency of Leinster, Ireland."
"I agree that there will be a certain administrative cost associated with implementing the new controls proposed by the Commission."
"I welcome this Commission proposal, which I believe meets the expectations of the citizens of the European Union both in terms of increasing levels of environmental protection, and as regards efforts for the treatment, recycling, recovery and transport of waste."
"The belief that environmentally responsible waste management is crucial is fortunately now widely accepted."
"Solid proof of this is the impact on the media that the transport of waste (and pollutants), in particular by sea and inland waterway, has had recently."
"Waste operators today – whether they are simply transporters or responsible for treatment, recycling or recovery – must be required to meet the highest possible safety and protection standards and procedures."
"To this end, regulations for control must also be established, depending on the type of waste transported and on the way in which it will be processed at its destination."
"I also agree with the proposals for a Red List (more dangerous substances) and a Green List (less dangerous substances)."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise the importance, in these matters, of constantly sharing information and best practice because of the frequent doubts, of a scientific and technical nature, about the fate that should be reserved for certain types of waste."
"Mr President, we all believe in supporting measures that help to cure diseases in our society."
"It is also clear that medical scientists are very divided on this issue."
"I myself believe that there are alternatives to embryonic stem cell research."
"There are numerous examples of this and it is not fair to say that those of us who are against this research are against finding cures for these diseases."
"The Commission's proposals for funding for research activities, which are illegal in some Member States, are flying in the face of the subsidiarity principle, and that should not happen."
"This is clearly a very sensitive issue."
"I have tabled amendments to state that we do not support EU funds being made available for embryonic stem cell research in Europe."
"The European Parliament having expressed its views, this matter now moves into the domain of the Council of Ministers and the national governments."
"Mr President, I also voted against the Liese report."
"We have to be very careful."
"Whether we like it or not, we live in Huxley's Brave New World."
"We need to be very careful about the kind of power and leeway we give to scientists."
"I find the kind of lobbying that went on grossly offensive, using illnesses such as Alzheimer's – which my father died from – as an excuse to go ahead with embryo stem cell research."
"Many scientists have said that in the case of Alzheimer's adult stem cells are more reliable."
"It is completely unacceptable that European taxpayers' money should be used to fund something that is not allowed in some Member States."
"If Member States want to do it, let them use their own taxpayers' money, not funds that are for the whole of the European Union."
"If Mr Ó Neachtain feels so strongly about this, let him resign from his party if his government will not vote against this in the Council of Ministers."
"The Irish Government must vote against this!"
"There is no point in making a lot of loud statements here if the government will not follow through on what it is supposed to do and support Germany and the other countries that are opposed."
"That is the only logical and honest approach."
"Mr President, I voted today to reject restrictions on embryo stem cell research."
"I am very pleased that the House has decided likewise."
"Unlike the previous speaker, I believe we should congratulate those organisations such as the Parkinson's Disease Society, the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Society and other organisations who worked hard to bring to Members' attention the real benefits that people suffering from those conditions have gained from stem cell research and hope to gain in the future."
"This topic keeps coming up in this House and many Members are trying to use the European Parliament to fight a different battle – a battle about banning embryo research and a battle about abortion."
"I hope that today's vote means they will leave that aside and recognise that this is a proper matter for national competence in the first place, and that it is quite proper that we should use European funding to finance research which can help tackle very serious conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also voted against today’s proposal because I cannot support the use of common resources for purposes of research that is expressly prohibited in some Member States."
"Precisely because the Member States’ individual laws differ greatly on the matter of human embryo research, more restrictive positions on embryo research should not be ignored."
"It must therefore be left to each Member State to take its own decision, in accordance with its own laws, about the kind of research on which it will spend money and about the research purposes for which no funding will be made available."
"Finally, in view of the fact that, unlike adult stem cell research, there have still not been any unquestionably promising results in embryo research, I cannot understand why funding should be provided from the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Mr President, my voters do not want their tax money to be used to kill unborn human beings, even if, unlike in Germany, it is permitted for research purposes in many Member States."
"For this reason I came out quite clearly against this report as it now stands and have from the outset supported the clear line taken by Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and by Mr Gargani."
"We were, however, prepared to go a long way in a compromise motion in order to prevent something worse."
"I would like to thank Mr Nisticò and Mr Liese for giving this House the opportunity for a compromise that is so far-reaching but which sets limits."
"Unfortunately, this was turned down by a tiny liberal left majority of this House and I must make it perfectly clear that that is probably the end of compromises in this matter."
"This House is divided on this important issue and I imagine there is the same division in the Council of Ministers."
"I do not believe that we should use our in any case meagre research funding to finance such highly controversial research on so divisive an issue; we ought to concentrate on things that are not controversial in the EU and leave this question, to which the principle of subsidiarity should apply, to the Member States."
". I voted for the Liese report because it is a moderately pro-science position, as voted."
"My mother died of Parkinson's disease and I watched the long-term degeneration of her life."
"I hope that future research will help to combat this dreadful condition."
"My vote is for my mother, and my colleague Nicholas Bethel."
". We welcome the result of today's vote on the Liese report on the 6th Framework Programme."
"The issue of funds for collaborative research projects using human embryonic stem cells and stem cell lines was discussed in depth in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who reached a consensus view, reproduced today in Parliament."
"This will allow us to continue with this vital research which has the potential to bring relief to millions of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes sufferers."
"Several colleagues tabled amendments to the report seeking to express their own, or nationally based views on the matter, which would impose restrictive conditions on deadlines for use of stem cells or stem cell lines."
"This would discourage or simply prevent innovative research in this area confining scientists and researchers to using ageing supernumerary embryos which are not in the best condition and could even result in an increasing number of stem cells being consumed for this purpose."
"There is no ethical consensus on this issue in Europe."
". I support the Liese report because I believe that stem cell research may hold the key to restoring and regenerating many vital bodily functions lost in various devastating illnesses and injuries."
"This proposal may offer the possibility of treating Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, strokes, burns, heart diseases, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis."
"The proposal is to fund research only in Member States where such funding is requested."
"Research would only involve embryos created before June 2002 for medically assisted IVF treatment but now 'supernumerary' and which would otherwise be destroyed."
"Embryos would have to be voluntarily donated with informed consent and without payment."
"Researchers would have to fully comply with comprehensive ethical and legal rules."
"Research would only be funded where it meets agreed objectives and where there is no adequate alternative."
"Furthermore the results would be made public."
"In these circumstances, I believe the European Parliament should adopt this proposal and all Member States should support the European Parliament's position in Council on 27th November."
"Although I must statethat the debate on defining the priorities and funding of scientific research at Community level in the context of the Sixth Framework Programme is not simply about the important issue of funding for research into stem cells, I agree with the position advocated by my group, which is to:"
"- reject attempts to prevent Community funding for research based on stem cells, in particular embryonic stem cells, taking place in EU Member States that allow this practice;"
"- respect the national legislation of the EU Member States that reject this possibility;"
"- confirm the aim of pursuing, in a regulated way, research in this field in an attempt to alleviate or cure diseases, in particular those caused by the degeneration of specific cells, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and diabetes."
"This being the case, I reject direct or indirect attempts to limit or even to more or less totally prevent the Community funding of research in this field."
"– The Commission proposes funding embryonic stem cell research despite the opposition of certain Member States which prohibit this and in contempt, too, of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Embryonic stem cell research, which automatically entails the destruction of the embryo, is completely contrary to the principle of human dignity recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 2)."
"This research also presents technical problems."
"We are not yet at the stage of research for therapeutic purposes."
"Even if we are concerned here with fundamental research, nothing justifies using new embryos : that is Mr Liese’s compromise."
"Very few of us have talked about the suffering of those who are ill and of the need to find treatments as a matter of urgency."
"Now, that is in fact the question posed by stem cell research."
"In the present state of research, only the use of adult stem cells offers hope."
"It presents no ethical and technical problems, but does not unfortunately have enough financial resources at its disposal."
"That is why the bulk of European funds should be used to finance this type of research which, alone, will be able to meet the urgent requirements of those who are ill."
"For all these reasons, I shall support the Gargani amendments, which I have co-signed."
"On matters involving the use of Community funds, but which affect areas that, in terms of their respective legality or illegality, fall within the sphere of national legislation and on which the Member States adopt differing responses, the European Union must refrain totally from providing funding."
"Otherwise, it will be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity. This is not a question of the European Union’s banning or authorising something that does not fall within its sphere of competence; it is a question of not interfering indirectly, by financial means, in exclusive national competences and of preventing taxpayers’ money from being used to fund programmes and activities which, in their own Member States, are banned or constitute illegal acts."
"By not respecting this guideline, the Commission proposal clearly breaches the principle of subsidiarity and I therefore voted against it."
"As regards stem cells and the hopes for this research, I suggest that, without prejudice to what each Member State does with its own financial resources, all European funding for research must be channelled towards adult stem cells."
"This does not raise ethical or legal problems and experiments on this type of cell have brought tangible results that are extremely encouraging, which is not the case with embryonic stem cells."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his efforts to reach a compromise limit, and on the clarity of his final statement of rejection the proposal on seeing that a majority would once again make it impossible."
"– I am very pleased that, against the advice of the rapporteur, Mr Liese, the European Parliament has today opened the door to the funding of research into embryonic stem cells."
"Through this vote, the European Parliament is delivering a genuine message of hope to all patients (diabetics, those suffering from Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases and people with chronic heart failure and other diseases)."
"It gives researchers the means of finding, and perhaps soon, remedies for incurable diseases."
"There are three reasons why I voted as I did."
"Firstly, my vote was perfectly consistent with the position adopted by the Strasbourg plenary on 15 May 2002 on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development."
"The creation of embryos from gametes donated for the purpose of obtaining stem cells is therefore prohibited."
"Secondly, the five Member States opposed to any funding of embryonic stem cell research will not be able to prevent Europe from advancing, since such funding is in the interests of Europeans awaiting treatment."
"Thirdly, the opponents of this form of regenerative medicine find their position to be self-contradictory."
"They are people who consider that the embryo is an entirely independent living being from the first day but who are in favour, however, of the destruction of supernumerary embryos cultivated for the purposes of fertilisation."
"I have supported the rapporteur, Mr Liese, from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in his ambition to introduce stricter ethical guidelines for the EU’s funding and monitoring of research."
"In the same spirit, I have voted in favour of Amendments 37 to 44, which were signed by myself and many other MEPs and which have been rejected."
"In the final vote, I voted against the report as a whole. It was, however, adopted by 298 votes in favour, 214 votes against and 21 abstentions."
"Research into embryonic stem cells is incompatible with the Irish Constitution and banned by law in Germany, Austria and Portugal."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in view of the big differences in the Member States’ legislation on research involving the use of human embryos, it should be up to each Member State to decide for itself whether it is to fund such research using national funds."
"It is therefore unfair to those states that ban research into embryonic stem cells to compel their citizens to contribute to the EU’s common research budget for an activity that is illegal in their countries."
"Such coercion is also contrary to the spirit of European cooperation."
"My hope is therefore that the Council will reject the European Parliament’s majority view."
"We believe that priority should be given to the ethically and legislatively uncontroversial research using adult stem cells."
". As parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent, in keeping with the laws and constitutions of our sovereign Member States."
"We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended."
"It is unacceptable for human life, whatever its age, to be treated as a commercial product, without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos."
"It is deeply disturbing that the European Commission, supported by Members of this Parliament and certain Member State governments, including Ireland, have succeeded in imposing public funding of controversial and unethical research without proper public debate and without the opportunity for national parliaments to respond."
"There has certainly been no debate in Dáil Éireann."
"This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions, but also the conscience of millions of citizens."
"It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research."
"This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and, as our rapporteur has pointed out, is high-risk."
"Mr President, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, a Spaniard, calls with this report for soil protection through a range of different maps and legislation – so that we preserve our ability to produce top-quality agricultural produce."
"I welcome this but, reading about soil protection, I had the sudden desire to ask the rapporteur, to ask Europe, whether we ought not to be endeavouring to ensure that, in connection with soil, our governors too, rather than having their heads in the clouds, keep their feet on the ground, that they walk safely with their feet on the ground."
"All too often, indeed, they think about the stars and the sky rather than the everyday needs of all the citizens."
"Mr President, I will conclude, if I may, by saying that we need more presidents like you, for all the states of Europe need presidents called ‘Onesta’ – if you will forgive the play on words – not just France."
"– My surname thanks you for that remark, Mr Fatuzzo."
"The report addresses basic aspects of the important issue of soil protection, which should be taken into consideration in future resolutions, but it will be hard to comply with the timetable that has been proposed."
"Some targets, especially for Portugal, will be difficult to achieve, bearing in mind on the one hand, the reality of the Portuguese situation and, on the other, various scientific and technical issues, specifically the presentation by the Commission, before July 2004, of a thematic strategy for soil protection that should define problems, qualitative and quantitativeobjectives and the means by which they can be achieved, timetables and general principles for evaluation and monitoring."
"Presenting a strategy of this nature will require the cooperation of the Member States and, given the current state of actions being undertaken by the working groups set up for this purpose, it will be hard to achieve all the stated objectives in time."
"By the same token, although there is a need to produce what is being called a ‘scientific soil catalogue’ – a need that has been felt by the various researchers and specialists in this area for a long time – and this must be supported, the proposed timetable nevertheless appears to be very limited."
"The attempt to harmonise methods of soil analysis in order to obtain comparable data would be even more difficult."
"Lastly, the implications of these ‘concerns’ in agri-environmental policies must be evaluated, particularly in social and economic terms, so as to not render the farming sector unviable."
"Erosion, the decline in organic matter, contamination, sealing (caused by the construction of houses, roads and other infrastructures), compaction (caused by mechanical pressure resulting from the use of heavy plant, overgrazing, sporting activities), the decline in biodiversity and salinisation (the excessive accumulation of soluble sodium, magnesium and calcium salts), and floods and landslides constitute worrying threats to soil in the Member States."
"In this regard, despite the fact that there is no specific European policy on this matter, actions undertaken in the context of other policies, such as environmental, agricultural, regional, transport or research policies, clearly have an effect on soil protection, which is so necessary."
"I am voting in favour of this report, although I feel that the Commission has ridden roughshod over the principle of subsidiarity by proposing legislation on this matter."
"Despite the fact that this strategy is only being announced, we would be entitled to ask what would be the added value of European action beyond exchanging information, knowledge and best practice, and what is the need to look at the of urbanisation and regional planning, given that the issue of soil varies enormously from one Member State to the next, and even within each Member State."
"Mr President, Mr Blokland’s report concerns the movement of waste in Europe, waste from towns and from outside towns."
"I voted for the motion because this certainly represents progress for Europe, but I would like Mr Blokland and Europe to concern themselves more with the free movement of citizens too, particularly pensioners and particularly pensioners with disabilities because, at the moment, I am afraid, under Regulation 1408, people in receipt of social benefits and healthcare allowances – such as hearing- and visually-impaired people and those requiring assistance – lose the right to draw their disability allowance if they travel in Europe."
"There must be as much freedom of movement for European citizens as there is provided for in this directive for urban and industrial waste."
"I voted in favour of this report, because I agree with the principle that when it comes to environmental matters, we must always try to raise stringency levels."
"The environment recognises no borders and concerns everyone."
"Data submitted by the Member States on the processing, recovery or recycling of waste must be more reliable and provided more promptly."
"I agree in particular that the Member States should be instructed to draw up plans for waste management or for improving existing plans, primarily to promote measures designed to encourage the prevention or reduction of waste production."
"I must, however, express my unhappiness at the general tone of the report when it recommends giving the Commission greater powers to punish and to levy taxes in environmental matters, calling for infringement proceedings to be initiated depending on the higher or lower quantity/quality of the data provided by the Member States."
"It is crucial that such action, which should focus more on monitoring, vigilance and prevention and less on punishment, is based on reliable data, particularly as regards the nature of the waste treated."
"As the rapporteur himself points out, however, the first harmonised statistics will only be available in 2006."
"We will not, therefore, have all the elements we need objectively to evaluate the ‘relative’ dimension of waste treatment in the European Union."
"– That concludes this morning’s agenda."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the EU-Russia Summit.(1)"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russian Federation Summit has been one of the most important events to be held during the Italian Presidency in the field of the Union’s relations with third countries because of the strategic significance of relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Russia, too, attaches great importance to the Summit."
"Initially created as a forum for political dialogue, over the course of the years the Summit has become an occasion for both parties to review and revitalise at the highest level the entire spectrum of their cooperation."
"The Villa Madama Summit gave the go-ahead for the practical implementation of the St Petersburg Declaration, where it lays down that European Union-Russia relations must be built around common spaces, to be created in the medium to long term within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently in force."
"The main aim was to make further progress in respect of all the common spaces by making the best use of existing structures and tools with a view to enhancing strategic relations and driving forward the process of integrating the Russian Federation into Europe."
"For the European Union, the Summit provided an opportunity to remind Moscow of our common commitment to tackling the current challenges and to discharging in a coordinated manner our shared responsibility for the environmental protection of the continent, and of the need to share information and work together to resolve the problems caused by climate change."
"The meeting allowed the European Union and the Russian Federation to look at current global issues, including crisis situations and what are known as the frozen conflicts in the region."
"The Italian Presidency, however, was concerned with keeping the main emphasis on the creation of the four common spaces and on the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation, and therefore focused on the major tangible achievements of the Summit, in particular a Joint Declaration on the CFSP and on cooperation in crisis management, the signing of the Agreement between Europol and the Russian Federation, the start of talks on the visa-free regime and the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation."
"The Russians endorsed the approach and the emphasis given to the creation of the four spaces."
"The Summit, which took place at a sensitive moment in Russian domestic politics – parliamentary elections will be held next December and presidential elections in March 2004 – also afforded President Putin an opportunity to strengthen the ties drawing the European Union and the Russian Federation increasingly close together."
"To this end, President Putin reiterated the need to activate the Permanent Partnership Council, within which and within whose various formats representatives of key areas of EU-Russia cooperation will be able to exchange views and work together."
"Addressing himself to strategic considerations, President Putin expressed Moscow’s concerns at the short- and medium-term consequences of enlargement on both economic and trade relations and political relations between the Russian Federation and former Soviet Bloc countries – with particular reference to the Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic states – in view of the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States."
"In reply to President Putin, we made it quite clear that the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is an obligation with which the Russian Federation must comply within the timeframe laid down and is an essential condition for strengthening its relations with the 25-Member State Europe."
"The Summit also looked at the state of progress of the talks for the Russian Federation’s future membership of the WTO which, despite significant unresolved issues, both sides hope will be achieved before the end of 2004."
"Both the European and the Russian sides looked forward to the ending of current visa regulations, and noted with satisfaction that talks on the preliminaries for a visa-free system had begun and that the current visa regulations were to be relaxed immediately on a bilateral and, of course, reciprocal basis."
"One of the key moments in the Summit was the ceremony of the signing of two agreements: the renewed Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation and the Europol-Russia Agreement on the exchange of strategic analyses and cooperation in police training, which is a tangible sign of the willingness of the Russian Federation to work alongside the European Union in the field of Justice and Home Affairs."
"In constant association with the Commission and the Secretariat, the Italian Presidency put a great deal of effort into the preparations for this event."
"It was discussed on 28 October at the meeting of the European Union Troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, as well as at a number of meetings of senior officials of the Italian Presidency and the Russian Federation."
"It was necessary, in particular, to overcome a twofold difficulty. This consisted, on the one hand, of the Russians’ high expectations of a leap forward in their relations with the European Union, and, on the other, of the more rigid position adopted by the majority of Member States with regard to what they see as Moscow’s inadequate commitment to giving practical effect to the political pledges it has made."
"Precisely because of its joint nature, being the result of a compromise, the Joint Declaration issued at the end of the Summit was achieved only after long, hard negotiations between the Russian Federation, on the one hand, and the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretariat on the other."
"It thus represents the reconciliation of conflicting demands and is a sensitive compromise between the demands of many of the Member States, which had wanted explicit reference to be made to all the controversial issues, and the desire of the Russians for a very pared-down Declaration limited to highlighting the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before examining the individual elements of the Summit, I should like to make it clear that all the issues on the agenda were dealt with fully in our talks with President Putin."
"They included the situation in Chechnya, the failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the issue of Moldova and Transnistria and the implications of the judicial proceedings involving the group."
"As regards Chechnya, in particular, I should like to point out that not only was the issue raised at the initiative of the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, but ample debating time was dedicated to the subject during the plenary session."
"If there is no mention of this issue in the final Summit Declaration, this is owing to the considerations that I mentioned a short while ago to the effect that this was a proposal on which agreement had to be reached, and thus the fruit of a brokerage exercise."
"The Commission, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Presidency all agreed that the reference made to the joint declaration was acceptable as an outcome."
"These, therefore, are the reasons."
"In respect of domestic developments in Russia, President Putin described the internal political and economic situation with reference also to the parliamentary elections next December and the presidential elections the following March, and in the light of the events connected with the affair."
"He reiterated Russia’s clear intention to carry on with its privatisation programme and continue with the process of creating an independent judicial system and strengthening the public institutions."
"We replied that, although we had absolutely no intention of interfering in Russian domestic affairs, we would continue to follow the affair very closely, and that we were confident that the Russian judiciary would act with complete transparency and in accordance with the law and would give the international community and the business community its full assurance that the ongoing reforms would not be obstructed, and that Russia would continue to follow the principles of the market economy."
"In response to a specific request from the Presidency, President Putin illustrated the efforts that Moscow is making to begin political and institutional reconstruction in Chechnya by means of a referendum, amnesty and elections, and invited European representatives to visit the region."
"For our part, we expressed our solidarity with Russia in the fight against Chechen terrorism as well as our support for a constitutional reform that encompasses ever-wider sections of the Chechen population that are not compromised by terrorism."
"We renewed our appeal for all possible efforts to be made to speed up the release of Arjan Erkel, the representative who was abducted in the Caucasus in August 2002, and expressed the hope that an ECHO office would be opened in the area."
"President Putin suggested that one could be opened in Chechnya itself, and that he would personally guarantee its security."
"As regards the common economic space, the Summit sanctioned an agreed strategy that, we hope, will increase the level of interdependence between our economies in the coming years."
"We now have to decide upon the appropriate institutional forum for the operational follow-up, perhaps extending the mandate of the relevant High Level Group."
"The Summit was supportive of Russian aspirations for WTO membership by the end of 2004, but remains well aware of known difficulties in areas such as energy, air transport issues and insurance, which remain outstanding items on the EU-Russia agenda."
"Dialogue on energy will continue, with the EU continuing to encourage progress in the Russian process of reforming the sector, in spite of the difficulties that Russia has in meeting the demands of Europe and the WTO, especially in relation to domestic prices and the privatisation of the energy sector."
"The European Union also insisted strongly on the need for Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol with all speed and on our expectation that Russia would make a determined effort to increase cooperation in matters of protection of the marine environment."
"As regards the common space of freedom, security and justice, I should like to draw your attention to the signing of an agreement between Europol and the Russian Ministry of the Interior."
"This is a significant confirmation of our joint determination to press ahead with implementation of the plan of action against organised crime."
"In the same context, we were also pleased to record the start of talks at a technical level on issues relating to the liberalisation of visa requirements, and took note of the willingness of both sides to introduce measures to relax the requirements for the issuing of visas under the existing legislation."
"We also underscored the importance of rapid conclusion of the Readmission Agreement."
"The meeting gave the European Union the opportunity to confirm its conviction that internal security is complementary to justice and respect for human rights, and that the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia continues to be based on shared values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression."
"As regards the common space of external security, the joint declaration on cooperation in the area of crisis management was a clear sign of the willingness of the European Union and the Russian Federation to work together in this area of vital interest for Europe."
"I believe that this, too, should be recorded as one of the successes of the Rome Summit as regards the creation of a common space of external security."
"The Russian proposal for closer cooperation in the field of civil protection and the management of natural disasters will be considered in more detail and converted at the earliest possible date into agreements that will enable the Union and Russia to cooperate and strengthen their joint response to future emergencies."
"An initial step may be the establishment of direct contact between the competent bodies in Brussels and Moscow."
"The possibility of similar cooperation is also to be explored by the relevant multilateral bodies in relation to weapons of mass destruction."
"As regards the common space of research and education, the Summit opened a new chapter in bilateral cooperation, which had been bolstered by the Russian Federation’s joining the Bologna Process, an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism promoting agreements in the field of the mutual recognition of academic qualifications and the harmonisation of university curricula."
"The Bologna Process paves the way for forms of effective intergovernmental cooperation in the field of the harmonisation of academic qualifications, which is an initial step towards the creation of a common space for university teaching."
"Moreover, the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation will make it possible for the Russians to take part in European research programmes."
"Lastly, the question was explored of the functioning of the Permanent Partnership Council, with the aim of finding a solution based on the values of efficiency and flexibility that reconciles Russia’s desire for discussions of greater depth and reach in matters of common interest with the principle that the decision-making processes of the EU must remain autonomous."
"I hope that, by building on this foundation, we shall soon be able to reach an agreement that will make it possible to put the Permanent Partnership Council into operation."
"As regards international issues, in addition to the debates imposed by current events in Iran, Iraq and the Middle East, on which the two sides are in broad agreement and essentially share the same goals, we also raised the question of the situation in Moldova, in particular, on account of a number of imminent deadlines relating to the Transnistria crisis in which the Russian Federation has a crucial role to play: the definitive withdrawal of Russian military hardware by 31 December, and progress in the five-way negotiations and in the work of the Constitutional Committee responsible for drafting a new model of state for Moldova."
"We believe that Russia should honour its commitment punctually, without any further postponements."
"Russia confirmed the undertaking to withdraw, but observed that, since the negotiations for the resolution of the Transnistria crisis had made little headway, further endeavours would be needed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I think I can say that the Rome Summit was not altogether easy but it was an important moment in the consolidation of our overall relationship with the Russian Federation and enabled us to make progress in the creation of the four common spaces."
"It was certainly a valuable occasion for an extensive exchange of views on international issues."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the preparatory political dialogue for this summit, which took place on 28 October in Moscow, I considered it necessary and right to describe the state of our relations as follows: we have very many action plans but hardly any action."
"We have grand strategies but small deeds."
"We have visions but little practice."
