"Should this not be the case – and this is important – the Commission will not hesitate to propose appropriate legislative measures."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Can I push you a bit further on that last point you made, because up until then I was a little disappointed with what you were saying in implying that the legislation was already there."
"I could give you any number of examples about which I am concerned, but I shall give you just one."
"Nestlé ‘Cheerios’ is a breakfast cereal which has 21% sugar and a great deal of salt."
"They produce their own colouring book and encourage children to eat more and more of this product according to how much they are colouring in."
"The EU already legislates, as you outlined in your remarks, but you also implied that this legislation was the basis that could be used."
"If no new legislation is necessary, can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation – which I am not at all certain is accurate – and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening?"
". It is quite obvious that the nutrition and health of young people is very important, and not only to the Commission."
"I think we can all agree on that."
"It is also quite clear that we do not want to see a situation where young people might become overweight, causing severe problems later in life, not only for their own health but also for society."
"Therefore we will look into how this works at present."
"That is why, if – and I stress, – it does not seem to be working, the Commission will be ready to take further steps."
"Unlike my colleague, I am delighted that you are not proposing any further legislation today."
"Your view is absolutely right."
"I thank you also for reminding us that this is an issue about diet, physical activity and health."
"It is very easy to carry on bashing the food industry, but would you not agree that it is time for people to recognise that individuals have responsibility for their own lives and that exercise plays a huge part in what is clearly an important issue?"
". As I said previously, we all have a responsibility to try to ensure that youngsters do not find themselves in a situation where they are more likely to fall ill later on in their lives."
"Clearly, society cannot take responsibility for everybody."
"Therefore, parents and other adults who are around young people during the day have a responsibility in this area."
"We need to have a discussion in the Member States about how much exercise young people do throughout the week at school."
"There is a clear link between exercise and health, in terms of the diseases you might get if you do not move properly."
"Now, I am old enough to say that, when I was young, we did not have all these video games that exist today – we did not just sit in front of computer screens and enjoy ourselves like that – so we need to encourage young people to get out and get some exercise in order to try to prevent a situation from arising later on in life that none of us would want."
"The political agreement reached by the Council Summit in December 2005 concerning the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 reduced the Commission's original proposal for funding of the Trans-European Transport Networks from EUR 20 billion to EUR 7 billion."
"Given the importance of the Trans-European Networks for the Lisbon Strategy and the operation of the internal market, does the Commission believe that it is possible, with the amount of EUR 7 billion, to implement the thirty priority projects scheduled for the near future?"
"Does it share the view that this significant cut by two thirds of the original provision will hold back the transport sector more broadly defined, particularly since some of these projects are already encountering problems, and how does it intend to deal with this matter?"
"Does it have a progress assessment for the implementation of the priority projects and does it share the view that some of the priority projects will have to be revised and/or suspended owing to the reduction in financial provision?"
". In July 2004 the Commission presented a proposal to amend the regulation concerning trans-European networks – TENs – under the 2007-2013 financial perspective, which, among other things, provided for a higher rate of support up to 50% for a cross-border section of priority projects."
"The total allocation amounts to EUR 20.35 billion for these TENs transport projects."
"The agreement on the 2007-2013 perspective reached at the December 2005 European Council implies a significant reduction of around 40% of the overall amount of appropriations allocated to Heading 1a which, in addition to the transport sector, covers areas such as research, education, competitiveness and new technologies."
"The breakdown of appropriations between the various components of Heading 1a has not yet been decided."
"The Commission is therefore unable to give a precise reply to the honourable Member regarding the consequences of the reduction of the amounts contained in its original proposal for a financial perspective until the figures have been finally decided upon by interinstitutional agreements."
"Those discussions are ongoing."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply and your honesty, but you have not convinced me that the Commission is addressing the issue with the necessary seriousness for a sector which is so important to the completion of the internal market and the competitiveness of the European Union."
"It would appear to be clear that we shall have a reduction – and a significant reduction – from the Commission proposal."
"Solutions in this sector take time."
"Planning takes time and resources."
"Have you not already thought about better partnerships with the private sector, for a larger share on the part of the Member States, about greater involvement by the European Investment Bank?"
"I am surprised that you are not preparing yourselves in that direction."
". Of course it is not unimportant for me to underline that the Commission is not underestimating the importance of these trans-European networks."
"However, I am really not in a position today to give any signals at all on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspectives for the period up to 2013."
"As I said in my initial response, it is a discussion that is going to take place in the interinstitutional areas that are always in these negotiations at this crucial time."
"I would like to ask how the reduction in funding for ‘Trans-European Networks’ projects will affect the new European Union countries, whose transport infrastructure, in particular rail transport, lags considerably behind the level of the countries of Old Europe."
"And more precisely, how will the vitally important project to the Baltic countries ‘Rail Baltica’, connecting the capitals of the Baltic countries with Warsaw and Berlin, be implemented?"
". I did not hear a question, I heard only a statement."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that the Commission has not answered the substance of my original question, and to put a related supplementary question."
"It is understandable that the Commission cannot tell us today how it intends to divide up a budget that has not yet even been adopted, but I do believe that it certainly should be giving consideration to how to go about providing these trans-European networks with the funding that they will need."
"As we all know, the various transport operators are perfectly willing to pay tolls, and the new infrastructure costs directive established a very narrow base on which these charges were to be levied, so let me follow up the previous question by asking whether it might not be possible to come up with a proposal for extending that and making cross-financing possible?"
". Madam President, I am sorry but I am not in a position to give any specific answers."
"Even if I wanted to, it is simply not in my hands at this stage."
"It is in the hands of the European Parliament, amongst others, and I ask for your understanding of the situation."
"There are many important areas in these negotiations that certain Members of Parliament want to support, which is understandable, but at this stage it is impossible."
"I am sorry."
"The funding of the seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research for the period 2007-2013 is due to be adopted this year."
"The programme will have a budget of over EUR 72 000 million and includes plans to double the number of researchers taking part in projects, to create research jobs and to improve the conditions for collaboration between research and business."
"Statistics on participation in the sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for research for the period 2007-2013 show that in the majority of EU Member States, including Lithuania, small and medium-sized businesses often received less funding than universities and other centres of research or institutes."
"In EU countries, and in the new Member States in particular, there is little collaboration between private businesses and researchers. This state of affairs reduces the EU’s competitiveness globally."
"Would it not be appropriate to allocate part of the moneys available under the seventh Community Framework Programme (15–20%) towards funding the requirements of small and medium-sized businesses?"
"In my view, this would encourage private businesses to collaborate with centres of research and individual researchers and would also help to increase the use of new technologies and innovations."
". The Commission would like to give the following reply to the honourable Member’s question."
"First, regarding the total budget for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the Commission proposal will need to be revised in the light of the developments in the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"Secondly, regarding cooperation between research organisations and enterprises, in particular SMEs, the Commission agrees that this is of crucial importance."
"Participation by SMEs is, and will remain, one of the key objectives of the framework programmes."
"In Framework Programme 6, a variety of measures has been taken in order to promote SME participation in the thematic areas where they collaborate with other firms and research organisations."
"These measures include: support to networks of intermediaries in specific sectors of technological fields to help SMEs with proposals, preparations, partner searches etc.; targeted calls in areas of particular interest for SMEs, as well as funding schemes dedicated to SME support, the outsourcing of research by SMEs and SME associations."
"Given their success, we propose that they should continue in Framework Programme 7."
"The framework programmes are thus already promoting participation by SMEs and their cooperation with research organisations very actively."
"With specific reference to the honourable Member’s suggestion to set a quantified target for SME participation, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Council has introduced a target of 15% SME participation as part of the partial general agreement on FP7."
"Such a target already exists in FP6, but the Commission has doubts about maintaining such an overall minimum budgetary target for SME participation for the following reasons."
"Firstly, potential participation by SMEs varies very much from one thematic area to another, from approximately 5% to 20%."
"It is therefore practically impossible to define a realistic overall target and it could even be misleading."
"Secondly, targets for SMEs may be perceived as compromising the objective of supporting only research of the highest quality and would go against the principles of equal access and excellence that are fundamental to the Framework Programme."
"Thirdly, support to SMEs should focus on real measures that make FP7 genuinely attractive and beneficial for SMEs, through the identification of research topics, simplification of administrative aspects and so on."
"So the Commission believes that SME involvement is best achieved by removing barriers to SME participation and that is what we want to do."
"It is also achieved by simplification and improvement of administrative and financial procedures, shorter time to contract, reduced reporting requirements and increased flexibility for SMEs to promote projects of a scope and size that best fit their needs."
"More account must also be taken of SME needs and potential in developing the content of the theme in the specific programme and especially in the work programme."
"In addition, it is very important to underline that for SMEs the Community financial contribution may reach 75% of the eligible costs instead of the usual rate of 50%."
"This is the proposal which was included in the Rules for Participation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for a convincing answer."
"In any case, very considerable amounts of money will be allocated under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development."
"How does the Commission intend to distribute these funds between the Member States?"
"Preference will probably be given to large and significant projects."
"Could it also happen that the bulk of financial assistance will be allocated to countries that are already advanced in the field of research and that those which are not will get only crumbs?"
". Madam President, the Framework Programme is only one of the tools being used at the European Union level; it is approximately 4% or 5% of the European Union budget."
"I agree with the honourable Member that it is a large sum of money, because there are important challenges which are ahead of us if we are to deal with questions such as how to sustain our quality of life and remain globally competitive."
"That is the major question which is included in the Lisbon Agenda and the Partnership for Growth and Jobs which is a follow-up to that."
"I believe it is crucial that, on the one hand, we try to stimulate the potential of Member States which are less developed, smaller and maybe do not have the potential to compete on an equal basis today."
"There are a number of action centres; specific action is proposed in Framework Programme 7 to boost that ability to compete."
"On the other hand, we have to be aware that the European Union should be aiming for the top."
"We should stimulate excellence and the possibility that we can truly compete with the changing and challenging world of today."
"So we care very much about what you have said, but we also believe that the various types of sources should be combined to address both questions which I underlined, one being the question of aiming for the top, of having the best for Europe; and the second, the question of how to deal with the others which may not be in the best position today."
"Madam President, quite a few countries have stated that the European Investment Bank could provide loans of up to EUR 10 billion for research purposes or for research and innovation."
"What thought has the Commission given to having the EIB develop new funding instruments in support of innovation?"
". Thank you for the question."
"You are right to say that it was mentioned in the debate."
"However, even before it was mentioned in the debate, the Commission, in its original proposal and together with the European Investment Bank, tried to develop an instrument called a ‘risk-sharing facility’."
"One of the major problems we have to deal with at European Union level is that we do not all have the same ways of addressing risk."
"It varies from culture to culture."
"That is why it is crucial that we create instruments to address that problem."
"It is not allowing us to be totally in line with the major competitors, especially when we talk about the percentage of GDP invested in research and development."
"It is crucial that that we stimulate that."
"That was the idea behind introducing the risk-sharing facility with the EIB."
"It would increase potential, because with each unit of the grant which we would somehow give to the EIB, we would get something like four to five units of credit back."
"It would also give us the opportunity to address some of the more risky businesses which the EIB – in line with banking logic – is not addressing. I am sure that this is not a magical answer which will solve our problems, but I sincerely hope that it will be followed by some other financial institutions across Europe."
"Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner precisely how he envisages this reduction in bureaucracy operating in practical terms, since we keep hearing small and medium-sized enterprises complaining that the bureaucratic hurdles – unlike those of national research support programmes – are insurmountable."
"Secondly, how will commercial confidentiality be safeguarded?"
". You have touched on one of the most difficult issues with which we are dealing."
"As you rightly stated, probably the best way of stimulating SME participation is to cut down on red tape."
"Bigger companies do not have to expend the same proportion of their energy on this as smaller companies, and the same is true of the proportion of finances."
"We are trying to approach this question in a consistent manner: from the financial regulation, to the rules of participation, to the next steps of how we will deal with that in-house, we are trying to cut red tape."
"It is one of the most difficult exercises we are conducting."
"However, I am firmly convinced that, with goodwill, we can take a major step towards at least reversing the negative trend."
"On the same day as we adopted the framework programme, we also adopted the special paper dealing with questions of simplification."
"In addition, we established a kind of simplification board, consisting of a number of small actors who have been advising us on the preparation of the rules of participation and who will continue to advise us on further in-house simplification processes."
"I see simplification as a process that we need to address in all phases and which has to be consistently applied throughout the entire period."
"I hope that, in this major endeavour, I will also obtain the support of the European Parliament and the Council, because it is to a certain extent a problem we all share."
"Can the Commission state clearly what specific actions it intends to undertake to promote the role of the regions in Europe in the context of the forthcoming Research and Technological Development Programme?"
". The proposal for the seventh Framework Programme includes an extended regional dimension under the capacity-specific programme, with a number of new initiatives that provide European regions with new opportunities for involvement in research and technological development."
"First of all, a new scheme on regions of knowledge provides support to research-and-development-intensive regional clusters."
"This follows on from two rounds of experimental activities that have created a lot of interest among our regional stakeholders."
"Members will recall that the first was actually stimulated by the European Parliament."
"The proposal for the seventh Framework Programme recognises the role of regional actors in developing the research capacity of their region and supports projects focused on regional research-driven clusters."
"Another important new initiative under the capacities-specific programme is the one on unlocking research potential, which aims to develop the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions by supporting secondments of research staff, the acquisition of equipment or the organisation of conferences for technology transfer."
"Activities will also be undertaken on the coherent development of policies, part of the capacity-specific programme that will enable the exchange of experience between policy-makers at regional level."
"Activities are provided for under the strand of research infrastructure that would have important implications for some regions in Europe, and, last but not least, the Eranet and the Eranet+ activities that will also involve research players at regional level."
"Regions have always been partners to the framework programme."
"The fact that this is now taking one step further, including schemes targeted specifically at regions, must not allow us to forget that the framework programme has contributed to research and development in the regions in many more ways and will continue to do so."
"Framework programme projects help fight regional insularity and technological preventionism."
"Through European research projects, innovative companies in convergence regions will continue to link the major technology networks and to regenerate their profile and capacity, and remote universities will continue to have access to innovative ways of adopting their research models and become, in some cases, real development drivers for the region."
"SME networks participating in the framework programme will continue to improve their technological competence."
"Marie Curie fellowships will maintain support for research and development human resources, with a direct impact on regional research capacities."
"New features in the framework programme enhance its commitment to improving synergies with European regional policy so as to reinforce the support of the structural funds for research in the regions."
"Through our actions in the framework programme, the Commission will try to provide useful models that will enable European regions to become more efficient in designing and implementing research policy and thus be more able to support their research players."
"In addition, they will become more efficient in using structural funds resources for research investment."
"This presents a real opportunity to make progress towards the Barcelona objective of 3% of GDP investment in research and development in the context of the Lisbon strategy."
"It is obvious that we must address the issue of catching up at European, national and regional levels, and that is clearly acknowledged in the proposal for the framework programme."
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply."
"I would like to ask him what monitoring system has the Commission in mind to ensure that there is a balance and an equal share-out of the funding across the regions?"
"As the Commissioner knows, there are regions which are not capable of taking down this funding, and obviously that imbalance will create uneven European development."
"Can the Commissioner tell me what the Commission intends to do about that?"
". The honourable Member rightly pointed to a question which also concerns us."
"The intention of the framework programme in the first place is not balance but excellence."
"Being aware that we have to develop the potential of the regions, the Commission’s approach in the proposal is and always has been synergetic."
"It is crucial that one reads carefully the cohesion guidelines prepared by the Commission, which try to give a clear message that the Member States, in addressing their problems in the regions, need to take into account the structural and cohesion funds which are important in this respect for catching up with the Lisbon goals."
"As I said before, we also try to do that through our programmes."
"However, even if we have specific programmes – such as the one concerning the potential of the cohesion regions – we have to go on with an open course of proposals where we choose the most stimulating ones."
"It is crucial to have incentives to give those that are not on top today a lift upwards."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for having drawn attention to the fact that research can be supported via structural funds resources."
"I am very interested to know how this is to be managed and how coherence is to be ensured between various research efforts: those using structural funds resources, those made at national level and those made in the EU generally."
"How can matters be managed in such a way that sensible projects take place?"
"A second question concerns the amounts from the structural funds that one might imagine being set aside for research, compared with the amounts available under the Seventh Framework Programme?"
"The Council talks in terms of 60% of structural funds resources going to the Lisbon objectives."
". If I may start at the end, that was also the Commission’s proposal in the letter which President Barroso sent to Parliament and the Council."
"It is important that we recognise the need for the right balance between physical infrastructure on the one hand and intellectual infrastructure and other steps on the other, to stimulate innovation in regions which are today cohesion regions and less developed than the average in the European Union."
"That is crucial."
"I recently attended a conference in Poland with my colleague Mrs Hübner."
"It was a good conference, in which we were both able to explain to the audience how important it is to approach matters from both sides."
"At the end of the day, we have to be aware that if these recommendations are taken on board, it is in the hands of the Member States."
"We have to understand how crucial it is that we balance this kind of support in practice."
"I am also fully aware that, in terms of differing levels of development, countries’ needs are not identical."
"So it is crucially important that this aspect is seriously taken into account and that this shift in attention is also taken into account."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question is prompted by the recurrent need, in regional policy, for people to be shown new examples of how to do it."
"Since there are many methods of ‘best practice’, and since there is such a thing as the ‘innovation scoreboard’, would it not be possible for you, Commissioner, and your fellow-Commissioners Mrs Hübner, Mr Potočnik and Mrs Wallström, to put your heads together and consider how these tried and tested practices may be better got across to the European public, so that they may have incentives to step us this sort of cooperation in future?"
". I can only say that I fully agree with the honourable Member’s remarks."
"It is crucial in all areas that we simply understand that we are working towards the same goal and only by pooling all financial resources together in a practical way can we truly achieve the changes."
"Commissioner Potočnik, appearing before Parliament on 26 January 2006, admitted that grave problems will arise from the proposed cuts in the financial perspective as regards achieving the objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme (it is, however, true that we will have to wait till the end of the negotiations on the final budget before the exact amount of the cuts is known)."
"Can the Commission explain the main ideas it is considering for adapting the framework programme to this less generous financial situation?"
"Does it intend to keep the existing proportions for the distribution of resources between programmes?"
"Does the Commission not believe that one of the aspects which should not be seriously undermined is the strengthening of support for researchers in order to stem the present 'brain drain'?"
". Regarding the revision of the Seventh European Union Research and Development Framework Programme, it is the Commission’s intention to maintain the structure and essential philosophy of the initial proposal following the broad consensus that has already emerged in the discussions in Parliament and the Council."
"The principles in the approach to the revision were outlined at a meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on 26 January 2006."
"Smaller activity actions cannot be reduced as much as bigger ones, otherwise they lose their ."
"Some lines have a budget that depends, for instance, on international commitments entered into by the European Union or some other bodies."
"Prioritisation within the themes and a high level of flexibility are also necessary."
"The cooperation part should remain the core of the programme."
"Alongside the cooperation part, many other activities, such as infrastructure, SMEs and the mobility of researchers will be given due consideration in the revised proposal."
"In the context of the reduced budget, not only the breakdown but also the timing for the introduction of new initiatives may have to be considered."
"The framework programme aims to make European research more attractive and to create more mobility for researchers."
"That is to be boosted by the People Programme, dedicated to structuring the mobility, training and career development of researchers throughout Europe."
"This is essential to help create a single labour market of researchers, but it is not the only programme to create an attractive European research area."
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your explanations."
"The purpose of my question was to communicate to you the concerns of our scientific community at the cuts planned in the funding for European science and technology."
"Though it is true that we must wait until the end of the negotiations, in practice it is essential to know as soon as possible what ideas you are considering in order to adapt the Framework Programme to the smaller amount of resources and we are therefore grateful for your explanations."
"It is fundamental both in order to continue our parliamentary work and in order to be able to inform our researchers, who want an end to this situation of uncertainty about the future of their research projects, which has gone on for too long already."
"I also wanted to ask you, in particular, whether making the European Union a genuinely attractive area for researchers is going to continue to be a priority."
"This issue is of immense concern to us and I wanted to ask you whether you can tell us anything more about this issue."
". We are all trying to attain one of the goals which the Member States agreed in Barcelona in 2002, i.e. to provide 3% of GDP for investment in research and development."
"Pulling the strands together practically is crucial."
"It is obvious that cooperation at EU level could show the best ways of using and investing the money."
"That is happening with or without our investment."
"This is the trend that is going on, because this is the only way in which we can truly deal with the challenges ahead of us."
"By stimulating that at European Union level, however, we help this process go faster."
"That is why I agree with you totally that our common endeavours are very important for Europe to benefit."
"Today, approximately 5% of public money is spent through the Framework Programme at European Union level."
"The rest is invested from the budgets of the Member States."
"Private funding is even more important than public funding."
"In the European Union, approximately 55% of private money is invested, compared to 45% of public money."
"It is crucial that we try to stimulate not only the public but also the private sector."
"It is crucial that companies work and invest in Europe."
"That is why it is crucially important that these companies are stimulated via the creation of proper conditions, i.e. that tax incentives are there, state aid is supporting that, intellectual property rights are in place, public procurement goes in this direction, risk venture capital is provided, and we stimulate brain circulation and so on. All these things matter."
"Three per cent is a kind of indicator of whether we are doing things correctly."
"Our horizontal policies which we are using across all our sectors are consistent and are those which are truly up to the challenges which we have to face today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of today’s newspapers quotes Mr Jean-Claude Juncker as saying that the Financial Perspective, the Council’s offer should not be the last word."
"He suggests that it would be possible to put forward some EUR 875 billion."
"Do you believe that it is still possible to top up the seventh research framework programme?"
". It should not be seen as the final word."
"We have the interinstitutional talks going on and we all know the position of Parliament, which was quite definite."
"I always welcomed the support from Parliament in our joint endeavours to stimulate education, research and development and innovation, the whole ‘knowledge triangle’."
"This is something which would need to be decided in the next stage of the process."
"I can simply say that investing at European Union level in areas connected with research and development has paid off and it really matters."
"I very much appreciate your support."
"Commissioner, in order for scientific research programmes to succeed, it is very important that businesses participate in them, both by using scientific research inventions and by funding them."
"Yesterday, in the European Economic and Social Committee, Mr Verheugen, who is a Member of the Commission for another area, presented his programmes to us as programmes to stimulate innovation."
"My question would be as follows: do you cooperate and in general coordinate activities between two Members of the Commission and two types of programmes?"
". ‘Yes, we do’ – that would be the shortest answer."
"Under the competitiveness and innovation framework programme, one phase addresses the issue at hand, and the other phases are addressed through the framework programme."
"From the very beginning, we have coordinated our activities, which are having a similar effect on innovation as the structural funds have on the regions."
"Furthermore, when we talk about involving business in the work we are doing, it is crucial to underline that we have a new tool that did not exist in the past: I refer to the technology platforms, which were established at the beginning of this century and which are developing very fast."
"The whole idea of technology platforms – I believe we currently have 28 of them – is that they are bottom-up initiatives, starting with the business’s point of view."
"In these platforms, the points of view of practically all stakeholders are taken on board."
"So, while these platforms stem from a business initiative, they also include researchers, politicians, NGOs, financial institutions, regulatory authorities and the others on board."
"They create what are known as ‘strategic research agendas’ for the next 20 years – or more, depending on various factors."
"This is the first time that this kind of tool and this kind of logic have been developed at European Union level."
"I meet daily with industrialists and with others, who are clearly very enthusiastic about what is going on."
"Even if we were now to remove the incentives, which were, at the outset – if we are frank – financed through the framework programme, this is now a process with its own story."
"It will definitely make a change at European Union level."
"I believe that we are part of a process that will produce hugely important benefits."
"On the basis of their views for the long-term future, where you have an idea of what research should be undertaken, to the final product and the business sector’s ideas on how to evaluate it in their work, we take this input on board when we create our cooperation activities."
"In practice, that is in the major part of our programmes."
"Moreover, in some areas, where we believe that this long-term, strong partnership exists, and where there is strong commitment from the companies and other actors, such as Member States, for instance, we are ready to develop what are known as ‘joint technological initiatives’, which are a new long-term tool with clear cofinancing, as a new tool, from the European Commission."
"We have never had such a clear overview of the intentions, strategies and points of view of the business sector as we have today when we create the framework programme, and, of course, in the final phase, the specific work programmes."
"In its answer to my written question concerning Plan-D (E-4200/05), the Commission states that it will listen to the views of citizens and draw conclusions therefrom."
"The Commission also stresses that it does not intend to predefine which individuals will be able to act as 'European goodwill ambassadors'."
"In the light of this information, will the Commission provide specific answers to the following two questions?"
"If citizens mainly put forward views to the effect that EU cooperation should be restricted and that further integration is not desirable, will the Commission then act in line with those wishes, that is, will it recommend a more intergovernmental approach?"
"How are the individuals who are to act as 'European goodwill ambassadors' to be selected?"
"Must a person or organisation propose suitable 'goodwill ambassadors' or can any well-known individual officially act in this capacity regardless of his/her political views?"
". Mrs Wallström is in bed with the flu."
"That is the reason."
"As a complement to the Commission’s reply to Written Question E-4200/05, asked previously by the honourable Member, on the issue of the goodwill ambassadors, the Commission can reassure the honourable Member that its intention during the period of reflection is to listen to citizens’ views on a range of EU issues and to draw conclusions from the debates held at all levels."
"The issues discussed will be very varied and they may or may not include recommendations on the desirable level of integration at EU level, but the role of the Union will certainly be tackled and in any case the content of the database of debates will be reflected in the feedback process."
"This process will start with an initial synthesis report that will be presented by the Commission to the European Council under the Austrian Presidency in order to prepare the stocktaking exercise at the June 2006 European Council."
"The Commission would like to take this opportunity to remind the honourable Member that the declaration calling for a period of reflection was adopted by the Heads of State and Government themselves, therefore it is for the Council to take stock of the exercise as well."
"Moreover, in the organisation of national debates the European institutions have an important role to play, but the primary responsibility rests with the Member States."
"What the Commission has recommended in Plan D is that the national debates need to be structured to ensure that the feedback can have a direct impact on the policy agenda of the European Union."
"Concerning the second part of the honourable Member’s question, the Commission would like to stress that the different initiatives suggested by Plan D at European level are part of a long-term plan and are being implemented at a different pace in the 25 Member States."
"The European goodwill ambassador plan is one of the measures that need to be further developed in most of the countries of the EU and in cooperation with the Member States, depending on the creativity and the proposals identified by those involved in the process."
"There is no single model for every country, just as there is no standard model for the organisation of the debates in the Member States."
"In any case, the Commission thinks that it is important to reiterate that the ambassadors would always act on a volunteer basis and the views that they would convey would be their own views."
"The Commission has no intention of imposing a particular line on them."
"I should like to know whether Commissioner Potočnik does not think that the project involving goodwill ambassadors might appear ridiculous."
"Should it not be elected, representative parliamentarians who are ambassadors for the EU?"
". There is no doubt that we have confidence that Members of Parliament will act as ambassadors for the European Union."
"It is up to all of us to do that."
"I believe that Europe is simply too big and there are so many misunderstandings in Europe today that none of us, even if we tried wholeheartedly, can address them properly."
"I believe that any action we can take to raise awareness of what the European Union really is might bring us better results."
"I agree with the honourable Member that it is up to all of us, Members of Parliament and the Commission, but the action we are proposing is also important."
"What resources will be made available for civil society groups to stimulate the debate on the future of Europe?"
"When will the call for proposals be published?"
". The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that EUR 7.6 million will be allocated to the Prince budget line for the 2006 budget, which is intended to finance actions as foreseen under Plan D to highlight the debate during the period of reflection decided by the June 2005 European Council."
"This budget will be managed as follows: a call for a proposal of EUR 2 million will be launched in the following weeks to give support to pan-European projects aimed at creating the conditions for citizens’ debates on EU issues."
"It will be aimed at supporting EU citizens’ networking and participation in the debate on Europe."
"It will be aimed at collecting citizens’ opinions, especially through qualitative means and extensive scale and it will be aimed at providing analyses of citizens’ contributions as feedback for decision-makers."
"In addition, EUR 850 000 will be allocated for setting up specific information products."
"On a complementary basis, in order to stimulate the implementation of Plan D at a local level, EUR 4.5 million will be decentralised to the Commission’s representations in order to develop debates at regional and local levels and to improve synergy and coordination between national, regional and EU levels for the implementation of Plan D. This EUR 4.5 million will be executed either by calls for proposals or by procurement."
"Finally, EUR 250 000 will be requested to develop a website especially devoted to the debate about Europe."
"On a broader scale, the Commission has already expressed its disappointment about the recent agreement of the European Council to cut the global appropriations of the next Financial Perspective, Heading 3, in a situation where the debate on Europe is becoming truly crucial."
"I welcome the Commission’s answer."
"I am glad that the focus of this is towards civil society and NGOs and towards listening to their views, rather than just listening to tabloid newspapers and other protagonists of the debate."
"May I also say that while the focus has up to now in this period of reflection been more on the context rather than on the text of the Constitution, does the Commission accept that we will in due course have to bring the debate forward to discuss what we are actually going to do about this text, maybe not this year, but certainly next year?"
". Of course I think that attention should also be paid to the substance and questions which you underlined."
"As you said, maybe not this year, maybe next year, but attention should be given to that also."
"Commissioner, given the Commission’s desire to control its own propaganda – as evidenced by Commissioner Wallström’s announcement recently of her proposal for a politically-controlled European news outlet, the EBS – what confidence can exist that any attempt will be made at striking a balance in terms of the distribution of funding between organisations and individuals promoting a pro-Constitution stance and those who promote an anti-Constitution stance?"
". It should be an open debate and that was always the idea."
"It should be a debate in which both sides, pro- and anti-, should be heard."
"It was done through the whole constitutional debate process and it was organised in a broad consultative manner."
"That is the intention for the future."
"What is the Commission's assessment of the activities of the European information networks to date?"
"Does it intend to redesign these networks to provide information to European citizens more effectively and, if so, which financial mechanisms does it propose to use?"
". On 1 May 2005 the Commission launched a new network of Europe Direct information relays."
"Implanted locally all over the enlarged European Union, 393 new relays have taken over from former Info-Points Europe and Rural Information and Promotion Carrefours which targeted the public in urban and rural areas respectively."
"The objectives of the new network have been streamlined in order to better meet the information needs of the public."
"As regards the financial mechanisms put in place to support the network, they need to comply with the EC financial regulation."
"The new relays were therefore selected on the basis of a call for proposals, following the decision from the Commission, C/2004/2869."
"Each Europe Direct information relay benefits from an operating grant of a maximum of EUR 24 000 while the maximum grant for former IPEs and Carrefours was EUR 20 000."
"Furthermore, Digicom is planning to launch a complementary call for proposals at the beginning of 2007 in order to open new relays in geographical areas insufficiently covered by the current network and taking into account future enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria."
"Concerning the assessment of the impact of the networks, an internal assessment of the former information relays in 2003 revealed the real value of the relays as partners in the communication policy, especially at the local and regional level."
"As for the new relays, starting from the second semester of 2006, an online monitoring system will be implemented in order to assess the activities of the information relays."
"Finally, in the framework of the action plan on communicating Europe published in July 2005, the Commission intends to carry a feasibility study – action 6 of the action plan – to assess the desirability of progressively streamlining the Commission’s various information sources."
"As stated in action 42 of the same action plan, an impact study on the communication of the relays’ activities is also scheduled to start at the end of 2006."
"– Madam President, having listened to your reply to the previous question, I should like to ask how proportionate spending on this permanent information on Europe's present is in relation to spending on Plan D to which you referred."
". There is no money for the relation."
"There is no link between the previous issue and this one."
"EuroNews offers daily coverage of topical European issues and is partly subsidised from the EU budget."
"The fact that residents of Lithuania do not have access to such programmes places them at a disadvantage compared to the citizens of other Member States, especially as local mass media cannot afford contracting reporters in the European Union."
"Does the Commission see any way of providing access for the residents of Lithuania to daily half-hour broadcasts of EuroNews on the national public broadcaster?"
". In 2005 the Commission signed a service contract with EuroNews to cover EU affairs in its news and magazines, under a strict editorial independence charter."
"The contract covers the production and distribution costs of the EU programmes."
"It was signed on the basis of the existing seven languages – German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian – and state of distribution."
"It does not contain any obligation for the channel to increase its geographical coverage or the number of languages."
"Nevertheless, the contract provides that however much the coverage or the languages increased during the life of the contract, the EU programmes would be included."
"One of the selection criteria was the capacity and the will of EuroNews to develop its geographical and language coverage."
"Since the contract was signed, a window has been opened in Romania and in the Romanian language; agreements have been signed in India, China and elsewhere."
"EuroNews is also diversifying the various distribution technologies through which it can be received: cable, DTT, mobile phones, etc."
"Obviously, the Commission is encouraging EuroNews to increase by all the means under its control its geographical distribution technologies and language coverage."
"As far as Lithuania is concerned, at present only 49 000 households out of 1.33 million are able to receive EuroNews via cable or satellite."
"EuroNews is a candidate to be distributed via digital terrestrial television, Lietuvos Telekomas, and hoping for a positive answer."
"Moreover, negotiations are on course with the public channel, LRT, which would permit LRT to broadcast EuroNews programmes on their Hertzian base frequencies as often as they like."
"A Lithuanian window, similar to the Romanian one, is also currently under discussion."
"I would just like to thank you for your answer."
"I trust that in future the Commission will try to ensure that all those ‘Euro News’ opportunities exist in all countries where they are not broadcast, and in, let us say, neighbouring countries, as television is still the most popular information channel, especially where Europe is concerned."
". We are trying to do the best we can, taking into account the contracts and the independence of EuroNews."
"The agreement on sugar reform opens up the possibility for some Member States to pay national aid to sugar beet producers."
"What then is the Commission's position in principle on the use of national aid as a regulatory instrument under the common agricultural policy?"
"Is it an instrument that the Commission may be expected to use in connection with future proposals or is it being used in connection with the sugar reform by way of exception?"
"How does the Commission view the prospects for phasing out subsidies for agricultural production in the EU in the event of total or partial renationalisation of agricultural aid?"
"Madam President, honourable Member, when it comes to applying Europe's common agricultural policy, there has, right from the beginning, been a fully recognised principle whereby account should be taken of the special character of agriculture and of the structurally conditioned differences between the various areas of the EU – from Finland in the north to the southernmost tip of Italy."
"If need be, these dimensions might, moreover, be taken into account with the help of State aid."
"It is currently permitted to grant State aid for the production and processing of various agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty, if three different criteria are fulfilled."
"Firstly, the conditions of competition must not be repudiated."
"Secondly, the aid must be in keeping with the common agricultural policy in general and, thirdly, such aid must of course be compatible with the international commitments we have entered into."
"In this connection, I could mention our WTO agreement on agriculture."
"At the November European Council, the agricultural ministers laid down the political strategy for reforming the common EU policy on sugar."
"According to this agreement, it will be possible to grant limited and specific State aid of no more than EUR 350 per hectare to sugar beet producers in Finland, with a maximum of EUR 90 million per year being specifically targeted at the EU’s ‘outermost regions’."
"It was also decided that those Member States that reduce their sugar quotas by more than 50% be given the opportunity to receive temporary aid for a transitional period of five years, calculated from that production year in which they make a start on reducing their quotas or in which they reduce their quotas to below 50%."
"In the case of Italy, it has already been possible to grant such transitional aid, corresponding to approximately EUR 11 per tonne of sugar beet per production year."
"It has primarily been earmarked for the transport of beet."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP reform), adopted in 2003 in accordance with the decisions in the agricultural sphere previously taken in Berlin, Gothenburg and Brussels, is now in the process of being implemented."
"In the new Member States, the reform clearly lies within the budget framework for the enlarged EU, laid down in Brussels in 2002."
"In connection with the adoption of the CAP reform, there has been no desire whatsoever to renationalise European agricultural policy."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for her answer."
"Firstly, I should like to say how pleasing it was that we obtained a sugar reform."
"What is more, I am not for a moment in any doubt that the Commissioner is acting legitimately."
"I am not questioning the way in which the reform has been worked out."
"I am no doubt looking, rather, for a political answer and political declaration."
"I believe that we need more reforms within the agricultural area during the next few years."
"I should therefore like to know what the Commissioner’s attitude is to the use of renationalisation as an instrument of reform."
"Has the Commissioner no reservations about going down that road?"
"As I see it, renationalisation would mean our abandoning the common agricultural policy."
"In other words, I want to know what, on principle, is the Commissioner’s attitude to the concept of the renationalisation of future agricultural policy."
"Madam President, I do not believe that the honourable Member can be in any doubt as to my attitude to renationalisation when we talk about Europe’s common agricultural policy."
"At no time has renationalisation been proposed. On the contrary."
"If, moreover, I might refer to a relatively topical example, it is clear that I have fought with all the legal means available to me against the proposal for a voluntary modulation of up to 20%, put forward by the British Presidency in connection with the negotiations concerning the next financial perspective, namely that for 2007-2013."
"In my view, such a proposal would mean our taking the first step towards renationalising Europe's common agricultural policy."
"It would mean that, instead of competing on the same basis, we should get into a situation in which agricultural policy would be about competition between the various national exchequers and between the different finance ministers of the EU’s 25 Member States."
"The sugar market reform adopted by the Commission and Council provides among other things for sugar producers to receive compensation amounting to EUR 730 for each tonne of quota renounced."
"In Poland, where production quotas are allocated to sugar factories and not to farmers who grow sugar beet, this could lead to the reduction of sugar production, forcing farmers to stop growing sugar beet."
"What form of support will farmers in Poland receive when they are forced to stop growing sugar beet?"
". The sugar quota is in principle fixed per country by Community legislation."
"Under the current sugar market organisation, the quotas are allocated by the Member States to the sugar manufacturing undertakings and are actually not allocated directly to the beet growers."
"This principle will remain unchanged after the reform and Poland is no exception to this rule."
"The restructuring fund will be set up in order to facilitate the necessary restructuring measures that should lead to lower sugar production in the less competitive regions within the European Union."
"Undertakings which renounce their sugar quota will be eligible for restructuring aid over a transitional period of four years."
"However, this payment will be linked to a series of conditions, including obligatory consultation with the beet growers and the submission of a restructuring plan to be agreed between the government and the industry."
"Member States will have significant flexibility to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid, as long as they comply with the general rules of future Community legislation."
"Therefore – and this is very important and I underline it at every opportunity – the restructuring money by the industry."
"This is very important and it is the whole idea behind this restructuring fund."
"Besides the undertakings, beet growers and machinery contractors will also be able to benefit from this restructuring fund."
"An amount of at least 10% of the restructuring fund, amounting to EUR 730 per tonne, should be reserved for the farmers, to compensate in particular for investment in the specialised machinery needed to produce sugar beet."
"It is quite clear, with this wording of ‘at least 10%’, that Member States can decide that a higher percentage should be allocated to the sugar beet producers, the farmers."
"It should also be emphasised that, independently of the restructuring fund that we have just talked about, sugar beet growers will receive direct aid as compensation for their loss of revenue due to the reduction in prices."
"They will receive this direct aid even if they stop producing sugar beet."
"This is very important."
"For the new Member States specifically, there will clearly be no phasing-in of the direct payment for the sugar beet compensation."
"The sugar beet producers in the new Member States will receive exactly the same amount per hectare in compensation as the EU-15, which means that there is no phasing-in as there is for cereals."
"The compensation will be 100% right from when the new sugar reform is first implemented."
"Madam President, I would like to ask another question."
"Does the Commission have instruments to limit the transfer of sugar quotas between countries, for example from Poland to other countries?"
"Do such instruments exist and will they be effective?"
". It has not been part of this agreement in the Council that it is possible to transfer quotas between Member States."
"It is possible within a Member State."
"For example, within Poland or any other country it is possible to take a quota from one factory to another, but there is no cross-border quota transfer in the reform proposal."
"As the Commission knows, ACP countries which are party to the Sugar Protocol receive a guaranteed price for their raw sugar which is equivalent to the EU's minimum intervention price."
"At the current moment, this price includes basic adjustment aid to traditional refineries, which amounts to 5.1% of the guaranteed price."
"This aid amounts to approximately EUR 35 million."
"However, under the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime, this refining aid will no longer be paid from the EU budget, but instead will be passed on to the ACP in the form of a 5.1% price cut representing a loss in earnings of EUR 35 million for the ACP."
"Could the Commission confirm that it will consider the possibility of a small adjustment to the compromise package on the CMO, due to be considered in the Council on 20 February and allow adjustment aid for the refining industry to continue to be paid from the EU budget?"
". To guarantee the price for Sugar Protocol countries, prices have always moved completely in line with EU institutional sugar prices, so there has never been a guarantee for a fixed price for the Sugar Protocol countries."
"However, these Sugar Protocol countries will benefit from a lower cut in the prices until the 2008-2009 production year."
"This will give these countries a period of three years to adapt to the new price support arrangements within the European Union."
"During 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, the reference price for raw sugar will decrease by only 5%, while the producers of sugar beet in the European Union will see a decrease of 20% the first year, and 27.5% the following year."
"The reason for this decrease of only 5% is due to the fact that refiners and therefore the ACP suppliers will be exempted from the restructuring levy."
"They do not have to pay the levy at all."
"However, refiners will lose the benefit of the refining aid which will be abolished in the context of the reform."
"It is quite clear that the different conditions for the ACP countries after the introduction of a reform within the European Union has been discussed at length before finalising the political agreement in the Council."
"It is quite clear and it has been from the very beginning that it was important to secure the period of the last six months of 2006, which is outside the next financial period."
"Therefore the decision was taken to allocate EUR 40 million specifically for the period from 1 July until the end of this year."
"For the period within the next financial perspective it has been quite clear that the Commission’s wish to allocate a significantly higher budget than the aforementioned EUR 40 million will be dependent on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspective for the next period."
"But it is a significantly higher amount than that mentioned."
"I can only say that within the Commission proposal, a budget of EUR 190 million a year was in the budget and I therefore hope that there will be an understanding also in this Parliament of the need to help these ACP countries, specifically in a transitional period."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I am talking about the fact that the collateral damage from the effects of the reform of the sugar regime has been felt by the 18 protocol countries."
"You say that they had EUR 40 million between 18 countries."
"Three commissioners – you, Mr Mandelson and the President of the Commission – pledged EUR 190 million to the ACP countries."
"I am now following that very closely."
"We can see no place in the budget for that money; we can see no likelihood of anything like the amount you promised to them being included in the budget."
"However hard this Parliament tries, it is very difficult in terms of the budgetary allocation that we have to make sure that we ring-fence the kind of money that we need."
"Will you, Commissioner, urge the Council to agree that we should ring-fence the money in any unallocated money that we may find under Heading IV?"
"Will you make it your business to protect the ACP sugar-producing countries at this time, when they are feeling so vulnerable?"
". Mrs Kinnock, I am quite sure that, as you are so well informed about this issue and it is not the first time that we have discussed it, you will know that we have been in very close contact with the sugar producing ACP countries."
"Not all of those countries produce sugar."
"It has been very important for us to try to help them, perhaps not to continue to produce sugar if they could not be competitive, but then to try to do something else."
"Therefore, I was very happy that at the Commission meeting last week it was possible to get through a communication on bioethanol."
"Afterwards, Mr Michel, who is responsible for the development money, took part in a press conference with me on this because bioethanol might be an alternative for those countries that want to stop producing sugar."
"On the figures, this is an ongoing discussion."
"But it has been important for the Commission to send a clear signal that we care about the possibilities for these sugar-producing ACP countries."
"I am quite sure that when you are in contact with them, they will also recognise that we have had numerous meetings with these countries."
"For example, we have been able to have direct contact during Council meetings on two occasions."
"It has been acknowledged that this is really an issue that is on our minds."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector [2005/2053(INI)] (A6-0014/2006)."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, especially the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their work on risk and crisis management and the very useful resolution and report."
"I will, of course, study your position and the different proposals in the report carefully."
"My intention with the communication on risk and crisis management presented in March 2005 was to launch a comprehensive debate."
"I think that objective has been successfully achieved, in the Council, in the European Economic and Social Committee and now in the European Parliament."
"Your contribution will be essential for the progress of our work."
"I therefore take note of your position regarding the three options for new rural development measures to support risk and crisis management."
"I welcome your encouragement to continue the work on the subject."
"I note your particular interest in option 2, which concerns mutual funds."
"In the shorter term, I share your views concerning the fruit and vegetables sector and I have already said to the Council that we are going to examine the subject of risk and crisis management in the context of the future reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"As you have noticed, however, the subject of risk and crisis management is really very complex, notably because the purpose is to adapt to a changing international trade context in respect of WTO rules."
"We therefore need to study this area further."
"As regards the analytical background, at the beginning of 2005 we launched a research project on risk and crisis management instruments for EU agriculture."
"The work is well advanced and we should have some intermediate results in the coming year."
"We are also preparing a study on the agricultural insurance systems in the various Member States and the technical issue of insurance systems in agriculture."
"This was specifically requested by the European Parliament."
"It is essential to describe and analyse what is done at Member State level before eventually deciding whether we need to set up permanent European instruments for insurance possibilities."
"We will then have a good basis for discussion during the coming year, which will facilitate the detailed political debate that is essential before we agree on additional measures."
"I am quite sure that, after listening to your comments, I will be able to respond directly to some of the questions raised."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the farming sector is dependent on many factors, not all of which the commercial sector regards as risks at all, and it is for that reason that the common agricultural policy has always protected it from certain risks, and, in the past, intervention in the form of guaranteed prices and guaranteed sales for important products provided specific farms with income guarantees."
"However, this resulted in a distribution of aid that very much favoured larger holdings to the detriment of the smaller ones."
"In the end, the distribution of payments was such that 80% of the money was going to 20% of the farmers."
"These also resulted in partial surpluses being generated in a region of the European Union that is one of the biggest importers of foodstuffs in the world, because this state intervention had given rise to a sort of vacuum effect."
"These surpluses were then sold on the world market for billions in a tax-subsidised dumping operation, the consequence of which was that in some countries, mainly in the developing world, regional markets were destroyed."
"Following the reforms, we have therefore attempted to at least start to put an end to this, but the money is still being distributed in the same ratio."
"We have a situation where highly rationalised businesses get EUR 120 000 per employee per year, while the majority of farmers get less than a tenth of that."
"Now that we are considering whether we need to initiate a new system of crisis and risk management, we need to correct the distribution of State aid in favour of rural farms."
"This is nothing to do with large and small holdings – it is to do with the production method, in other words with where workers are actually employed."
"We – and I as the rapporteur – take the view that, of the options you have listed here, we obviously need to look into the first option of insurance against natural disasters; this already occurs, but just needs to be put on a more systematic basis."
"Option 2, regarding whether there is or should be a mutual fund, is an interesting consideration, but, as I said earlier, it should be made clear here too that the payments that farmers have to make to these funds must take account both of the scale of production and of the farmer's ability to pay, so that the new system does not end up once again in inequalities to the detriment of rural farming."
"It is also important for farmers themselves to be involved in this insurance, in other words for there to be cofinancing from the farms, so that we do not end up with state protection, replacing one system with the other, that is to say bringing the system we have just abolished back to life under a different name."
"Normal risks must largely be allowed for and managed by farmers and farm managers themselves on the basis of their business knowledge."
"Our main criticisms are reserved for Option 3. This relates to providing basic coverage against income crises."
"Natural disasters and unpredictable risks obviously always result in loss of income, in other words to economic strain."
"However, we must not run the risk of this coverage against income crises taking us back to the old system of guaranteed incomes via state intervention."
"It will be clear from our report just how careful we have been about this."
"Nevertheless, some groups have concentrated on this area in their amendments, and have at least said that we should look into the possibility of supporting these measures and the connection with the WTO."
"To that we say that the reforms dismantled the old-style intervention system, and it must not be replaced."
"– Mr President, everyone knows that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate conditions."
"The previous speaker told us so and there is no need for us to repeat ourselves."
"Everyone also knows that, under the old CAP, there was far more protectionism towards Greek farming than there is under the present common agricultural policy and I greatly fear that the next common agricultural policy will be even worse."
"We consider that the insurance system, however it works, will have its pros and cons, but we consider that the participation of the European Union in financing is very, very small and I think that we should be more generous on this point."
"In addition, I would like to say that particular importance needs to be attached to fruits, which are sensitive products and which have greater need for protection."
"Similarly, we have seen over recent days a large rise in fuel prices which, for numerous agricultural crops, will result in a ruinous increase in costs."
"Additional measures which we need to see to attentively and carefully are that, in times of crisis, storage and processing and promotion need to be stepped up, as do voluntary cutbacks in production."
"We consider it particularly important for the entire system to be subject to speedy intervention."
"To close, I have to say that, in the particularly globalised environment to which we have brought our agriculture, if we do not support it, it will be ruined and we shall have no European agriculture."
". Mr President, the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf discussed here today identifies clearly and concisely the shortcomings and flaws of the risk and crisis management system in European agriculture."
"For many years, the common agricultural policy protected farming and farmers in Europe."
"While recent reform has made farmers more market-oriented, it has also forced them to shoulder the responsibility for risk management."
"Subsidised European agriculture removed the mechanisms for preventing and insuring against risk."
"Few farmers can plan for crisis situations today and unfortunately few of them can afford insurance in a climate of free competition and low profits."
"Non-agricultural undertakings, traders and insurance companies have created a whole portfolio of insurances, to cover even such sophisticated situations as exchange rate fluctuations or income loss due to political circumstances in the case of foreign investments."
"Both the Commission’s communication and the rapporteur’s excellent report show just how far behind this issue has fallen in the European Union."
"A farmer-entrepreneur running a farm on the free market after the reform and in the face of enormous competition is risking everything, without having even the insurance fallback that is available to the investor or trader."
"A large or highly productive farm will be in a position to cover the cost of insurance and the cost of risk, but millions of small and family-run farms in Europe cannot afford to pay for insurance to cover their own homes, let alone their production."
"If a crisis arises, these farmers have to rely on help from their neighbours or on State aid."
"What European farmer is going to take out insurance against income loss in the event of borders being closed by Russia, against reform of the market in sugar and the need to destroy plantings, or against the dumping price of fruit and vegetables imported from China?"
"Who will comprehensively insure a farmer-investor and the risk of financing investments, the risk of fluctuations in the price of produce, the price of fertilisers, feeds and fuel, the risk of global climate change, soil degradation, drought, hurricanes, flooding and storms?"
"Who will provide insurance to cover imbalances in supply and demand, epidemic diseases and genetically modified food?"
"As a sector of the economy, agriculture requires a special legal and organisational framework for its insurance needs."
"Agriculture is too fragmented and weak as a sector to set up its own insurance schemes."
"Even the richest countries of the European Union are not in a position to take on this task on their own."
"This means that a common and universal insurance system must be set up to include all Member States and all farmers as part of a reinsurance scheme."
"The 1% from modulation proposed by the Commission will not be sufficient for a reinsurance scheme, let alone setting up a system of prevention and indemnification."
"Spain has the most effective insurance system currently in place in Europe."
"I therefore call on the Commission to universally apply this system as rapidly as possible and to adopt it as a standard model in the European Union."
"Only then should discussions be opened with major insurance companies and national governments about an appropriate system that would be universal and compulsory, solvent and low in cost, fair and based on the principle of subsidiarity."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for rightly mentioning the exclusion of the new Member States from the 1% modulation, and proposing an alternative funding scheme for these countries to the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringsdorf, for his work on the report on risk and crisis management in agriculture."
"We live at a time when a lot of damage is caused as a result of natural disasters ranging from major floods to drought and fires."
"Also fresh in our memories is the huge amount of expenditure incurred by Europe as a result of infectious diseases in animals and efforts to eradicate and combat these."
"We wish to continue with the liberalisation of the EU’s agricultural policy in the current WTO negotiations."
"The CAP reform was a large and important step in that direction."
"I do not, however, think that the Commission has shown a sufficient sense of urgency about coming up with proposals for eliminating or reducing risks and for averting crises and outbreaks of disease that we could well do without."
"Who is to cover the losses due to future outbreaks of disease?"
"How is the market to be regulated and managed, especially in those areas of the EU that are not affected by disease but that are nonetheless hit by no longer being able as easily to export foodstuffs?"
"Why has the Commission not put proposals on the table concerning the provision of insurance cover by private and mutual insurance companies – something requested by the European Parliament as long as two years ago?"
"The many different insurance facilities that exist are used in agriculture and by the food industry on a daily basis."
"This area must therefore be investigated very quickly with a view to devising cover for the large losses that the agricultural budget will not in future be able to cover."
"Finally, I should like to say very clearly that we do not want to go back to the State aid or disguised State aid of earlier times."
"Mr President, Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture has a major credibility problem."
"The committee takes decisions that often have only one purpose, namely to grab more money for itself and its friends."
"However, all of us in this Chamber share responsibility for the European Parliament’s plenary again and again adopting the resolutions presented to us by the Committee on Agriculture."
"Today, it is crisis management and insurance schemes that are at issue."
"The subject is in itself a useful one to debate, and the report contains a lot that is constructive."
"However, it also contains some bad things, and it is those on which I want to concentrate on this occasion."
"Firstly, crisis management and insurance schemes should be funded by the industry itself. I have been told that the spokesman for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fought hard for this to happen, but that he was in a minority in the committee."
"What is more, crisis management and insurance schemes should have to do with genuine crises."
"I find it commendable that farmers everywhere in Europe should show solidarity with each other if their farms are hit by serious diseases such as BSE, foot and mouth disease or avian influenza."
"When, however, the Committee on Agriculture defines trade liberalisation in the WTO as a crisis situation, that is not a sign of healthy prioritisation."
"It is a sign of the Committee on Agriculture’s patent unaccountability."
"I very much hope that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested a split vote so that we might have this notion removed from the resolution."
"Finally, I expect support for the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for a split vote with a view to removing the committee’s demand for aid for offsetting high oil prices."
"That is emphatically the worst thing in the report."
"It is depressing to see how often Members of the European Parliament, who otherwise work to bring about a green Europe and to forestall disaster where the climate is concerned, go no way towards discovering what goes on in the Committee on Agriculture."
"It is nothing less than appalling that the proposal concerning aid in connection with oil can reach plenary at all."
"This is something that the groups’ spokesmen on environmental and climate issues should have nipped in the bud."
"What, however, is, in the end, required to get the Committee on Agriculture to act in a less self-centred way?"
"I do not, unfortunately, believe that anything will happen until the European Parliament obtains real influence over agricultural policy and until we get rather more people with farther-reaching visions of Europe in the committee."
"– Mr President, risk and crisis management measures need to be introduced in the agricultural sector."
"This need relates not only to protection from natural risks but also from the breakdown and gradual abolition, through the review of the CAP and WTO agreements, of mechanisms which, even if not terribly satisfactory, do protect farmers' incomes."
"Similarly, farmers also need protection both from the introduction of new technologies and, more importantly, from genetically modified organisms, which harbour unpredictable negative repercussions on the environment, public health and farmers' income, as the rapporteur notes in his report."
"Nonetheless, all the proposed scenarios are predicated on the fact that they will not encumber the Community budget and that the appropriations needed will be deducted from appropriations for differentiation."
"In fact, private insurance companies are considered to be a basic mechanism for implementing the proposed measures."
"However, we all know that, even in such cases, some companies do not insure certain categories of risks because they are unprofitable."
"In addition, the report accepts the incentives set by the Commission, relating mainly to reinsurance, which needs to be free or with reduced reinsurance premiums by national agencies or by introducing reinsurance premium subsidies, in order to safeguard the companies' profitability."
"I do not agree that natural and commercial disasters, especially for small- and medium-sized farms, should generate profits for insurance capital."
"At the same time, it is accepted that compensation should not be paid for losses of less than 30% of the average over the preceding three years."
"In other words, the following injustice is being promoted: small- and medium-sized farms will sustain losses from natural disasters and commercial crises, in the best case scenario of at least 30%, while insurance capital's profitability will be guaranteed."
"Even if we accept that measures need to be introduced which will cover all the losses caused to farmers' income by various natural disasters and commercial crises, we cannot, however, agree with these proposals, which create an additional burden on small- and medium-sized farms; instead of improving their income, in our opinion they reduce it."
". Mr President, it seems to me that the biggest risk that farmers face every year is that agriculture, and ultimately their livelihoods, are controlled by the European Union."
"The debacle that Britain suffered during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, is eloquent testimony to what happens when crises are managed by the EU."
"It is not widely known that the strategy for dealing with that disaster was managed by the then Commissioner for Agriculture, and what a complete pig’s breakfast he made of that."
"Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an orgy of killing and burning that shocked the world."
"Furthermore, the roots of the disaster lay with the EU and its destruction of local slaughterhouses through excessive regulation."
"I am gratified to see that the report acknowledges that the CAP has ‘encouraged the development of non-sustainable production methods heavily dependent on water and energy’."
"But, judging by this weekend’s newspaper revelations that the EU has a surplus of four billion bottles of wine, costing the taxpayers a billion a year, not much has been learnt in that area."
"I would ask Members to reject this report, until a study has been made of the practical implications and the cost of implementing its recommendations."
"It seems to me that trying to protect farmers against everything, including weather aberrations such as storms, as this report indicates, will be extremely expensive and possibly fruitless in the end, because who can predict the unpredictable?"
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on tackling the very important question of managing risk and crises in the agricultural sector, and taking the situation of the new Member States into account too."
"I also welcome the Commission’s concern for farmers having to face up to the crises caused by the liberalisation of agricultural markets, export restrictions and animal diseases, not to mention natural disasters."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say, Commissioner, that fuel payments and biofuel production are of particular interest to Polish farmers."
"Biofuel production will boost income and make farmers feel more secure."
"It will also lessen day—to-day anxiety and worry caused by the fluctuating price of pigmeat for example."
"Mr President, market regulation and price support used to do quite a good job of protecting the agricultural sector from risks."
"Agricultural reform has now turned much of that over to the market, and in principle that is quite right too."
"However, farming is in a unique situation: even though farmers have to cope with climate change, livestock epidemics, natural disasters and global sectoral crises, much of which they cannot even predict, let alone plan for economically, they still need planning security."
"More market thus also means a need for more private-sector involvement in the management of agricultural risks and crises."
"The report provides some very positive proposals – an astonishing number coming from a Green rapporteur."
"Despite some imbalances, it is a very welcome sight coming from that part of the political spectrum."
"It is primarily producers, associations and private insurers who are called on to provide innovative risk management concepts throughout Europe."
"The European Union and the State must take a back seat."
"The public purse must be restricted to partial coverage for uninsurable risks such as natural disasters or massive livestock epidemics."
"That is why we have to design reinsurance systems, and the European Union must also provide an aid framework that allows both private solutions and public coverage for extreme risks."
"However, we must bear in mind that we cannot insure against every conceivable eventuality."
"The world's climatic zones are shifting, and this has effects on the geography of farming that call, as a matter of urgency, for scientific investigation."
"Europe has a duty to encourage this."
"We will also end up having to look into resettlement measures."
"These are regions that are being affected by ever worsening and more frequent droughts or floods, so that farming there is simply no longer worth it."
"In this context we must also recognise the realities of additional risk insurance, and thus also provide aid for resettlement and structural change."
"That, too, is a political responsibility of the European Union!"
"– Mr President, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his report, for the proposals which he has tabled and for accepting many of the proposals tabled by the political groups and, on the other hand, I wish to thank the Commission itself and Commissioner Fischer Boel for their balanced communication in this sector and for the alternative scenarios which they present, scenarios in which each Member State, depending on the structure of their insurance systems and the peculiarities of their agriculture, can find their own level."
"However, I should like to say to Mrs Fischer Boel that you need to put far more pressure on the Council so that future Councils of Ministers follow an integrated policy in this sector and the Agriculture and Fisheries Council does not confine itself simply to a sectoral perception of management policy, such as for example, in the fruit sector, because, as far as the fruit sector is concerned, insurance policy funds will come from the sector itself and will have nothing to do with cofinancing or financing from the fluctuation mechanism."
"As you all know, we are in what I believe is the most sensitive development of the common agricultural policy, a development which is being judged by global trade itself and by the corresponding European Union agreements."
"On the other hand, we have the financial framework which is being set at the negotiating table between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission with the guillotine of the common agricultural policy review clause."
"Above all, however, what we have to hope for, as Parliament, is that there will be a full guarantee of farmers' incomes and of agricultural production in the European Union."
"Within the framework of these objectives therefore, by 2013, the crisis management policy, with the creation of a security index for farmers' incomes, will be one of the basic priorities of the European Union and will need to identify with and be combined with our policy to strengthen the fluctuation mechanism."
"I should like to stress, for the benefit of my honourable friends worried about competitiveness, that a great many of our international commercial competitors have applied the price security index even at the level of loss of income due to changes in commercial pricing policy, a policy covered by WTO agreements."
"European producers therefore need to fight with the same mechanisms and the same weapons in international trade."
"Commissioner, I should just like to mention to you a combination, as it were, of measures which are needed: reinsurance, private insurance and state insurance."
"The management policy system – and here I disagree with the rapporteur – will not be the subject of state subsidies, because this will be the greatest distortion for future agriculture."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that farming has become subject to increasingly serious risks and crises in recent years, caused by climate change and natural disasters such as flooding, drought and fires, and to the damage caused by animal diseases which are being spread more rapidly at international level."
"Although the Commission has put forward a number of options for managing risks and crises, its proposals do not take account of the problems facing small and medium-sized holdings and family farming, which are under threat from an unfair common agricultural policy and from World Trade Organisation negotiations. The upshot of this is the destruction of thousands of small holdings, the strangulation of the rural world and the desertification of vast sections of the interior of countries such as Portugal, which is also reflected in the increased number of forest fires."
"What is more, quite apart from urging the cofinancing of insurance premiums against natural disasters paid by farmers, the Commission is proposing to finance this from just 1% of funds from modulation, which is clearly inadequate."
"What is needed, as we have been proposing, is a public insurance scheme financed by the EU, with a view to creating a better policy framework for risk management and crisis prevention, which is crucial for family farming."
"As the rapporteur points out, the Commission’s proposals do not take sufficient account of the level of risk and probability of crises. It is therefore crucial that the Commission carry out a more detailed assessment of the instruments and measures that could prevent collapses in prices, market crises, farmers’ income losses and all obstacles standing in the way of their continuing to farm."
"I note, Commissioner, your willingness to take on board arguments put forward in this debate, and look forward to seeing this put into practice, both in terms of risk and crisis management in farming, and in the creation of a safety net in relation to the forthcoming reforms of common organisation of agricultural markets, in particular of wine, fruit and vegetables."
"What is also needed is to provide for the possibility of granting aid for farmers to purchase fuel when the price has increased sharply."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report."
"It is good to see the Commissioner here this evening, because the Commission has put forward a flexible approach to crisis management in agriculture."
"Animal diseases and natural disasters are going to happen and we must find a flexible approach to these."
"The CAP reform is now moving towards offering help for farmers to help themselves."
"That really has to be the way forward."
"If you take what happened with the foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, the huge sums of money that were needed to eradicate the disease could never have been funded by an insurance company on its own."
"We should perhaps look at a form of insurance with the Member State and the European Union as the insurer of last resort, so that they can actually step in when there are huge disasters."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf referred to young farmers in his report."
"There is a special case for a certain amount of extra help for those setting up business early on in their career, because they do not have the capital behind them and they need extra support."
"If Mr Titford had still been in the Chamber, I would have liked to take him up on his comment that Commissioner Fischler and the European Commission were to blame for the mishandling of the foot-and-mouth crisis."
"Had he been part of the inquiry here in the European Parliament, he would have found that was not the case."
"I have to admit to you that the blame lay with the UK Government and a Prime Minister who was hell bent on calling a general election and wanted to get the disease under control."
"He had a huge contiguous cull of millions of animals that was completely unnecessary."
"We could have used vaccines, which were also ruled out."
"I would have liked to put Mr Titford right on that and other points."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, recent years and in particular the past year have provided eloquent examples of the variety of risks and crises facing Europe’s farmers."
"In 2005, at the same time as thousands of hectares of forest were being destroyed by fire, with the loss of human life, and when a number of parts of southern European were stricken by drought, a number of countries of Central Europe were afflicted by devastating floods."
"In both cases, the magnitude involved was without historical parallel."
"What is more, animal diseases and the inexorable liberalisation of trade have particularly exposed farmers to fresh risks and uncertainties."
"The Commission’s initiative underpinning this report is therefore a welcome one."
"It falls short, however, of what is actually needed."
"I therefore share the rapporteur’s view in most of the points raised and suggestions made, with particular regard to agricultural insurance and mutual funds, although I regret the timidity – I have chosen this word with great care – of his approach towards coverage against income crises, particularly given that some of our main trading competitors have such safety measures at their disposal."
"I also feel that this report is an important tool in a broader approach that the issue merits, not least as part of the ongoing debate on the solidarity fund, the forestry strategy that we will certainly discuss, along with the own-initiative reports on natural disasters being drawn up by various committees."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt coherent positions with regard to this range of instruments."
"This is the best contribution it can make towards the Union being in a position to provide adequate, urgently-needed protection for its farmers, firstly to prevent the occurrence of crises and risks, but also to rectify them if it proves impossible to prevent them."
"Mr President, the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely."
"There has been a radical shift in agricultural activity, brought about by the agricultural reforms of 2003, and the opening-up of markets as a result of the WTO."
"While benefits have undoubtedly flowed for farmers, there has been – as has been said repeatedly this evening – a greater and real increase in the risk factors."
"Under the new CAP, the risk and crisis measures that we had all become used to were dismantled and the onus on the protection, prevention and management of crises has shifted squarely onto the farmers’ shoulders."
"Open markets and product mobility increase the possibility of the spread of disease."
"Climate change is happening very quickly, so that reorientation will be inevitable."
"The depletion of oil stocks means that fertilisers, pesticides and machinery will all be affected in due course and, by extension, agriculture will be affected and will have to adapt."
"In Ireland, the nitrates directive, for example, is beginning to bite and having such serious consequences that the farming organisations have withdrawn from the government-sponsored social and economic partnership talks."
"Farming is in transition as never before."
"It is in transition because of a variety of factors and the transition will continue."
"Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before."
"Good farming practice and a stable and experienced farming population are the best guarantee for what Europe needs, which is a safe, secure and healthy food supply."
"Farming is a difficult life: long hours, hard work, high investment and many risks."
"In many cases it is a whole family transaction."
"It deserves the protection against risks proposed by the rapporteur in this report."
"I commend the rapporteur and his report."
"I support him completely, particularly in relation to option 2, and I welcome the Commissioner’s comments this evening."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for tackling the problem of risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector."
"This is an enormous task, given the significant number of issues that have to be dealt with. The latter range from limiting the impact of natural phenomena such as droughts, floods, fires and hail, through diseases and epidemics, to the risk of income loss resulting from falling demand for agricultural produce or rising prices, for example for fuel."
"Risk insurance, reinsurance and producer payments are just one aspect of reducing the risk of running the business we call agricultural production."
"For us to really manage, or in other words to reduce, the risk involved in agricultural production, we need to manage that risk."
"This implies a different approach to the concentration of production, dispersal, reinstating the natural environment, introducing new methods and new technology such as biotechnology."
"A number of these actions have already been taken. Together, they will make it possible to eliminate adverse phenomena and reduce production risks."
"Mr President, it is always good to belong to one of the larger groups, because you get more time."
"Commissioner, in my first speech I placed the emphasis on not succumbing to the risk of relapse, and spoke of the social balance that must be involved in a new system of this type, but now I would also like to focus on preventative crisis management."
"All of the crises that have been mentioned here, including the fires, were, in part, caused by human beings and human action."
"Even the BSE crisis was not sent down from on high, but was caused by cows being fed to cows, completely contrary to any sense in good farming practice."
"If we plant maize and eucalyptus in dry areas, we should not then be surprised when damage by fire and drought is the result."
"When we talk about liberalisation, on which one Member has expressed rather different ideas, we should not be surprised – if we look at it as an end rather than as a means – that many people go out of business and fall into major crises, including income crises."
"We must therefore ensure that proper arrangements are made, through the WTO, for qualified market access."
"I would point out that many smallholdings and organic farms have created a higher value, high-quality market by keeping genetically modified organisms out."
"If we now botch coexistence, it will turn into a Trojan horse, and then these good, high-quality markets, including the wine market, will have gone."
"Then we will lurch into crises that we could have prevented, and insurance will be the last of the things we need to talk about."
"However, Commissioner, I am also talking about the possibility of economic development in rural areas and the fact that, when it comes to the second pillar, we are now threatened with financial exhaustion."
"We should then not be surprised if many farmers who have entered these higher-value markets are prevented from pursuing this development by exhaustion and are on the point of getting out."
"General agricultural policy therefore also has to fulfil a preventative function."
"I would also remind you that fossil fuels are going to run out in the not too distant future, and that we must prepare farmers for the need to convert to other energy sources and, perhaps, help them to benefit from them."
"We can operate crisis prevention in this context, too, and I would like these preventative considerations to play a role in the legislative proposal by the Commission – which is currently in the brainstorming phase this year."
"To Mrs Batzeli I would say that, when I talked about management responsibility, I did not simply want to blame the crises on the incompetence of the farmers, but I did want agriculture to have an influence on policy in the way I have described, so that the crises do not arise in the first place, and so that in future farmers are guaranteed a decent income."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate."
"Many of the points mentioned in the report are covered by the ongoing studies that the Commission has initiated, for example, proposals 2, 5, 7, 19 and 23."
"Regarding the safety-net provision – proposal 8 – the discussion in the Council has not produced a clear mandate for introducing a general safety clause in all COMs or for trying to finance this insurance out of the modulated money."
"However, I am ready to examine the introduction of targeted risk and crisis management provisions in other COMs and, as mentioned by Mr Gklavakis, in the fruit and vegetable sector, which we will also discuss here in Parliament at the end of this year."
"I completely agree with your rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that basic coverage against income reduction is not a solution."
"It is quite clear that, if or when we face structural problems, they must be solved through policy changes."
"That is obvious and I am very happy about Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s clear support for it."
"As a safety-net for income, I consider the CAP reform’s decoupled direct payment to the farmer to be essential."
"I am positive about the content of proposals 18, 24 and 26."
"I also take this opportunity to draw your attention to the review of the state aid guidelines adopted by the Commission on 8 February."
"The Commission proposes to include compensation for bad weather and animal and plant diseases in the present exemption regulation for state aid within the agricultural sector."
"This is hopefully a simplification."
"It would also speed up the implementation of state aid in such situations, so that we can react extremely quickly."
"The Commission has looked into a number of options for encouraging the development of risk crisis management tools and providing an improved response in the event of a crisis."
"My intention for the communication was, firstly, to have a comprehensive orientation debate in the Council and here in Parliament before tabling any legislative proposal."
"The discussions we have had so far in the Council have not, as I said, produced a clear mandate to introduce a general safety clause."
"However, the Commission is ready to proceed further if there should at any stage be a clear mandate from the Council."
"Since I consider crisis and risk management an important issue for the future as well, even in the situation of an absence of a clear mandate from the Council I am prepared to examine the introduction of a crisis management provision, as I said previously, on a case-by-case basis."
"There was a question about the position of the new Member States."
"It is quite clear that the new Member States will not be excluded from risk management measures."
"As we have pointed out in the communication, we could envisage identifying a comparable envelope in rural development, just as we do for the old Member States – a clear signal to the ten new Member States."
"With the political agreement on the CAP reform and the implementation that has now taken place in all the Member States, we want European farmers to try and seize the market opportunities."
"There is a strong responsibility for the farmer, but there is also a need for solidarity when crises arise."
"Listening to the discussions in the European Parliament as well as in the Council, it seems to me that the approaches are fairly different."
"My conclusion is, therefore, that we need to study the options carefully and discuss them before taking a final decision on the instruments to be used."
"I agree completely with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that prevention is usually better than cure and my personal view is that the conference on coexistence to be held in April is necessary in order to avoid GMOs being mixed with organic production."
"I am therefore particularly looking forward to that discussion."
"As for your views on fossil fuels, I do not think that we should wait until we have used up those fuels; we should start now to look at what can be done on renewable energy."
"I am thinking specifically about our recent discussions on bioethanol and the possibility of taking full advantage of agriculture’s contribution to this future way of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions."
"This has been an interesting discussion and I thank the rapporteur for what I consider to be a balanced approach to this very important issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Mr Kindermann on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the implementation of a European Union forestry strategy [2005/2054(INI)] (A6-0015/2006)."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, on a very well-balanced report."
"The Commission believes that the main issues and challenges in the European forestry sector are well reflected in the draft opinion."
"In particular, we appreciate the overall support given to the Commission’s proposal concerning the preparation of a European action plan for forestry."
"In our view, the action plan should provide a coherent, verifiable and practical framework for the implementation of this strategy."
"It could become a major instrument of coordination between Community actions and the forestry policies in the different Member States."
"For that reason, we consider the development and implementation of the action plan a dynamic process, which should involve the Member States and the stakeholders and should be accompanied by regular monitoring and reporting."
"The ideas are very well expressed in the draft opinion and we fully share the rapporteur’s view on the need to develop the action plan in close cooperation with the Member States and the stakeholders."
"I think we have already made progress in that respect."
"The action plan will be based on the overall principles of the European forestry strategy, which are sustainability and subsidiarity."
"There are three specific issues that I would like to highlight."
"First, the need to enhance the competitiveness of the forestry sector, in line with the Lisbon objectives."
"There is growing concern about the economic viability of sustainable forestry in the European Union in the context of globalisation."
"Competitiveness is a key pillar of sustainable forest management and it is of crucial importance in maintaining the multiple benefits that forestry provides to society, including employment opportunities in rural areas where there is nothing else."
"Forestry can deliver a wide range of products and services to society and we should try to develop this potential in the future."
"The second issue is that the forestry sector has to respond to social demands concerning the protection of the environment and the natural heritage, in accordance with the Gothenburg objectives of sustainable development."
"The forestry sector as a whole will prosper best if it fits snugly into wider society."
"Actively contributing to major European objectives, such as biodiversity, conservation or climate change mitigation, will offer new opportunities for forestry."
"In relation to a previous discussion, the possibility of biomass for energy is a clear example of how forestry can contribute."
"The last issue is the global importance of forestry for sustainable development and the need firmly to continue our support for international commitments for the protection and sustainable management of forestry worldwide."
"That also involves measures to combat illegal logging and related trade in forest products."
"Those issues are well addressed in the report and I can assure you that they will be reflected in our action plans."
". Mr President, Commissioner, in May 2005 the Agriculture Council called on the Commission to work in close cooperation with all those involved to draw up an EU action plan for sustainable forest management by mid-2006, which should turn the various elements of the EU's forest strategy into reality."
"With its own-initiative report on the EU forestry strategy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made an early entry into the discussion, and we want this report to take the process we have initiated further and deeper."
"Which of our considerations and demands ultimately end up in the action plan is, of course, purely up to the Commission, but the quality of the cooperation – for which I am very grateful – leads us to believe that, on the essential issues, we are thinking along the same lines."
"The starting point for our own-initiative report was the Council resolution of 1998 on a forestry strategy for the European Union, which offers a whole range of possibilities, but has no specific targets and no coherent structure."
"In accordance with the various starting points, and alongside some general remarks, we have identified a range of strategy elements."
"I would just like briefly to go over the most important points."
"First: Until now, there has been no uniform legal basis for forestry activities at EU level."
"In our view, an objective assessment would be desirable despite all the concerns of those involved."
"Secondly: There are various definitions of forest both internationally and in each of our 25 countries, and we therefore ask the Commission to consider drafting a European definition, in order to make the European Union's measures in this domain transparent and comparable."
"Thirdly: In order to improve coordination, communication and cooperation, we propose strengthening existing structures such as the Standing Forestry Committee."
"In addition to horizontal coordination, the exchange of information between the levels of the hierarchy within the Commission must be improved using the new Inter-Service Group."
"In our opinion, this vertical coordination should have a dedicated unit in the Secretariat General."
"Fourthly: Europe's forests must be protected from forest fires and air pollution, and also from soil and water pollution."
"Illegal logging outside the EU must be combated by means of appropriate coordinated international measures, and the EU can play its part in this."
"Fifthly: Forests can help us to slow down the greenhouse effect and climate change, but only if we make greater use of their various products."
"The EU should therefore promote the use of environmentally friendly wood products and give renewable energy from forests a greater place in its energy supplies."
"Sixthly: In order to promote the competitiveness of the sector, and thus employment and income in rural areas, Europe needs to address itself more effectively to such tasks as the mobilisation of timber resources, the removal of obstacles to the use of wood, overcoming structural problems in forestry, and the diversification of forest owners’ income."
"Seventhly: since forestry-related research and development have a major role to play in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, key forestry research projects should therefore be included in the Seventh Framework Programme of Research."
"Eighthly: European training and further training programmes such as Leonardo and Erasmus should be put to more use than hitherto in the forestry sector."
"In this connection, the Member States are particularly called on to provide those affected with more information on the opportunities available."
"Finally: What contribution can the forestry sector make to Lisbon and Gothenburg?"
"We think that Europe's forests, unlike those in other regions of the world, are underutilised, not only with regard to timber – we use only 60% of the quantity grown – but also with regard to services that have previously been unmarketable."
"We want the European forestry sector to improve its competitiveness in this way, because only a vibrant and competitive forestry sector can contribute to Lisbon and Gothenburg and thus to the wellbeing of Europeans."
"– Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I should like to emphasise that forests are incredibly important to our continent and that they affect a very large number of people."
"In Sweden, forests and forest management account for nearly 30% of the economy, and there are more than 15 million forest owners in Europe."
"What we decide here in Parliament is therefore of great importance to a lot of people, both at home in Sweden and in many parts of Europe."
"I know that there is great anxiety about the EU interfering in forestry issues and beginning to take decisions and about Brussels starting to meddle in this area."
"I can understand that concern, for such interference would not be helpful."
"There are huge differences between an olive grove in southern Italy and an industrial forestry business in northern Sweden."
"Decisions about forests should be taken locally and close to those who are familiar with the forests and who use and own them."
"I wish, however, to reassure those who fear such a development."
"I believe that the Commission is extremely clear in its statement: forestry policy should be based on subsidiarity."
"This is the starting point for those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"That does not, however, mean that the EU does not have any responsibility for forestry."
"On the contrary, the EU has a big responsibility, namely that of taking account of the forests in all its decision-making."
"Now already, the EU takes a great many political decisions that affect European forests either directly or indirectly."
"We in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety find, however, that coordination between the various proposals affecting our forests is almost non-existent."
"This state of affairs both makes for inconsistency between different environmental objectives and affects the basic conditions under which forests are managed."
"I wish, therefore, to emphasise that, in my opinion, the Commission’s most important task in the future is to coordinate existing policy and monitor how it affects forests."
"Moreover, preliminary assessments able to take account of the ways in which different political decisions affect European forests and forest management must be carried out in good time."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the importance of forest management."
"It is probably the branch of industry that most clearly creates both economic and environmental value."
"As the Commission points out, EU forestry does, however, have problems being competitive in the global, open market, and that is something that has a price in terms of environmental value."
"My and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s message to you today is, therefore, that, by taking account of our forests, the Commission should be able to create sound and stable conditions for forest management and thus give Europe both a better economy and a better environment."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Kindermann for his wise and balanced report, as he has put a great deal of commitment and empathy into achieving a compromise and drafting a balanced text."
"We are in favour of the forest strategy, Commissioner, but against market regulation, and that is something we want to make quite clear."
"We are in favour of subsidiarity in forestry policy and are convinced that we should continue to go down that path."
"We certainly should pay much more attention to this sector."
"If only 85% of the forested area in the European Union is managed, we must do our level best to bring the other 15% into the economic cycle; and if, as Mr Kindermann has indicated, only 60% of the wood grown is used, it is all the more important to draw attention to it: it is only if they are used that these forests can be protected."
"Let me also say that the fairy tale of the dying forests of Europe we have been told for decades really was a fairy tale, a tale told more for political effect than for any other reason."
"If there is growth of 450 thousand hectares a year, then the forests are certainly not dying, but expanding."
"It thus only remains for me, Commissioner, to ask you to incorporate into your work as much as possible of what ultimately remains binding in the text following tomorrow's vote, and I am pleased that you have already agreed to do so at the end of your speech."
". – Commissioner, the European forest, and its economic, social and environmental importance, is a subject in which we have a shared interest."
"We must never overlook the fact that forests account for 35% of EU territory, 3.5 million jobs, 15 million owners and a production value of over EUR 350 million."
"These figures illustrate the importance of the issue and the importance that the European institutions should be attaching to it. This is especially true at a time when various factors – be they natural or man-made – pose such a threat to forests."
"In a particularly complex international context, the Union urgently needs a fresh approach to the energy question, whereby biomass is duly brought to the fore, and this is borne out by the priority that the Commission and the Austrian Presidency have been attaching to the issue."
"I therefore welcome the Commission’s communication on the implementation of the strategy and commend Mr Kindermann on his report. I welcome much of the report, which represents an excellent contribution from Parliament to the formation of Europe’s forestry strategy."
"Furthermore, there are a number of proposed amendments which I believe will help to improve upon and complete the report."
"The fact that the report acknowledges the vulnerabilities of the forest is a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate on natural disasters."
"The Commission will hopefully, therefore, adopt an integrated approach to this vitally important issue, an approach that sees the problem, as we do, as a whole. In this way, the contributions of the various instruments now on the political agenda can help to improve the situation for Europe’s forests."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a balanced one."
"Although it does not endorse the idea of a common forestry policy, it does stress the need for coordination."
"The report acknowledges that Member States vary in their definitions of what is meant by the word ‘forest’, which makes it difficult to offer a definitive assessment of important Community forestry measures."
"I, for one, am disappointed that the proposal to set up a European observatory has not been adopted."
"Such an observatory would have led to the use of reliable, retrievable data."
"That aside, I support the proposals calling on the Commission to improve coordination between the various Directorates-General concerned with forestry issues and to strengthen the role of the Standing Forestry Committee."
"I tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to make proposals to the Member States based, in particular, on tax arrangements and designed to encourage forest owners to plant indigenous species in order to maintain biodiversity and reduce fire risks."
"The spirit of this proposal was echoed in the report, which recommends the adoption of measures for the prevention of fires and desertification, afforestation with native species, the promotion of diversity, the sustainable management of natural forests and the promotion of environmental services, particularly with a view to protecting water systems and combating erosion."
"The implementation of these measures entails investments on the part of forest owners."
"As they provide benefits to society, they deserve to be duly compensated."
"Lastly, the report takes account of my hopes and fears for the sector."
"It sets out the priority axes for a policy that will be global, yet will cater specifically for each region, taking account of the economic, social and environmental potential of the forestry sector."
"Thank you, Mr Kindermann, for your work, which I believe will secure a large majority in tomorrow’s vote."
". – The undoubted need to maintain forests and to preserve their multifunctional nature requires effective management and support measures that take account of the range of forests and their specific problems."
"I therefore do not accept the idea of emphasising a one-size-fits-all concept of the forest, when we know that there are internationally accepted definitions underpinning reports on, and periodical assessments of, the state of forests in Europe and the rest of the world."
"Whilst we welcome an EU Action Plan for the sustainable development of forests, we do not endorse a number of the proposals put forward in the report before us."
"We regret the rejection of a number of proposals that we made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, aimed at warning of the situation in the forests of southern Europe, which face fires on a yearly basis, and which in some years are stricken by drought; such was the case in Portugal last year, where some 300 000 hectares of forest burned, with enormous costs and serious consequences for the forest, biodiversity, farmers and the populations of vast areas."
"We therefore call for a proper medium and long-term forest-fire prevention strategy, a specific regulation and a dedicated budgetary heading with a view to protecting the forests against fires, taking account of resolutions that have actually already been adopted by Parliament and of what happened to the previous specific Community regulation, which was regrettably removed by the Commission."
"We also feel that the next Action Plan should cover seven years, so as to correspond to the next financial perspective. The Plan should include a programme for the protection of cork-oak forests, and a contribution towards the rearing of livestock and cork production, which is of vital importance for rural development across vast areas of countries in the south."
"We trust that the Commission will take on board the proposals – not contained in the report but which we once again wish to stress – to make the Action Plan a proactive instrument in the protection and promotion of the range of forests, including those in the countries of the South where the climate is most conducive to forest fires."
". – Mr President, the figures that characterise forest structure in the 15 countries of the old European Union in terms of forest cover are very good and amount to 35% of the total land area, with a significant majority in the hands of 15 million private owners."
"However, with forests divided to this extent among private owners, the question arises as to how economies of scale can be achieved in forest management."
"I am not against private forest ownership."
"In my home country, Poland, the majority of forests are state-owned, the exact figure being 82%, with 2% of this accounted for by national parks."
"By comparison with other EU countries, the structure of our forests is much richer and older."
"The Polish forestry model is efficient and effective."
"State-owned forests are a self-financing, profit-making institution."
"However, what European Union aid for forests in Central Europe provides is substantial funding to train people who plant trees on their own private land, and funding for payments."
"Support is also needed for areas that are not exploited commercially, national parks and reserves."
"The infrastructure linked to forestry needs modernisation."
"I call on the Commission and Parliament to draw on the experience of forest management in Poland."
"Western Europe can learn from experience too."
"Not everything that is private is always best."
"Non-private forests also need support."
"The wealth of Polish forests benefits society across the entire European Union."
". – Mr President, what I have to say also concerns the problem facing Polish forests mentioned by the previous speaker."
"Poland’s forests are a significant resource, but unlike in most EU countries, the majority – more than 80% of the total area – are state-owned."
"This is the result of a long historical process and at present there are no reasons for a radical change in the structure of forest ownership in Poland."
"Public opinion in Poland is largely in favour of forests continuing to be state-owned."
"The problem is that the EU has thus far discriminated against state-owned forests, denying them support."
"I am pleased that Mr Kindermann’s report contains one amendment that holds out the hope that the situation will change and that EU support will be given to forests irrespective of how they are owned."
"This is something we very much need in Poland and we trust that the Commission will demonstrate understanding of the situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to our rapporteur for his very balanced report, for he has taken a very balanced approach to the three pillars of sustainability – the economic, the ecological and the sociocultural."
"This report reflects the European model of forestry: multifunctional forest management, predominantly private ownership of forests and a close entwinement with agriculture, leisure space for citizens and living space for plants and animals."
"The report also refers to the regional characteristics of forest management: in the South, for example, as has already been mentioned, the problems of forest fires and cork oaks; in Central Europe the high utility of the forests alongside their considerable importance for relaxation, tourism and vital protective functions, particularly in Alpine areas; and in northern Europe primarily the market orientation of timber production."
"It also emphasises the importance to climate policy of wood as an energy source and building material to replace fossil fuels and building materials."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for making specific reference to this."
"I see sustainably managed forests as being a sort of green lung."
"This report particularly emphasises the need to coordinate forestry-related policies at EU level and to take joint measures, agreed by vote to achieve additional effects for European forestry, whilst safeguarding subsidiarity."
"It follows, then, that what we are talking about here is a European forestry strategy."
"I would like to make quite clear my opposition to market regulation of forest management, which has been put up for discussion time and time again."
"Once again, many thanks for this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow the European Parliament will approve the report by Mr Kindermann and, in doing so, it will be sending the Commission and the Council a clear message about the approach we want the future action plan for our forests to take."
"Of all of the ideas on which we have worked in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to stress the innovative nature of the proposals relating to the ban on changes in use of burnt land."
"This measure, which we are already applying with considerable success in my country, Spain, has the great virtue of discouraging those people who destroy our forest heritage whose sole motivation is then to speculate with the land."
"I therefore believe that the future European forest plan must opt clearly for a policy for preserving our forests and enhancing and making the best possible use of the immense resources obtained from forest soil."
"I would also like to say, however, that for a long time we Spanish Members of Parliament and many Members from countries of the South have been calling for a common forest policy to serve as an instrument for managing this heritage, which benefits the whole of the Union."
"I therefore believe that we must not take the wrong approach: the protection of forests is good for the North and good for the South."
"We would have liked some of our suggestions about the Mediterranean forest to have been taken into account."
"We all agree that the forests play a fundamental role and provide us with resources that are closely linked to the future of the Union and to the objectives we all set in Lisbon."
"The multifunctional role of the forests must be enhanced on the basis of a common approach."
"We would therefore urge you, Commissioner, to consider common regulation of what we see as an asset and a heritage for the whole of the European Union."
"– Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, has drafted an excellent report on the implementation of a European Union forestry strategy."
"My sincere thanks go to him for that."
"I also wish to thank him for the excellent cooperation he showed in preparing the report."
"As we have already said, in the European Union forestry employs 3.4 million people, and the value of its output stands at EUR 350 billion."
"In many countries, such as Finland and Sweden, its importance to the economy is crucial."
"Aside from production, forestry provides employment for a cluster of industries related to it, among which is the very considerable metal and electrical engineering industry."
"Its importance will only grow as new possibilities for producing energy are sought."
"The EU, however, has no common forestry plan, although many areas of policy, such as rural development and environmental policy, impact greatly on this sector."
"It is therefore appropriate to undertake a comprehensive assessment of action on forests."
"The report makes the assumption that, even in the future, forestry policy itself will fall within the competence of the Member States."
"The tone of the report suggests that there is no desire to create new bureaucracy similar to the European Union’s agricultural policy."
"The report supports the Commission’s project for an action plan for sustainable forest management in the EU."
"The very fact that this area of policy is so fragmented makes this necessary."
"There have to be better guarantees for the success and future of a sector of industry that employs sustainable, renewable natural resources."
"The report is not in favour of setting up a separate forestry agency."
"This is quite right."
"We in the EU need to learn to rationalise our policies so as to be able to perform new tasks with the resources currently available, without always establishing new agencies."
"I await the Commission’s new proposals with interest."
"Mr President, whilst thanking Mr Kindermann for his report, I would like to stress that the EU’s forestry strategy should have one single goal, namely a systematic extension of the land area covered by forests, particularly large forests."
"Only in forests covering more than 500 ha can the biodiversity of plant and animal species be restored."
"The afforestation policy can be implemented most effectively in the new Member States, particularly in Poland."
"This is because of Poland’s very effective model of ownership and the right to work and exploit forests."
"The evidence for this is that in 50 years Poland has increased its forests by almost 50% and the only virgin forests in the Union are in fact in Poland."
"Large-scale hunting for deer, boar and elk goes on in Polish forests."
"Everyone has access to the forests and those who hunt in them are involved in their management."
"Allocating more funds to afforestation in the new Member States is not the best strategy."
"Supporting and promoting the Polish model of forest management is, in my view, desirable."
"The EU should treat state-owned forests at least as well as privately—owned ones."
"It follows that state-owned forestry undertakings should have the same right to financial support as private ones."
"Any kind of discrimination against state-owned forestry undertakings makes no economic sense."
"Most importantly, it makes no sense either from the ecological point of view."
"Mr President, the EU’s forests are characterised by their great diversity."
"The conditions for preserving their multi-functional role are also diverse."
"This means that forest management must be well-planned and sustainable in order to maximise a forest’s protective and social functions, which are no less important than its productive functions."
"Forest owners play a major role in forest management."
"Studies and reports show that management is at its best in state-owned forests."
"Unfortunately, in contrast to privately-owned forests, state-owned forests cannot rely on significant assistance from EU funds."
"It is therefore necessary to reconsider whether the existing forestry strategy is appropriate, and whether state-owned forests should not also come within the scope of EU assistance."
"We must remember that when all is said and done, what matters to people is the forest, not who owns it."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Commission’s report before us sets out the main conclusions of the analysis of the European forestry strategy and the emerging problems affecting the forestry sector, and suggests measures that might be taken in the future."
"Experience has shown that the forestry sector can help deliver the Lisbon Strategy objectives of sustainable economic development and competitiveness and the Gothenburg objectives, including the safeguarding of Europe’s natural resources."
"The Commission is proposing to develop a European Action Plan for forest management that will be able to provide a consistent framework for implementing measures in the field of forestry, and in so doing help to make the most of the sector’s potential for Europe."
"The Treaty establishing European Union does not, however, lay down a legal basis for a common forestry policy. What is more, neither the sectoral Community policies on the forest, nor the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, have ultimately been sufficiently efficient to combat the deterioration of forests."
"I wish to remind the Chamber of the tragedy of the forest fires and the drought which have laid waste to southern Europe in recent years, and which have unfortunately hit Portugal particularly badly."
"I realise that some may see this situation as nothing more than a distant problem, but I should like to draw your attention to the major difficulties that the forestry sector in southern Europe is facing, and the problems endured by the citizens who depend on the sector."
"In view of its serious nature, this problem needs to be tackled, and a committed and far-reaching approach adopted, as a matter of urgency."
"A common forestry policy is, more than ever, of vital importance."
"I therefore believe that the Member States should think very carefully about the environmental, social and economic benefits of introducing a common policy within the context of the future Constitution."
"I therefore call on the Chamber to support Amendments 7, 8 and 9, to which I have put my name, along with Mrs Herranz Garcia and others."
"Mr President, I believe this report to be very positive and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Kindermann, most warmly on his work."
"We Spanish Socialists identify in particular with this text because it recognises the importance of the forest sector in the European Union, on the basis of broader criteria than the purely economic and also because it highlights the need to produce a single interpretation of the concept of forest."
"Furthermore, because it makes particular mention of fires and the management of disasters, which are the two great problems facing the Spanish forests, and because it supports the general approach and the results of the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, which is a process in which Spain plays a very prominent role, since it is one of the four States that are leading it."
"Furthermore, because I believe that the report by Mr Kindermann provides new elements which deserve to be taken into account, such as — and I believe this to be very important — the need to facilitate coordination and cooperation, both amongst the units of the Commission and between the units of the Commission and the Member States, and enhancing the fields of research, training and communication to the public, fields that are in line with the Spanish forest plan."
"I would like to thank Mr Kindermann very much for having accepted my amendment, relating to the fundamental role played by forests as regulators of the water cycle, but I would still like to see an express mention of the importance of Community intervention in contributing to the maintenance and remuneration, where necessary, of the environmental services that forests provide for the whole of society."
"In this regard, although I believe that we should take account of the importance of the economic and environmental aspect, I would like to say to the Commissioner and the rapporteur that I will continue working to achieve a genuine Community policy in this field."
"– The EU does not have a common forestry policy."
"However, the importance of forestry has prompted the creation of the EU Forestry Strategy, and the Commission is preparing an action plan for its implementation."
"The EU forestry sector is incredibly diverse in terms of forest types, sizes, ownership structures and social-economic conditions."
"Around 60% of forests are private."
"The 10 new Member States have more state-owned forests than the former EU15."
"In Lithuania, 50% of forests are state-owned, 33% private and 17% are reserved for the restoration of ownership rights."
"In Lithuania, forest management is the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment."
"State and private forests are managed by different sections of the ministry."
"Three thousand workers work in state forests, while private ones are run by just 120 officials."
"Not only is forestry management complex, there is also a gap between timber growers and processors."
"The question arises whether it would not be better if forests were administered by an independent Forestry Ministry?"
"Perhaps the Commission could provide some examples of good practice experience in forestry management?"
"– (Mr President, speaking today in the debate on the EU’s forestry strategy, I would like to draw your attention to two facts I consider to be very important."
"In Poland, the State Treasury owns over 80% of the country’s forests that are managed on its behalf by the State forestry undertaking, ."
"Their management, which has spanned a period of several decades, has been acknowledged in World Bank and EU reports as a veritable model of forest management."
"Secondly, the European Union allocated around EUR 5 billion for forestry measures from rural development funds in the period 2000-2006."
"Unfortunately, despite the efforts of a number of my fellow Members, state-run forestry cannot benefit from these funds."
"Consequently, my appeal to you, Commissioner, is that this critical shortcoming in the financing of the forestry strategy be rectified in the next seven-year period, namely 2007-2013."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, allow me, too, to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, for his excellent report and to endorse all of his demands."
"In these times of empty coffers, some people are pulling their hair out when they hear about the new things that the EU is doing and spending money on."
"However, the EU forestry strategy and the drafting of an EU action plan for sustainable forest management are not new activities and expenditure."
"Forestry policy is not a Community matter, although it cannot be denied it, and forest management too, are increasingly influenced by policy in other areas such as the environment and agriculture."
"Ever increasing social demands and environmental standards are also pushing the forest and timber industry to the very edge of profitability."
"If they are pushed over this edge, the managers will withdraw from the fray."
"We see the EU action plan as an opportunity to improve the framework conditions for forest management in the enlarged European Union."
"I think there are two key aspects to this: first, improving communication and coordination structures at EU level, and secondly appointing a structural unit within the Commission to take primary responsibility for implementing forestry action plans and strategies."
"There are three things that we do not need: firstly, European regulation of the timber market, secondly, more bureaucracy, and thirdly, particularly in the current financial situation, I reject EU aid for communal or state forests."
"Forestry in Central Europe is characterised by multifunctionality."
"We hope that social, ecological and economic sustainability will continue to be exemplary in the European context, and that European forestry will remain competitive."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must first commend our rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, for his outstanding report."
"It is crucial that the importance of forests in the EU be taken into account, in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, on account of the area that forests cover in the rural environment, their position in the rural economy as a complementary sector of activity to agriculture and their role in landscape planning, for example in preventing, and limiting the impact of, natural phenomena such as flooding and erosion."
"There are several reasons why an EU forestry strategy would make it possible to establish sustainable development in forests."
"Firstly, it would help mitigate climate change and would contribute to sustainable energy supplies, in particular biomass."
"In this regard, I welcome the agreement reached at the Ecofin Council authorising the application of a reduced rate of VAT for the production of heat and refrigeration from wood."
"In practice, such a reduction should encourage the development of this renewable energy source and of new outlets for the wood sector."
"Furthermore, forestry activities also create wealth and jobs, whether this be …"
"– First of all, I want to thank my colleague Mr Kindermann for preparing the report on the implementation of the EU Forestry Strategy."
"The draft of this report was also debated in Lithuania and was well received by the Forest Owners Association of Lithuania."
"In Lithuania, forests are by tradition an important part of our way of life, culture, mentality and economy."
"This subject is doubtless relevant to the whole of the European Union, in which 60% of forests are managed by 15 million private owners and the average size of a privately-owned forest is only around 13 ha."
"All of the EU Forestry Strategy is important, but today I would like to talk specifically about the eighth strategy element of the report, that is, the stimulation of competitiveness, employment and profitability in the forestry sector, and more precisely its 25th point, which states: ‘calls on the Commission and Member States to include in the EU Action Plan for Sustainable Forest Management effective action measures to avert dangers and cope with serious disasters (fires, storms, insect infestations and drought)’."
"The report correctly underlines that a large part of the European Union's assistance for forest fire prevention is now obtained from rural development funds, and that it is necessary to consolidate the coordination of regional and national programmes by preparing Community strategic guidelines, which would help to coordinate preventive measures implemented by different state institutions."
"Within this context I would like to draw your attention to the trial project for battling against natural disasters, which, thanks to the efforts of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we incorporated into the EU 2006 Budget."
"It has been allocated EUR 6.5 million."
"The trial project is aimed at funding preventive measures to fight natural disasters, including forest fires and droughts."
"I am confident that the funding of preventive measures is a much more effective means of implementing the Forestry Strategy than battling with the consequences of fires and droughts and awarding compensation from the EU Solidarity Fund for the caused damage."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Kindermann, particularly for successfully probing into the issue of what European policy on forestry is and what it should be doing."
"I would especially like to focus attention on the multi-use aspect of forests and the use of wood in new, innovative ways."
"Wood as a raw material has many properties which remain unexploited."
"For example, wood can be used instead of plastic, thus saving non-renewable raw materials."
"The chemical industry could exploit wood as a raw material, and the properties it has, in totally new ways."
"There is a lot of potential in the foodstuffs industry; for example, in the production of healthy foods."
"All this, however, requires new research and knowledge."
"I therefore suggest that we should consider establishing a top-level research unit in Europe for the forest and wood sector to address this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my view that the Union needs a common forestry management strategy."
"I fully agree with the principles on which this strategy is based, particularly the recognition of the multifunctional nature of forests and their significance for the economy, the quality of life, environmental protection and the protection of biodiversity."
"As a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I also welcome the fact that the report, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, calls for support for the production of biomass from wood."
"Many parts of the report show the need to look at forestry management in the context of other common policies, such as environmental protection or energy."
"In order for the strategy to be effective, however, it must also comply with the financial instruments of the EU."
"In this context, I should like to point out that current regulations on financial support from the Union virtually exclude all mention of forests owned by the state or state enterprises."
"It is possible for these forests to receive aid only in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters, but no longer for everyday requirements such as investment."
"This is a key issue, particularly for countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland, where more than 50% of the forested land is in state hands."
"I am pleased that the report states that EU support should not be made dependent on the form of ownership of forests."
"Surely a forest is a forest, whether owned by private individuals, the state or local authorities."
"Is its significance altered in any way by the form of ownership?"
"European law should apply the principle that all forms of ownership are equal and enjoy the same legal protection."
"I hope that this report will contribute to raising the profile of the forestry sector in the EU and will encourage the Commission and the Council to devote more attention to this area."
"A start could be made, for example, by setting up specialist working groups or platforms for exchanging experiences and harmonising national strategies."
"It is necessary to bring about a situation where national experts in the area of forestry management will be able to view EU institutions as discussion partners."
"Mr President, the implementation of a common forestry strategy in our countries will as usual be linked to the provision of funding for these measures."
"This will not be a problem for many countries, because most forests are public or privately-owned."
"What, however, can be done in countries such as Poland where most of them are owned and managed by the state?"
"The number of my fellow Members from Poland speaking today is testimony to the magnitude of the problem."
"However, I do not share their view and believe that until such time as a balance is struck between state and private ownership, funding should go only to privately-owned forests."
"The number of funding applications for new forests has already exceeded the funding allocated for the purpose."
"In the first year of the programme, new forest plantings amounted to about 6 000 ha."
"This is an opportunity to change the structure of ownership, lower the cost of timber production and implement a common forestry policy in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the key issue of forestry is being debated in Parliament and that it is also the concern of other EU and international institutions."
"The Commission submitted to Parliament a communication on the implementation of the forestry strategy to date."
"It also sets out the issues to be included in the Union’s action plan for sustainable forestry management."
"Its setting is general and succinct and it identifies the way forward to a true balance between the economic, environmental and social functions of forests within a model of sustainable forest management."
"The Natura 2000 ecological network is in place in the European Union."
"However, the success of this initiative will depend on the proper functioning of the funding mechanism for the network."
"The rules for funding biodiversity, which is the main objective of Natura 2000, should be the same for every form of ownership in the Natura 2000 network, whether private or public."
"Funding for forestry-linked programmes must come from funds allocated for this purpose in the Union budget, and should not be dealt with in the context of rural development."
"European taxpayers will be happier funding forestry or the environment than the common agricultural policy."
"Forests cover one third of Europe and provide a whole range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the community."
"Cross-sectoral relationships must be better understood and citizens of the Union better informed about the problems and needs of the forestry sector."
"Our main objective should be to get forestry and the community to work together."
"The forestry sector can make an important contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"Forests have an influence on scenic and cultural values and serve as a base for other kinds of activities such as hunting and tourism."
"They are also a source of raw materials for renewable energy."
"It is important to remember that preserving the natural and environmental functions of forests that are needed to safeguard and balance the ecosystem requires money as well as know-how."
". Mr President, I have been greatly encouraged by the very engaged and highly interesting debate on this important issue, and I should like now to refer to some of the questions that have been raised during our discussion."
"On vertical integration in the Commission, two main points must be noted."
"Firstly, the Commission has very recently set up a new unit in its Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development with a much stronger focus on forestry."
"This unit is presently coordinating the preparatory work on the EU forest action plan and chairs the meetings of the interservice group on forestry."
"Secondly, the interservice group on forestry, which was established in 2002 to facilitate cooperation and coordination of forestry-related work between relevant Commission services, has proved to be an effective tool of coordination and is working very satisfactorily."
"Its membership has increased and now comprises 11 Commission services."
"It is very actively involved in the preparation of the action plan and will have a very important role in its implementation."
"Regarding the legal basis, several legal studies have been carried out in the Member States concerning the creation of a separate legal basis for forestry in the Treaties."
"In our opinion, unless the position of the Member States changes, the added value of further legal studies on this issue is questionable."
"Regarding the concerns raised about the establishment of a European forest observatory, I believe that this should be discussed primarily among the Member States, which have the main responsibility for our forestry policy."
"They can assess the added value of such an initiative in the light of the current structures and existing international institutions."
"I am aware of the importance of the problem of forest fires in the European Union and the need to continue to prevent these situations from arising."
"I had the opportunity to see the horrible consequences of these forest fires last year during a visit to Portugal."
"The current Rural Development Regulation provides support to the Member States for important forest fire prevention measures, such as fire breaks, water points and preventive sylviculture, as well as for the restoration of the forestry production potential in forests that have been damaged by fires."
"I should like to indicate that these actions will be continued during the period 2007–2013 under the new Rural Development Regulation, and Member States will, therefore, have the possibility to include forest fire prevention measures in their rural development programmes."
"The rural development measures will be complemented by the actions that will be undertaken under the LIFE+ programme for the next financial period."
"In this respect, following an initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission will launch a study to examine the main causes of forest deterioration in Europe, including forest fires, and the efficiency of the current measures, as well as possible future options to improve the situation."
"Quite a few honourable Members mentioned state-owned forests."
"It is clear that the main objective for rural development is to revitalise rural areas and not to finance public authorities’ activities."
"This is why the main target group of beneficiaries of the rural development measures related to forestry is the private sector, notably farmers, foresters and, under axis 3 in the rural development policy, the broader rural society."
"However, there are derogations concerning the exclusion of state-owned forests from support under the new Rural Development Regulation in order to take into account the specific situations of certain regions and the characteristics of particular measures."
"Finally, I shall make two comments on the content of the action plan."
"Firstly, the action plan will be designed in accordance with the key principles of the European Union forestry strategy."
"The main responsibility for forest policy lies with the Member States, and actions at Community level will continue to be based on the principle of subsidiarity."
"Our intention is to concentrate Community actions on those areas where there is a clear added value."
"The second point is that the action plan will also identify Community instruments that can be used by the Member States for the implementation of the proposed actions, for instance, the new Rural Development Regulation, the LIFE+ instrument or – as was also mentioned here – the seventh Research Framework Programme."
"In this respect, the action plan will strengthen the overall visibility of forestry and increase the complementarity of different Community actions in support of sustainable forest management."
"Concerning the specific proposals in the report, the Commission welcomes the recommendations contained in paragraphs 1, 4, 7, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26 and 29."
"There are a number of recommendations, notably paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23 and 30, which are addressed also to the Member States, and the Commission will discuss these specific proposals with the Member States when we elaborate further on the action plan."
"The Commission has also taken good note of recommendation 9, and we will look into it: coordination is certainly an issue to be addressed."
"Finally, there are a number of recommendations, such as 2, 13, 15, 25, 27, 28, 30 and 32, which will go beyond the key principle of the European forest strategy or may not be completely in line with the regulations already adopted."
"Once again, I thank you for an extremely interesting and very good report and also for this engaged discussion, which has been very supportive."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"– The purpose of the forest action plan is to consolidate the core principles of the forestry strategy, namely sustainable forest management and strengthening the increasingly multifunctional role played by forests, highlighting their economic, social, cultural, recreational and environmental dimensions and complying with the subsidiarity principle."
"It is right not to go down the road of setting up a common forestry policy."
"That being said, we could have gone further by setting up a structure specially tasked with coordinating, on the one hand, national and Community policy and, on the other, all those working in the forestry sector."
"Forest owners are also among the guarantors of biodiversity."
"The management of animal species goes hand in hand with the management of habitats."
"Forests have a substantial capacity for hosting wildlife, and the species that naturally colonise these habitats deserve to exist."
"What is more, the management of forest damage does not necessarily entail the reckless destruction of animal populations."
"There must be coordination and dialogue between forest owners and hunters if biodiversity is to be fostered and if the right balance is to be struck between forests and game."
"The next item is the report by Mrs McGuinness, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Decision on Community strategic guidelines for Rural Development (Programming period 2007 2013), [COM(2005)0304 C6-0349/2005 2005/0129(CNS)] (A6-0023/2006)."
". Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to Parliament for the support it has provided over recent months in our common goal of further establishing rural development as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"I am convinced, as I am sure you are, that it is a policy that really adds value to the European area."
"Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, our rural development regulation was adopted last autumn."
"The strategic guidelines which are before you today are an essential element in taking further the process of developing national strategies and rural development programmes in the different Member States."
"I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs McGuinness, for their help in bringing the opinion forward in a very timely manner."
"We are still well on the way to delivering our rural development programmes on time."
"Our strategic guidelines for rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 are meant to guide Member States in the development of their own national strategies and programmes."
"I am convinced that our policy will offer many opportunities to make the rural development policy a success, but we will have to use it in the right way."
"We must use it to help unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors and the economic, environmental and social potential of our rural areas and the people who live in them."
"It is an extraordinary potential and it is our responsibility to do everything we can to mobilise it."
"The Community strategic guidelines will be a first step towards achieving this, firstly by identifying and agreeing the areas where the use of European Union support for rural development will create good added value."
"Secondly, by making the link with both the reform of the common agricultural policy and the necessary restructuring, the strengthening of the second pillar provides opportunities both for farmers and for jobs and growth."
"I have made it very clear that rural development should contribute to the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies, and I think we are doing just that."
"Thirdly, consistency with other European Union policies will be ensured, in particular in the field of cohesion and environment."
"Let me now say a few words about the amendments."
"The report proposes many helpful suggestions and I am very grateful for this."
"In my view, many of the amendments tabled by Members reflect important issues that are not reflected adequately in the Commission proposal."
"These can be taken either wholly or partially into account."
"On the other hand, there are a number of proposed amendments which we feel are already dealt with adequately in the current text."
"I see this as a clear indication of the very broad consensus between the Commission and Parliament about the aims of our rural development policy."
"Let me conclude this introduction, therefore, by expressing my agreement with the issues raised by the rapporteur in her report: the role of modernisation measures, the need for measures to help to encourage young farmers and farming families to stay in rural areas, and the importance of putting the heart back into our villages, sustainable farming and preservation of the rural heritage."
"Above all, a vibrant, commercial and sustainable agriculture is essential for the development or our rural regions, in which we have a huge common interest."
". Mr President, at the outset I should like to thank all those who have assisted with this report and the colleagues who put forward amendments, which were extremely helpful."
"In my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development, which, as you said, Commissioner, unlocked the potential of rural areas."
"I mention, in particular, those under the Leader Programme."
"Rural development in action is much more interesting than the theory behind it."
"However, we need to have rules, and that is why in this report we have set out strategic guidelines to allow Member States to plan their programmes from 2007 onwards."
"I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes."
"Each Member States has different needs because rural areas differ right across the 25 Member States."
"We talk about the two pillars of the CAP – agriculture and rural development."
"Some people speak of two different policies, but it is important to remember that it is a single policy with two different pillars."
"I am glad to hear you say, Commissioner, that agriculture is still of huge importance."
"We should not ignore the reality that a vibrant, commercial and sustainable farm sector is a vital component of rural life."
"Of course, rural development has a much wider remit: it provides for restructuring of rural regions and it allows for environmental protection and for measures to improve the quality of life for rural people."
"Just last week I presented certificates to mature students in Tullamore, a town in the midlands of Ireland."
"These courses were promoted by the local Leader group."
"Each and every one of the students spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their community."
"Benefits will flow from that."
"It is another example of rural development in action – and it does work."
"Rural areas are different from urban areas, but the policy priorities for rural regions have to fit in with the overall objectives, as you have set out, of competitiveness and economic growth, environmental sustainability and quality-of-life issues."
"Because of time constraints, I will not go through all of the details."
"However, improving the competitiveness of agriculture, forestry and food is a priority."
"We need ongoing investment in research and development across all of the range of activities in rural regions."
"In the report, we stressed the importance of job consolidation and maintenance, just as we stressed the importance of job creation."
"When we reform agriculture there will be changes in employment in rural areas."
"A quality environment is key to the future of rural regions."
"So, too, is the ongoing restructuring of the agriculture sector."
"Where we have measures in place to try to encourage young people into farming, we must ensure that they are sufficient to do just that."
"Across the European Union we hear of young people not wanting to farm."
"We may regret that in the future, as it has implications, not just for food production, but also for the quality of our rural environment and landscape."
"We want young people because we want a living countryside."
"Without people, we have very little else."
"We also allow for regional specialities to be promoted; organic farming by traditional means is provided for as well."
"Once again, the priority is to ensure that these measures and this production are market led and that the measures we put in place under rural development programmes add value to these local products."
"Non-food uses are also very important, and other reports discussed here tonight spoke of renewable energies and biomass."
"Ensuring that the rural communities have access to basic services, such as childcare and education, is also very important."
"We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services."
"A key requirement in rural regions is access to information technology: to IT training and broadband."
"I spoke earlier about the great success of rural development in the town of Tullamore but, in case you think all is wonderful in rural Ireland, in terms of broadband penetration, we are unfortunately languishing in 17th place in the European Union."
"Broadband, in my view, is just as essential as electricity to rural regions, and yet many parts of rural Europe do not have this basic facility."
"It means that they cannot provide jobs and that small and medium-sized enterprises are held back."
"With regard to the budget, we did not have access to the final details when this report was being drawn up."
"We now know that there is a reduction EUR 20 billion in funding for rural development for the period 2007 onwards, compared with what the Commission had forecast."
"It is a bad signal to send to rural areas."
"I have huge concerns about the possibility for Member States to cut 20 % of market support measures and direct payments and to allocate it to rural development."
"That is robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"It is, in my view, a renationalisation of agriculture policy by the back door."
"It is also unworkable in its current form."
"It now emerges that Member States who opt for this voluntary modulation can spend the money in any way they choose, without regard to the rules or indeed national cofinancing; this is regrettable."
"We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live."
"In so doing, we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the thanks of the Committee on Regional Development are due to Mrs McGuinness, not just for the quality of her final report, but also for her close cooperation with us in producing it."
"Although the original Commission proposal contains much of value, we have concerns about certain aspects."
"These include, in particular: the need for more recognition of the diversity of rural areas; greater clarity on the activities to which the individual axes are addressed; fuller attention under Axis 1 to forestry, the fuel chain and renewable energy resources; additional detail under Axis 2 as to the environmental goods to be promoted, including preservation of the cultural, as well as the natural, heritage; and a heavier emphasis under Axis 3 on measures to improve the quality of life and social inclusion in rural areas in parallel with, and as an aspect of, maintaining and developing employment."
"On a broader level, the committee wishes to stress the promotion of both sustainability and territorial cohesion with the need for an integrated approach that would embody appropriate spatial planning and foster coherence between the actions engendered by all sources of European funding."
"In that context, we emphasise the importance of the partnership principle and of the broadest possible involvement of all competent authorities and appropriate bodies in developing strategies at regional and/or national level as appropriate to the Member State concerned."
"We are delighted by the extent to which the report addresses our concerns and commend its content to the Commission, recognising, with thanks to the Commissioner, that she has already touched on some of these issues in her introduction."
"We commend it to the Council and to Parliament as a whole."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McGuiness, for her report."
"As the Commissioner has already said in her introductory remarks, this report looks at the strategic guidelines as a bridge between the provisions of the Council regulation on rural development and the implementation of those provisions in the Member States in the form of national strategies and programme planning documents."
"One major problem is the lack of the Financial Perspective."
"I know, Commissioner, that you are not happy with the Council's decision in December to reduce funding for rural development, but we need to finally set up the financial framework so that the programmes can be started on time in the Member States."
"The greater flexibility in relation to the priorities is important for us all."
"The Community strategic guidelines form the basis for establishing national strategies."
"An important aspect in this is that, on the one hand, the EU's priorities have been taken into account but, on the other, the Member States have been left with sufficient room for manoeuvre."
"This is not just about creating new jobs, but also about safeguarding existing employment opportunities in agriculture and forestry and safeguarding all related industries, which are very important to the employment situation in our rural regions, so that we can achieve the goals that Mrs McGuiness talked about so decisively."
"Our aim must continue to be to work together to achieve the objectives of Lisbon and Gothenburg."
". Mrs McGuinnes has done an excellent job with this report."
"I would like to thank her for the excellent cooperation, as in the report she had taken into account all the comments of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I am extremely delighted that this report is in full agreement with the earlier report of Mrs Schierhuber."
"I know that the issue of rural development is extremely important to the Commissioner."
"We all talk about the fact that rural development has been the greatest loser of the seven-year budget."
"It is shocking that while all of us – both the Commission and Parliament say that rural development, the second pillar, ought to be given more money, exactly the opposite is happening."
"And this is why the report of Mrs McGuinnes is so important, because if there is no more money in the system, and in fact there is less money, then the system should at least be more flexible, and it should express the diversity of Member States better."
"In this respect, this report is very good and very useful."
"Incidentally, as an MEP from a new Member State, I deeply regret that the rural development fund of old Member States has been decreased by 15-20%, but the rural development fund of new Member States has only been increased marginally, to a very modest extent, even though everybody had said that they would be compensated by an increase for the long, protracted phasing-in period agreed in Copenhagen."
"Well, there has been no compensation, and unfortunately, the rural development fund of old Member States has been drastically reduced, perhaps forcing them to apply modulation, but obviously, this is no consolation."
"The issues raised by Mrs Schierhuber are very important: jobs should not only be created, but also preserved."
"And in this respect it is very good that the McGuinnes report supports activity diversification."
"In other words: we should not just give money to clear an apple orchard, but also to enable the farmer to plant a marketable crop in its place."
"This is a very important issue in this report, because it facilitates the preservation of jobs."
"The strengthening of quality products and of local products is also very important."
"At this moment in time we still have an excessively market-profit-oriented view."
"We would like to thank Mrs McGuinnes that the transitional regulations currently in place in new Member States will continue to remain in effect."
"By the way, my experience as a future rapporteur for integration issues of new Member States (these issues will be debated in the second half of this year) is that these are very much required in the new Member States."
"I support the report of Mrs McGuinnes."
". Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs McGuiness, has drafted an excellent report on the Commission’s proposal on guidelines for rural development."
"My sincere thanks go to her for that."
"More than half the population of the EU live in the rural areas of Europe, and these regions generate almost half the Gross Value Added in the EU."
"These regions, however, lag behind others when certain indicators are applied."
"For example, unemployment is greater in these areas."
"The European countryside faces big changes."
"A comprehensive reform in agricultural policy has been initiated, and as a result agriculture is becoming less able to employ and sustain the population in rural areas."
"Special action is therefore needed to restore the vitality of the countryside."
"The Commission is proposing several different possible solutions."
"The strategic guidelines are based on the EU Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the text of which was adopted last year."
"In it three axes are defined, as well as a Leader Community initiative."
"The report in many respects improves on the text submitted by the Commission."
"The debate on the report is nevertheless overshadowed by the Council’s terrible proposal for the EU’s financial perspective for the next seven-year term."
"The Council has cut the figure for appropriations proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament by a full EUR 19 billion; in other words, more than 20%."
"It is therefore completely wrecking the great efforts that Parliament and the Commission have made to establish a policy on rural development and sustaining rural populations."
"As a consequence, we have to wait until this issue is revisited in the finance negotiations between Parliament and the Council, and the situation is corrected as is only right and proper."
"We must insist on this."
"It is not just the need for general development of the countryside, but also greater self-sufficiency in energy for the EU, and other challenges, that depend on this."
"– Mr President, I congratulate my colleague on this report."
"I agree with many of the proposed amendments and with the overall direction, but I have some concerns."
"Firstly, I am disappointed that the minimum allocation for the Leader axis in the budget will be reduced to 5%."
"It is proposed in the financial perspective that Member States can increase the rate of modulation by up to 20%."
"Given the ongoing difficulties in the agricultural sector, more resources are required."
"If the rates are increased, as I hope, we must ensure that ample money is allocated to axes 3 and 4, as well as 1 and 2."
"Concerning diversification, not all those leaving farming and/or rural dwellers are entrepreneurs, or interested in being so."
"There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.3."
"Also, although support for renewable energy is highlighted in points 3.1 and 3.3 of the guidelines, it is futile to provide support for renewable energy at a local level if national policy is prohibitive to the development of the sector."
"We must therefore coordinate these."
"It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes."
"Lastly, I should like to say to the Commissioner that in Ireland it is hard to take her recommendations on organic farming seriously, when she will not allow us to declare the island a GMO-free zone."
". – Mr President, I congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her excellent report on an extremely important issue."
"In recent times, the Union has tended to neglect rural and agricultural problems."
"We have often heard, even in this House, that it is not worth spending nearly half of the Union’s budget on helping rural communities and farmers who account for barely 6% of society."
"The strategic guidelines now hold out the hope that rural and agricultural problems will receive better treatment in the future."
"After all, the development of rural areas is not just a matter for farmers."
"It concerns society as a whole."
"Without rural development and support for farming there can be no food security, sustainable growth or effective environmental protection."
"I am hopeful that the future of rural communities and farming in Europe will be well-served by the document we are debating today, particularly in the new Member States which are in greatest need of support for their rural areas."
"The Strategic Guidelines of the Community for the area of rural development in the 2007–2013 programme period constitute a worthwhile and necessary document."
"I support the amendments of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as they enhance the Council proposal."
"I also admire the good work done by Mrs McGuinness, the rapporteur."
"According to the strategy, rural development should accompany the implementation of a new, market-oriented common agricultural policy, and should support the key role of the market within this policy."
"This is all very well."
"The budget cuts proposed for the CAP in the Financial Perspective, however, are causing justifiable concern over the real benefits of rural development."
"Further concern results from the course of negotiations in the WTO, where it appears that European farmers could be put at a disadvantage in their competition against the rest of the world."
"There are also risks, however, arising from the restrictive nature of ongoing reforms, as was the case for sugar reform, as well as other reforms that are in the pipeline."
"Studies also suggest that there is a risk of the rural economy being weakened because of the transition to single payments per farm, etc. It goes without saying that the above risks are greatest in the new member countries."
"For example, in my country, Slovakia, following the transition to single farm payments, agricultural output is expected to fall by a further 17%."
"These are dramatic figures, since we have increased the importation of food by a half over the past two years due to the discriminatory influence of the CAP in the new Member States, and the export-import balance in Slovakia’s agricultural sector trade has deteriorated by one-third."
"The worst-off are the most backward, typically rural regions that are falling behind virtually in front of our eyes."
"At the same time, all of the EU resolutions have stated that our policies should be working to narrow the gap that the more backward regions are facing."
"According to the findings of the Slovak non-governmental organisation ‘Rural Parliament’, the countryside depends entirely on the prosperity of agribusinesses for its development."
"Rural areas develop where agribusinesses flourish."
"Where business is slow in the countryside, entire rural areas are on the decline, and rural development becomes impossible."
"The problem of the new Member States is therefore that of a deficient rural economy resulting from the uneven effects produced by the role of the market as embodied in the CAP."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs McGuinness for the excellent work she has done in her report."
"In the new Union it is important to ensure a strategic approach with regard to intervention policies. This approach should be translated into clear objectives, incisive measures and appropriate action, the results of which can be assessed objectively."
"The identification of priority actions to be undertaken must not, however, result in an inflexible programming exercise and in a restriction for the Member States."
"On the contrary, it is important to guarantee the Member States some flexibility, which enables them to make decisions about how they will intervene on the basis of what is actually happening at national, regional and local levels."
"It is crucially important for the purposes of rural development that we revitalise, and restore the competitiveness of, our agricultural production when compared with that of the other countries, which have significantly lower production costs. In that context, moreover, it is important to foster accompanying measures that facilitate innovation, research and development."
"The emphasis placed on the areas of excellence and quality of agricultural products, particularly those produced locally and regionally, is consistent with the Community’s overall strategy."
"Quality must be understood not only as food safety and consumer protection, but also as value added to the competitiveness of businesses and as the expression of local traditions and of the cultural heritage of rural communities."
"One need only think of local crafts, environmental protection, agricultural specialities and the related traditional production techniques."
"These objectives clearly need to be coordinated with the need to help young farmers and women enter the rural professions, by passing on traditional knowledge and skills to them, and by improving the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of services and infrastructure."
"Lastly, we must welcome the crucial aspect of bringing the experience gained through Leader to the system of local governance, building on the best practices of earlier programming exercises."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having analysed the report by Mrs McGuinness, whom I wish to commend for her work, I should like to highlight certain points."
"Firstly, it falls to us to ensure that the EU's rural strategy is formulated and interpreted as the benchmark for any Community policy or programme relating to rural areas."
"The Commission’s proposal, sadly, limits its ambition to the implementation of the future regulation on rural development and accordingly makes it impossible to integrate rural, regional and social development policies."
"As regards the Lisbon Strategy, the rural strategy ought to make a greater contribution to socio-economic and territorial cohesion for all rural communities."
"Local conditions must be improved and supported, in particular by strengthening existing knowledge-exchange networks, or setting up new ones, and by improving the living conditions of rural communities."
"These conditions should not, however, encourage migration from cities to the countryside."
"Mr President, I feel that citizen involvement should be encouraged and citizenship fostered."
"These issues are crucial to the construction of a democratic local identity in the areas concerned."
"Lastly, the Commission should establish a forum for dialogue with the existing European networks and support their activities without undermining their independence."
"This would boost relations with the stakeholders on the ground."
"Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation."
"Personally, I am adamant that the rural economy, SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals."
"Rural development is not just an adjunct; it is not just an add-on to compensate for falling numbers in agriculture, though it may well help to achieve that."
"In its own right, it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas."
"In that context, I agree fully with the rapporteur that funding for rural development should not involve robbing the first pillar to pay for the second pillar."
"Rural development should stand on its own two feet."
"I am happy about the inclusion of my amendment on the necessity to ensure consultation, cooperation and, where appropriate, compensation for farmers when their activities are restricted owing to the enhancement of landscapes and habitats."
"I have always believed that if the EU requires that of farmers, it must pay compensation."
"Finally, I have one minor quibble with the rapporteur when she says that agriculture must remain central to the economies of rural areas."
"While food production, using the European model and food security, are of paramount importance, this should not sideline the contribution of rural development."
"Rural development has an increasing role to play in the maintenance of farmers’ livelihoods and farm family incomes and incomes of rural dwellers, so we need to build a sustainable income stream to complement agricultural income."
"That has a life of its own and needs an adequate fund of its own; hence my disappointment at the cut in the budget for rural development."
"Mr President, in the European Parliament I represent Poland, which is home to six of the ten poorest regions in the Union."
"Five of these regions are located in the eastern Poland."
"They are characterised by a poorly developed infrastructure, a fragmented agricultural structure and high unemployment, some of which is hidden on peasant family farms."
"The additional funds in excess of EUR 800 million earmarked in the 2007-2013 budget for eastern Poland are not a solution to the backwardness of this region."
"The support we need must be at least equal to the aid given by the Union to marginal and sparsely-populated regions in the old Member States."
"As well as financial assistance, eastern Poland, which includes the poorest Lubelszczyzna region, needs a stable agricultural policy and protection for its farmers."
"It is high time that provision was made for its development."
"Mr President, funding for rural development is a key issue."
"It should not, as the rapporteur has said, involve robbing the first pillar in order to fund the second."
"Nor must we lose sight of the fact that the core and single most important component for the development of rural regions is the maintenance of sustainable agriculture at the very heart of their economies."
"Thus a funding formula reliant on a smash-and-grab raid on the single farm payment through excessive modulation is simply not acceptable, particularly in circumstances where there is no necessity for matching national funding."
"There are four particular points that I want to support: first of all, the use of funds to encourage new entrants, to assist the essential transition of farm families from one generation to the next; secondly, the prioritisation of funding to allow for the modernisation of farms and help with meeting higher animal welfare and environmental standards; thirdly, maximum regional flexibility on the implementation of the rural development programme must be secured and built upon; and fourthly and finally, the proposal for village renewal and the preservation of rural heritage is vitally important in revitalising and sustaining the rural communities."
"This is a good report."
"It is obviously the product of hard work by the rapporteur and I congratulate her on her efforts."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"The future of the rural economy depends on the success or otherwise of our future policy from 2007 to 2013."
"I must say I am concerned that there will not be sufficient funds to achieve a positive outcome to sustain the future under the second pillar."
"Rural society has been on a downward spiral for many years, and you do not need me to rehearse the problems again."
"All I know is that there are no easy solutions and we cannot wave a magic wand."
"The rural economy has evolved over the years and there is now a heavy reliance on environmental projects."
"This can be a help, but on its own is no panacea for all the problems facing the rural dweller."
"I believe there is now too much emphasis placed and too much pressure put on such projects."
"There is no doubt of the need to diversify, but there are not many new ideas out there."
"Yet we must persevere and try to achieve our targets and we require a greater vision in the projects we support, because in the past too many projects in rural areas turned out to be white elephants."
"As far as we in Northern Ireland are concerned, we will not see any change unless we achieve a totally different approach from our planning services."
"They are living in the past, looking through rose-tinted glasses and looking back to a time that no longer exists."
"If we are to achieve anything in this, we must be adventurous and innovative; we must encourage the development of more small and medium-sized enterprises and more micro-industries in rural areas."
"If a farmer, his son or his daughter has an opportunity or an idea to develop their farm or to diversify, they should be encouraged to do so and to expand and not be forced into the nearest town or village."
"This is the way forward."
"We cannot afford to live in a time warp."
"One other concern of mine is that some Member States will give these proposals good support and others, including my own, will do what they have always done with such initiatives: nothing!"
"The way forward for rural development is one of vision and confidence; above all, we must look to the future!"
"Mr President, Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mrs McGuinness, the report that we are debating today contains the guidelines to be followed by the Member States in drawing up the national strategic plans."
"Mr Castiglione said something very clear: that the actions mentioned in its annex will provide a guide that will allow criteria to be unified, and this unification of criteria is going to promote the harmonious application of the new rural development Regulation, but it is also going to enable each Member State to take its own decisions on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity."
"We Spanish socialists are satisfied with the reference to the multi-functional role of agriculture and we are also pleased that the conservation and protection of soil has been included as a priority. Soil is actually an environmental resource which must be considered together with water, air and biodiversity."
"This consideration is necessary in order to curb the processes of erosion and desertification, which lead to the kind of disasters that have been mentioned here this evening, such as forest fires and floods."
"Furthermore, this care of the soil will allow us to maintain good agricultural and environmental conditions."
"I am particularly pleased, Mrs McGuinness, that the incorporation of women into the labour market is taken up as a horizontal priority, and expressly referred to as such."
"I am also pleased that the consolidation of existing jobs has been added to the reference to the creation of new jobs."
"With regard to the need to establish services to maintain the population and to receive new inhabitants, we Spanish socialists agree that this may be the case and, furthermore, we agree that a fair proportion of the Structural Funds should be allocated to these areas in order to guarantee the balance between the development of rural areas and that of urban areas which is so necessary."
"It is clear, Commissioner, that good investment in infrastructures would contribute to an improvement in the quality of life of these areas and to countering depopulation."
"I live in a rural area, I have been Mayoress in a rural area and I can tell you that nothing could be more necessary or more motivating for the inhabitants of these areas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work and on her excellent report. I welcomed and approved, among other things, the emphasis given to young farmers, micro-businesses and crafts."
"The task awaiting the European Union at a difficult time for the agricultural sector – which is made all the more critical by the health threats and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the WTO negotiations – is one of focusing primarily on young people and of doing everything in its power to ensure that they are not forced to abandon the countryside."
"It is therefore crucial to diversify economic activities, to create new job opportunities in rural areas, to support local initiatives such as farmers’ markets and to focus on high-quality and niche products, in addition, of course, to crafts."
"As Mrs Attwooll, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, sharply underlined, we also need to ensure the sustainable use of water resources and to put the emphasis firmly on training by investing sufficient funds in this area."
"Lastly, I agree with the bottom-up approach used by the Commission in its proposal."
"Indeed, rural development must not ignore the specific characteristics of the various regions, the strategic positions of local actors who set the guidelines for each area or, particularly, the development model for towns, which represent the real driving force of the entire regional economy."
"( Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of rural development problems in the new Member States."
"In Poland, rural areas became a kind of shock-absorber for the economic transformation that took place in the 1990s."
"These areas saw a considerable influx of workers after the mass closure of workplaces that occurred at that time."
"This means that Poland’s rural regions need enormous financial support and a number of instruments to create employment in that environment."
"I am pleased that it is proposed to allocate more than EUR 80 billion for this purpose in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, and that some 10 to 20 billion of this should go to Poland."
"This policy must, however, go hand in hand with rational measures within the context of the common agricultural policy to stabilise traditional farm livelihoods, since only a stable livelihood on farms will enable the latter to make effective use of the support that is available from rural development funds."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in common with all Members of this House, I agree on the objectives of the new rural development funds and on the need to strengthen the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"I should like to add my voice to the congratulations offered to the rapporteur and welcome the input from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I am particularly grateful to Mrs Attwooll for helping to clarify a text that strikes me as decidedly overladen and not always easy to understand, not least by those who will have to implement it on the ground."
"The experience of the ongoing Leader programmes is a salutary lesson in the dangers of an excessively fussy, nit-picking set of guidelines."
"I personally wanted to emphasise the need to take territorial cohesion into account."
"In order for this to become a reality, a balance must be struck between territories in line with the principle of equality among all citizens of the EU no matter where they live."
"Rural areas must not be defined in terms of the difference between them and urban areas."
"On the contrary, the relationship between the urban and rural environments needs to be strengthened by developing, , public services and in particular complementarity and transport accessibility."
"The quality of life required to sustain an active population in the rural sectors entails cooperation and the joint implementation of essential financial resources."
"Lastly, new territorial indicators are required to improve the process of evaluating and deciding upon measures to strengthen territorial cohesion."
"In addition to gross domestic product, there is also a need to include employment rates, the decentralisation index and the level of public-service provision."
"We await the Commission’s proposals in this regard, and not solely from you, Commissioner."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her outstanding work, and I wish to commend her for her willingness to listen and her openness."
"This new strategic approach on rural development is designed to channel resources along well-defined priority axes. I feel that this will help to improve the effectiveness of measures in rural areas and coherence between the Member States."
"It was also important to reaffirm the importance of rural development policy as the second pillar of the new common agricultural policy."
"Nevertheless, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the financial perspective, I am dismayed to note that the sum proposed for funding rural development policy, some EUR 20 billion, represents a sharp drop in relation to the Commission’s proposal."
"The solution put forward by the Council to address this significant reduction is the optional supplementary modulation transfer of up to 20% from the first to the second pillar, and this is left entirely to the discretion of the individual Member States."
"This proposal raises a number of concerns: firstly, this modulation is technically impossible for market expenditure; secondly, it would mean drastic reductions in direct aid; lastly and most importantly, the fact that this optional modulation would comply with neither the EAFRD regulation already adopted by the Council after seeking an opinion from Parliament, nor the strategic guidelines on which we shall be having our say tomorrow, would be unacceptable."
"As with the EAFRD funds and the funds based on mandatory modulation, there must be national cofinancing and compliance with rules on minimum spending per axis and integration with national strategic plans."
"Each region has its own natural features, so every country needs to make its own strategic plan for rural development."
"However, the Community’s strategic guidelines should provide some general support and guidance for individual countries in this respect."
"The countryside is one of the key factors in preserving the cultural, ethnological and natural heritage through which our lives are enriched."
"Since we wish to preserve and develop the countryside in the future, we must ensure that the working and living conditions do not lag behind those of the urban centres."
"This demands greater investment in education, a reduction in the bureaucracy involved in new investments and the provision of an appropriate infrastructure."
"Preserving the cultural landscape is an extremely important task, so we cannot simply leave it to chance and to those increasingly rare individuals who, despite the low incomes, are prepared to involve themselves in this."
"Our forebears worked the land not simply for survival, but also out of love for it."
"Today that is no longer enough."
"Young people must see the prospect of advancement and a decent income, as well as adequate social security."
"There is still very poor provision of social security for women, and it is equally unacceptable that mothers employed on farms still do not have the same rights and benefits as women employed in other sectors."
"Farmers must possess a great deal of knowledge to carry out their trade and to perform additional rural activities."
"In spite of this, the kind of work is the least valued in society."
"If we want young people to see some prospect and opportunity for themselves in the countryside once more, we must increase respect for agricultural work and respect for the countryside as a whole."
"Over half of our population lives in rural areas."
"Rural development throughout the European Union is a challenge for each Member State."
"The complete achievement of its goals would not only benefit the development of rural areas, but would also boost the entire economy of the European Community and contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of all citizens."
"Efficient rural development programmes not only improve competitiveness and provide a solid support for sustainable development, but also strengthen social cohesion and the healthy development of all social strata."
"This particularly applies to new Member States, whose productivity has not caught up yet with that of the old Member States."
"The efficient utilisation of the increased assistance granted to the second pillar facilitates the reduction of the existing differences."
"When we take stock of the methods and instruments required, we must pay particular attention to the natural diversity of regions within the enlarged European Union."
"Therefore, Member States must be given an appropriate opportunity for the flexible handling of the instruments of rural development."
"This will allow them to create the development programmes most suited to the particularities of the regions."
"The involvement of private capital is indispensable to the execution of programmes and to the consistent implementation of structure change and modernisation."
"The creative utilisation of alternative resources and supporting a wide range of training opportunities are also crucial to the implementation of truly equal opportunities between men and women, and, by expanding the labour market, they are crucial to the involvement of as many women as possible in the process of solving rural development tasks."
"I propose that this excellent report be accepted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rural regions make up 92% of the territory of the EU-25."
"These regions create 45% of Gross Added Value and provide 53% of employment."
"They lag behind, however, when it comes to socio-economic indicators; income per inhabitant is around a third less, the service sector is less developed and higher education levels tend to be lower."
"In the period 2007 to 2013 we must aim to invest in the future, which means investing in people."
"This involves know-how, new ways of delivering win-win environmental services and the creation of more and better job opportunities."
"Particular attention should be paid to the removal of barriers for those whose access to the labour market is currently hampered because of their gender, age or disability."
"The diversification of economic activities, the protection of the rural cultural heritage and investment in infrastructure for local services are preconditions for improving the quality of life in rural areas, and help to counter rural depopulation."
"It is essential to present the EU’s rural areas as attractive locations for investment, work and living."
"They can offer enormous growth potential in the areas of tourism, accommodation and workspaces."
"The new programming period offers a unique opportunity to refocus support from the new rural development fund towards economic growth, employment and sustainability."
"We must have financial instruments in place with sufficient funds for fulfilling these targets."
"It is already obvious today that funding for the third axis, namely that of improving the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy, falls short of what is required."
"I thank the rapporteur for her work."
". Mr President, I can assure you that at this late hour I will not go into detail."
"However, for those brave people who are still here, we need to give a decent reply to some of the questions raised."
"First of all, regarding the economics, it is quite clear that the outcome of the financial perspectives has not been very encouraging to many of us."
"It is correct that there has been a reduction of almost EUR 20 billion for the next financial period, which is all the more reason we have to ensure that the funds are spent as efficiently as possible, and I hope that the strategic guidelines can help us to do that."
"Now we need to continue with the planning."
"I could not agree more with the rapporteur’s views on broadband."
"The rural development policy has a role in bridging the digital divide."
"This year I will be exploring that with my colleague, Commissioner Reding, to see what can be done."
"Finally, on the question of voluntary modulation, I completely agree with Mrs McGuinness."
"It is quite clear that if we enter into this discussion on voluntary modulation, which is not even cofinanced by Member States, that will be the first step towards a re-nationalisation of European agricultural policy, so that farmers in the different Member States will have completely different competitive possibilities."
"That is acceptable."
"I congratulate Mrs McGuinness on her report."
"It has received a good response from the Members who were here earlier this evening."
"I have very much enjoyed listening to the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 16 February 2006."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of political importance under Rule 144."
"I read with interest your comments on possible internal reforms of Parliament and you are greatly to be commended for your view that better attendance at debates and better participation of Members is a desirable objective."
"However, I am somewhat dismayed that, in your hurry to ensure the inclusion of all Members in the work of Parliament, you chose to bypass them entirely and instead provide your draft proposal first to the press, without prior consultation with the Members you are so keen to assist."
"Why is this item not on the agenda?"
"I am further dismayed that your solution to the vexed question of MEP participation is to recommend the complete centralisation of decision-making to the Conference of Presidents, which you chair."
"Mr President, perhaps you could explain to me and the rest of the House how your great vision of democratic inclusion and participation can be achieved by centralisation and exclusion?"
"In the words of Mr Poettering, the chairman of our group, this amounts to unfocused administrative micro-management within Parliament."
"The rule that you have invoked, Mr Stevenson, was not the correct basis for your comments."
"Your interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is not correct."
"I have allowed you to speak because I did not want my cutting you off to be misinterpreted."
"Your point of order was not appropriate."
"You have accused the President of having leaked a document that was in the hands of no less than 30 people."
"Your interpretation of the procedure adopted is also entirely mistaken."
"The Conference of Presidents has discussed it, it will continue to discuss it and, when the time comes, you will be made fully aware of the decisions it takes."
"I would ask that next time you chose the right rule to invoke in order to raise a point of order, because, if you do not do so, the President will not allow you to speak."
". – Mr President, I would like to comment on what Mr Stevenson has just said."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament in this House is grateful to you for taking the initiative in mooting these reforms, of which we are in favour."
"In the Conference of Presidents, I too, got the impression that we were of one mind, and that we wanted to start by reflecting on this within our groups."
"Mr Poettering made it clear that his own group needed to discuss this;"
"I said the same on behalf of my own, and other Members did likewise."
"We will discuss this within our groups, and our discussions will be wide-ranging and all-embracing, but I do want to make it plain – and I will have to ask the services to insert the relevant Rule into the Minutes – that the President, in moving towards these reforms, enjoys the full confidence of the Socialist Group."
"Mr Schulz, we shall look for the appropriate rule, but this is not a call for a vote of confidence in the President, not yet at least, so the Conference of Presidents will continue working, the groups will take part in the debate and the group chairmen will act as spokesmen for their groups’ positions."
"I am sure that, together, we will make proposals that improve the functioning of our Parliament."
"That, and nothing less than that, is everybody's intention, including, if you will allow me, Mr Stevenson, your President’s."
"I would now like to make a statement on two recent events."
"On 8 March, International Women’s Day was celebrated throughout the world, and I would therefore like, on behalf – I believe – of all of the Members of this Parliament, to take this opportunity to express today before Parliament our rejection of the violence perpetrated by the police against a group of women who were demonstrating peacefully in favour of their rights in Tehran."
"In light of this event, which Parliament condemns, I would like to express our solidarity with every woman in the world who demonstrates and calls peacefully for her rights to be respected."
"This is an important opportunity for us to reflect on the problem of inequality, not just on 8 March, but on every day of the year."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which marked this day in a very important and timely manner."
"With a view to the coming Football World Cup, our Committee on Women’s Rights organised a seminar, the details of which have been widely disseminated, on the issue of forced prostitution in the context of world sports events."
"We should also remember that we held the second European Day for the Victims of Terrorism and that this year, like last year, our Parliament marked it with a ceremony in memory of the victims of terrorism."
"600 pupils from various schools in London and Brussels were invited, and they expressed their opinions on terrorism in a rich debate in which several Members of our Parliament participated and which was chaired by Mr Lambrinidis, Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I would like to thank him for deputising for me at that event."
"I believe that we must remember the tragic terrorist attack carried out in Spain, which happened two years ago now and which led to the deaths of 192 people, as well as the attack in London in July of last year."
"We must continue to fight all forms of terrorism, and our Parliament, which has always fought for the dignity of human beings, is fully committed to a fight that no European country will be able to win on its own."
"Only European democrats, united, will be able to tackle this threat."
"I wanted to remind you of what we did in this area this weekend."
"The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 9 February 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the vote on the report by Mr Cottigny, scheduled for tomorrow, be postponed until Wednesday."
"Does anybody wish to explain this request from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats?"
"Mr President, the shadow rapporteur needs a little more time to confer with the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs of the different groups."
"In view of the large number of amendments that have been tabled, combined with the need for a number of split votes, we would like to postpone the vote until Wednesday."
". – Mr President, further to the proposed order of business, I have a request concerning Wednesday."
"With the order of business as proposed, as I see it, when we come to the statement by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council and on the Lisbon Strategy, we find ourselves – much as we do with the debates between 3 o’clock and 7 o’clock on the Council statement on the informal meeting of foreign ministers, on the Brok Report, and on other reports – reaching the outer limit of what is feasible in terms of organisation."
"I propose to elucidate that by reference to some figures on speaking times."
"The speaking times for the Council statement on the summit and for both the Council’s and Commission’s statement and the ensuing debate, are shared out as follows: the Council gets 30 minutes speaking time, the Commission get 20 minutes, and the House as a whole gets 60."
"What that means is that the two other institutions have about as much time in which to speak as all the Members and all the Groups put together."
"The result is that, in a debate on this subject, the Group of the European People’s Party has 18 minutes at its disposal, my own group has 14, the Liberals have 7, and the Greens have four-and-a-half."
"I have just told my group that this is going to spark off squabbles within the groups, since, if I were to get all my experts to speak, I would need more speaking time than has been made available to us."
"The consequence of that is that groups will be reducing their speaking times to such an extent that people will end up speaking for no more than a minute each."
"While that may help keep the peace within the groups, it will do nothing whatever for the quality of debate in this House."
"It is because this does not make sense that we will continue to urge you to move further towards the reform that you have set in motion."
"The simple fact is that we need more time for such debates."
"What we also need, though, is for the institutions, under the circumstances under which we have to work, to reduce their speaking times somewhat, and this we ask them to do."
"I am pretty sure that the Council and the Commission are well able to get the key points that they want to make across to us in less than 30 or 20 minutes, for the fact is that I have to get mine across in five, and I have not so far had the impression of having succeeded in this."
"If I were to have 20 minutes in which to speak, it would be quite splendid – not only for me, but also for this House!"
"For now, though, I ask you and the services to get together with the two institutions by Wednesday – that is to say, with whichever of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission is actually present – and reduce your speaking time so as to make more time available in which this House can have a debate."
"Let me just read you the figures for the afternoon."
"That afternoon, the time available for speaking to the reports amounts to 50 minutes each for the Council and the Commission, while Mr Brok, the rapporteur, gets five – which is quite utterly inadequate in view of the importance of his report – and all the Members put together get 90 minutes between them."
"I put it to you, Mr President, that that is not reasonable."
"I therefore ask that, in the first instance, you agree with the institutions on a reduction for Wednesday, and then, in the longer term, I ask that this House should organise our orders of business in such a way that we have a proper amount of time in which to debate important matters among ourselves."
"Mr Schulz, as you know, there are no rules on the speaking time allocated to the other institutions."
"Nothing in the Rules of Procedure states how long they may speak, and they are normally given free rein, that is to say that they speak for as long as they see fit."
"That is not the case for Members of Parliament, whose speaking time is very limited."
"I believe that the Commission and the Council have duly noted Mr Schulz’s request."
"I am sure that they will act accordingly."
"Bear in mind that, in this item, there are three statements and their replies; in other words, we are talking about 50 minutes for those statements and replies."
"In view of the time restraints, I am sure that the two institutions will limit themselves so that the Members have time to speak."
"Mr President, I do not entirely understand your reaction, particularly if we bear in mind the applause coming, for once, from all sides of the Assembly, following what was said by Mr Schultz, the chairman of this great party that is the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"In fact, we are calling for you to negotiate with a view to restricting the length of the speeches made by the Commission and the Council on the Lisbon Strategy."
"They have already explained the Lisbon Strategy to us on three occasions; we are familiar with it."
"They can each therefore easily limit themselves to 15 minutes’ speaking time in which to outline their views on the Lisbon Strategy, thus leaving us time for a debate."
"People should not be treated like fools."
"We are aware of the problems connected to the Lisbon Strategy: Mr Barroso has already enlarged on them three times in this Chamber, and I would be surprised if he had anything new to add this time around."
"Fifteen minutes’ speaking time, therefore, for the institutions and the rest for Parliament seems legitimate to me."
"Thank you very much, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"If I have understood Mr Schulz correctly, he was referring to Wednesday afternoon, and you have referred to the morning."
"In any event, we shall talk to the Commission in order to ensure that it conforms to the time available."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"I must warn you that not everybody who has asked to speak will be able to do so, because that would require more than the 30 minutes available."
"I am therefore going to give priority to Members who have not given one-minute speeches in previous sittings and I am going to ask all of you to conform strictly to the one minute so that there will not be too many Members unable to speak through lack of time."
"Let us try to ensure that everybody can speak, and I am going to begin – I repeat – with those Members who were unable to speak in previous sittings."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the House to devote more time today to the situation of the Kurds in Turkey, because last week, the horrendous news reached us that the elderly parents of the chairman of the Kurdish Institute in Brussels were brutally murdered in Turkish Kurdistan."
"There is reason to believe that this was done by Turkish death squads."
"Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident, because every week, we receive reports of such crimes against Kurds."
"I am sure you are familiar with the news that the second-in-command of the Turkish army himself was named as the organiser of a criminal gang which aims to eliminate Kurdish separatists."
"I have therefore written to Commissioner Rehn, asking him to get the Commission to mount a thorough and independent inquiry into the circumstances of these brutal killings, which should not go unpunished."
"I hope that the House committees and the Turkey delegation will be giving these incidents the attention they deserve."
"Mr President, I must inform you that, for several years, the company L.G. Philips has been axing jobs not only in the constituency of Dreux, but also in Aix-la-Chapelle, the Netherlands and Hungary."
"All this is nothing new."
"However, one should also be aware that, in 2001, this company was created to prevent the problems affecting the cathode-ray screen market from putting the holding company, Philips, at a disadvantage."
"Behaviour such as this is extremely serious because it allows our large companies to shirk their economic, social and industrial responsibilities."
"Promises were made to the workers employed by these three factories but, to date, these promises have come to nothing."
"Furthermore, this liquidation reminds us of the events that took place in the Isère region with regard to HP and also reminds us that the large groups are doing as they please and are gradually dismantling Europe’s industrial policy."
"– Mr President, I welcome the measure taken last week by the Commission, namely the Green Paper on energy, which I believe has emerged at a most opportune time."
"Europe is becoming increasingly dependent on supplies and it is clear that we will have to solve energy problems together."
"We must, for example, fully complete the liberalisation of the internal market and work together to save energy and to develop alternative sources of energy, including atomic energy."
"We must also tackle the issue of energy security together."
"I have said before that I am very much in favour of this Green Paper, and that it should kickstart discussion."
"The outcome of this debate should be a genuinely shared energy policy in Europe."
"Mr President, this afternoon you mentioned International Women’s Day."
"Last week was also Endometriosis Awareness Week."
"Figures for this female disease are much the same as when I raised this matter in the House last year: up to 14 million women in Europe affected, up to EUR 30 billion in costs to the EU economy for lost days at work."
"Endometriosis is a condition that is stagnating in misdiagnosis, ignorance and misunderstanding; it takes up to 11 years from onset to diagnosis."
"I can promise you, and it gives me no pleasure, that I will speak in this House on every appropriate occasion until every woman and every health professional in Europe is aware of this disease, its symptoms, its effects and the treatment options."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the second European Day to commemorate the victims of terrorism, which took place on 11 March."
"I should like to thank you, Mr President, for the information you gave us on the way in which Parliament marked this date."
"I should also, however, like to ask you and the services to approach the Council to ensure that this commemorative day be accorded greater prominence and dignity in all EU Member States. I feel that this is essential."
"I am also strongly in favour of involving the national parliaments in the European Day commemorating the victims of terrorism, and of giving the day greater visibility in the future."
"This is, in my view, very important in the face of this tremendously dangerous threat."
"– Mr President, as we have already heard, the parents of Mr Derwich Ferho, the President of the Kurdish Institute in Brussels and a political refugee in Belgium for the last 28 years, were brutally murdered by perpetrators who, according to the information available, are employed by the Turkish state."
"This is an extremely serious issue."
"A march was held in Brussels last week and the Flemish Minister of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the Turkish ambassador in Brussels demanding clarification."
"Given that Turkey is a country seeking accession to the European Union and given that this sort of behaviour is not exactly in keeping with the European profile which it likes to present, I would ask that we too, as an institution, demand similar clarification about this atrocious crime, so that we do not also give European citizens the impression that we are directed by certain centres of interest."
"Mr President, there is almost no hope left that the presidential elections in Belarus next Sunday will be free and fair."
"The atmosphere during the election campaign is dangerous."
"The campaign has been marked by Aleksandr Kozulin, a presidential candidate, being heavily beaten by secret service men."
"In addition, many activists are being arrested and threatened, to stop them supporting the democratic candidate Aleksandr Milinkievich."
"In this context, statements were made by some EU office holders which I found disappointing."
"After it became known that the European Parliament is planning to send an ad hoc delegation to Minsk, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated that the members of that delegation will speak only for themselves."
"Mr President, may I kindly ask you to remind the Commission that Members of this House are the only elected representatives of the EU citizens, in contrast to the Members of the European Commission."
"Members of the European Parliament are entitled to speak of behalf of those who elected them and not only for themselves."
"It is highly regrettable that the European Commission makes lamentable statements instead of expressing at least their moral support for the MEPs who are going to observe elections in Minsk, and instead of stating that in the event of any provocation by the Lukashenko regime against parliamentarians they are ready to take action in their defence."
"Mrs Andrikienė, when our fellow Members take part in a mission of observers, they do not go on their own account. They are not representing themselves, but rather they are representing this institution."
"It is possible that there has been a misinterpretation on the part of the Commissioner, and I am sure that that is how she sees it as well."
"When I have the opportunity to speak to her, I shall remind her of it, but I do not believe that that is necessary, because I am sure that the Commissioner is perfectly aware of the role that falls to our Parliament."
"Mr President, as a Socialist and human rights activist, and simply as a militant opponent of the death penalty, I would like to express to all of you the anguish I feel for the family of Pablo Ibar, a Spanish citizen, whom the Florida courts sentenced to death for murder in 2000."
"On 2 February, the Supreme Court of that State lifted the death sentence on the alleged accomplice in the murder, having ruled that there were errors in the previous trial and that the evidence against the convicted men was insubstantial."
"Nevertheless, the hopes then raised were dashed on 9 March, when that same Supreme Court confirmed the death penalty for the European citizen, Pablo Ibar."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are calling upon the competent United States authorities to seek a resolution to this unjust and inhumane situation."
"I would also ask you, Mr President, as well as the Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the United States, to address the said authorities, on the one hand to reiterate our well-known complete rejection of the death penalty and, on the other, to ask that justice be done in the case of Pablo Ibar, who was unfairly convicted, as appears to be proved by the acquittal of the person who was originally convicted of being the accomplice in the same alleged crime."
"– Mr President, the European Union is taking all the necessary measures to combat avian influenza and rightly so."
"However, avian influenza has generated a great deal of panic among consumers, and as a result we have seen a drastic fall in the consumption of poultry by 80% and a fall in the consumption of eggs by 45%."
"All this has put the poultry farming sector in a very difficult position and the European Union is not taking the right measures to help the industry."
"We should not allow this under any circumstances."
"I call for suitable measures to be taken to help poultry farmers."
"Moreover, if we do not take these measures, once the fuss dies down, we shall not have any poultry farms in the European Union to meet future demand and the poultry products of the European Union are certainly of a higher standard than the products which we shall have to import from third countries."
"I therefore call for us to demonstrate our solidarity with the industry."
"Mr President, six years ago the pollution of the River Tisza with cyanide, which was caused by gold mining in Baia Mare, Romania, showed us the dangers of gold mining at the heart of Europe."
"Hungary was not a member of the European Union at that time, but the whole European Union showed solidarity with us, the victims of the river pollution."
"The European Union has recently adopted a directive on mining waste that will stop all mining activity that is dangerous to nature."
"We were more than satisfied when the Romanian Government, even before its membership of the European Union, showed its readiness to accept this directive."
"However, according to the latest worrying news in some political and business circles, the idea is once more emerging of opening up a new gold mine with cyanide technology in Romania."
"Let us give a strong and definitive ‘no’ to such dangers and ventures."
"Let us ask the Romanian Government to keep to its commitments."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words about the elections in Belarus and Ukraine."
"The situation in Belarus is abundantly clear."
"It is very difficult indeed."
"It is likely that these elections will be neither free nor democratic."
"Clearly, the repression of opposition leaders and candidates is proving far more severe than had been anticipated."
"It is important to keep in mind that another election campaign is under way too."
"Elections are also due to take place in Ukraine, a country that has already shown its pro-European leanings."
"I myself have been to Lvov on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to support the election campaign of the Socialist Party of Ukraine."
"I have to say that I was uplifted by what I witnessed."
"I saw Ukraine, and I saw many pro-European electoral slogans."
"I would, however, like to report an important and worrying issue."
"It was brought to my attention that certain electoral registers, that is to say lists of people entitled to vote, might not have been drawn up correctly."
"This highlights the potentially enormous importance of what our European Parliament representatives are doing not only in Belarus but also in Ukraine."
"Mr President, so far President Mahmoud Abbas, who is due to address us this Wednesday, has been a big disappointment as President of the Palestinian Authority."
"He has been unable or unwilling to reign in terrorist suicide bombers, including his own Fatah al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade."
"He has failed to disarm militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad and seems incapable of stopping the rampant corruption that, in part, led to a Hamas victory."
"Although the EU must be an impartial and strong supporter of the roadmap for peace under the Quartet, we must not fund a Palestinian Authority led by an unreformed Hamas, an EU-banned terrorist organisation committed to Jihad and a Caliphate under Sharia law."
"First, Hamas must renounce violence and recognise Israel’s right to exist."
"If that means that the Palestinian Authority gets its money from Iran and Saudi Arabia, so be it."
"That will mean less money for Iran to build its nuclear weapons."
"Mr President, on 28 February in Brussels four Commissioners – those responsible for enterprise, the environment, competition and energy – presided over the first meeting of a high-level group to look at issues concerning energy, the environment and competitiveness."
"Around the table there were also four cabinet ministers, twelve chief executives of energy producers and energy users, three NGOs, the Chairman of the European Trade Union Congress and three regulators."
"However, there were four empty chairs at that crucial advisory meeting, the first meeting that will set a two-year agenda."
"Colleagues may be surprised to know that those four chairs were allocated to Members of this Parliament."
"I regard that not just as a discourtesy to the Commission, but these are crucial issues, and if we want to be engaged with those issues, perhaps you would explain to me and to Parliament why those chairs were empty."
"Will you please put in place the procedure to nominate people to fill those chairs, and if you cannot do it yourself, why do we not have nominations and an election to fill those four empty chairs?"
"I hope that I am not mistaken in saying that the places were empty because the Conference of Presidents had decided not to appoint representatives of this Parliament to occupy them and to ask the Commission for clarification of the status, purpose and role of representatives of Parliament in this technical committee."
"Our not having received that clarification, the Conference of Presidents decided not to appoint representatives of this Parliament."
"It is not therefore a case of there being representatives who did not attend, but rather of representatives not having been appointed to do so."
"Mr President, I am happy to take your assurance."
"However, I served for a year as a member of a previous high-level working group on the automotive industry."
"The terms of reference were clearly defined and I believe that it was crucial for a Member of this Parliament to be there from the very beginning."
"If you had asked for my advice, I would have explained how that system worked."
"In addition, we had a hearing in this Parliament about the high-level working group."
"It is absolutely vital that we are involved."
"My dismay is that this was not resolved before the first meeting, because this group only meets every three months and the crucial agenda-setting and design of two years’ work will now have taken place without Members of this House sitting round the table."
"Thank you very much, Mr Harbour."
"I would emphasise that the Conference of Presidents decided to ask Mr Barroso to explain the purpose of Members being present in these groups, and Mr Barroso will come to explain that purpose to the Conference of Presidents."
"You are welcome to disagree with the decision taken;"
"I am simply communicating it to you."
"Mr President, wholesale arrests of opposition activists have taken place in Belarus in the last few days."
"The European Union cannot stand idly by whilst the fundamental rights underpinning all civilised societies are infringed."
"I appeal to the European Commission to take immediate action and to draw up a black list of the Belarusian and the list should be as long as possible."
"All members of the dictator Lukashenko’s immediate entourage must be banned from entering the European Union."
"Such a ban should apply to those responsible for the decision to use force and for directing the activities of the internal security forces."
"It should also apply, however, to circles involved with media propaganda."
"Imposing visa sanctions on these persons will be an effective method of weakening the position of the Belarusian Government, whilst avoiding a negative impact on Belarusian society as a whole."
"It will also send out a clear signal to the opposition that their western neighbours are not indifferent to their situation."
"The individuals responsible for the latest wave of arrests must be punished."
"Publicising the intention to draw up the black list I described may well save the lives of many people and protect them against repression."
"A preventive measure of this nature will prove that Europeans do speak with one voice and are indeed united in the defence of fundamental human rights."
"– Mr President, the attempt by the Czech Government to ban the Czech Communist Youth Movement because it projects the perception of class struggle and of Marxism and Leninism is an insult and has provoked the indignation of thousands of democratic people in Europe and the rest of the world."
"I have copied a memorandum and petition to you and to the chairmen of the political groups."
"This sort of stand is intolerable, given that the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia is a party with a great deal of political action, influence and recognition among the Czech people and is represented in the European Parliament by six members."
"In truth, how would we feel if the legality of the youth movement of the party from which we came was questioned?"
"This sort of action comes within the framework of the anti-communist strategy and is opposed by the overwhelming majority of peoples."
"I call for us to condemn it, thereby expressing our defence of democratic rights, freedom of political action and ideological expression, by calling on the government and authorities in the Czech Republic to put an immediate end to the ideological and political persecution of young Czech communists."
"Mr President, the art of letter writing is certainly flourishing."
"What European Union Commissioners ought to be doing is putting their noses to the grindstone and getting down to sustained hard work to reinforce the European Union’s authority, which is gradually slipping away."
"Unfortunately, however, the Commissioners have decided instead to while away their time writing letters telling individual Member States what they should be doing."
"I would like to mention the example of the Dutch Commissioner, who is one of the most controversial members of the Commission."
"Commissioner Kroes is currently under investigation by the House, following allegations of conflict of interest and lobbying activities."
"She recently took it upon herself to send a letter to the Polish Government concerning the merger of two Polish banks."
"I thought it might have been appropriate for the Commissioner to share her country’s first-hand knowledge of how to lose a referendum on the Constitution with the Polish Government."
"Instead, the Commissioner saw fit to preach to the Polish Government, even though a Dutch bank, the ING, had been very quick off the mark in buying one of the larger Polish banks, ."
"The Commissioner’s offensive letter is paternalistic in the extreme, and typical of the attitude of the countries of the old Union to the new Member States."
"The Commissioner might have been more usefully employed preaching to the Dutch Government on how to prevent ethnic and racist tension, which is unfortunately fast becoming a fact of life in her country."
"Mr President, you asked that this Parliament should enjoy a greater commitment from its membership."
"This is not really a parliament in any sense that the British would understand or recognise."
"This Chamber looks like the Supreme Soviet, apart from the flags."
"It conducts business like the Supreme Soviet and the debates here are not debates in any real sense of the word at all."
"As a mere backbencher, if I get one minute – determined by officials and not by knowledge or need – I am lucky."
"There are no interventions, there is no giving way, nor any chance to challenge and test ideas that have been put forward."
"This essentially is an elaborate democratic fig-leaf and we are all part of a charade."
"– Mr President, the extermination, the disgusting murder of the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, in the detention centre at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which was planned and executed by the imperialists of the USA and the European Union responsible for the war in and the break-up of Yugoslavia, is yet another link in the long chain of crimes against the peoples who stood up against imperialist barbarity."
"The people who planned and executed the abduction, imprisonment and trial of Slobodan Milosevic at The Hague, having refused to take measures to protect his life despite his serious health problems, brought about his extermination."
"The USA and the European Union set up the travesty of a trial at The Hague in order to redeem their crimes against the Yugoslav people, whom they bombed for 78 days in 1999, purely and simply because Yugoslavia, while accepting the overall Rambouillet agreement, refused to accept the deployment of NATO occupying forces on its territory."
"The imperialist attacks on and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan which followed the bombing of the people of Yugoslavia revealed once again in its true colours the repulsive face of American and Euro-unifying imperialism and its hideous crimes against peoples and mankind."
"The peoples will continue to fight against imperialism and for the right to shape their own destiny."
"– Mr President, I would like, again, to bring to the House’s attention the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor who have been jailed in Libya."
"In 1999, they were accused of deliberately using blood transfusions to infect 400 children with the AIDS virus."
"Although they were sentenced to death in 2004, the sentences were a matter of legal contention and have now been suspended."
"We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision and look forward to more transparent procedures and a fairer trial."
"These people have been subjected to incarceration and torture for seven years, and we now hope that their trial will not be exploited and misused for political ends."
"Until such time as they are at liberty, it is our task as parliamentarians to highlight this case and follow its progress closely."
"Mr President, I would like to express to the House my satisfaction and relief at the decision taken by the management of General Motors on 15 February to manufacture the new Opel Meriva model at the Figueruelas factory in Zaragoza, thereby finally putting an end to the risk of the relocation that it has been planning for months for 7 600 workers and many more auxiliary companies."
"I would like to congratulate the workers on their commitment to productivity, the Spanish directors and the engineers for their good work, and the regional government, headed by its President, Marcelino Iglesias, for its support."
"That is not sufficient, however."
"The competitor was the Gliwice factory, in Poland. The only advantage it was offering was lower labour costs."
"Our relations over recent months have given us a better understanding of the frustration of the Polish workers and, as a result, we support the proposal of the European Workers Forum that the Agila model be produced in Gliwice."
"In the meantime, by way of compensation, the Spanish Government has just opened up the possibility of the free movement of workers, but that is not sufficient either."
"What we need is a European industrial policy."
"Mr President, I am glad that Commissioner Frattini is here to hear me address the next item."
"In a recent statement, the Dutch Minister for Integration, Mrs Verdonk, announced a change in the return policy for homosexuals and Christian asylum seekers from Iran."
"She said that since homosexuality and Christianity are not outlawed in Iran, asylum seekers can simply return home."
"Whilst this may, strictly speaking, be true, in practice, homosexuals and Christians have good reason to fear for their safety."
"It is a fact that homosexual activity carries the death penalty."
"My question to Commissioner Frattini is whether the Commission intends to find out whether Dutch return policy is in line with the European minimum standards for asylum seekers as laid down by the directive that is required to be implemented by October of this year, and whether it is in line with international agreements."
"The digital television era is supposed to be one of increased competition and an era where consumers have more choice between quality services."
"Unfortunately the change over to digital TV in Malta is creating new monopolies where consumers are simply being asked to pay for the screening of popular sports events which until today have been enjoyed free of charge."
"Moreover we are witnessing the formation of a factual state in which there is no interoperability between the different systems of digital television."
"This means that it is very difficult to interchange systems with the result that the choice of the consumer is being limited."
"Even worse, our consumers are being asked to pay private operators to receive national channels which until today they had been receiving free of charge while the authorities still expect them to pay the same amount for the television licence."
"The digital era is supposed to be such that information and entertainment are accessible to all rather than to an increasingly restricted number of people."
"Mr President, I had the honour of receiving a declaration from a group of young people who visited the European Parliament last Thursday."
"They were rather disappointed at not being able to meet more of us, and I therefore promised to inform you of what they wanted to say."
"They came from the Second Chance School, and their message is as follows:"
"‘We, the young people from across Europe, participating in the E2C youth summit in Copenhagen in June 2005, hereby declare the following: “All young people have the right to make decisions about their life and create their own future."
"All young people have the right to an education – at any level."
"All young people have the right to be different and to be as they really are."
"Everybody should respect each other, and respect goes both ways."
"No young person should be discriminated against or suppressed."
"All young people should have homes, food and care.” ’"
"As a message from those schools for which we fight so very hard, namely those that guarantee lifelong learning for all, this is something that I really think we should take to heart in our forthcoming political work."
"Mr President, the chikungunya epidemic that is currently hitting Réunion is plunging this outermost region of the European Union into an extremely worrying health and economic crisis, and the scale of the long-term consequences is very difficult to assess."
"The virus, which is transmitted by mosquitos, has now already infected 200 000 of the 760 000 inhabitants of the island of Réunion and is thought to be directly responsible for the deaths of five people."
"The form taken by the disease – the severity of which went undetected until the start of this year – directly threatens some of the most vulnerable population groups, including the elderly, young children, pregnant women and patients already carrying a disease."
"Just when the European Union is – quite rightly – concerned with combating another health crisis, one that affects the agricultural sector but that only potentially threatens the population, I would be immensely grateful to you if, as from today, you kindly expressed your and the European Parliament’s solidarity with citizens of the Union who are living in real fear of chikungunya."
"I thank you in advance on behalf of all the inhabitants of Réunion."
"Mr President, I should like to mention two issues concerning the Serb area of Kosovo."
"Firstly, there is every possibility that a genuine humanitarian disaster will take place there over the next few months."
"I refer to a humanitarian disaster in the areas occupied by Serb refugees."
"Bear in mind that in those areas electricity is only available for an hour a day and terrorist groups extort protection money to let medicines through."
"There is absolutely no security there."
"Terrorist groups are also blowing up Orthodox churches in the zone, and those churches are not only places of religious worship but also part of our common European heritage."
"In my view, the destruction of these Orthodox churches is certainly a crime comparable to the destruction of the figures of the Buddha in Afghanistan by Al-Quaeda."
"Mr President, sadly, it seems to me that Europe has now turned its back on Kosovo and on the Serbs."
"It is ignoring people who hold democracy and human rights dear."
"Thank you very much, Mr Chruszcz."
"I regret to say that there are fifteen other Members who are not going to be able to speak through lack of time."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the oral question to the Commission on forced prostitution in the context of world sports events, by Anna Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (O-0006/2006 B6-0008/2006),"
"- the oral question to the Commission on EU measures against trafficking in human beings and the launch of an anti-trafficking day, by Karin Riis-Jørgensen and Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0011/2006 B6-0011/2006),"
"- the oral question to the Commission on EU measures against trafficking in human beings and the launch of an anti-trafficking day, by Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (O-0017/2006 B6-0014/2006),"
"- the oral question to the Commission on EU measures against trafficking in human beings and the launch of an anti-trafficking day, by Lissy Gröner, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (O-0019/2006 B6-0015/2006), and"
"- the oral question to the Commission on EU measures against trafficking in human beings and the launch of an anti-trafficking day, by Eva-Britt Svensson, Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, Kartika Tamara Liotard, Feleknas Uca, Ilda Figueiredo and Věra Flasarová, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (O-0021/2006 B6-0016/2006)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak today as chairman of this Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"I also speak as a woman supportive of women forced into prostitution."
"It is unacceptable that a woman should be forced into prostitution; it is unacceptable that she should sell her body."
"In actual fact, ladies and gentlemen, the news has never been so sad."
"In the German capital, on the outskirts of the Olympic stadium, a 3 000 square metre ‘megabrothel’ has just opened its doors to welcome 650 clients at any one time."
"Over 40 000 poor young women will be ‘imported’ from the East in order to satisfy the post-match requirements of the spectators of the World Cup football tournament."
"The fight against trafficking in women and the fight against forced prostitution are a priority for female political representatives too, and are undoubtedly so for Angela Merkel."
"Let us call on her to add her voice to ours."
"As political representatives from all sides, we have powerful tools available to us."
"Let us reject this instance of decadence and let us make ourselves heard not only here, in the European Parliament, but also in our Member States, at the Council of Europe and in all the fora in which we can make our voices heard."
"Let us make ourselves heard loud and clear."
"This is not the first time that the various United Nations bodies, the Council of Europe and the EU institutions have used sport as a vehicle for sending out a message of good citizenship and progress."
"Those in power would have us believe that this state of affairs is an unfortunate coincidence."
"However, the lawyer working for the group that built this ‘pleasure palace’ has stated that ‘football and sex go hand in hand’."
"How is it that, in football’s highest governing bodies, nobody seems deeply shocked by this?"
"It would seem that encouraging young men to take part in brutish acts orchestrated against young women does not shock anyone and that the failure to prevent these acts and to protect the victims against this organised degeneracy is not a source of outrage."
"The FIFA President, Joseph Blatter, wrote to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality saying that his organisation was not responsible for what took place outside football grounds."
"Neither UEFA nor the heroes of the national teams have said a word."
"UEFA has set itself the task of promoting football in Europe, in a spirit of peace and without any form of discrimination."
"The footballing world is a man’s world: the reality inside the grounds shows this."
"It is men who demand the services of prostitutes and who abuse women."
"That is why I am addressing men too – my male fellow Members and all those men in positions of power."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that we can already count on the public support of men in order to combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution."
"I am grateful to our colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, who is himself a professional soccer referee, for having made the Sports Intergroup a mouthpiece for speaking out against trafficking in women and forced prostitution."
"I am grateful to our colleague, Mr Coveney who, as a Member of this Chamber, oversees the work of ‘businessmen against trafficking in women’ and the ‘Stop the Traffic’ campaign."
"Finally, I call on you all to support the impressive work done by the Council of Europe, which launched the first ‘agreement on the fight against trafficking in human beings’ in Warsaw on 16 May 2005: to date, only 11 of our Member States have signed this agreement."
"None of them has ratified it yet."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the legal instruments and every possible political measure must be applied in order to prevent women from being commodities whose only purpose is to act as sex workers, and this not only in Berlin but also throughout the world."
". Madam President, the evil of human trafficking is a clear example of an area where the EU can and must act."
"That is why Karin Riis-Jørgensen and I tabled our oral question."
"We want answers today if at all possible."
"Not enough publicity is being given to this foul trade."
"In many cases the victims are seen as the offenders: we must turn that around."
"I am pleased with the recent attention the subject has been receiving at EU level."
"Parliament’s own-initiative report is due; the Council adopted an action plan in December; there is the Council of Europe Convention; yet there is still little progress."
"There is no point in Member States talking unless urgent and concrete action is taken."
"At the moment these women – and we are mainly talking of women and girls – have no guaranteed protection."
"They are treated as illegal immigrants and deported, and, in many cases, are retrafficked."
"There are actions that can be taken: they are laid down in the European Convention against Trafficking, amongst other documents."
"We need safe havens so that young women and girls can be protected."
"We need at least the 30-day breathing period that the European Convention calls for, so that these women can decide whether they will take part in the prosecution of the traffickers."
"In the United Kingdom, there is only one safe haven with 25 places."
"It is estimated that over 1000 people per year are trafficked into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation."
"The failure to tackle this problem really is not good enough."
"The United Kingdom and other countries must sign up to the Council of Europe Convention."
"Finally, with the run-up to the World Cup in Germany, we need to do much more to make people aware."
"It is estimated that thousands of women and children will be trafficked during that time and used for forced prostitution."
"In this oral question and in this debate we are not talking about prostitution where the prostitutes know what they are doing."
"We are talking about a modern-day slave trade, where the women and children have no choice about whether or not they work as prostitutes."
"This is what today’s debate is about and we must not confuse the issues."
"That is why I am working in the campaign to give the red card to forced prostitution and I hope all the fans, footballers and sports associations, together with all other organisations, will get behind the campaign to stamp out this evil trade."
". – Madam President, I hope that this resolution will end up right in the back of the net and thereby bring this issue, once and for all, out of the taboo area and into the public eye."
"Forced prostitution is something that nobody wants to talk about: the people engaged in it do not want to, and nor – unfortunately – do its victims."
"We must also make much more of an issue of the connection between migration and job creation."
"The German Football Association wanted to keep this issue in the taboo zone, and our breaking through its defensive wall amounts to a massive success."
"As has already been said, we really do have to be firm in showing people-trafficking and forced prostitution the red card."
"We have to make it abundantly clear that fair play in sport involving saying a firm ‘no’ to forced prostitution."
"Under no circumstances whatever can it be tolerated."
"I have to tell Commissioner Frattini, though, that we not only have to get the criminals, the people-traffickers themselves, in our sights – although we must of course do that – but, in order to do that, we also need solutions that do not criminalise only the women involved, which is what happens at present."
"I hope that you will address this issue in your speech."
"My expectation is that we do more than just require visas, for it would be the women who would bear the brunt of that, when what is needed instead is prevention and care and support for women."
"Much as is done already under Italian immigration law, we must guarantee women who are unwilling to testify as witnesses the right to remain."
"We need to do more if women are to be enabled to escape from forced prostitution."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the football World Cup is being held in Germany under the slogan, ‘a time to make friends’."
"The sporting community is getting ready for it, but so are organised gangs of traffickers – getting ready to ship thousands of women to Germany and exploit them there."
"These women will be enticed to Germany with false promises and then forced into prostitution."
"Poverty is one of the main causes of this, and that is where we must start, but making people welcome in Germany must also mean protecting women in need rather than turning a blind eye to their plight."
"Up to 800 000 women worldwide fall victim to people-trafficking, and 100 000 of them come from the EU."
"Although nobody has any idea how many of them will be in Germany this summer, we should show the people-traffickers the red card."
"What I expect you to do, Commissioner Frattini, is to take the proposals that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality put forward in the Prets report and in the plan of action against trafficking in women, and use them as the basis for practical action."
"If the women’s organisations’ campaign for multilingual telephone hotlines is to be supported, it will need funding."
"Victim protection schemes need to be put in place."
"Reference has already been made to the way in which the Member States have been no more than half-hearted in their transposition of the 2002 Asylum Directive, and pressure needs to be brought to bear upon them."
"Belgium has said that the right to remain will be accorded to women who are willing to take the witness stand and who want to get out of prostitution, and that they will be given help in order to do that."
"That is quite splendid."
"If the modern-day trade in women is to be effectively combated, then Europol will have to become more involved, and there are of course things that the sporting associations can do; that is why we rely on their cooperation in appealing to the fans to keep their eyes open and do their bit, as they must."
"To demand special visas for women is to shoot from the hip, and I am not in favour of that, so please give some more careful thought to what you propose to do."
"Madam President, millions of people around the world are delighted at the prospect of the upcoming World Cup football tournament, but how many thousands of women must be sacrificed so that men can not only watch football but also purchase readily available sexual services?"
"If a sufficient volume of sexual services is to be offered, tens of thousands of women, including many with no choice in the matter, will have to supplement the already large number of prostitutes in Germany."
"This trafficking in human beings is shameful and deeply inhumane."
"It is indicative of an oppressive view of women and also shows the low regard in which all those men who will be coming to watch football are held."
"In order to put an end to the violence against women and children, responsibility for sex slavery and prostitution should be laid at the door not of the victims but of those who assume the right to buy and sell women’s bodies."
"‘Forced prostitution’ may be interpreted as implying the existence of its opposite, that is to say some form of what might be called voluntary prostitution."
"There is, however, no such thing as voluntary prostitution."
"Women do not choose prostitution; they are forced into it for one reason or another."
"This may happen through their being victims of organised crime, but poverty and unemployment are other causes."
"Above all, however, there are clear links between prostitution and the fact that women have, in the past, been exposed to physical, psychological and sexual abuse."
"The links between the legalisation of prostitution and the increase in trafficking for the purposes of sex slavery need to be clarified."
"What, for example, does the fact that prostitution is legal in Germany signify in terms of the increase in the number of victims of sex trafficking in connection with the World Cup?"
"Legislation that permits prostitution must be evaluated and compared, for example, with the Swedish legislation that criminalises the client."
"The Swedish legislation has shown that, when demand is reduced, the number of victims of trafficking and prostitution decreases too."
"Responsibility is placed where it belongs: with the clients."
"It is they who must accept responsibility for their sexuality, without buying women’s bodies."
"If we accept that men can assume the right to purchase women’s bodies, we are, as a consequence, forced to accept a situation in which approximately four million women and children are moved around, within and between countries, in order to be exploited sexually."
"To condemn sexual exploitation and prostitution does not mean putting the blame on women working as prostitutes."
"Absolutely not."
"We want to see all women given the right to their sexuality, and on equal conditions and without being oppressed."
"Women are not a commodity."
"They are not for sale."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions posed by Mrs Záborská and by the other speakers demand a detailed response on my part: it is only right and proper that I provide some concrete answers."
"Sixteen different points have been addressed in the various questions, and some very precise requests made, to which I will try to respond."
"More generally, I find it unthinkable that one might take advantage of a sporting event, which in principle ought to be an opportunity for promoting positive values, in order to tolerate or encourage forced prostitution."
"In this regard, I have heard a truly saddening reference, namely that football and sex go hand in hand, as though forced prostitution were the inevitable consequence of a large sporting event."
"Rather, this is the opposite of sport’s most wholesome values."
"It therefore seems necessary to begin with legislation, and precisely with the relevant European legislation adopted in this context, which provides for the prosecution of those who help force people – women and children mainly, but, it must be said, men too – into prostitution."
"As you are aware, a European framework decision exists, while on the subject of Germany, there is currently a national law in place that entered into force in 2005; in other words, it is a fully applicable law."
"We will also prepare a report to the Council and to Parliament before the end of April on the application of the framework decision on trafficking in human beings and on the criminal prosecution measures so as to ensure that all of the Member States have adopted national laws transposing this framework decision before the World Cup football championship takes place."
"Among the most important rules is one that requires the Member States to prosecute those responsible in their countries of origin and not in the country in which they committed their crimes."
"The framework decision stipulates this with the aim of ensuring that trials are actually carried out and that criminal penalties are imposed."
"After the report has been presented, between now and the end of April, the Council – and Parliament too, if it considers that it will be useful – will be able to thoroughly address the topic of the latest measures that could be adopted at European level, or rather at European legislative level."
"I believe that in relation to these measures, we ought to consider – even if we do not give a definitive answer right now – whether we should punish those who, as customers, take advantage of people’s services, knowing that these people have been victims of force and even in some cases of a genuine trafficking operation that has led them into slavery."
"Obviously, the issue of the legality of prostitution is addressed in the Member States in very different ways."
"Nevertheless, I believe that if the customer is aware that the person with whom he is talking is a victim of trafficking, of force or of coercion, then he must think twice about what he is doing, including from the point of view of a possible criminal penalty."
"The role of Europol and Eurojust in this area must clearly be developed."
"Among the priority issues that I raised when I met the President of Eurojust and the Director of Europol was precisely that of strengthening Europol’s and Eurojust’s capacities in terms of the application of the action plan against trafficking in human beings that we presented, as this Parliament will recall, at the end of last year."
"Europol can play a very important role in the coordination of European measures to combat these abhorrent types of crime."
"We have already successfully combated paedophilia, having succeeded thanks to action by Europol aimed at dismantling a paedophile network in 13 European countries; this is another area that needs to be followed up."
"There is, then, the specific issue of the World Cup in Germany: I had made a promise to this Parliament, when this topic was first discussed, that I would formally involve the German Federal Minister of the Interior."
"I obviously did so, and Minister Schäuble, whom I approached, replied to me a few days ago formally assuring me that not only will the federal law in force be rigorously applied, but that it will also be specifically accompanied by prevention initiatives on the ground in all of the German cities involved in staging the football matches."
"I can therefore confidently state that the German Federal Government, on the word of its Minister of the Interior, not only assures us that it will fully cooperate, but also calls for the Council of Interior Ministers, which is due to meet in April, to examine the issue with the aim of developing an operational strategy."
"It will be a non-legislative strategy in this case, but a truly operational one in terms of prevention on the ground, with the aim of preventing the sporting event from being used for the purposes of transferring a huge number of victims of this abhorrent trafficking."
"At this point, I should like to make two remarks concerning the practical measures that I, in my capacity as a Commission representative, intend to present to the April summit of the Council of Interior Ministers."
"As regards the issue of visas, first of all, I would like to make it very clear in particular to Mrs Gröner – but also to those who wrote me letters after the seminar of 8 March – that I have never intended, wanted or planned to introduce visas for women."
"Visas are not introduced by category of person; visas are governed by country and by nationality."
"I had announced the plan to assess whether some non-EU countries, which are significantly at risk, are currently not subject to the visa requirement and therefore whether it might be advisable to temporarily extend the visa requirement for a country that is the source of a likely trafficking operation; this obviously did not include women."
"I apologise if I was misinterpreted at the seminar of 8 March."
"I have looked into this matter and I can also give you the answer: according to police data, all of the flows of trafficked persons that originate from countries outside the European Union are subject to the visa requirement."
"It will not, therefore, be necessary to make changes to the current visa system simply because all the non-EU countries that, according to the statistics, are ‘at risk’ are already covered by the visa requirement."
"In any case, it was never a question of introducing a visa requirement for women, but merely of providing for more checks on some countries."
"There is no problem, but it is clear – and I will submit a proposal to the Council along these lines – that consulates need to carry out more checks in terms of ascertaining visiting groups’ actual purposes of travel, since it is obvious that those who traffic women for sexual purposes declare, or make the women declare, false reasons."
"It is therefore incumbent on border guards and consulates to carry out the checks – something that requires cooperation among all of the EU Member States – and they will have to be enhanced checks to ascertain the veracity of the declared objectives."
"As you know, people often declare that they are visiting a country purely for tourism, which is a lie."
"In-depth checks are necessary."
"Furthermore, it is clear that, as some of you have suggested, practical victim support measures are crucial."
"Personally, I support the idea of promoting dedicated telephone lines, that is to say telephone lines that, by means of a simultaneous interpreting service, can offer immediate assistance in as many foreign languages as possible."
"Obviously, this relates to both the period during which the World Football Cup takes place and the period that follows: measures such as these cannot stop in July 2006."
"These measures providing immediate and operational support can be considered well and truly as part of European action, thanks to the projects and the funding that Europe can allocate to practical proposals of this kind."
"Another measure that I consider necessary is a comparative study of all of the Member States’ laws on prostitution and on the connection between prostitution – where it is legal – and trafficking in human beings for sexual purposes."
"There is clearly a link between the rise in demand and, shall we say, the incentive for traffickers to carry out this shameful activity."
"There exists a study promoted by this very Parliament, which is precisely a study on transnational crime."
"On the basis of that very study, I intend to propose carrying out a comparative study in order to have a clearer insight into what constitutes the link between the rise in demand and the rise in trafficking."
"Naturally, still in the scope of the Daphne programmes, it will be possible for the European Union to cofinance initiatives on this issue with the aim of increasing the public’s awareness of the need to reduce the demand for prostitution."
"In fact, reducing the demand for prostitution limits or helps limit trafficking of persons for sexual purposes."
"Another proposal that can be made relates to more in-depth contact with local governments, regional governments and town councils."
"It is clear that phenomena such as these are present throughout the EU and, as you know, a European Crime Prevention Network does in fact exist."
"We will see whether it will be possible for this European network or other systems to enable local governments to become more involved in the activity of prevention, on the one hand, and of helping the victims of trafficking, on the other."
"In terms of victim support, there is also the application of the rules that were cited just now, which place in a certain category female victims and those who are, in general, victims of trafficking in human beings or of forced prostitution."
"In the aforementioned European legislation, it is specifically the European directive of 2004 that guarantees the granting of residence permits, as someone requested a short while ago, and you are aware that the Member States can transpose the European directive until 6 August 2006: fortunately some Member States have already done so and, in order to give a little encouragement to the Member States that have not done so by spring, in other words much earlier than August, I shall convene a technical meeting with the representatives of all of the Member States in order to understand which problems have, to date, prevented the transposition of that directive into national law and in order to formally request, before the deadline expires, that, by August, all of the Member States guarantee the victims of sexual exploitation and of trafficking in human beings the preferential treatment stipulated by the European legislation."
"Other important questions remain, such as the need for real statistical data on the phenomenon."
"As I had already mentioned, we intend to launch a debate, accompanied by an appropriate publication, in a few weeks’ time, and we will present a European communication on a typology of European statistical data on crime, with specific reference to this type of crime, so that we can at least be certain that we have reliable statistical data on the phenomenon, on its victims, on the complaints lodged and on the penalties imposed."
"Obviously, this is not an initiative dedicated solely to the World Cup championship in Germany; it is a necessary initiative in the medium-term."
"Madam President, I am about to conclude, and I apologise for the length of my speech, but there were 16 different points and I should not like it if one of the speakers were to say later on that I had not provided answers."
"We will promote a programme in order to increase awareness of the phenomenon at European level."
"I am personally in favour of the idea of a European day against trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution and, in a few weeks’ time, I intend to organise a technical seminar – which will obviously be open to everyone – for exchanging best practices with a view to preventing this phenomenon."
"Thank you."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Your obvious engagement made it impossible for me to interrupt you when your allotted ten minutes of speaking time were up."
"It would have broken my heart to interrupt you."
"However, we are running out of time and we must move on quickly."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has taken the civilised world thousands of years to eradicate the slave trade, inhuman working conditions and female submission, not to mention the death penalty, even though these battles are still not over."
"The century that has just dawned must be the one in which this new form of slavery that is forced prostitution and that each year claims thousands of women and children as victims is banished from our societies."
"That is the message constituted by the oral questions submitted today by our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"The European Parliament – I am pleased to point out – is in fact identified throughout Europe and much further afield as a tireless defender of the universal values of the human person and of human dignity."
"By voting overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs Prets’ report on 16 January, we have already sent a very powerful signal to which you were not averse, Mr Frattini, as confirmed – if confirmation were needed - by your remarks of a moment ago."
"Our oral questions today follow on from our vote in January and from our action of 8 March, and once again show our indignation."
"We are deeply shocked that preparations are being made for the forthcoming World Cup with a blind eye being turned not only to the construction, but also to the commercial promotion, of a place that some even dare to boast will be the largest brothel in the world."
"As you in fact said, Mr Frattini, it is unacceptable that international sporting competitions should have thus become outlets for forced and organised prostitution."
"Mr Frattini, however strong our protests may be, they are not enough, and you have understood that."
"We are grateful to you for having replied to the majority of the questions we put to you."
"With the World Cup taking place in Germany very soon, this is a pressing issue."
"All of the initiatives that you have just mentioned are excellent, but I would draw your attention to the fact that they need to be in place in good time."
"That is why close monitoring is needed."
"For its part, the European Parliament will do everything in its power to help achieve this."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I am glad that many of the proposals that we incorporated into my report have been adopted."
"It is important that the general public should become aware of this debate."
"If this is to happen, figures and statistics will be vital, and they need to be arrived at using common rules, not only within the European Union, but also in third countries, for we know that visitors will be coming from them."
"These, then, should be included as well."
"Much as I welcome the Commissioner’s intention to have a study produced on the effects of prostitution on the traffic in human beings, this should not consider only legal prostitution, but also the illegal variety."
"Questions also have to be asked about the situation in countries in which prostitution is banned."
"And what about the mobility of prostitutes’ clients?"
"Any study must also take account of that."
"You have already explained what you intend to do by imposing a visa requirement for the World Cup."
"I assume – and hope – that you want to tighten up controls on the grant of visas rather than to bring in a temporary visa, for then the question would arise of when one should begin and when it should expire."
"The reason why we are taking the World Cup as an opportunity is because general public interest in it will enable us to make them aware of how this problem fits into it."
"Forced prostitution, though, is also to be found going on at congresses, trade fairs, and even here in Strasbourg when this House is in session."
"This is what makes the introduction of temporary visa requirements so problematic."
"I would ask you to decide what your priorities at the April Council meeting in Brussels are going to be."
"Austria will have to prepare itself to deal with this problem if it is going to host the European Championships in 2008."
"That is why good suggestions are vital; we could all do with some."
"Although you stressed the importance of Europol, what that means in plain language is that Europol must be given not only more staff but also more powers, or else the whole thing will not be workable."
"There is much more to be said on this subject, but perhaps other Members will be the ones to say it."
"Madam President, we are at a crossroads in the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"Last week on 8 March, and again now, Commissioner Frattini announced that an extensive study will be launched this year on how laws on prostitution affect the situation of trafficking in the different Member States."
"That is indeed good news."
"In September last year, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality presented a similar, smaller, study on the issue."
"It was the first of its kind. That study gave us a strong indication that criminalising the demand for trafficking has a very strong impact and that it substantially lowers the number of girls and young women being trafficked."
"Legalisation, on the other hand, has the opposite effect."
"It increases the number of victims of trafficking."
"The figures also show clearly that not only does the legalisation of prostitution increase the legal part of the business, it also increases illegal prostitution."
"With the forthcoming study by the Commission we will strengthen the factual basis for measures against trafficking, especially criminalising the demand."
"This is no longer just an issue of different opinions; it is an issue of facts."
"I warmly welcome Commissioner Frattini’s work on the issue."
"Do we really want to fight trafficking?"
"There is a way."
"Are we brave enough?"
"Madam President, personally, I do not care for the expression ‘forced prostitution’ because all prostitution is more or less forced, but our group naturally supports the resolution put forward."
"Trafficking in human beings is slave trafficking. It is discriminatory and shameful and a disgusting crime."
"It is crucial that we do more to help this extremely weak and vulnerable group of trafficked children and women."
"On my own behalf, I should also like to welcome the fact that a thorough debate on prostitution in general is taking place."
"It is important that we dispense with the myth of the happy prostitute."
"The majority of prostitutes live miserable lives, exposed to the risks of, for example, assault, rape and sexually transmitted diseases. In no other area of our society is it accepted that a person’s working life might inflict such tremendous harm on them."
"Who, moreover, among those present in this Chamber would be pleased if his or her daughter were to become a prostitute?"
"This is a debate that we must, then, make sure gets under way."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the World Cup in Germany is an opportunity to tackle the issue of the exploitation of human beings."
"In my opinion, we need to support the initiatives put forward by the Commission in relation to women’s rights."
"I support the idea of launching an information and educational campaign designed to combat the phenomenon of sexual exploitation."
"Initiatives need to be undertaken at European level, including through the use of international instruments such as the Council of Europe Convention, but it is just as important to make a clear distinction between the world of forced prostitution and those who freely choose to work as prostitutes."
"There are, in fact, associations of female and male prostitutes; one such association came here to Parliament in order to call for the recognition of their profession, beginning with the introduction of a Charter of Rights and of a declaration of principles."
"There would appear to be a need, in political terms, to establish whether a woman who is not forced to prostitute herself should or should not be free to do so."
"Recognising voluntary prostitution and the laws governing a profession means recognising a series of rights and duties; among the rights – to mention a few – are those of living freely and safely, of carrying out one’s job free from slavery and of marrying, given that this is not permitted in some countries."
". – Madam President, today’s debate on trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution in the context of world sports events illustrates the tragedy of the thousands of exploited women traded in the sex industry."
"It also illustrates the absurdity of a liberal understanding of freedom according to which one is free to do anything one likes."
"This kind of licence leads directly to killing, the spread of diseases, drug addiction, prostitution, pornography and other ills."
"Genuine freedom makes sense when it is at the service of truth and love."
"This means that violence, manipulation and deceit must be perceived as destructive and unacceptable, and that prostitution must be perceived as exploitation of the individual."
"The use of the so-called red card to combat forced prostitution and deal with this contemporary form of slavery seems rather an ineffective and disjointed approach in the context of liberal propaganda."
"Legal restrictions are needed."
"Madam President, I was in Belgium in 1999 and witnessed the treatment meted out to a Polish woman who had been raped by an Albanian."
"This woman was ordered to leave the country after she filed a complaint with the police."
"The fate of the rapist is unknown."
"He might well have got away scot-free as he was a poor candidate for political asylum."
"The unfortunate victim of the rape did not, however, receive any kind of compensation or psychological support even though this could have been made available to her."
"It was impossible to help the victim because she was given three days’ notice to leave the country."
"Consequently, it is important to grant special status to the victims of violence, rape and forced prostitution, allowing them temporary residence in the country concerned and some financial support."
"Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is without question a fundamental abuse of human rights and one of the most wretched phenomena of the present day world."
"This modern form of slavery that we are witnessing should not be part of any civilised society."
"The trafficking is extensive in scale and takes its toll on hundreds of thousands of victims in Europe."
"It is estimated that the number of sexually abused women and girls amounts to 85% of all the victims."
"In this context, I would like to comment on two issues."
"The European Convention against Trafficking serves as a legal instrument, but the Council of Europe’s website offers information indicating that thirteen European countries, EU Member States, have failed to sign this Convention, and none of the countries has ratified it so far."
"Even the European Community has not signed this document."
"How is Mr Frattini, the responsible Commissioner, going to deal with this issue?"
"Secondly, I would like to question how we can fight effectively against human trafficking if demand goes essentially unnoticed, apart from some cases, and if these services continue to be tolerated."
"According to some analyses, Europeans spend billions of euros for such services and, as a result, demand becomes the driving force of this successful business."
"I am looking forward to the strategy and the promised communication on action plans to combat human trafficking which, in my opinion, will offer an appropriate setting for continuing our discussion on these serious matters and for expressing our views."
"Madam President, in many countries, thousands of women are exploited and forced into prostitution, and the ones subjected to this forced prostitution are mostly young and vulnerable."
"The weakest ones are controlled by pimps, who keep watch over them and who punish them physically, financially and psychologically; death threats are often made."
"One might wonder, therefore, why these women do not inform against their pimps."
"They are sometimes bound by love, but more often than not by fear."
"These helpless women thus accept this nightmare because they no longer have any choices."
"For some, there is a stage of prostitution that is almost congenial."
"However, we are now increasingly seeing – but not really registering – this new kind of slave pacing up and down our streets."
"If the girl does not work enough, she suffers a torrent of physical abuse."
"The pimp puts constant pressure on her to encourage her to work. In circumstances in which prostitution is legal, the pimp defends the girl, puts her in touch with brothel-keepers and forces her to submit to the demands of the environment to which he belongs."
"In order to achieve his aims, he uses seduction, threats and violence."
"The victim is forced to hand over her earnings either directly or through a third party."
"Subjected to violence as they are, these young women must settle large debts in order to cover the cost of their journeys and their identity papers."
"Staying illegally in a country, more often than not deprived of their money, they no longer have any hope of seeing their situations improve."
"When they resist the pressure of the traffickers, they, their children or their families are threatened."
"There is no way out of this situation, and the nature of the environment in which they work often makes them sink into drug addiction."
"No one can wash their hands of a tragedy such as this."
"We have a duty: that of combating this vile business, as others have combated slavery, racism and arbitrary imprisonment."
"This debate concerns all of us, in all of the European countries."
"– Madam President, it is very important that the issue of how to combat the traffic in people, and in women, be debated before the football World Cup kicks off in Germany."
"We are talking here in terms of thousands of additional prostitutes, most of whom will be working against their will and as a result of coercion."
"My many years of experience with NGOs working in the field of child prostitution on the borders between the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria lead me to believe that these crimes can be dealt with only by improving the laws, by giving more powers to the various institutions and authorities, and by cross-border cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe."
"In the longer term, though, it will be necessary to combat poverty and mount information campaigns in order to send forced prostitution off the field for good."
"Instituting an Anti-Trafficking Day will make people more aware of this problem."
"Madam President, the questions tabled are commendable for the way in which they address the issues of people-trafficking and prostitution."
"I particularly – and wholeheartedly – endorse the demand for an inquiry into the relation between these issues and those about the course of affairs surrounding the football World Cup."
"I thought Commissioner Frattini’s response was excellent."
"I am delighted that the Commission is prepared to mount a comparative inquiry into the way in which Member States treat prostitution in legal and practical terms and into the impact of that policy."
"I would ask Commissioner Frattini also to take into consideration the extent of transparency and controllability of prostitution, the extent of forced prostitution, opportunities for prostitutes to leave the profession and the demand for prostitution."
"I would be interested to learn something of how the adverse effects of prostitution can be controlled most effectively."
"I should like to conclude by saying that I am delighted with the tone of this debate."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a friend of my 20-year-old daughter recently told me, jumping for joy, that she had got herself a job as a hostess at the World Cup."
"When I asked her how this had come about, she – a sporty lass – told me that she had got the job by applying to the German Sports Association."
"In this instance, I am sure that this is a proper job offer, but imagine that you live in poverty and your daughter announces that she has the chance, this summer, to travel to Germany, where a super job is waiting for her."
"Of course, as a mother or father, you rejoice at every opportunity your child gets, but who actually considers the risks involved or investigates whether the offer is genuine?"
"That is just one of the many possible ways in which these things can happen."
"Providing information where people are is where we must start – the Commissioner has referred to the many surveys that have been conducted – but we must make people, whether parents or children, aware of the dangers inherent in every such questionable offer."
"We know that there is a spectacular increase in the demand for sexual services during major events like this, and, of course, in the incidence of criminal activities such as people-trafficking and forced prostitution."
"Only a very few women and children work without being in a brothel or managed by a pimp."
"Thousands are brought here from Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, attracted by false information and driven by poverty at home and by the need to feed their families."
"They come here and are broken, and exploited, in the most brutal fashion, so that they end up losing their dignity and their self-respect."
"Quite apart from providing information on the ground, there are things we have to do in the country in which the events are being held, things such as public relations work and a 24-hour multilingual telephone hotline – all these things are under consideration, and that is why we support these actions."
"Now in particular, at a time when the World Cup is being played for, we need to show the red card."
"Let us talk about how to do that."
"– Madam President, the phenomenon of trafficking in and the movement of women is a problem with global dimensions which arises even more acutely during the organisation of sports events."
"Obviously, with this problem, there can be no discrimination between forced and 'voluntary' prostitution, because both forms have the same root: they are caused by deep poverty and social exclusion, phenomena which lead women to the limits of exploitation."
"However, from a legal point of view also, when the victim comes before the courts, how can a distinction be made between forced prostitution and prostitution and how can sanctions be imposed on the person behind them?"
"It is vital that it be made clear that sports events must be safeguarded in the conscience of all of us as roadmaps of values and cultures."
"Each and everything that sullies such cultural meetings must be abolished."
"I believe that the proposals you just mentioned, Mr Frattini, and Mrs Prets' proposals, lay down a serious framework at European and international level."
"Madam President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Frattini for the attention he has given to the issue of trafficking in human beings."
"This is one of the most appalling manifestations of international crime. It is a serious breach of human rights and of the laws on immigration and work, and has a highly detrimental effect on national and international security."
"There has been alarming growth in this type of crime, and according to UN figures, it has become the third most lucrative activity in organised crime."
"This is a transnational phenomenon that is a major concern for a great many countries, be they countries of origin, transit or destination."
"What is needed is therefore an across-the-board, coordinated strategy, involving increased efforts at both legislative and operation levels."
"At legislative level, the adoption in 2002 of the framework decision approximating the criminal provisions of the Member States and applicable penalties, and enabling judges from one Member State to issue a European Arrest Warrant relating to criminals involved in the trafficking of human beings was an important step."
"This framework decision was supposed to have been transposed by August 2004."
"We are still awaiting a report assessing the measures adopted by the Member States and on whether or not it has been implemented by all Member States."
"On the operational side, I feel that the main priorities are the strengthening of Europol, which is currently underused; rapid, comprehensive reaction in support of victims, whereby victims can be offered immediate assistance; and improved exchange of information and statistical data, to which you referred earlier, Commissioner."
"Madam President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, trafficking in human beings is a scourge that must be combated by all means at our disposal."
"Every year, more than 700 000 women and children are caught by networks of traffickers."
"In Europe alone, 100 000 women are victims of trafficking every year and subjected to acts that impinge on their physical integrity and mental health."
"The trafficking of women and children is the most rapidly rising form of crime and it is known that the problem is worse during major sporting events."
"The trafficking of women is linked to illegal immigration."
"Thousands of poor women are lured by the promise of a decent, well-paid job, only to be forced subsequently into prostitution."
"In light of what has already been said, the football World Cup provides the Commission with an opportunity to set a valuable precedent in combating the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women, by means of programmes aimed at the social inclusion and rehabilitation of women, along with legal, medical, psychological and language assistance."
"– Madam President, the exploitation of women and children through forced prostitution, on the occasion of and centred around major sports events, is one of the scourges of our times."
"At a time when gender equality, freedom of thought and human rights are the focal point of our interest and thoughts, I consider the fact that the open borders of the free and democratic European Union provide the opportunity and offer asylum to organised crime in the form of the forced prostitution of women and children to be an insult."
"The numbers, on the occasion of the World Cup in Germany, beggar belief."
"It is impossible to imagine the forty, fifty or one hundred thousand women and children from throughout the world who will flood the European country in a common action, women and children who, because of their poverty and the inability of world public opinion to address the problem, will be sacrificed at the altar of commercial sex as prostitutes."
"Commissioner, offering advice or passing national legislation is not enough to combat this phenomenon."
"It is not enough to prevent serious diseases which threaten health as a result of commercial sex by relying on the free distribution of thousands or millions of condoms, as we have seen at major sports events."
"It is our duty not to tacitly legalise the humiliation of women and children who, with society, are being thrown to the lions of commercial interest by abusive prostitution."
"I should like to finish, Commissioner, by mentioning that you proposed 25 March as an international anti-trafficking day during your recent visit to Athens."
"I would like to ask you to postpone this by one day, as 25 March is a national holiday in Greece, one of the biggest celebrations in our history."
"We respect women, but we also respect national holidays."
"Thank you in advance."
"Pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"People trafficking, or slavery as we used to call it, stamped out by the British Empire with the force of the Royal Navy behind it, is now a sad fact of life under the new Brussels Empire."
"This despicable trade is being unwittingly fostered by a policy agenda governed by man-hating lesbians with no knowledge or understanding of the real world."
"If you doubt this click on to their website and make your own judgement."
"The next item is the report (A6-0013/2006) by Mr Hutchinson, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on relocation in the context of regional development (2004/2254(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of my report – the relocation of businesses – is a sensitive but nonetheless topical one."
"I realised immediately that it had a delicate side when I presented my first draft report in the Committee on Regional Development."
"I have rarely witnessed – although I am still a young MEP – such a heated debate in committee."
"The fact remains that insight often springs from a clash of ideas, and I think that we have succeeded in drafting a good, balanced text, which expresses several interesting ideas and which enables us to demystify, clarify and better grasp the complex mechanisms of a genuine problem in our society."
"I should also like to take advantage of the time given to me to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues who helped draft this report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are a great many of us in this Chamber – perhaps not this evening, but in general – who were able to note that relocations give rise more often than not to considerable economic consequences for the regions affected."
"However, a relocation also means job losses and tragedies for the families that are the victims, and that is something that affects us."
"Furthermore, an initial observation that I was able to make while preparing this report was that the European statistical tool in this area is weak."
"I was also able to observe that our Assembly had already addressed this issue in the form of other reports."
"In an initial resolution of 13 March 2003 on the closure of businesses in receipt of EU financial aid, Parliament put its finger on the major risk that relocations represent with regard to the primary objective of regional policy, namely economic and social cohesion."
"Then came the resolution of 6 July 2005 by our fellow Member, Mr Hatzidakis, on the reform of the Structural Funds."
"On that occasion, Parliament had drawn up several proposals regarding relocations."
"My report obviously takes up the ideas contained in the resolutions previously voted on by the European Parliament."
"I have attempted to reproduce the main principals of those resolutions."
"After having pointed out that regional development policy is aimed at facilitating the development of EU regions and that public aid should not serve to encourage the relocation of economic activities, the report voted on by our Committee on Regional Development goes on to propose the adoption, both at Community and at national level, of measures designed to prevent, on the one hand, the potential negative consequences that relocations might have for economic development and, on the other, the social tragedies caused by these relocations."
"Firstly, we are calling for a tool to be made available to us that will allow us access to more precise information."
"We therefore propose entrusting the Dublin Observatory with the remit of studying, assessing and monitoring the phenomenon of relocation in order to give expression to its social and economic impact and its effect on policy regarding cohesion and regional development."
"In addition to this tool, and in the absence of better coordination of our national social systems, the Committee on Regional Development considers that it is now crucial to adopt an overall European strategy for averting, managing and monitoring the relocation of companies not only within, but also outside the Union."
"We propose a number of measures that we address in very practical terms in the report."
"Firstly, we call on the Commission to take all the measures necessary in order to fulfil what I believe is one of the crucial requirements of the report: that of preventing European regional policy from being an incentive for companies to relocate."
"Secondly, we support the Commission proposal aimed at penalising the companies that have received EU aid and that relocate their activities within seven years."
"We also request that, in the event of non-compliance with national and international laws, it should no longer be possible for these same companies to receive public aid intended for their new place of production."
"We call on the Commission to contemplate measures with regard to the relocations that I would refer to as ‘reverse’ relocations, namely those that, without relocation of the company’s activities, lead to a deterioration in working conditions."
"We consider that the granting, and continued provision, of public aid to businesses must be conditional on precise commitments in the areas of employment and local development."
"We suggest that the Commission develop a system designed more severely to penalise companies that, after having received public aid, relocate all or part of their activities outside the European Union."
"We also call on the Commission to include social clauses in international treaties and request that the implementation of these social clauses be supported by positive measures and incentives to help the countries and the companies that comply with those clauses."
"We support the Commission proposal aimed at creating a Globalisation Fund designed to avert and deal with the economic and social crises resulting from restructuring and relocations."
"Finally, the Committee on Regional Development considers that the consequences of the many relocations must lead us to take an open and constructive approach to the issue of creating a genuine European social area."
"In this regard, we consider that social dialogue has a major role to play in terms of preventing relocations and of dealing with their effects."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as we all know and as has been said often enough, the European Union has been going through a significant crisis of late."
"What is serious about this crisis is the fact that Europeans have undoubtedly lost confidence and interest in this fantastic project that is European integration."
"Whether it be by means of this resolution on relocations or by means of other texts, we, the Members of the European Parliament, who are elected by the people of Europe, have a duty to listen to these worries."
"I believe that the report on which we voted in committee contains some interesting areas for further reflection and that it responds to the legitimate questions posed by our fellow citizens on this matter."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mr Hutchinson, and the Committee on Regional Development for this exceptional report, which concerns a sensitive issue which has been the subject of extensive debate in the various Member States over recent months."
"Without underestimating the sensitivity of the issue, I should like to remind you that the right of establishment anywhere in the Community is a fundamental freedom and cornerstone of the single market."
"It is detrimental to encourage or ban investment decisions."
"Specialisation and changes to the location at which economic activity is exercised form part of economic development and are needed if we want growth and more and better jobs."
"However, the Commission knows full well that company relocations, as Mr Hutchinson stressed earlier, and the loss of jobs within the Union are very worrying phenomena."
"Of course we cannot intervene in decisions by companies or undertakings in their work; however, we are resolved to combat the social consequences of such decisions."
"The objective of the Structural Funds, during both the current and the next programming periods, is job creation, growth and further economic progress."
"They are flexible and perfectly able to mitigate and limit the difficulties created in the regions and for citizens by a company's decision to close and relocate all or part of its economic activity to another Member State or outside the European Union."
"Both current and future regulations which have not yet been finalised make provision for any company financed by the Structural Funds of the European Union which relocates within five years of receiving a subsidy to repay the subsidy."
"Thanks to this rule, companies will stop taking recourse to subsidy hopping."
"To close, I should like to assure you that the Commission will examine carefully every specific proposal which Parliament may present within the framework of debates on future regulations."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the terrible consequences of company relocations in various EU countries, namely increased unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. Development across vast areas is also hampered, especially in countries with weak economies such as Portugal, which are dominated by the ‘traditional’ industries of textiles and clothing, footwear and cable-manufacturing."
"Relocations, according to the opinion delivered by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, affects not only these ‘traditional’ industries, but also highly capital-intensive industries such as steel-making, aviation, mechanical engineering and electronic components, not to mention large parts of the service sector, for example software development and financial, logistics and information services."
"It is good news that the Committee on Regional Development, through its rapporteur Mr Hutchinson, has welcomed most of the opinions expressed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in particular the inclusion of the social clauses in international treaties based on the International Labour Organisation conventions, thereby ensuring that countries and businesses comply with them, although I personally do not feel that these measures go far enough."
"Nevertheless, as we stated in the debate and vote on Parliament’s resolution of 13 March 2003 on closure of undertakings after receiving EU financial aid, the Commission and the Member States must take action to put a stop to this economic and social scourge, which leads only to greater profits for multinationals and economic groups that do not demonstrate any social responsibility."
"This debate must produce practical results, whereby the rights of workers are safeguarded and the economic groups with a history of relocations and unemployment no longer receive aid in any Member State."
"The Commission, in conjunction with the Member States, must, as a matter of urgency, take on board the opinions of the European Works Councils, draw up and publish a blacklist of businesses and economic and/or financial groups that have used relocations for the purpose of increasing their profits and demand the return of any aid granted."
"More stringent requirements must also be in place with regard to defending jobs and regional development in forthcoming regulations on Community funds."
". Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development supported this report with a large majority."
"The rapporteur had to harmonise completely opposing opinions, and deserves our thanks."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has never supported the restrictions on freedoms, such as, in our case, the free movement of capital."
"Our compromise was based on this principle, and in the future, too, we must continue to refuse to expect solutions to local problems on the restrictions on freedoms."
"Unfortunately, we have already seen an alarming example of this, not too long ago, in relation with the Services Directive."
"Protectionism induced by selfishness and fear will always have undesirable consequences."
"There has been a growth in production in countries where the labour market was opened to workers from new Member States, and unemployment levels have actually dropped."
"In other areas, some companies relocated to regions with cheaper wages."
"Company relocations raise many concerns."
"If company owners are only concerned with the profit, they may succeed in increasing their profit levels, but they would cause damage to others."
"Increasing shareholder revenues are no consolation to employees who lose their jobs because their company relocated to the developing world, or even just to a different region of the European Union."
"Therefore we must identify the appropriate methods to enforce the common good, but I am afraid that no law can ever replace the feeling of mutual responsibility between owners and employees, for the welfare of the other."
"The owner-employee relationship will only have a ‘human face’ if it is based not only on economic, but also on ethical considerations."
"Therefore, I am certain that while we are searching for new routes and new solutions, we will have to return to the issue of company relocations."
"– Mr President, I am glad that the rapporteur – after what were at first considerable differences of opinion in the Committee – has succeeded in achieving such a broad compromise on this report."
"It is a compromise of which I am very much in favour."
"There are three points that I would like again to highlight."
"Firstly, I was interested to learn that only a very few companies that relocate actually get European aid, that is to say, aid from European tax revenues, and, as cohesion and structural policy are founded on solidarity with more vulnerable regions, I do not think that anyone here in this House will be undermining them."
"Secondly, there needs to be more transparency as regards which companies get which aid, in order to make it clear to our electorate what we in the European Union are actually doing and what we are supporting."
"In any case, we will not stand for any ‘subsidy hopping’."
"Thirdly, where relocations result in job losses, there is a need for an instrument to help those affected, and that is what the globalisation fund could be."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to see that, after the long hours of work devoted to the report by our fellow Member, Mr Hutchinson, we have reached, as my two fellow Members have just said, if not a full consensus, then at least an agreement on most of the elements."
"Coming back to the initial report and to the observation made, I believe that we must of course take into account what motivated Mr Hutchinson, namely the shock that a relocation represents for the employees and the region concerned, since any relocation of a large workforce is a genuinely traumatic experience, both for the employees and for the region."
"As the rapporteur also said, it is not acceptable that certain business executives should use blackmail."
"We must, however, note that, in a free economy, there are, within our very own regions – since relocations sometimes take place within our own countries – differences in wages and technical competitiveness that mean that a company might in fact be led to relocate some of its production plants, whether it is goods or services that they produce."
"Finally, let us not forget that, in accordance with the Single European Act of 1986, we have to facilitate the free circulation of goods, persons and services in our Member States."
"Before talking about relocation, we need to ask the following basic question: if a company that has to face up to competition and that has to provide a service to its customers does not relocate, then what does it do?"
"I am not talking about crooks here."
"I am talking about a number of companies that have been faced with this decision."
"The fact is that a number of them have managed perfectly well by creating and developing their Research and Development service, by creating new markets and by managing to relocate part of their activities."
"To conclude, then, I should like to stress that, as Mrs Krehl said, it is important that our European Union does not use its funds improperly to support relocations."
"Rather, we must use the available funds to support the employees and the regions that run into difficulties when such relocations do take place."
"– Mr President, subsidy hopping is a popular game of extortion in the European Union, and it is quite clear that it is the taxpayer who foots the bill for it."
"This game has not been played only since the accession of the ten new Member States; on the contrary, as soon as Sweden joined, a business was enticed away from Bremen to the new Swedish ‘Objective 2’ area, having just received a subsidy."
"The effect of that was to frustrate public measures against unemployment in Bremen."
"That example shows what is at issue here."
"This is not about restricting freedom of establishment, but rather about the need for companies that receive public funds to commit themselves to creating jobs in the region, and for this to be laid down in a binding way."
"The Commission has proposed a period of five years, which I do not think is enough."
"It is no more than symbolic and is quite utterly ineffective."
"In view of the fact that the companies’ investments are subsidised by up to 50% from public funds, this period must be longer – at least seven years, which is what the previous Commission had proposed."
"Five years amounts to a considerable reduction; even a period of seven years is not very much at all in this instance."
"If we really want to restrict subsidy hopping, it is this longer period that we need."
"I think Mr Hutchinson’s report addresses essential issues, and that it is an important one."
"What I expect of the Commission is that it should reconsider this five-year period, which, with this amount of subsidy, distorts competition; that it should incorporate the period of five years as recommended by this House into its regulation on subsidies, and, moreover, that it should monitor more closely those companies that engage in this sort of subsidy hopping and blacklist them in the way the rapporteur has suggested."
". Exactly three years ago, following a long struggle by the workers to defend jobs and the viability of companies such as CG and Clark in Portugal, Parliament adopted a resolution on 13 March 2003 with a range of recommendations on the closure of undertakings after receiving EU financial aid."
"Three years on, and what has the Commission done to implement these recommendations?"
"What has it done to make Community aid contingent on long-term agreements on employment and local development?"
"Has the Commission published the register of breaches of contract by businesses that have relocated and have benefited directly or indirectly from public money?"
"How many times has the Commission refused to grant Community aid to businesses that have failed to comply with the contracts they have signed, or demanded the return of that aid?"
"What practical measures has it adopted to support the workers and economic recovery in areas affected by relocations?"
"Has the Commission drawn up the proposed code of practice to prevent company relocations?"
"The answer to these questions is clear for all to see in the report before us, which, after three years, simply lists the same recommendations to the Commission."
"Companies tend to view relocations as an investment."
"By obtaining the various public incentives and aid and exploiting cheap labour deprived of rights, the company is looking to gain maximum profit in a short space of time. This is until it finds a more cost-effective place in which to relocate, thus going back on all of its undertakings and overlooking the appalling social and economic damage that they leave behind."
"Company relocations act as a form of constant blackmail hanging over the workers, a form of pressure to reduce salaries, increase working time, increase the flexibility of the labour markets and to reduce workers’ rights."
"We therefore propose the adoption of a regulatory legal framework to combat company relocations, so that in three years’ time we will not be holding the same debate."
". Mr President, I wish to focus on the concept of direct state aid as a tool of regional development, to which Mr Hutchinson alludes in his report."
"It is a concept very closely allied to the idea of structural funds and regional cohesion and my country, the United Kingdom, is paying a heavy price within the EU as a result."
"The rapporteur called for companies that have received public aid and have then relocated within the EU to be blocked from receiving state aid or structural funding for seven years."
"But what of respected companies that have applied quite properly for state aid, received no answer from the British Government due to delays from the Commission in giving the green light, and have then relocated to another part of the EU, which fits in better with Brussels’ idea of cohesion and is, therefore, completely free of the same obstructions?"
"In 2002 Peugeot asked the European Commission to approve a state aid package to build the new 207 model at Ryton in the English West Midlands."
"More than two years later, with still no answer forthcoming from the Commission, Peugeot gave up and announced that the 207 would be built in France and Slovakia."
"No doubt Brussels saw that as an economic mission accomplished."
"Meanwhile, Ryton faces an uncertain future."
"Once production ceases on the 206 model – built there so well and so competitively up until now – if this factory then closes after many years of production under various owners, I suppose one could describe that as a kind of relocation; but it is hardly Peugeot’s fault."
"Perhaps instead the Commission should be banned for seven years from pronouncing on state aid and from over-regulating the business sector."
"That would certainly be cheered in the English West Midlands, where skilled workers are suffering at the hands of EU economic policy."
"Rubbing salt into its workforce’s wounds, we now have the news that Peugeot has reached an agreement with Kia Motors to build the 206 in Indonesia, along with unconfirmed reports that the 207 will be built there too."
"Nothing could better illustrate the illiteracy of EU economics."
"If we want an increase in employment we should strike the right balance between regulation and flexibility for business."
"Over-regulation creates artificial jobs, which are not economically justified."
"Mr President, I welcome this report by Mr Hutchinson on relocation in the context of regional development."
"It highlights the importance of EU cohesion policy as a means of alleviating disparities in regions that are lagging behind."
"I come from a country that has benefited from the EU’s structural funds."
"I therefore welcome this from an Irish point of view, but particularly for my own region – the west and north-west of Ireland."
"Being a predominantly rural region – 70% of the people live in rural areas – it is more vulnerable than most to the effects of relocation."
"Europe must protect regions like the west and north-west of Ireland, particularly as regards the settlement pattern, which can only be sustained by balanced regional development."
"Europe must insist on infrastructure deficits being addressed, especially in areas like transport, energy and modern broadband communication."
"These deficits inhibit regional competitiveness."
"In this regard, I warmly welcome the European Commission’s approval last week of the Irish Government’s decision to spend EUR 170 million to extend the broadband network over 70 towns across the state."
"Measures such as this will assist the competitiveness of regions, attract mobile investment and hopefully offset the tendencies for companies to set up in locations that are already congested."
"This is the strongest defence against relocation and in favour of strengthening the regions that need that help most."
"– Mr President, I naturally do not want EU taxpayers’ money to fund the development of businesses that relocate outside the EU or that do not play by the rules."
"Nevertheless, I entirely reject this report, as I believe that to impose a seven-year freeze on businesses, during which time they may not relocate their operations, displays a deep misunderstanding of the global economy."
"Likewise, I fail to understand why a business in the EU should not be cleared to move to another territory, if there is competition between the types of State aid granted by individual Member States."
"A freeze on businesses moving will not ensure the protection of sustainable employment; it will only succeed in overloading an already inflexible employment and high-taxation system with further immobility."
"This will give rise to more pointless bureaucracy and the further spread of the nonsensical strategy of fighting against company relocations."
"Civil servants are engaged in a futile struggle, tilting at windmills with EU taxpayers’ money."
"In other words, capital is always channelled where it is best appreciated, and will not follow the instructions laid down by Parliament or the Commission."
"Mr President, the European Parliament obviously does not want in the Hutchinson report to prohibit companies from relocating to other countries."
"This would be restrictive and anti-democratic."
"We, at least the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, know that a company needs to be competitive in order to survive and the individual Member States will need to have a fiscal and general economic environment that attracts investment in the individual Member States."
"Nonetheless, it is not right for the European Union to encourage the continual relocation of companies with resources from the European budget."
"That is why the Hutchinson report proposes, once again, that penalties should be imposed on companies which have received financial aid from the European Union and relocate their activities within seven years of the granting of the aid."
"It also proposes that companies which received state aid, especially those which failed to comply with all the obligations connected with such aid, should not qualify for state aid for their new location and should be blocked from receipt of future Structural Fund aid."
"The Hutchinson report also points out that we need to be even stricter with companies that relocate outside the European Union."
"I think that the European Parliament's proposals are realistic and respond in a balanced manner to an existing problem."
"I also wish to highlight the proposal made in the Hutchinson report in connection with the globalisation fund."
"We welcome the proposal by the European Commission and believe that the globalisation fund will soon become a reality in order to address the negative consequences of this modern situation which offers opportunity to everyone but also contains risks which need to be addressed in an effective manner."
"Mr President, earlier on it seemed that many intended to use this debate to create yet another divide between the old and the new Member States of the European Union."
"Our task is to create regulations that are able to ensure a better, safer and expanding Europe in each Member State and for each citizen."
"If the regulations are not good, then there is a possibility that the cohesion policy, which is based on solidarity, one of our greatest fundamental values, will help the most underdeveloped regions, but it may create uncertainty and vulnerability in others."
"The author of the report had the difficult task of ensuring that the issue of company relocations does not become a further divide between East and West, but a new step towards the unification of Europe."
"The work of the rapporteur has led to more balanced proposals, which are mostly able to ensure that the goals of regional policy are met, and they strengthen social and economic security for workers in all twenty-five Member States."
"My congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on the excellent work he has done: there is clearly a need to implement effective policies designed to counter fiscal dumping among the various Member States."
"The decision to relocate production within the Union – if it is justified by one territory being more competitive than another – can nonetheless benefit the European economy as a whole."
"On the contrary, it is something quite different – and worrying – when, usually as a result of rather permissive labour laws in many non-EU countries, relocations take place outside the European Union."
"It is clear that the European social model is costly, and it is primarily the competitiveness of our businesses that suffers as a consequence. However, that does not mean that we can accept cut-price compromises."
"Firstly, we need to stimulate European production in terms of quality and specialisation. Secondly, we need to introduce measures aimed at lessening the social costs of a relocation through actions designed to promote the training and reskilling of workers in the regions hit by restructuring."
"We covered a subject of this kind in detail in the past, when this Parliament debated the steel crisis with specific reference to the Thyssen Krupp affair in Terni, Italy."
"I agree with imposing severe penalties on businesses that, after having received European or national public aid, decide to relocate part of their production outside the Union."
"That is all I have to say, Mr President."
"I should just like to take up the proposal to create a European trademark for goods produced entirely on EU soil: I believe that this is an important incentive to produce within the European Union."
"– Mr President, last month Commissioner Danuda Hubner stated during an interview with a French financial newspaper that we need to facilitate relocation within the European Union."
"For the Commissioner, this is one of the fundamental principles of the internal market and the application of artificial rules designed to restrict it will have negative consequences on the competitiveness of Community undertakings."
"If, however, the European Commission wants to develop a competitive European economy, it would be a good idea to make sure that it does not destroy the European social model in the process, that it does not destroy workers' rights or, at the very least, that it does not create an environment which encourages companies to violate them."
"A competitive European economy is not a bad development for European workers, but the means of achieving this objective, and the planning philosophy have unquestionably caused nothing but problems for the workers."
"The Hutchinson report is without doubt a positive step forward."
"I must welcome and support the report, given that I agree with most of it, but I would also comment that it is one of the few reports which I have seen by a socialist member of the European Parliament recently which, at long last, appears to have been written by a true socialist."
"Mr President, as I take the floor in this debate I should like to draw the attention of the House to two important issues."
"Relocation, or the process of transferring economic activity abroad, is an objective economic process."
"It is a consequence of the need to respond to ever-fiercer competition that goes hand-in-hand with the need to reduce manufacturing costs."
"It is true that relocation results in job losses in certain countries, but only in the short term."
"Research has shown that, in the long term, additional jobs are created following relocation."
"Research undertaken amongst 600 German undertakings by McKenzie, a firm of consultants, has confirmed that transferring jobs to Eastern Europe promotes the creation of additional jobs in Germany."
"For 40% of the undertakings studied the creation of one job abroad meant that three new jobs were created in Germany at the same time."
"The same is true of British and French enterprises investing abroad."
"This being the case, setting up administrative barriers and imposing financial sanctions on enterprises wishing to relocate or on local authorities making public aid available to attract investors simply dos not make economic sense."
"I shall therefore be voting against Mr Hutchinson’s report."
"Mr President, as an elected representative of the French region of Nord-Pas de Calais, whose industries – particularly the textile industry – lose thousands of jobs each year, I obviously approve of the proposal designed to demand the repayment of the European aid granted to companies that relocate their factories."
"This is a sensible economic and social proposal, which the had made during the 2004 regional elections with regard to the subsidies paid by the regional councils."
"This measure, crucial as it is, will not, however, be any more adequate than was the creation, on 1 March, of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"As far as this matter is concerned, the European Commission is only repairing with its one – ostensibly social – arm the damage done by its other, ultraliberal, arm."
"Relocations are not inevitable, but are the consequence of the European Union’s commercial ideology."
"By destroying economic borders, this ideology exposes our businesses to competition from groups with extremely low labour costs."
"This social dumping is not only to the advantage of non- European countries, but also takes place within Europe itself."
"Thus, there are many European directives that give de facto support to relocations between Member States and to the levelling down of social legislation."
"In order to have any hope of preserving our jobs and our way of life, we will have to re-establish our commercial borders and introduce a social VAT on imported goods."
"We will indeed have to choose one day between the re-introduction of a national and European protection policy and your policy of liberal fundamentalism, which leads to widespread social decline."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, the European Communities Treaty established free movement of persons, goods and capital within the EU, and so it would hardly be possible to call for the free choice of location to be banned outright, since that would harm European businesses by making them immobile."
"What is needed, though, is the introduction of something to accompany the principles of free circulation, which must remain within the cohesion policy framework, and the reforms of the structural funds and of the law on subsidies present themselves as opportunities for doing this."
"What that means is that it is urgently necessary that the Commission should, in awarding subsidies and also funding from the Structural Funds, ensure that the granting of such aid should be conditional upon medium-term guarantees of permanence and employment."
"That is indeed something that Europe must deal with."
"What Mr Hutchinson’s report – albeit not without its being the subject of lively debate in the Committee – makes clear is that the companies receiving the aid are obliged to implement the policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Put in plain terms, that means that the consistent way to put the proposal made by the Commission with reference to the Structural Funds is to specify that companies that fail to comply with the conditions attached to public aid, should be required to repay it, without, however, being allowed under any circumstances to receive public subsidy for the new locations and to be barred from support from structural funds or in the form of State aid for a period of at least five years – although seven would be better – from the date of relocation."
"This report is intended to stress the need for every necessary step to be taken to prevent the offering, under European regional policy, of incentives for business relocations that result in job losses."
"Mr Hutchinson’s report, in its present form, is an even-handed one and deserves to be endorsed."
"Mr President, under the pressure of the French and Dutch ‘No’ votes on the Constitution, Parliament is finally concerning itself with relocations."
"I can only approve of the measures proposed."
"There is an urgent need to implement these measures because each day that goes by brings with it the destruction of thousands of jobs."
"I regret that, in this area, we have only got as far as providing support in small doses, when what is required is a drastic remedy."
"Nevertheless, the relatively tentative approach of the report illustrates the major contradiction running through the Union’s economic policy: competition can never be both totally free and undistorted."
"Businesses use blackmail, threatening to relocate in order to force employees to accept social conditions that fall short of what is required by their countries’ laws."
"This social blackmail is coupled with fiscal blackmail."
"The threat of relocations is systematically used to obtain tax relief."
"Successfully combating relocations entails the swift, upwards harmonisation of taxation and social laws within Europe."
"Furthermore, we have to put an end to the independence of the European Central Bank, which always promotes the interests of public borrowings to the detriment of those of the job market."
"Mr President, Poland supports the relocation of enterprises within the European Union."
"In our view, penalising enterprises which have transferred their activities with a ban on receiving EU aid for a period of seven years is unduly restrictive and cannot be justified."
"It is hard to understand why EU enterprises are to be prevented from reacting to the needs of the market, when this is in the interests of both consumers and producers."
"We are opposed to the drawing up of special lists of enterprises that have relocated, as this runs counter to the fundamental principles of the EU."
"We call on all Members of the House to reject such unjust provisions."
"They infringe free market principles and are particularly damaging to the new Member States."
"Mr President, relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe."
"Within the EU, of course, it is in part a product of the free movements guaranteed under the Treaty and it has come into focus as a real issue because of the precipitous speed and scale of enlargement."
"With cohesion funding targeted on the new Member States, the situation is set to worsen."
"This will lead to a development deficit in other European regions."
"Policy which facilitates relocation thus damages social cohesion."
"What is urgently required is a stronger policy of denial of EU funds and a facility to recoup them in respect of any company which relocates production to another Member State."
"Five years is far too short a period."
"There is no future in robbing the old Member States of jobs in order to develop the new Member States."
"EU funds should play no part in that, nor should we facilitate opportunities for companies to soak up grants and then move on."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are addressing the issue of relocations is an understandable attempt to balance, on the one hand, the impact of the rules of the internal market, with, on the other, support for cohesion policy and ensuring a level playing field for Europe's regions."
"Let us not forget, however, that we would not have to worry about this problem if all EU principles, including the free movement of services and labour, were being upheld."
"The fact that basically only the free movement of goods and capital are possible today more or less encourages the relocation of production to areas where costs are lower."
"Indeed, regional aid must not distort the rules of the internal market, and European regional policy must not encourage company relocations."
"This is where the intervention of the EU in Europe’s economy should end, however."
"I do not accept the idea of protecting inflexible businesses and workers."
"In my view, to block the relocations of companies represents a breach of free movement, which is one of the basic freedoms of the European Community."
"I disagree with Mrs Schroedter out of principle, and take the view that a five-year period for maintaining operations supported by the Structural Funds is already long enough and that there is no reason to extend it."
"This period should be tied to the objective of investment for which resources have been earmarked, and should not exceed the real life of the project and its scope."
"It is wrong to prevent entrepreneurs who want to move to where they have a cheaper, better educated and perhaps better quality workforce."
"It is also not possible to hold back national governments from trying to attract foreign investment, just as it is impossible to dictate to Member States the level at which they are to collect direct taxes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we attempt to suppress this trend, it will lead to indolence and waste in the EU economy."
"This is about the free market, and the principles of the free market would trickle away in the face of more stringent regulations on company relocations."
"As far as relocations are concerned, we should in my view concentrate on company relocations outside the EU, which are the real nightmare scenario."
"– Mr President, more and more entrepreneurs are enticed eastwards by the prospect of low payroll costs and what appear to be better production conditions, and, since such a relocation costs a great deal of money, it is understandable that they want this decision to earn them funding from the EU."
"To date, this has mainly affected the sectors that are labour-intensive and need little technology."
"There is now evidence of an increasing tendency for research and technology to do likewise, and so now, of course, we can no longer shut our ears to the sound of alarm bells going off."
"It must be dawning on even the most optimistic among us that the multinationals do not care whether they exploit the environment, force small and medium-sized businesses into bankruptcy, or leave mass unemployment in their wake."
"EU funds and national aid can do no more to change that fact than can guarantees of seven-year permanence that are scarcely worth the paper they are written on."
"Whether Member States should be in solidarity or competition with each other is no longer the issue."
"What is now at stake is the mere survival of our European economy, which is made up of more than just big businesses, whose various relocations we are supposed to fund, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises, that are equally in need of promotion and support, and have been waiting for it for too long."
"Mr President, the text of the resolution we are to vote on has been the subject of difficult concessions and compromises."
"Nonetheless, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a couple of important issues in the course of this debate."
"Firstly, the text rightly points out the danger of inappropriate use of European funds if they are used in order to transfer production, when the funds are linked to structural intervention areas in a specific region."
"In a sense, therefore, the funds are linked to that region."
"Secondly, the text is interventionist in nature and amounts to a set of preventive or repressive proposals."
"Thirdly, in this text relocation is perceived as a real threat, even though the references are only to potentially negative consequences."
"Only at the start of the resolution is it stated that there can be many reasons for relocation, and that these might be linked to efficiency and profitability."
"Thereafter, the focus is exclusively on negative mechanisms."
"The text makes only a brief mention of the difference between internal and external relocation, and does not pay sufficient attention to the promotion of positive mechanisms that would encourage investors to remain in the EU."
"The text also fails to distinguish between smaller and larger enterprises in the various categories, which is the case for public aid."
"In future, texts of this nature should be accompanied by detailed economic analyses highlighting economic conditions and the duration of the production cycle."
"Mr President, the phenomenon of relocation worries the European Union as a whole but, more specifically, the old Member States."
"Moreover, we know the reasons why, as they have been pointed out by our fellow Members: economic globalisation, distortions of competition both in social and in fiscal terms and so on."
"It is clear that this issue has had an unquestionable influence on the recent constitutional debate, and we, in our country – France – are aware of the consequences."
"This report is therefore very timely, and I, for my part, should like to pay tribute to the work done by our rapporteur, as well as to the improvements made by the Committee on Regional Development."
"We now have a balanced text."
"It can genuinely enhance the measures designed to combat relocations and to prevent the negative effects that they may have."
"I, for my part, should like to emphasise a particular point, and we are clearly talking here about regional development: the report stresses the importance of properly using the Structural Funds in order to prevent the risk of short-, medium- and long-term relocations."
"We are mainly concerned here with the aid granted directly to those economic sectors in need of support, but it is clear that one crucial factor in danger of inducing companies to relocate has to do with the isolated location and poor accessibility of production units."
"It is therefore important that the new generation of Structural Funds allocated to competitiveness and employment gives priority to, among other areas, improving the accessibility of regions that are at a significant disadvantage in this regard."
"This would be the best way of ensuring that economic activities continue in these regions."
"I, for my part, hope that, in addition to considering the requests and recommendations contained in the report, the Commission will also welcome this specific appeal, which will most certainly be forthcoming when the new regional development programmes are drafted."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to voice some criticisms of the report before us on relocation in the context of regional development."
"Throughout its history, Europe has been well acquainted with the phenomenon of what is referred to as company relocations."
"We are currently observing it, and it will certainly happen again in the future."
"In short, people and companies look for the best place in which to realise their ideas, services and products, and there is, was and will be nothing wrong with that."
"This is in fact the expression of rational behaviour that lies at the core of European civilisation."
"Fighting against economic rationality is the path of European poverty."
"Since its inception, the EU has been built on room for manoeuvre for the free movement of people, goods, services and capital, and that includes room for manoeuvre for European companies."
"Thanks to that liberalising policy, Western European countries have attained a very high standard of living; not by blocking their markets but precisely because they opened them up."
"This report is proposing the complete opposite, a policy based on fresh barriers against the movement of capital, and that is something I cannot accept under any circumstances."
"The issue of European aid versus the free movement of capital within the EU really exists."
"The solution, however, is not to tighten the conditions for granting aid to businesses or to tie aid to the place in which the company operates."
"What we need instead is to put a definitive stop to European aid for businesses."
"Such investment has no economic justification and will only lead to the distortion of the European market."
"If the Commission is under the impression that ‘relocation’ poses a problem, it should pay much greater attention to improving conditions for entrepreneurs and businesses."
"It should think carefully whether businesses are not being driven out of Europe by the Commission’s own over-regulation."
"In my view, this is certainly what is happening at the moment."
"The European legislative burden is too great and should be cut back at the earliest opportunity."
"We will then see a flood of companies entering the EU and the growth of employment in the EU."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the framework conditions for European structural policy are undergoing dramatic change; globalisation is accelerating structural change, and businesses are facing ever-tougher competition."
"While the global market economy continues its triumphant progress, the choice of potential production sites increases."
"The logical consequence of this is that locations change with ever-greater speed, and that is when industry acts, with new sites opening up new markets in which it can sell its products, and the pressure of cost forcing it to move to countries where costs are lower – not only within the European Union but also to Asia or to Ukraine."
"These business relocations are happening; they are a normal outward sign of structural change, and the EU should put no legal obstacles in their way."
"It is, however, no less clear that we cannot subsidise things that were decided long ago as a matter of business policy."
"No entrepreneur will move to another location just for the sake of a single grant; he will do it only if the long-term conditions in the new location are right, and that is why these relocation subsidies result in steering effects, which are precisely what we have to prevent in future, for European structural funds are too valuable for that."
"There is another argument against helping firms to relocate."
"It does have an effect on people’s acceptance of the European idea if workers in a place from which a company has moved see their taxes used to pay for their jobs to go somewhere else."
"We find it regrettable that both the Commission and the German Social Democrats deny that this sort of relocation support is going on."
"It is of course the case that European regional support gives incentives for these unnecessary steering effects."
"The simple reason why so few examples are known about is that the threshold for them to be reported is set far too high."
"We therefore call on the Commission to at last take seriously the suggestions from this House and from the Council of Ministers."
"What we are demanding is a regulation, enforceable at law, which would once and for all make it impossible for European funds to be wasted so pointlessly."
". Mr President, I thank both you and the members of the European Parliament for your very positive interventions."
"The European Commission recognises and endorses the fact that the problem of relocation and the loss of the relevant jobs is a seriously worrying issue."
"The Commission, in agreement with the Member States, made it clear at the last summit at Hampton Court that social protection and the protection of workers' rights are an integral part of European values."
"In a global environment, every undertaking takes the final decision to locate or relocate its business activities in an independent manner."
"This sort of decision is determined by numerous factors."
"For example, according to the information available, it would appear that a decisive factor is often whether or not there is specialised labour available, the possibility of accessing various infrastructures and the level of administrative, bureaucratic formalities."
"The proper functioning of the internal market allows companies to adapt their productive process to the opportunities available on each occasion."
"This dynamic aspect of the internal market results in long-term benefits for all regions."
"As I stressed earlier in my opening speech, the Commission has proposed and applied measures designed to restrict any use of the Structural Funds for purposes unconnected with the sustainable development of each area."
"In addition, the Commission is proposing to create a fund for adapting to globalisation, a proposal supported by the European Council last December."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that the Commission is encouraging better collation of the relevant statistics and the drafting of additional studies into the benefits and cost of relocation."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"We must always remember the objectives of regional development policy: economic, social and territorial cohesion, full employment and social progress."
"Within the Union, the free movement of goods, capital and persons is enshrined by the EC Treaty, and it is therefore difficult to support a complete ban on the choice of where one establishes one’s own place of business, all the more so since such a ban would lead to an immobilisation that would be detrimental for the European economy."
"The economic and social cohesion policy is crucial for safeguarding the citizens’ approval and support of the European Union."
"The policy is based on the harmonious and unified development of all the regions of Europe."
"To make good the economic and social development gaps in some regions by promoting methods that could cause a lack of development in other regions of Europe would therefore run counter to such an objective."
"Relocation processes such as these do not correspond to an overall increase in investments on a European scale, but merely to the re-allocation of these investments in order to gain, as the explanation goes, a temporary cost advantage."
"For this reason, businesses that are based in a Member State and that decide to relocate their activities to another Member State should be unable to take advantage of contributions from the Structural Funds."
"The next item is the debate on an oral question to the Commission on the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City (16 to 22 March 2006) by Roberto Musacchio, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Caroline Lucas and Alain Lipietz, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Glyn Ford, Giovanni Berlinguer and Béatrice Patrie, on behalf of the PSE Group (O-0001/2006 – B6-0003/2006)."
". Mr President, the World Water Forum is taking place at a very significant time, because more than two billion of the world’s inhabitants do not have access to drinking water or to sufficient domestic water and more than two million people die every year as a result of a scarcity of water, an element that is fundamental to life."
"Water must be distributed more fairly, but at the same time the quantity of freshwater is falling, year after year, as a result of climate change and the destruction of ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, shores and rivers."
"We must respond with firm and practical measures, with financial commitments, with a world water treaty, promoting a good water culture."
"We need international legislation which allows for more efficient management of water."
"In the European Union, we must apply the framework water Directive in all of our actions, in our cooperation and in bilateral agreements."
"Furthermore, we must promote good agricultural practices."
"We must apply the same European law when we are outside Europe and we must ensure that the quantity of water obtained by complex means through ecosystems and through the fight against climate change is conserved in the medium and long term."
"This cannot be achieved through concrete or through large building schemes alone, but through complex and integral policies."
"."
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: water must be a common asset, a right of humankind guaranteed to every woman and man in every continent."
"We want these binding words to be solemnly approved by this Parliament and to be upheld at the World Water Forum in Mexico City in a few days’ time."
"They are urgent and necessary words in the face of a tragic reality, whereby billions of people are deprived of the right to water and thus to life, to the extent that millions die and fall ill from the consequences of this deprivation."
"Wars and conflicts are waged in order to have water, and the very availability of that basic resource is being compromised by the unsatisfactory policies that have reduced it enormously, thus altering its life cycle."
"There are unquestionably those who want to privatise water and to treat it like a commodity that is only given to people who can pay for it."
"That is as good as privatising air and only letting people breathe if they have money."
"Now is the time for some tough decisions that must ensure that Europe is the exponent of equitable policies and is not party to the assault of the multinationals."
"In Johannesburg, it was not felt that water should be written down as a right, but merely as a need."
"In Mexico City, at a Conference that we should like the UN, rather than other bodies, to be far more responsible for directly overseeing, this right must be solemnly enshrined: those who are calling for the right to water find themselves denied the right to life, in so many continents, beginning with the African continent."
"Let us not disappoint them; let us see to it that this Parliament projects a voice of hope and makes a practical commitment."
"Mr President, the World Water Forum is an international platform which provides an opportunity to exchange views and experiences on the best possible ways of managing water and combating the problem of water shortages."
"The fourth meeting of this Forum, which will be held in Mexico City at the end of this month, will focus on actions which can be taken at local level in order to meet the global challenge of water shortages."
"The objective is to discuss ideas for better support of local actions on a global scale."
"The results of these discussions will constitute a material contribution to the special water and sanitation issues section of the 16th meeting of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in 2008."
"No new political initiatives or decisions are expected to be taken at the 4th World Water Forum."
"The European Commission and the Member States will not therefore be called upon to adopt new positions."
"Consequently, the Commission will not need a negotiating mandate in order to take part in this specific exchange of opinions."
"Although representatives of the Commission and the Member States will be present in Mexico City, there will be no official accredited European Union delegation at the event in question."
"The Commission's objective at the 4th World Water Forum is to highlight and promote policies and means agreed between the European Union and other interested parties, such as the European Union water initiative, the ACP-EU water facility and numerous aspects of the Agenda 21 action plan."
"In addition, the Commission will provide information on the results of the innovative water technologies of the Community framework research programme and the results of the review of integrated water resource management works."
"As far as water management and the internal market are concerned, the Commission may, if it appears necessary, explain the position of the European Union, by which I mean that the current rules in the European Union are neutral on the question of the ownership of water and water companies."
"The Commission considers that a regular supply of drinking water is, as the rapporteur also said earlier, a basic humanitarian need and that the policies applied for sustainable development must address the problem of the equitable and sustainable management of water resources in the interests of the whole of society."
"This stance is also reflected in the European Union water initiative."
"At the stage we are at today, the question of whether there needs to be an international agreement on safeguarding a constant supply of water to all areas of the planet still remains open."
"In all events, the World Water Forum is not the appropriate platform for such a debate."
". Mr President, aid from the European Union and the Member States to improve the world’s water situation totals EUR 1.4 billion a year, which makes us the biggest single contributor of aid."
"Considering how large this sum is, it is clear that the EU’s message will also be heard at the World Water Forum starting this week, and that the Union’s message is therefore not insignificant."
"The figures are alarming: 3 900 children die every day because of a lack of clean water."
"One fifth of the world’s population, some 1.1 billion people, suffer from a lack of clean water."
"More than 40%, meanwhile, are without proper water and sewage services."
"The figures are also a reminder that talk of looming water wars must actually be taken seriously."
"This is not just a matter of unsustainable development: it also has to do with a threat to security."
"The report by the UN which was published last week, entitled ‘Water: A Shared Responsibility’, says that the reason for the unsatisfactory situation in the world with regard to water is largely poor administration."
"Aid reaches its destination more slowly because of bureaucracy and hierarchical decision-making."
"Decisions regarding how and when water should be distributed, and to whom, are not just made at national level, but also by local authorities, in the private sector and within the domain of civil society."
"Aid is needed in particular in order to increase regional decision-making and cooperation, and in a spirit of fairness."
"The issue is surely not helped by the fact that many of those countries suffering a serious water shortage are also high up on the corruption list."
"For example, in India millions of dollars are wasted every year in the water sector on political corruption, according to Hindu.com."
"Nearly a third of Indians who replied to a survey say they have had to pay bribes to receive water and sewage services."
"I would also like to remind everyone that improvements to the regional water situation cannot be separated from other areas of development policy."
"Recently, studies have been published showing that merely solving the water problem could even make the situation as a whole worse if it causes population growth to accelerate, which would lead to food shortages."
"Simply building a well is therefore not enough."
"In all development aid we have to take the overall view so that solving one problem does not lead to new shortages, which we obviously do not want."
". Mr President, the World Water Forums represent a unique opportunity to bring together all those groups in the world that are involved with water, be they official agencies, development banks, states, professional organisations, NGOs or local authorities."
"These meetings make it possible to define a fairer and more unified world water policy and to ensure that people’s right to water is upheld as a crucial element of human dignity."
"The organisations have chosen to steer the debates in Mexico City by establishing ‘Local Actions for a Global Challenge’ as the main theme of this forum."
"The aim is to make local authorities the central actors with regard to water management."
"In order for this to happen, developing countries must be encouraged to delegate the budgetary resources and the management of water policy to their local authorities."
"Water policy should always be developed on the basis of the specific nature of the terrain and by taking account, as far as possible, of the users’ needs."
"Parliament’s resolution calls on the Commission to do more to acknowledge and make use of the fantastic level of human resource and financial expertise present in Europe’s local authorities."
"With a wealth of successful experiences and technical skills behind them, the towns of the North are keen to help their counterparts in developing countries."
"In order to facilitate these cooperation operations that are decentralised from town to town, the Commission is requested to encourage and prioritise the funding of projects presented by towns of the North."
"As far as the allocation of resources from the European Water Fund is concerned, the Commission could, in particular, restrict eligibility to receive these funds to those operators best placed to help the authorities of the South."
"The results of the first call for proposals by the ACP-EU Water Fund show that scarcely 3% of the projects accepted were projects presented by local authorities."
"That is highly unsatisfactory given the added value that local authorities provide in this area."
". Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the role of the ACP-EU water facility to which the Commissioner has referred."
"It has also been discussed recently in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Social and Environmental Affairs Committee."
"I welcome the decision by the ACP-EU Council to launch the EUR 500 million water facility in 2004, but there has been a lot of disappointment because of the slowness with which the initiative was implemented."
"Indeed, the claim has been made that not one person has yet received clean drinking water under the ACP-EU initiative."
"It is important that due regard be given to process and that high standards of administrative probity are adhered to, especially with so much money involved, but the final evaluation of proposals took place in January this year and 97 proposals were at last selected."
"So I would like to know whether we are now on course to provide 10 million more people with access to drinking water by 2010 as planned and, when it comes to the second call for proposals, whether the process will take less time to complete."
"Mr President, 1.2 billion people have no access to drinking water, and so 15 people die in the world every minute, half of whom are children."
"We are therefore involved in a real race against the clock."
"That is why the World Forum must put forward three kinds of proposal."
"Firstly, the question of rights."
"Water belongs to all of humankind, and having access to water is a fundamental right of human beings."
"This right must be established by an international treaty."
"Next, the question of resources: to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without access to water is an ambitious target."
"An extra USD 100 billion needs to be found each year."
"For that to happen, we need to harness all of our resources by increasing official development assistance (ODA) and the resources allocated to the tenth EDF and by obtaining the support of innovative partners in the public and private sector or of operations designed to exchange debts for investment."
"Lastly, the question of management."
"Water policies must be developed using a participative and democratic approach that embraces users, civil societies and the role of women and be managed at local level, accompanied by the implementation of pricing policies that guarantee the most underprivileged citizens access to water at affordable prices."
"I hope that the Commission will champion these guidelines at the World Forum in Mexico City."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, you said that no new positions will be taken up at the Fourth World Water Forum."
"What is clear is that you will have a lot of work to do."
"You described the right to have access to water as a human right, but that is precisely what the disputes were about at the last Water Forum."
"The cause of conflict at it was an argument about whether the availability of clean water was a human right that had to be guaranteed by the State, or whether it was a need that should be met by the market."
"Despite massive protests by the campaigners present, the ministers at the forum refused to say anything in their final statement about access to water being a right."
"I wish you much success in getting its status as a human right recognised in Mexico City."
"As for the forthcoming World Water Forum itself, we will also have to consider what democratic legitimacy it possesses."
"It is organised by the World Water Council, which is largely dominated by private industry and businesses."
"Since its chairman is the head of a subsidiary of French water companies, we must of course ask ourselves to what degree it is influenced by the industry and just how useful are the solutions that may emerge from it."
"What I would like to see – perhaps at a future meeting of the United Nations, which would have the appropriate democratic legitimacy – is debates held without the massive influence of the companies that are making themselves rich from water supply and drainage in many countries around the world."
"Mr President, the debate demonstrated that we have the same views on the World Water Forum on numerous counts and I hope that the Commission will benefit from taking part in the discussion at which, as I said earlier, we do not expect decisions to be taken, whether or not they are necessary."
"In all events, no decisions are expected but, of course, there will be a serious discussion and there will be an exchange of views from all over the world on these very important issues, the significance of which you also highlighted."
"In particular, we shall, I hope, be addressing the question of the local actions on which the 4th World Water Forum is concentrating and we expect interesting ideas on water management to be put forward."
"I should like to say that this year we have started financing the first plans and we shall start the second stage of this financing in June."
"We hope and intend that 10 million people will have drinking water in 2010 and 5 million will have access to sanitation services."
"I should like to thank you very much for the interest which you have shown and expressed and I hope that, together, we shall be able, in close cooperation, to promote joint efforts on this very important issue to mankind."
"I have received six motions for resolution(1) tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"The next item is the report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies (COM(2005)0113 – C6- 0181/2005 – 2005/0052(CNS)) (A6-0027/2006)."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for the truly excellent report which we are debating today."
"The objective of the Commission proposal to establish a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies is to safeguard a single financing framework for civil protection actions."
"These response and preparedness actions are currently covered by various financing instruments, such as the action programme or the Community civil protection mechanism."
"However, what is even more important is the fact that the proposed financing instrument takes account of the calls by the European Parliament and of the Council for the strengthening of the response capacity in the civil protection sector in Europe."
"The basis for the further development of cooperation in the civil protection sector is through strengthening the work already carried out and through launching new actions."
"Two innovations need to be highlighted here: firstly, we are proposing to finance the cost of moving assistance within the framework of civil protection."
"On numerous occasions we face situations in which the assistance was available but there were no means for moving it to the scene of the emergency."
"As a result the assistance was either not provided at all or was provided late."
"That is why the Commission is proposing that the European Commission be given the facility to hire the necessary means of transport either from third countries or from private companies."
"There is a similar problem with civil protection equipment: in the case of emergencies which affect several European countries at once, such as forest fires in the summer or floods in spring or even simultaneous threats of terrorist action throughout Europe, the Member States may face difficulties in providing assistance to another Member State due to the need to address their own requirements."
"In such cases, the Community must be in a position to provide assistance to the Member States affected."
"Thus, the Commission is proposing to establish a backup financing network at Community level which will allow additional equipment to be hired."
"Ambitious but necessary reforms, such as those we are debating today, obviously require important financial resources and, to quote Demosthenes, 'money is the root of everything'."
"The Commission is certain that the European Parliament understands, as the report we are debating today illustrates, the importance of the benefit which derives from these reforms."
"Reinforced cooperation in the civil protection sector will result in better protection for the citizens of the European Union and the populations of third countries."
"This is the only way to ensure that the Community will be able to provide more coordinated, more effective and more prompt assistance to any country affected by a major emergency."
". – Mr President, I agree with Mr Dimas that we need to do more in order to make the way in which the European Union addresses extensive natural disasters, both those which affect Europe itself, such as floods, drought or fires, and other natural disasters beyond our borders, such as the tsunami or the hurricane in Mississippi and Louisiana, stronger and more effective."
"What we want, therefore, is to do more and to do better all together."
"If we succeed and respond to the demand by European citizens for improvements to their safety and quality of life, we can also achieve economies of scale, because a more effective European mechanism can result in savings in the resources of each Member State individually."
"I should like to point out that the challenge before us is to set up an effective civil protection mechanism."
"If we are to succeed in this, we need, apart from what Demosthenes rightly spoke about two and half thousand years ago, for the Council to agree as well."
"The Council must increase the resources available."
"The Commission and the Council agree that we also need to be able to find ways of strengthening assistance for addressing emergencies outside the borders of the European Union."
"Consequently, we also need to finance this facility and, if we make more and better perspicacious investments in strengthening our cooperation now, we can also avoid large losses of human life and painful damage to property which will cost a great deal more to the Union budget to address at a later date."
"I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for the excellent cooperation which we had within the framework of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and which resulted in my report and certain amendments to the Commission's initial proposal being approved almost unanimously, by 49 votes in favour and just one against."
"My amendments, which were adopted by the Committee on the Environment and are included in the report, focus on four main points:"
"The first point is the change to the legal basis, which will allow the European Parliament to put things in the right framework and, most importantly, not to confine itself to a purely advisory role, but to be involved in the codecision procedure, so that this institution, which is closer to the European citizens, will then also have the facility to exert greater influence on decision-making."
"The second change is the inclusion of prevention in the scope of the instrument."
"It goes without saying that the integrated management of situations caused by natural disasters must include, in addition to preparedness and rapid response measures, investment in prevention."
"Prevention is one of the pillars for addressing the problem and I am delighted that, on this issue, we have the same perception as both the Commission and the Council."
"This also applies to the third point, to the need to extend this instrument and its action to countries outside the European Union, because natural disasters do not recognise borders."
"The fourth proposed amendment is to include public health in the scope of the instrument, which is especially important at a time when there is a serious danger of an avian influenza pandemic."
"To close, I should like us to use tomorrow's vote to send, with the same assent we had in the Committee on the Environment, a clear message both to the European citizens and to the Council, as we have also done in the past with a series of motions on natural and manmade disasters."
"This message is necessary, because it will help us to achieve cooperation between the three institutions, so that we can quickly achieve a positive result."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from what Mr Papadimoulis said with regard to the additions that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety made to the Commission proposal through the principle of extending the scope of the regulation to include marine pollution, I should like to add that there are currently no other specific instruments designed to manage the consequences resulting from marine disasters."
"Having expressed all but unanimous support for the work done by Mr Papadimoulis, the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety approved other specific amendments that I tabled, including the centrality of environmental issues in the management of disasters."
"The Commission has been asked to ensure, within the scope of the various Community mechanisms and instruments in the field of civil protection, that greater attention is paid to those regions that are isolated and more remote due to geographical, territorial and socio-economic characteristics and to integrate civil protection measures into teaching modules and communication and information campaigns with a view to increasing awareness of the need to prevent, prepare for, and respond rapidly to, major emergencies and to guaranteeing the involvement of civil society in prevention and response measures."
"In other words, we need to focus on young people and on education in schools."
"A final important amendment was approved by the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, namely the one designed to raise the profile of voluntary work, whether done by groups or individual citizens, since volunteers can provide vital services in the absence of the emergency services, which may be delayed in the wake of a major catastrophe."
"I believe that, with these proposals, the regulation adopts a far broader outlook in terms of the management of major emergencies."
"Mr President, thank you, Mr Papadimoulis, for your thorough work on this report."
"We live at a time when disasters seem to be becoming ever more common."
"A few years ago, Iran was hit by a terrible and disastrous earthquake."
"I remember the event very clearly because, every day, I could see from the television that the Iranians were receiving no help in digging the survivors out of the ruins."
"Just over a year ago, South-East Asia was hit by the disastrous tsunami that also dealt a severe blow to my own country."
"There are reports from that disaster of how certain EU Member States rescued their own citizens but left other people to their fate."
"What is, in any case, clear is that the rescue efforts would have been more successful if there had been better EU cooperation."
"It is also true that aid could have been provided more efficiently on those occasions that the EU Member States have been hit by, for example, major floods and forest fires. Moreover, this type of disaster will presumably become more common as climate change progresses."
"That is why this instrument is extremely important."
"We Social Democrats have particularly emphasised the need for this instrument to operate both within and outside the EU, partly in view of the fact that our own citizens are often outside the EU but, above all, out of solidarity with other people."
"We also think it extremely important for the EU also to cooperate with the UN – its natural partner – in this area."
"We have also tabled an amendment of our own on the budget for this instrument."
"We hope that everyone will be able to support this amendment, because it states the obvious fact that the budget will depend on the outcome of the negotiations concerning the financial perspective."
"We also support the rapporteur when it comes to the legal basis and to extending the instrument so that it also covers disasters affecting public health."
"If we need to set priorities where the ongoing work on the budget is concerned, what will be most important for us Social Democrats are direct efforts and the preparations for these, both within and outside the EU."
". – Mr President, the tragic South Asian tsunami heightened public awareness, for the first time, of the possibility of similar extreme events threatening our homes and livelihoods."
"Although on a lesser scale, just weeks later, a major storm in Carlisle – a town in my constituency – coupled with hurricane winds and high tides produced exceptional rainfall, leading to the overtoppling of defences and flooding of 3 000 homes and hundreds of businesses, drowning two elderly ladies in their beds and forcing thousands of people from their homes, some for many months."
"I felt the devastation in Carlisle as deeply as I felt the aftermath of the tsunami and the earthquake in South Asia some months later."
"The EU suffered personal tragedies in all cases, as our holiday-makers in Sri Lanka and Thailand were washed away and our friends and families in Pakistan and Kashmir were lost in the rubble."
"The positive side of all this was the strengthening of our collective belief in the force of community across the globe, with the outpouring of aid and goodwill from governments and individuals alike."
"In that adversity we saw the best of human nature."
"Yet even the best suffer fatigue and it became clear in November, as the Kashmiris faced a second wave of deaths from disease and exposure, that the donor community cannot be relied upon to respond decisively where political will is lacking."
"The EU's Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument must fill this void and work closely with the UN system to take advantage of our pooled resources and see to it that when our friends need us we come to their aid."
"Given the impact of climate change, we must accept that extreme events will continue, and with increasing frequency."
"In Carlisle we have a new strategy for flood management – making space for water, undertaking integrated urban drainage pilot schemes to investigate how the threat of floods can be better managed."
"Prevention is crucial and environmental concerns such as the sound management of natural resources like forests and wetlands are key tools in the evasion of disasters, lessening their impact on people, homes and livelihoods."
"Whatever prevention strategies are put in place and however much is invested, it is unrealistic to think that these disasters can be eliminated."
"We must learn from them."
"Large sums need to be invested in warning mechanisms, risk maps and public awareness campaigns to ensure our citizens are aware of the risks."
"We must ensure that prevention, detention and warning mechanisms for natural hazards in Europe and across the globe are robust and put our citizens – from Carlisle to Kashmir – in the best position to prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters."
"In this report Parliament has significantly improved the Commission's proposal and it is one that I can fully recommend to this House."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Papadimoulis for his excellent work."
"When talking about the EU’s ability to react to catastrophes, we should remember that in recent decades the number of weather-related disasters has increased, and that it is predicted to rise further as a result of climate change."
"Consequently, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the main way of curtailing the number of destructive floods and storms in the future."
"Every year since 1990, the world has seen at least 20 weather-related events classified as major disasters, a figure which only occurred in three of the previous 20 years."
"Since 1990, according to insurance company statistics, the annual damage due to weather catastrophes has more than doubled and the compensation paid out has quadrupled."
"Researchers say that storms and floods are not only becoming more common, but more powerful too."
"The World Wildlife Fund recently published a study showing that climate change is adding to the number of storms that occur in Europe, mostly around the North Sea, in the British Isles, in the Netherlands and in France."
"The highest wind speeds could increase by as much as 15% by the end of the century."
"Experience shows that in the United Kingdom such a rise in wind speed could increase storm damage by 50%, and in the Netherlands a 6% rise in wind speed could result in damage increasing fivefold, because of the liability of flooding."
"In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we have to understand that climate protection is a crucial factor in reducing the number of weather-related disasters in future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join those who have thanked our fellow MEP, Mr Papadimoulis, and expressed appreciation for his work in drafting this report."
"The European Union has recently experienced an increased number of natural, technological and industrial disasters."
"I agree with, and fully support, the idea of combining efforts to prevent these disasters and to ensure a rapid response in the aftermath."
"Both activities are in fact inseparable, but we can only speak about the prevention of a potential disaster if it can actually be identified before it occurs."
"Many disasters are impossible to predict, and as such there can be no prevention; therefore, we can only deal with the consequences of the disaster."
"I am pleased that my amendments to this report have been accepted."
"The main purpose of the Regulation is to protect people, but it is also necessary to specify the nature of this protection, particularly the protection of public health and security."
"By the same token, it would be appropriate to include, in accordance with the solidarity principle, third countries in this process."
"We must realise that natural, technological, and industrial disasters, as well as terrorist attacks, recognise no borders."
"I would like to point out that it is also essential to protect the financial interests of the Community, and therefore I recommend amending Article 12 of the draft as follows: ‘If a financial aid beneficiary cannot satisfactorily document the use of the aid and, after being urged to do so, cannot demonstrate that the aid has been used in accordance with the Regulation, then there must be clawback provisions in place."
"The Commission must, rather than may, discontinue financial aid and must demand that the funds disbursed be repaid.’"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work."
"It is clear from the outcome of the vote that he has worked with all the groups and has spoken on behalf of the whole House."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for the holistic approach it has taken to this area of responses to crises and the management of natural disasters."
"The crisis response instrument that is under consideration is, after all, but one part of the overall framework with which the European Union is attempting to overcome calamities or find ways of responding to them."
"While I am on this subject, I might also mention that I too am from a region that has suffered from flooding, and that the Commission, last Friday, committed a substantial sum of money to alleviating the consequences of this disaster."
"So let me take this opportunity of saying how grateful I am for European solidarity."
"What is crucial is that we should do as the rapporteur recommends and alter the legal basis."
"I also believe that Article 175 is the right one to use as a means of creating a suitable legal basis for this instrument."
"It also strikes me as essential that the scope be extended to include prevention, civil protection in third countries, and maritime pollution as well."
"What can be said in general terms is that this presents us with an opportunity to respond to the European public’s concerns and questions by providing aid quickly and without bureaucracy."
"This is where the Community really can be made visible, and this instrument should be used to do that."
"It is no use to anybody if the EU expects them to go through complex bureaucratic procedures or points them towards committees that have yet to meet, when what they really need is quick and unbureaucratic help, which would achieve much more than expensive information campaigns that only end up running into the ground."
"I would like to conclude by saying that the French statesman Talleyrand’s dictum about the need for not too much zeal is utterly inappropriate in this context; one cannot be zealous enough when it comes to alleviating the consequences of natural disasters."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"In recent years, as other speakers have mentioned, there has been an increase in the number of natural disasters due to, , climate change, damage to the environment and lack of land-use planning. In order to respond quickly and effectively to serious emergencies, the EU has at its disposal a range of instruments, such as this regulation, which is at the development stage."
"The terrible natural disasters of the summer of 2005 – significant flooding in Central Europe, severe drought in southern Europe and fires destroying thousands of hectares of forest in my country, Portugal, and in Spain – require appropriate and rapid prevention and response measures in the area of civil protection."
"In working meetings with the local, regional and national authorities of the six countries stricken by natural disasters that I visited in my capacity as rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the initiative report on natural disasters, the call was always for simplification and flexibility; in order to help communities, the Community's emergency response instruments need to be simplified and the rules of application made more flexible."
"Stronger European-level coordination and, of course, increased financial support were also recommended."
"Mr President, I thank the members of the European Parliament for their very constructive interventions."
"You have tabled a series of very important amendments which are designed to strengthen civil protection facilities at European level and which concern prevention, the need to safeguard financing for civil protection operations in third countries and effective early warning and alert systems."
"The Commission supports most of the proposed amendments."
"I should like to comment in particular on prevention."
"It is worth noting that its particular aspects, such as the prevention of forest fires or floods, are already covered by special Community financing instruments."
"The Commission wishes to avoid overlaps with existing financing instruments."
"Nonetheless, we recognise the need to strengthen the general aspects of prevention within the framework of civil protection and we therefore gladly include the proposed amendments in the proposed financing instrument."
"However, although the Commission can accept most of the proposed amendments, there are some which cause problems and cannot be accepted as they stand."
"Firstly, the Commission considers that replacing the legal basis with Article 175(1) of the Treaty is not necessary for a civil protection financing instrument."
"As the Treaty has no special legal basis for civil protection, Article 308 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community has always been used for this purpose."
"The existing civil protection financing instruments, the action programme and the Community civil protection mechanism are based on this article."
"In addition, the proposed legal basis refers to environmental protection and public health, whereas civil protection actions also need to cover the protection of people and property, including the cultural heritage."
"As regards the integration of interventions in emergencies outside the European Union into the financing instrument, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament on the need to safeguard this type of financing action."
"The Commission decided to divide the financing of internal Community actions from external actions by adopting separate legal instruments."
"In this way, civil protection actions adopted in the countries participating in the civil protection mechanism are covered by the rapid response financing instrument, while civil protection interventions in third countries will be financed from the instrument for stability."
"In all events, in order for the instrument for stability to constitute a clear basis for the financing of actions of this type outside the European Union, express reference needs to be made in them to civil protection."
"This is the issue on which the Commission's position differs from the European Parliament report."
"However, I should like to stress that these differences of opinion should not overshadow our common objectives, which are very, very important."
"We agree wholeheartedly with the European Parliament's ambition to develop a stronger European facility for civil protection interventions, both within and outside the European Union, and the need for increased financing."
"On this point, I should really like to thank you for your support."
"I would, however, emphasise that, with the existing instruments, with the existing facilities and with the existing competences, civil protection and the mechanism which we have in the European Commission responded very, very well to last year's crises, by which I mean the various fires, for example in Portugal, and the floods in countries such as Bulgaria and Romania."
"We had thirteen such interventions and, of course, the two very big crises in South-East Asia with the tsunami, where the European Union was, through the civil protection mechanism, the first to send representatives to the area. Also, the European Union responded to the destruction caused by hurricane Katrina by providing the assistance which it had proposed three days earlier to the competent authorities in the United States, which is why, of course, we also had the relevant favourable mention from the European Council."
"It is no bad thing for us also to remember and emphasise certain things which happen under – I would stress – the existing facilities."
"Of course, we need, as Mr Papadimoulis's report says, to strengthen civil protection."
"I should like to file the full list with the Commission's positions on the amendments with Parliament's secretariat(1)."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur and all the honourable Members once again for their suggestions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The violence of recent natural disasters reminds us how vulnerable our societies are to risks in nature: in 20 years, natural disasters have killed 1.5 million people worldwide."
"In order to be effective, our handling of this problem must include looking ahead, by means of risk assessment, prevention, education and information for the public."
"The EU has made prevention and emergency aid a top priority, by setting up ECHO in 1992, the Dipecho programme in 1996 and the EU Solidarity fund in 2002."
"In 2005, it also decided to create a European coordination structure that could call on a European body of humanitarian aid volunteers."
"The Commission proposes to set up a new rapid response and preparedness mechanism for major emergencies for the period 2007-2013, and we are of course delighted with that."
"However, the legal basis for this mechanism should be amended to use Article 174, which involves codecision; and the preventative measures should be extended to cover civil protection in third countries and marine pollution."
"Finally, the budget for this mechanism must ensure that emergency aid is as effective as possible, in terms of both flexibility and responsiveness, and must increase the visibility of Community solidarity within and outside the EU."
"I am pleased to say that there are 52 amendments which the Commission can support fully, in part, or in principle."
"These are amendments 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73 and 75."
"The Commission cannot accept amendments 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 35, 42, 46, 53, 54, 63, 64, 65, 71, 72 and 74."
"The next item is the report by Marios Matsakis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Community strategy concerning mercury (2005/2050(INI)) (A6-0044/2006)."
". – Mr President, firstly, I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the very constructive cooperation afforded to me in the preparation of this report."
"I also thank all those who submitted amendments and are contributing to the debate on the subject-matter of this strategy document."
"Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans and wildlife."
"After mercury changes in the environment to methylmercury, the most toxic form, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and can cause severe neuronal damage."
"It also speedily crosses the placental barrier and can therefore affect foetal neural development."
"Mercury poses a global threat as it travels long distances through the atmosphere, crossing national boundaries and contaminating European and global food supplies at levels posing a significant risk to human health."
"As the EU is the largest mercury exporter in the world, EU leadership in dealing with global mercury hazards is, therefore, clearly an economic, political and moral imperative."
"EU action, as well as international commitment, is necessary for the protection of human health and the environment."
"The Community strategy concerning mercury, with its integral approach is, therefore, an important contribution in tackling this global threat."
"In broad terms, the report welcomes the Commission communication and emphasises the overall approach taken, with the objective being to reduce and eventually phase out emission and supply of and demand for mercury at European level, as well as to manage the surpluses of mercury and to protect against exposure."
"In particular, the strategy deals with matters such as: implementing an effective export ban and safe storage; introducing emission limit values for mercury from combustion plants, and other related activities; banning mercury in measuring and control equipment where possible; collecting and treating mercury waste; ensuring the provision of sufficient information and the monitoring of vulnerable population groups; and supporting and promoting international concerted action for dealing with the mercury threat."
"Of note is the recommendation to achieve a ban, where an appropriate and safer alternative exists, in the use of mercury in the manufacture of vaccines."
"Also of note is the exemption from the strategy of instruments of historical importance."
"With regard to the 13 final amendments before you, I would support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12."
"Of special significance, I feel, is Amendment No. 10, which essentially reintroduces my original Article 17 on dental amalgams."
"On that issue I wish to say the following."
"Article 17 basically asks the Commission to put forward proposals by the end of 2007 to restrict – not to ban immediately – the use of mercury in dental amalgams."
"The reason is that it is quite unacceptable, in my view, to continue inserting such a potentially toxic substance in people's mouths when safer alternatives exist."
"In fact, many dentists – my own included – have long since stopped using mercury-containing amalgams, as the more modern alternatives – the white-coloured amalgams – are safer, more aesthetic and cost the same."
"So, I urge you to vote positively on Amendment No. 10."
"Once again, I thank all those who have contributed to the work on this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation for the very good job done in the report we are debating today."
"In particular, I should like to thank Mr Matsakis for his exceptionally constructive and substantial contribution to it."
"I should like to comment briefly on the basic purpose and the objectives of the strategy concerning mercury."
"The basic purpose of the strategy is to reduce mercury levels in the environment and man's exposure to mercury, especially methylmercury contained in fish."
"Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to man, ecosystems and wild birds."
"High doses can prove to be fatal to man and, even in relatively limited doses, may have serious repercussions on human health."
"The strategy has the following six objectives: to reduce mercury emissions, to reduce the available quantities of mercury by cutting the relative supply and demand, to resolve the long-term problem of limiting surpluses and stocks of mercury in products which are still in use or have been stored in recent years, to protect against mercury exposure, to improve understanding of the problems caused by mercury and its unavoidable uses and to support and promote international action to address the question of mercury."
"Over recent decades, numerous actions have been taken at Community level to address the problem of mercury and reduce emissions and uses of and exposure to it."
"At the same time, this and everything we have done to date is not enough."
"A great deal more needs to be done."
"At the strategy preparation stage, the Commission paid particular attention to identifying the most important aspects of the mercury problem which continue to exist and the sectors in which it would be possible for further action to be taken on the part of the European Union."
"The main sectors examined and for which action is proposed in the short term are as follows: the supply of mercury to the market and mercury exports, mercury surpluses from the chlor-alkali industry, the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment and mercury emissions from coal burning."
"We should not forget that it will take decades to completely wipe out the problem of mercury."
"Today's levels are due to past mercury emissions and it will take time for these levels to stabilise, even if there are no new mercury emissions."
"I should also like to emphasise the importance which joint international action has, of course, with the initiatives being taken at European Union level."
"Mercury is a global pollutant and the Commission intends to organise an international conference in Brussels on 26 and 27 October of this year in order to strengthen the momentum which exists on the international field as regards addressing this issue."
"To close, I would like to thank Mr Matsakis and Parliament as a whole once again for their work and to repeat my promise to help shape even stricter European Union policies for better protection of health and the environment."
". – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Matsakis for all the work he has done on this report."
"The outcome of the votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is a report that is the first step towards a coherent approach being taken towards mercury and the ultimate reduction of mercury levels in the environment."
"That is a tribute to the work that Mr Matsakis has done."
"The PPE-DE Group has tabled two amendments to the report that was adopted in committee."
"One of those amendments – that concerning traditional measuring instrumentation, such as barometers – would allow the extremely small number of people in the EU who repair, maintain and recycle barometers to continue to operate under very strictly controlled conditions."
"A ban would see the end of the tradition of barometer-making and craftsmanship, which began over 400 years ago when mercury barometers were first introduced."
"If those businesses are forced to close, people will be unable to have their instruments properly repaired and they will potentially dispose of them straight into household waste, which would be in nobody's interests."
"I am, however, completely in favour of legislation to protect the public from the highly toxic substance that mercury is, but the approach that we should take on environmental issues must be proportionate and it must be balanced."
"A complete ban, in my view, would be a disproportionate response."
"Barometers are made by only a small group of people in Europe and those operators, who have an extremely good and safe working understanding of mercury and all the hazards it represents, are best placed to help reduce that pollution."
"Appropriate product safety warnings and the licensing of suitable establishments would enable the usage of mercury to be controlled and monitored and people could continue to use their barometers, as they have for centuries, without a threat to the environment or to health."
"The second amendment concerns mercury-cell chlor-alkali plants."
"I believe my colleagues will speak about those later on."
". Mr President, we share your objectives, Mr Matsakis: both the elimination of mercury emissions at European level and the ban on exports of mercury which, like its compounds, is highly toxic for human beings and the environment, as other speakers have pointed out."
"Although the European Union is the world’s main mercury exporter and a ban on its export will make a considerable contribution to curbing the trade and reducing world surpluses of this metal, I would appeal to the Council to ensure that the European Union continues to participate in international fora and activities, makes bilateral commitments and implements projects with third countries, particularly in the field of the transfer of technology, in order to deal with the problem of mercury pollution."
"In this context, binding legal measures should be adopted at international level."
"I would also call upon the Commission to increase awareness amongst the population, organising information campaigns on the health risks of exposure to mercury and the environmental problems caused by it, since I fear that citizens are not yet sufficiently aware of its toxicity."
"Another issue that worries me in particular is the use of mercury in the form of thiomersal in vaccines, since it could be harmful to human health, and we should therefore bear in mind that countries such as Denmark have not been using it in vaccines for children since 1992."
"I am delighted that the Council’s conclusions recognise the environmental and social problems resulting from the closure of the mercury mines that have been operating for a long time in Almadén, as well as the possibility of using these Almadén mines for the safe storage of the existing metallic mercury stocks or metallic mercury sub-produced by industry all over Europe, but never its waste, thus making use of the infrastructures, local manpower and technological expertise existing there."
"It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur and all of the shadow rapporteurs, because their work has been truly excellent."
"I wish to thank Mr Matsakis for his exemplary work as rapporteur."
"As long ago as 1990, when the PARCOM Agreement was concluded, it was agreed that the chlor-alkali industry should phase out mercury by 2010."
"Now, we must bring about an export ban that enters into force before this."
"Otherwise, the chlor-alkali industry, which has the largest stocks of mercury in Europe, will export huge quantities of it."
"It is important to have an export ban before 2010."
"We talk about safety where deposits are concerned, but the second most extensive use of mercury today is ten centimetres from our brains."
"I was given my first amalgam-free filling 21 years ago, and it is still there."
"It is of fantastically high quality."
"A mere 0.05% of Swedish children’s and young people’s fillings now contain amalgam, while the corresponding figure for adults is two percent."
"Moreover, the figures are falling all the time."
"The Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate has shown that it is mainly for reasons connected with the environment and public health that we must do away with mercury, for which there are sound alternatives."
"You can see how three quarters of mercury discharges stem from amalgam, with the majority of them originating in dental clinics."
"This means that amalgam fillings account for by far the largest portion of discharges of mercury into our sewers."
"I therefore call on you to vote in favour of my Amendment 10 in order to get rid of these problems."
"Thank you again, Mr Matsakis, for your constructive work."
"– Mr President, first of all I wish to express our congratulations and thanks to Mr Matsakis for his report; he made a serious effort to incorporate the views of all the honourable Members in the motion for a resolution."
"Despite the positive elements of the document, we are of the view that the Community strategy concerning mercury could and should have been strengthened further."
"We are of the view that a ban on mercury exports from European Union countries should be brought into force by no later than 2008 and not 2010, as supported by the majority in committee."
"At the same time, we would stress the importance of establishing a stricter regime on exemptions from the aforementioned ban."
"To be specific, exemptions should only be allowed if there is no suitable alternative solution."
"Finally, we support the fact that the EU should also help developing countries to wipe out mercury by offering not only technical but also financial assistance."
"– Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on deciding to eliminate mercury."
"That decision is long overdue."
"We have known that mercury is dangerous for a long time."
"I want to congratulate Mr Matsakis on an excellent report that goes further than the Commission, especially in identifying for the Commission one of the most dangerous uses of mercury today: thermerasol – mercury directly injected in commonly-used medications such as flu vaccines."
"Since removing mercury from paediatric vaccines in California, cases of autism are continuing to increase."
"However, for the first time in over 20 years the rate of increase has significantly slowed down."
"Commissioner, please ensure that, if there is an avian flu jab, it will be mercury-free."
"There is one more source of mercury that I would ask you to eliminate."
"The Irish Government pollutes the Irish water supply with hexafluorosilic acid, a waste product of the artificial fertiliser industry which, in addition to mercury, contains other toxins such as lead, arsenic, beryllium, vanadium, cadmium, radionuclides and silicone."
"Please tackle that."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Matsakis for his good, constructive and frank cooperation on this report, which is by way of preparation for legislation, so that we are pointing the way forward whilst not yet taking any final decisions."
"The legislative measures must follow later."
"It has by now become a matter of common knowledge that mercury is highly toxic, and that is of course reason enough why it needs to be taken out of circulation."
"So, then, by aiming for an export ban from 2010 onwards and for the secure storage of mercury that has been taken out of circulation, we are sending the first vital indications of the direction in which we need to go."
"It is already evident that the principle of substitution applies here, and that is made all the more important by the fact that mercury is not bio-degradable and so it is permanently in circulation; every single microgram of it will keep on coming back to human beings through the food chain."
"People living by the sea who frequently eat fish already have in their tissues concentrations of mercury in excess of the permissible threshold values."
"Unfortunate though it is that nothing can at present be done to change that, and that no direct consequences result from it, it does, in terms of environmental medicine, indicate the need for an absolute ban."
"As things currently stand, I am also less than satisfied with the wording relating to dental amalgam, which remains strongly suspected of playing a part in a range of conditions, of which I shall cite as examples immune deficiencies, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and damage to the unborn child in the womb."
"Even if the experts have not yet arrived at their final judgment on this, I see the tendency and the risk as being beyond doubt, so what is needed above all else is prevention and care before we think about experimenting on live subjects."
"I will not be recommending amalgam and mercury products to the people and patients entrusted to my care and will do my utmost to ensure that mercury is taken out of circulation – as far as possible and as soon as possible."
". – Mr President, generally speaking, I agree with Mr Matsakis and his excellent report."
"All of my amendments were accepted by the committee."
"I should like to briefly underline their content."
"Public information is crucial in this case."
"Everybody should understand the health and environmental risks of mercury."
"As pollution does not stop at borders, we must also urge our neighbouring countries to implement our strict mercury policy."
"The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is a primary tool to encourage those countries to take the right action in the field of the environment."
"The same goes for the labelling of gold that has been mined without using mercury, both inside and outside the European Union."
"Last but not least, I call upon the European Union to be cautious about dental amalgam."
"The real risk should be avoided, but we have to allow more time for research and consideration of the scientific facts."
"I believe that at this moment in time a total ban would be too radical a step."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Matsakis and the shadow rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"Mercury is a toxic element which has a negative impact on health, and the Commission is therefore proposing its safe storage and, at the same time, a reduction in its use and an end to the trade in it, but, as point 9 of the Communication states quite rightly, there are many gaps in our knowledge of its effects on human health, of how it is disseminated and accumulated in the environment, of its toxicity and of the sensitivity of ecosystems."
"I believe that it is important and should be a priority that all of these issues be investigated and that decisions be taken on a scientific basis and not on the basis of mere suppositions, which are sometimes alarmist and which have been exaggerated by the media."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, the only region in Europe that produces mercury, although its mines are already closed, is Almadén."
"This region was very prosperous, thanks to the mercury that it has extracted from its mines since Roman times, but it is now depressed, also as a result of mercury."
"It must therefore be compensated by means of specific support, measures and infrastructures which can partially alleviate the effects of the measures taken."
"It is there that, amongst other things, the safe storage of the liquid mercury that is going to be withdrawn from the market must take place."
"The chloroalkaline industry has signed an agreement to put an end to the use of mercury completely by 2020."
"This agreement must be respected and compliance with it monitored."
"Out of interest, I simply wished to say that I have lived in the region of Almadén, that I have held mercury in my hands on many occasions, that I have had mercury dental amalgams, which I no longer have for aesthetic reasons, and I can assure you that I have not had any health problems, and nor have the people who live there, nor the animals nor the plants, because, as the toxicologists say quite rightly, the poison is in the dose."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Dr Matsakis on his report and on the draft resolution that he presented to our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I would like to thank the Members in that Committee for their contributions, which have improved the text that we are currently debating."
"For more than 22 years I was a Member of Parliament in Spain for the province of Ciudad Real, in which Almadén and its mines are located and where the majority of the mercury extracted in Europe and the world has been produced for twenty centuries."
"This region, which has experienced a thorough process of diversification, will be affected once again by the prohibitions laid down in the Community mercury strategy on the production and export of that metal."
"The drawing up of Dr Matsakis’s report has been followed with interest in and around Almadén, and the text of the resolution that we will approve tomorrow responds to the expectations of my countrymen by recommending that they receive significant European Union compensation to ensure the social and economic revitalisation of those territories."
"They have also been sympathetic to the idea that has been mentioned here several times that the metallic mercury store envisaged in the Community strategy should be in Almadén, since it is there that the experience, technology and workforce necessary for managing that store with the proper guarantees can be found."
"I would like to take this opportunity to invite you, Commissioner, to come with Dr Matsakis and myself to Almadén and to witness the great beauty of its countryside, as well as the warmth of its people and their European enthusiasm for moving forward."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your understanding and solidarity."
"Mr President, of course your invitation is welcome."
"First of all, allow me to thank all of you for your very constructive comments."
"The contribution of the European Parliament is very important and it is only in close cooperation with the institutions that we shall be able to secure for the European Union effective ways of addressing the negative repercussions of mercury on human health and the environment."
"That is why I welcome the support which you expressed in your report and interventions on the strategy."
"I note with particular satisfaction that Parliament shares our views on the main actions of the strategy concerning mercury."
"That is a very strong foundation for the adoption of specific new measures to apply the strategy."
"These measures are already at the preparation stage."
"I should like, so as not to take up too much time, to say a couple of words about the points raised by Mr Callanan."
"The environmental repercussions from mercury are still important and there are suitable alternative solutions."
"Similarly, suitable adaptation is not a problem for small producers, which is why the Commission too has proposed a ban on the use of mercury in these measuring devices."
"As regards the question of dental amalgams, the Commission will ask the relevant medical working party to study new measures and will call for the opinion of the scientific committee on the danger to health and the environment."
"To finish, I should like once again to thank Parliament and Mr Matsakis in particular for his particularly positive stand on the strategy."
"The Commission wishes to continue this exceptional cooperation with Parliament on this particularly serious issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item – today’s final item – is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the free movement of workers and transition periods, by István Szent-Iványi, Graham Watson and Ignasi Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-0013/2006 – B6-0012/2006)."
". Mr President, this year was designated the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"By 30 April, each Member State must decide whether they are going to open up their labour market or not."
"This decision will determine whether this year will actually be the year of workers’ mobility, or a parody of it."
"We cannot tolerate a situation where workers from new Member States continue to be second class, and in certain respects even third class players on the labour market."
"The free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms, a fundamental idea of the European Union."
"In the course of the March summit, the European Heads of State or Government will discuss the Lisbon process."
"The Lisbon process is bound to fail if we do not create a unified and flexible labour market."
"And this cannot be achieved without the liberalisation and freedom of the labour market."
"The Commission has recently published an assessment which showed very clearly that the fears and anxieties persisting in the old Member States are groundless."
"There have been fears, for a long time, of a massive influx of workforce into Great-Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, the three countries that have opened up their labour markets."
"This has not happened."
"The rate of unemployment has not increased in these countries, against all expectations."
"On the other hand, ‘black work’ was reduced, public revenue increased, and the competitiveness of companies has improved."
"Illegal employment is still considerable in countries that continue to restrict their labour market."
"This has led the Commission to the unequivocal conclusion that the winners of this process have been the countries that have liberalised the movement of workforce from new Member States."
"So far I have been talking about the fact that the second class citizens on the labour market are the citizens of the new Member States. However, since 23 January, they have actually become third class citizens in a certain respect, because this was the date when the Directive stating that the European Union shall grant the right to employment and residence to third country nationals who have been residing legally within the territory of the European Union for at least five years came into effect."
"We do not have any problems with this."
"But this means that even these nationals are in a more advantageous situation than the workers from new Member States."
"This is why I ask the Commissioner: how does he envisage the rectification of this problem, how can it be ensured that workers from new Member States do not feel like third class citizens on the labour market?"
"And at this point I would like to welcome the decision of Finland, Spain and Portugal."
"These are very positive decisions for the liberalisation of the workforce, but we are waiting for France, the Netherlands and Belgium to join in and liberalise their labour markets, as this is in the interest of everybody."
". Mr President, first of all, the Accession Treaty provides for a nuanced approach and clear solutions which allow both the long-term residents directive and the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers to be applied in full legal compatibility."
"Let me explain this in detail."
"First of all, there is the question of first-time access to the labour market."
"In such a case the Accession Treaty – during any period in which any old Member State applies transitional measures – provides that it must give preference to nationals of the new Member States over third-country nationals as regards access to the labour market."
"The second situation concerns nationals from the new Member States who are already resident in an old Member State."
"In that case the Accession Treaty again provides that nationals of new Member States who already reside and work in a Member State applying transitional measures must not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries also resident and working in that Member State."
"This means that where by virtue of the directive, a third-country national has been given long-term status, the Accession Treaty operates so as to ensure that the old Member States must treat citizens from new Member States who are already legally resident and working in the territories at least according to the standards guaranteed in the directive – thus including the right of free access to the labour market."
"The same logic also applies in the third situation covered by the directive: movement by long-term residents between Member States."
"Here the rule is the following: workers from a third country who are long-term residents in a new Member State should not be treated more favourably than nationals of that state."
"In other words, in the situation of mobility to a second Member State, an old Member State cannot give free access to its labour market to a long-term resident who is a third-country-national if and where the same free access is not given to a national of a new Member State."
"The same applies to equivalent situations between two old Member States."
"In both cases of mobility between Member States, if both the national of a new-Member-State and the long-term resident are subject to national measures such as a work permit, Community preference would operate in favour of the national of the new Member State, who is a European citizen."
"From the above, it results that the rights provided by the directive can be reconciled with the provisions of the Accession Treaty."
"There is no need to submit proposals to change the rules, because it is impossible to have less favourable treatment for citizens of the new Member States of Europe."
"The Commission agrees, however, that there is a need for better information clarifying the issue to be sent to the Member States and I intend to do this by sending all Member States a letter clearly stating the existing rules."
"Mr President, an oral question is submitted to the Commission."
"The question concerns the issue of the free movement of workers from new Member States, and seeks an answer to whether, within the current regulation frameworks, certain groups of non-EU nationals are enjoying considerably more advantages than citizens of new Member States in respect of movement between Member States for employment purposes."
"If this were true, then this situation would be obviously wrong, and we would have to rectify it, to avoid any prejudice to the preference principle stipulated in the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty."
"However, Article 21 of Directive 2003/109/EC stipulates that third country nationals who have obtained long-term residence permits in a second Member State shall have access to the labour market."
"The expression ‘shall have' must be interpreted to mean that the issue of a work permit cannot be denied if the persons concerned have already obtained the right to long-term residence."
"Consequently, a long-term residence permit issued in the second Member State practically includes the work permit."
"This means that if companies in the target state are willing to accept them, the access to the labour market of non-EU nationals arriving from other Member States is automatic and unrestrictable, while the access of citizens from new Member States is unequivocally restricted and restrictable."
"We must obviously welcome an objective that aims to achieve greater mobility and a more flexible and more unified labour market."
"This is the obvious aim of Directive 2003/109/EC, too, but attention must be paid to the right sequence."
"I personally welcome the argumentation that I have also heard from the Commissioner, and would like to call attention to the fact that we need more than just a letter – we need some kind of a procedural regulation that explains what exactly needs to be done when a third country national and a European Union citizen are in a competitive situation."
"What I mean is that we need more accurate and more detailed guidance, and this is what I would expect from the European Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that, notwithstanding the responses to what is happening and the various interpretations of the Directive, this is also a good opportunity to raise our voices, and I would like to add mine to those that believe that this problem is not going to be resolved until we finally put an end to this transition period. Let us hope that it ends as soon as possible, so that all Europeans may be equal and so that we may make the mobility of workers an important tool in terms of our competitiveness, our employment and the construction of the European Union."
"I would therefore like to join with those people who are calling for an open door policy, and the sooner the better, and in this regard I believe — and, as a Spaniard, I am pleased about this — that my country’s government’s announcement that the restrictions during this transition period are to be lifted is very important."
"We have done this, Commissioner, because we are a country with a degree of experience, being a country of immigration and one of emigration."
"Furthermore, we have seen clearly once again over these two years that these restrictions imposed on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Europe of 15 must be lifted, for reasons of justice and solidarity, but also for reasons of rationality and common sense, today more than ever, in this year of mobility."
"We must firstly look at this from the point of view of justice and solidarity."
"We Spaniards also had a seven-year transition period and we felt humiliated and unfairly treated as a result of a situation that was not justified, because it became clear that many of those xenophobic and racist arguments were mistaken."
"There was no avalanche of workers."
"Spanish workers never created problems in the host countries; on the contrary."
"We have seen the same thing happening over the last two years with the workers of the new Member States: not only have they not created problems, but they are in fact resolving labour shortages, improving their skills and enhancing the global concept of Europe."
"What I would ask, therefore, is that the study carried out by the European Commission should serve to persuade more countries to lift the restrictions and that the day should come when Europe is genuinely a Europe in which all European citizens and all European workers have the same rights, because that would be consistent, because it would be very good for mobility and because Europe needs mobility if it wants to win the productivity and competitiveness battle with the United States."
"We need to create that great market of free citizens in which there will be no problems and which, furthermore, will enable us to improve our competitiveness, to improve our capacity and to improve the lives of our citizens, so that, as well as resolving specific problems, we may create something of a vision for the future in terms of removing those obstacles."
"Mr President, I can totally identify with what the previous speaker said and I would also like to bid Commissioner Frattini good evening for the third time today."
"There is no need to explain why citizens from the new countries should gain access to the labour market – quite the contrary, in fact."
"It is the countries that continue to protect their markets that have to explain why they continue to deny fully-paid-up fellow EU citizens their basic rights."
"It also makes good economic sense, of course, to lift the restrictions."
"The European economy and the labour market need people."
"If we, in the European Union and its internal market, want to compete with major markets outside Europe, we will need dynamic, young, well-trained people who are also mobile."
"That is something to which we have always aspired within the European economy, and so it makes no sense whatsoever to keep the labour markets closed off."
"Moreover, it is an illusion that these restrictions stop Eastern European workers from coming over here, for they have been around for a long time, even though they are being exploited by fraudulent employers and live in degrading circumstances in our countries – something that I regard as a disgrace."
"Considerations of civil rights, the economy and solidarity therefore require that the restrictions be lifted."
"I am pleased, then, that my own county, the Netherlands, will probably do that – at any rate, it appears that a majority is in favour of it – and I should like to urge all Member States, in the year of mobility, to do likewise."
"– Mr President, what is going on in the countries that want to keep the transitional rules is no more than the semblance of a debate, and, of course, Germany is one of them."
"The fact is that one way to achieve popularity is to tell people things that are not true, particularly if you tell them that the transitional rules can protect the labour market."
"Yet the opposite is the case; the transitional rules do not keep migrant workers out."
"Instead, since they cannot become employed legally, the black economy is the only option left to them."
"In the border regions of Eastern Germany, from which I come, the black market is burgeoning and there has been a massive increase in fictional self-employment, quite simply because the transitional rules encourage these things."
"As a result, higher wages come under even more pressure."
"Unlike in the case of legitimate employment, illegal employment is not capable of being controlled and monitored."
"That results in workers being subjected to exploitation and discrimination."
"What is needed in Europe is a well-ordered labour market with minimum standards and underpinned by the principle of the same pay for the same work in the same place."
"The effect of transitional rules is, quite simply, to put off to another day these urgently-needed reforms and efforts; more than that, they give the populists of the Right material for their speeches, and most of all, they undermine the European ideal."
"Let me, then, as a German, make my appeal for the transitional rules not to remain in place, but, instead, for the market to be opened up in Germany too and for proper conditions to become the order of the day there."
". – Mr President, the basic weakness of the European construction is that when national interests are perceived to be at stake Member States will look after themselves."
"That is how politics works, never mind promises of solidarity and Treaty obligations."
"This particular complaint is that we do not have equal treatment of workers from third countries across the Union, but nor do we have a free market in services, nor do we have anything approaching a uniform application of European Union law."
"Perhaps the most glaring example of broken rules is the Stability Pact, and without budgetary discipline the euro currency will not last for very long."
"Whenever some states misbehave we ask the Commission to do something, but the Commission cannot do very much and I am not convinced that Mr Frattini’s information drive will help."
"If the Commission demands equal treatment of workers, some nations will still just say ‘no’, or if they are persuaded to say ‘yes’ they will easily find ways of reneging."
". Mr President, the situation we have had to cope with since 1 January of this year is a paradoxical one."
"On the one hand, the countries of the so-called old Fifteen are bound to ensure that long-term residents receive the same treatment as their own nationals as regards access to the labour market."
"On the other, many of these same countries are taking advantage of the provisions of the Treaty on Accession and maintaining the ban on free movement of workers where the new Ten are concerned."
"This state of affairs is contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned Treaty on Accession, pursuant to which European Union citizens have priority over third country nationals regarding access to the labour market."
"The problem could have been resolved by doing away with the transitional periods for the employment of citizens of the new Member States in the labour markets of the old Union."
"Unfortunately, only three Member States, namely Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom opened up their labour markets from 1 May 2004."
"Two other Member States, Spain and Portugal, have stated that they will do so from 1 May of this year."
"Sadly, in most of the other Member States fear of the anticipated influx of cheap foreign labour and consequent loss of jobs has won the day."
"Mrs Schroedter mentioned this in the case of Germany."
"Such fear is entirely groundless."
"The European Commission’s statistics show that in most countries the number of citizens of the new Member States employed has remained fairly stable before and after enlargement."
"With the exception of Austria, the figure for workers from the 10 new Member States employed has not exceeded 1% of the economically active population."
"In no Member State of the Union has it been the case that the influx of workers from the new Member States has ousted local workers from their jobs."
"The new arrivals have been taking completely new jobs or previously unfilled positions."
"Mr President, we need to realise that the US economy will continue to outstrip ours in terms of competitiveness unless we increase the mobility of the labour force in Europe."
"Unemployment in the EU currently stands at over 8% but even so, there is a shortage of workers in certain areas."
"Meanwhile, not all Europeans can move freely in search of work."
"Regrettably, it is very likely that the greater part of the Union’s labour market will remain closed to citizens of the new Member States for a further five years."
"That is why it is essential for the European Commission to take action to eliminate the contradictions in Union legislation and to extend the free movement of workers."
"Mr President, I recall how almost two years ago now, a few days after the historic enlargement of the European Union, I took the floor in this House and called on the governments of the so-called old Union to be brave and to abandon transitional periods."
"I called on them to open up their labour markets to citizens of the new Member States."
"Unfortunately, only three Member States were courageous enough to open up their labour markets at that time."
"I refer to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden."
"The remaining 12 Member States gave in to the fears or maybe even the pressures of their own public opinion and citizens and barricaded themselves against an influx of workers from the new Member States, especially from Central and Eastern Europe."
"What conclusions can be drawn after these two years?"
"Clearly, those who have benefited the most are the very same three countries that dared to open their labour markets."
"The European Commission communication issued about a month ago, in February if I am not mistaken, makes it very clear that unemployment has not increased in countries that decided to open their labour markets."
"Social problems have not either."
"What has happened is quite the opposite."
"The economy has gathered additional pace, and income from taxation has increased."
"Such are the benefits of the practical implementation of one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty. It could even be deemed the most fundamental of them all."
"It is part of the foundations upon which the Union is built, and we should be striving to implement it across the 25 current Members of the European Union."
"On the eve of the expiry of the first transitional period I am delighted that a couple more governments are reconsidering opening their labour markets."
"It must however be pointed out that the way things stand, they still constitute a minority of the old Fifteen. This is a serious problem, and I should like to send out the following appeal."
"As we each take the floor in the near future to debate Parliament’s resolution, we should send out a clear call to the governments of Member States not simply to consider opening up their labour markets. We should appeal to them to go ahead and open them fully to allow the free movement of workers."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, István Szent-Iványi, for the inclusion of this topic on the agenda once more; this is not only important to the Member States, but to all of Europe."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, who has prepared an excellent summarising report, presenting an accurate and authentic picture of the labour market processes in the past period."
"The aim of Hungary and of the other new Member States is to see that all legal and administrative obstacles currently hindering the free movement of workers in the European Union are lifted."
"We would like to be equal citizens of the European Union."
"Opening up the labour market and ensuring the free movement of workers is not a gift or a favour, but the reasonable decision of the nine old Member States, which would have beneficial effects on all the citizens of the European Union."
"It is the competitiveness of the European Union that is at stake."
"I hope that nine old Member States will realise this, and that in April 2006, at the end of the two-year transitional period, the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision, joining Finland, Spain and Portugal, who are opening up their market now."
"We must thank the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who were the first to open their market."
"This step has brought a significant advantage to these countries."
"In the Republic of Ireland, the rate of unemployment has fallen in the past two years, partly due to the positive effects created by workers from new Member States."
"In the United Kingdom, the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness."
"Consequently, the accusations and fears related to mass immigration and social dumping are simply unfounded."
"Many thanks to Finland, Spain and Portugal, who have announced that they, too, are opening their labour market."
"It is highly hypocritical that the nine old Member States who are not lifting their restrictions are allowing the entry of workforce from non-European Union countries, but refuse to allow entry to workers from the new Member States."
"At this late hour I need to argue with Commissioner Frattini."
"What he has said is only true in the countries that have opened their labour market."
"In those countries it is, indeed, possible to give priority to workers from new Member States over workers from third countries."
"In countries that have not opened their labour market, this issue does not even arise."
"Therefore, opening the labour markets is a matter of principle, of competitiveness and of eliminating discrimination, as well as a matter of equality between the fifteen old and the ten new Member States."
"– What more can I add to the comments made by all those colleagues who spoke before me?"
"The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms which is guaranteed, but as yet only declared in European Community law."
"The new Member States expect the European Union's old-timers to open their labour markets to the newcomers as soon as possible, believing that the old-timers will only benefit from this, although it is the sovereign right of each one of the old Member States to do this before it actually becomes compulsory."
"According to European Commission statistics, the flood of labour from the new countries was not as great as had been threatened."
"Having admitted workers from the new members, England, Ireland and Sweden only benefited."
"We must congratulate several states on their decision to open their labour market to the new members of the European Union from May."
"The free movement of labour, the liberalisation of the services market and other measures would contribute to the competitiveness of the European Union, and moreover, it would increase citizens' faith in European Union membership."
"The clarity or ambiguity of a complicated situation reduces faith in the European Union."
"In my opinion, members of the European Union must take measures to immediately abolish discriminatory restrictions to legal employment faced by the citizens of Lithuania and other new Member States."
"This would allow people to truly benefit from their rights and would give them the opportunity to pay taxes legally."
"It is time to break the stereotypes of the old way of thinking and to understand that freedom and healthy competition are the engine of progress in Europe."
"Mr President, the plain and uncomfortable truth is that the old Member States were more than happy to open up markets where they held the competitive advantage, namely concerning the free flow of capital."
"I would point out that where the new Member States held the competitive advantage, the markets remain closed."
"One example is the services market, and the labour market could serve as another."
"From 23 January, following final implementation of the directive concerning residents, the situation regarding access to the labour market by third-country citizens may actually be better than that of citizens of the countries that recently joined the Union."
"I found your explanations interesting, Commissioner, but they failed to convince me."
"I think the House should hear more on this subject."
"All this is in clear contradiction to the provisions of the Treaties on Accession."
"It is worth emphasising yet again to the House that not one of the countries that opened their labour market has recorded an increase in unemployment or in other social problems such as benefit fraud."
"On the contrary, the cheaper labour force from the new Member States has reinvigorated the economy."
"Two years down the line we can state categorically that there is no economic justification for these restrictions."
"Pursuant to the Commission’s plans, this year is the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"It should be emphasised that low worker mobility is also related to the closed labour markets in most of the Member States."
"If Member States insist on maintaining the unjustified closure of the labour markets, 2006 may well turn out to be the year of European hypocrisy rather than the European Year of Workers’ Mobility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we are having this debate, since I am not one of those who want to settle this issue by creating winners and losers, by playing the old off against the new."
"We live in a Community."
"It is vitally important that we should make it abundantly clear that the four freedoms are among the fundamental rights of the European Union, one of whose principles is the ban on discrimination."
"The four freedoms are at the heart of the internal market; their implementation makes it a domestic one."
"These EU principles – the political goals – are clear, and they unite us."
"We must implement them as soon as possible; the reason why we have not yet done so is that our policies are subject to different framework conditions, to different social legislation, different wages, different tax legislation, different labour laws."
"With 19 million unemployed, we have differing growth rates, which are – thank heavens – higher in the new Member States than in the old ones."
"The result of this is fear and worry on the part of the public."
"Not least in my own country, which has the longest external border with the new Member States, there are more and more citizens of the new Member States in the workforce."
"What we have to do, though, is look into the Treaties and Community law for ways in which we can take public concerns and fears into consideration."
"Rather than standing in the way, we are seeking acceptable transitions, but transitions are not our goal; what we are aiming to do is to make the four freedoms a reality, to lay fears to rest and join together in seeking joint solutions."
"Rather than apportioning blame, we need to meet each other halfway."
"– Mr President, even if mutual understanding is sometimes made rather difficult by our linguistic differences, it does make sense that it should be the competent committees of this House that work through the Commission’s reports, assessing and debating them."
"This matter is meant to be handled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but this debate, and the question on this point, are pre-empting its deliberations, and that I really do think is something we can do without; there may be reasons for it, but it is, I think, something we can do without."
"Let me start by saying that the Commission communication, which is meant to help do away with the transitional period for the free movement of workers, is, I think, still defective in terms of its substance and – in the form in which it is presented to us – not yet watertight in economic terms."
"Nor are the authors of today’s question looking at the facts from the right angle when they talk in terms of the citizens of the ten new Member States being put at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the nationals of third countries."
"The fact is that, in Germany, people from the ten new Member States are 3% more likely to be in work than those from third states."
"In Austria, the difference stands as high as 6%."
"The advantage enjoyed by the ten new States is even more pronounced in Great Britain and Ireland."
"More to the point, data relating to only one year since accession cannot serve as a credible basis for a prognosis of medium and long-term changes in the labour market of the kind that the Commission is putting forward."
"When one considers the period to which the evaluation refers, the conclusion at which the communication arrives, namely that the opening-up of the labour market has a positive effect on economic growth and employment, is quite simply wrong."
"In 2005, there was markedly less economic growth in the EU of 25 than in 2004. This was particularly the case in the United Kingdom, where there was a 1.4% decline and where immigration was ten times greater than the British Government had predicted."
"In contrast to preceding years, there was also scarcely any reduction in unemployment, and so I call on the Commission to commission, as soon as possible, a study examining worker migration and all the effects associated with it, and doing so in a value-free way."
"That will be beneficial not only to the Commission, but also in terms of continued rational dialogue."
"I would add that, while I too would like to see an early reduction in the transitional periods, that will require good accompanying measures in a suitable framework, and the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive."
"That would be to the benefit of all concerned, in that it would allay one side’s fears and concerns, and make both sides better able to engage in dialogue, but the sort of debate we are having today I regard, quite simply, as wrong."
"It has been two years since the start of the latest stage of the enlargement, and the first part of the seven year transition period is coming to an end."
"The old Member States must come to a decision on the extension or abolition of the transition period."
"The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden opened their markets immediately and benefited, and at the same time encouraged the new Member States to view their own labour in a somewhat different light and evaluate it better."
"The job market of EU-15 has not been flooded by labour from the new states."
"Expansion has encouraged the legalisation of previously illegal jobs."
"No transition periods will stop a person who wants to leave."
"A person's freedom of movement is the cornerstone value of the European Community."
"On 26 January, a Council Directive entered into force allowing the citizens of third countries, who have lived in the EU for five years, to move freely, come to study, work or simply live in any EU country."
"Why did the Council adopt a Directive which is discriminatory with respect to the new countries?"
"Why is there such huge opposition to restore justice?"
"It is good news that Finland, Spain and Portugal plan to abandon the transition period."
"Austria and Germany initiated the introduction of the transition periods."
"The results of the two years have shown that the new states do not pose a threat."
"I urge Austria and the other remaining states to abandon the discriminatory transition period and this discriminatory view of the new Member States."
"I would pose a broader question – why do the new Member States feel that there is an increasing rift between themselves and the old Member States?"
"I will begin by mentioning the Services Directive."
"It was feared that the new Member States would start to offer services of a better quality than in the old Member States, and this resulted in the blocking of the implementation of one of Europe’s fundamental rights, which for fifty years had only existed on paper."
"There was offensive talk of the movement of services constituting ‘social dumping’, and the mythical was invoked to frighten citizens of the old Member States."
"This rhetoric humiliated the new Member States and left their citizens with the impression that they were not human beings."
"The conflict was not, however, between left-wing and right-wing forces, and the old Member States quickly found a compromise among themselves: some defended their large companies, while others protected their trade unions."
"But Eastern Europe opened up its market long before it joined the European Union, and as a result large companies from the old Member States have for years simply bought up companies in Eastern Europe without the constraints of a services directive."
"They came to our market and bought it, but when our turn came, the door was closed."
"It is the small companies and citizens of the new Member States, as well as consumers in the old Member States, who suffer as a result of this."
"Secondly, the restriction of the free movement of labour makes the new Europeans into second-class citizens."
"Some citizens of the EU are entitled to move freely, while others are not – on the basis of their citizenship."
"Neo-protectionism in the EU limits the civil rights of citizens of the new Member States, often using xenophobic rhetoric, as we noticed in the case of the debating of the Services Directive."
"Although the labour market is closed, the old Member States have for years gladly picked out those workers they lack – for instance, doctors, nurses and IT specialists."
"They would not consider insulting these workers by branding them with the label of dumping, because their recruitment is often even funded by state subsidy."
"Thirdly, we have now seen the implementation of a directive stipulating that non-citizens who have lived in an EU Member State for five years are entitled to freedom of movement, but citizens of the new EU Member States lack that right."
"What can one conclude from this?"
"Citizens of the new Member States are not only second-class, but even third-class citizens."
"My question is this: what action does Europe plan to take to ensure that this intolerable protectionism and obvious discrimination does not split the newly reunited Europe?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have read with interest the Commission report of 8 February clearly indicating that worker mobility within the European Union has had positive effects."
"Migrant workers have helped eliminate labour market deficiencies, increasing the skilled labour force in the EU, decreasing the potential for illegal employment, and contributing overall to better efficiency in Europe."
"A month ago we debated and approved in the first reading a report on opening the services market in the European Union."
"I am mentioning the Services Directive because a point may come when it will touch closely on the freedom of movement for workers."
"A critical moment could be reached if, on the one hand, the Services Directive becomes effective and, on the other hand, a country still chooses to frustrate the free movement of workers."
"This would impose constraints on workers in their desire to switch employers, even though such changes would benefit not only themselves but also the destination country."
"A country may eliminate this risk by cancelling the transition period."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in itself the free movement of workers is, of course, not a solution for sustaining the social model of a given state."
"Inefficient models cannot be sustained in the face of the deteriorating public finance deficits that result from globalisation, technological change and ageing populations."
"The free movement of workers, however, is definitely not, and cannot be, the source of these problems."
"European legislation cannot dictate to the Member States whether they should or should not cancel transition periods."
"These states, however, should take every measure to tackle the true causes of their economic problems."
"They will then view the free movement of workers as an advantage and not as a threat."
"That concludes this item."
"The VVD Group in the European Parliament is in favour of the ‘old’ Member States lifting the restrictions on workers from the new ones."
"All European countries derive economic benefit from opening up their borders."
"In the Netherlands, for example, we are short of manpower in the metal, horticultural, agricultural and health care industries."
"The open borders policy in Great Britain, Ireland and Sweden has proved to be a success."
"If we unlock the front door, at least we will have a say in who we allow in, instead of frantically trying to keep illegal entrants away from the back doors."
"That has proved impossible, for every year, we notice that seasonal labour, in particular, is carried out by illegal workers."
"I declare the 2005-2006 session of the European Parliament closed."
"I declare open the 2006-2007 session of the European Parliament."
"The next item is the report (A6-0036/2006) by Reino Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a European information society for growth and employment (2005/2167(INI))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I started drafting the report the telecommunications sector was in a rather miserable state."
"Most Member States had not yet even delivered their national communications on the progress they had made in implementation."
"The situation now is better: all the national communications are with the Commission, and in almost every Member State five directives have come into force one way or another."
"Meanwhile, however, many Member States have been protecting their monopolies for many years, and so they have had the money to penetrate the markets in those Member States which opened up their markets on time."
"Nevertheless, these directives are already obsolete."
"This industry is developing at such a rate that new legislation is necessary to guarantee the viability and development of the market and its potential for providing employment."
"For this reason, it is good that the Commission has decided to propose the i2010 strategy, which aims to create a viable common knowledge-based area."
"We need to safeguard investment and appropriations for research, and all Europeans need to have access to this system, including the poor."
"Technology changes more rapidly than legislation, and this is why I adhered to the basic premise that the strategy proposed in my report should be as transparent as possible, and that technology should be neutral."
"This will allow it to create incentives for access to the market for all kinds of new inventions and alternatives, and also competitors."
"We will change the world more with technology than with politics."
"But who should lead this change?"
"We should be talking about the ubiquitous information society."
"Information and communication technology no longer mean audiovisual technology."
"Information is transmitted, for example, between a tyre and a car, between a refrigerator and portable terminal equipment, a wallet and a key ring, home air-conditioning and a navigator."
"We are, then, dealing with digital technology, which is present everywhere all the time."
"How much cleverer is a person in intelligent clothing?"
"He is a mobile source of, and a target for, information."
"I just wonder when we will be starting to control him like a robot."
"Digital technology also makes life for many very easy, with the result that we are starting to look for stimulation outside this environment."
"It has been calculated that 80% of our national wealth is intangible, which is to say education, knowledge, administration, and just 3% is made up of natural resources."
"It is therefore alarming that in that 80% range we are lagging with indifference behind our competitors."
"We are not investing, not researching, and not implementing directives properly and at an acceptable rate."
"It is only mainly the Nordic countries and one or two others that are exceptions to this trend."
"Information and communications technology is the fastest growing sector of industry."
"It creates most jobs in industry."
"Unless we pull ourselves together, disaster awaits us."
"Those investing in the sector will look for their partners in countries such as China and India, and the old declining economies, which is to say us here in Europe, will be left behind."
"Already highly trained people from China and India are entering this sector, a lot more than from Europe."
"The day before yesterday the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Europe about this change."
"Is it not then time to act, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commission is also suggesting?"
"Some amendments have been made to my report."
"My colleague, Mrs Riera Madurell, and I drafted three of them, which can be kept in the form of these summarised versions, as compromises."
"Their purpose is to take clear account of equality between women and men and the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, but to shorten this opinion slightly."
"I hope this approach will be looked upon favourably."
"Furthermore, my colleague, Mr Guidoni, has drafted a few amendments, which we on the committee voted against, mainly because of a translation error."
"I also believe that I am able to support them."
". Mr President, I shall firstly express my thanks to Parliament and particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, for his very detailed report."
"He has been working very closely with the other rapporteurs and has gathered their opinions."
"To all of them I express my thanks."
"It is very encouraging to see that Parliament shares the Commission’s main concerns and the policy priorities for the information society over the next five years."
"As the various committees and rapporteurs have shown, it is very difficult to predict today how the information society of tomorrow will look, and that is why we opted for a broad and ambitious strategic framework, instead of a detailed action plan, because this strategic framework allows for review and adjustments in response to emerging challenges."
"The i-2010 framework thus seeks to provide a future-proof policy framework."
"I am very pleased to note that Parliament and the Commission share a position on the key elements of i-2010: commitments to make ICT legislation forward-looking and responsive to the changes brought about by converging."
"So, it must be technologically neutral and supportive of competition, and at the same time Member States must implement fully the existing regulatory framework which, unfortunately, is not always the case, but you know that I am fighting to get that done."
"We see a similar need for the approach to spectrum management which can respond to rapid technological developments and changes in demand and which is supported by regulators, operators and others involved."
"Here we will have a lot of work in the next few months."
"Our shared priorities also include support for the EU’s creation and distribution of European content, the protection of intellectual property, the promotion of security and the protection of users against harmful content."
"The Commission and Parliament are also of one mind when it comes to urging Member States and businesses to invest more into ICT research, and we see the same need for ensuring appropriate financial resources for ICT in FP7 and CIP."
"We also agree on the need to promote and protect citizens’ rights in the information society and that is why we need to raise the awareness of citizens on how their rights, freedom of expression, privacy, personal data protection and right to receive or communicate information can be exercised in the information society."
"Together with Parliament I would urge the Member States to use their national reform plans in order to address their own ICT priorities, to improve their public services, such as e-government initiatives, where I see a lot of progress in the move to invest more in the exploitation of ICT in public-sector services."
"Like Parliament, I am worried about the digital divide."
"We have to ensure that everyone can participate; not only people who live in cities; not only people who have a certain level of education; not only young people."
"This is a very strong goal and an opportunity to be seized."
"We will work together on steps to bridge this digital divide."
"When I refer to ‘digital divide’, I also mean the promotion of digital literacy for all, which leads me to the participation of women in all ICT-related fields of academia and business."
"There is good news: our statistics show that gender is no longer the main factor in the digital divide; that factor is diminishing very rapidly."
"I am encouraged by this, but that does not mean that we should not do anything to solve the residual problem."
"We have to work together and continue our efforts to promote greater gender balance in ICT-related fields such as science."
"In many governments, initiatives are being taken to that end."
"I agree with you on the crucial importance of the Internet for an economy based on information."
"That is why the EU also played an active role in brokering the agreement on the progressive internationalisation of Internet governance at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis last year."
"In my view, that is the best approach to Internet governance."
"The Commission, together with Parliament, will proceed by organising a forum later this year."
"I am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue."
"The working paper is going to be a stock-taking exercise to capture the wide range of different circumstances across the Member States, but at the same time – and I keep reiterating this – my views on ownership and media pluralism have not changed."
"Ownership issues are a matter for Member States: they must take their responsibilities and exercise them in an effective manner in line with the subsidiarity principle."
"That is why the Commission simply supports the Member States; it does not dictate to them in this important area of national life."
"Having said that, I promised you that I would follow this up and cooperate with you in that regard."
"I will shortly be proposing measures to that effect to this House."
"Concerning your call to speed up the e-inclusion initiative – which is planned for 2008 – I urge you not just to see the date of 2008, because 2008 is the time when we will have reached our objective."
"In order to reach it, we are preparing things now."
"So I have spoken with the forthcoming EU Presidencies of Finland, Germany and Portugal, and practical actions will be built up until we reach the e-inclusion initiative in 2008."
"Since the publication of the i-2010 action plan, we have significantly raised awareness of ICT issues."
"We have started to make progress on key objectives, with the adoption of several proposals, with other proposals in the pipeline and with initiatives that were not inscribed in the i-2010 initiative."
"The flexibility of the action plan allows us to add initiatives whenever necessary."
"The latest one I took involves consultation on RFIDs, which bring together economic necessity and the necessity to protect the privacy of our citizens."
"However, achievement of our ambitious objective requires adequate financial resources."
"As soon as an interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective is reached, we need to see important decisions and adjustments named in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"I therefore urge you to ensure that those two programmes are granted the basic necessary financial resources in order to support ICT as a driver for competitiveness and growth."
"I am very glad to see that this is a shared opinion and goal not only in this House but also in the three institutions, and that is a guarantee of success."
". Mr President, I am going to speak on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur on his wonderful work and then express my agreement with the Commissioner’s view and say that, in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives, it is essential to create a fully inclusive information society, in which everybody has access to the new information and communication technologies and can benefit from them under equal conditions."
"In this context, the scant presence of women in the fields relating to these technologies demonstrates that there is a real digital gender gap in the European Union, which has clear repercussions in terms of employment and which must be dealt with by means of specific actions."
"We must tackle the causes of this division, and it is therefore necessary to promote training actions aimed at increasing the number of well-trained women in the field and at all levels and to achieve a greater presence of, and participation by, women in all of the bodies that take decisions and formulate policies related to information and communication technologies."
"There are still very few women in this area."
"We are calling for special attention for women living in rural, isolated and geographically remote areas, for whom information and communication technologies may provide an effective means of participating in economic, political and social life."
"For all of these reasons, it is essential that we have reliable data, broken down by gender, and a legal framework that deals with the gender perspective and allows us to identify and tackle the causes of discrimination."
"On this aspect, the role of the new European Institute for Gender Equality may be fundamental."
"Our report also refers to the sexist use of pictures of women in the media, and particularly in the digital media, and we are therefore calling on the Commission to promote the drafting of a gender equality code for the media, which will help to promote gender equality in the media, both in terms of the information they convey and in the media organisations themselves."
"I do not wish to end without calling on the Commission to pay particular attention to the criminal use of the new information and communication technologies, such as the use of the Internet for the trafficking of women and children."
"In this regard, we would ask that all legal and technological initiatives necessary to put an end to it be promoted."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report constitutes a significant advance towards an understanding of the concept of an ‘information society’."
"Specifically, I would particularly like to point to one aspect of the report: the fact that it gives a precise indication of the extremely close relationship between current impressive developments in technology and the fate of democracy."
"The report was right to show the effects that the information society has on growth and employment and to present the benefits, problems and the solutions."
"The implications, however, go much further: the media have already become key in conditioning the ideas and behaviour of billions of people."
"Their role is therefore socially important and often decisive."
"Media ownership cannot be distinct from responsibility towards society, and the effects of the media must not be seen solely in terms of the market."
"At stake on this issue are all our values, our rights, and even the fate of peace and the survival of humanity."
"We face not merely a set of economic and technical problems; what is at stake are fundamental rights such as the right to be informed, to be able to express oneself and to communicate, particularly given that the information society will increasingly be a society of the moving image."
"This will be the dominant language of the future."
"Those unable to decipher the images and prevent themselves from being manipulated by them will not be free: helping our children to learn this language will be the only way to make them into citizens with awareness."
". – Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Commissioner for the report drawn up by the Commission."
"Thanks to that report, I believe that we have been able to hold an extremely interesting debate, because it stresses once again what I believe to be absolutely fundamental in the Lisbon Agenda."
"If there is one decisive area in terms of the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, it is the information and communication technologies, which constitute a priority issue for this House and for the European institutions."
"I would like to take this opportunity to refer to the budgetary issues, which have yet to be fully defined."
"For example, with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, we must not forget the essential and decisive role of the information and communication technologies in the Lisbon Agenda."
"I am going to mention just two aspects of the debate that we have held in my committee, in which we have reached an agreement on this report."
"Firstly, with regard to Article 66, which was approved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which refers to the need not to forget deregulation."
"This is necessary to the sector, which only needed to be regulated for a limited period and in response to the demands of the time."
"I believe that it is very important not to forget deregulation, because if we do not take it into account and vote in favour of it today, we will be going against the Lisbon Agenda."
"Finally, on the issue of women, all of the groups reached a compromise amendment and we voted in favour of it, but then eight amendments appeared dealing with the issue of women, which Mr Paasilinna is now telling us are being reduced to three."
"Women do not need to hear things repeated."
"Women need decisive action."
"Where there are problems, they do not need the same thing to be repeated twenty times, but rather they need something serious and decisive to be done once and for all."
"We are therefore in favour of the compromise amendment, but not in favour of more and more rhetoric, like that contained in these additional amendments."
". The knowledge-based society cannot be achieved unless we can bridge the digital divide in all its forms."
"There is a digital divide between rich and poor countries, but it also exists within the EU itself."
"If we are to combat this problem effectively, we need to tackle all of its various aspects, both technological and socio-economic."
"Indeed, knowledge of ICT is the best response we can give to this problem."
"The aim of the i2010 strategy is to develop the effective use of the goods and services provided by ICT and to encourage active and critical participation in the information society for all and to everyone's benefit."
"This plan of action is therefore particularly to be welcomed."
"The intention of our amendments was to ensure that we do not forget about vulnerable people such as the elderly, the disabled, and those who live alone or have social difficulties."
"I also think it would be worthwhile to undertake an analysis of the economic, cultural and social effects of the move towards an information society, in order to improve our understanding and the monitoring of the plan, because I believe that we cannot be competitive if we do not share knowledge and skills."
". Mr President, innovation in the field of ICT is progressing so rapidly that there is a risk that the European Union, which invests only EUR 80 per capita compared with the equivalent of EUR 350 in Japan and EUR 400 in the United States, will soon be left behind."
"The EU must therefore increase investment in research and urge the Member States to do the same."
"On the other hand, the fast pace of innovation means that there is a risk that the digital divide, and therefore social divides, will widen, to the detriment of the social and territorial cohesion that we are working towards."
"It is therefore vital that we build an information society based on inclusion, and on broad take-up of information and communication technologies in public services, SMEs and households."
"The success of the i2010 strategy requires the European Commission to put forward proposals to make these technologies accessible to all citizens, taking account of the crucial role given to the regions, to safeguard the principles of freedom and pluralism of the media, and to set out clear actions to protect against illegal and harmful content and to protect minors and human dignity, while also protecting privacy."
"The Commission also needs to put the emphasis on effective use of ICT in public services, particularly in health and education."
"Finally, although I am in favour, in the medium term, of opening up the market following a period of transition towards the implementation of general competition rules, I would point out that the Treaties define the rules for free competition, and at the same time call for economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Freedom of competition in the field of ICT must not result in the private sector refusing to invest in unprofitable infrastructure."
"The role of states and regions will therefore be a determining factor in encouraging the development of the necessary infrastructure."
"It is up to us to make ICT a real tool for economic development and for social and territorial cohesion in the European Union."
"I would like to thank Mr Paasilinna for the high quality of his work, and my fellow Members for their contributions to the debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information technology is a key element in constructing a society that is culturally richer and more cohesive."
"The information society ought to be open to all, and ought to be a democratic tool that takes cultural diversity into account and promotes participation by citizens as protagonists, and not just as consumers."
"We must tackle the elimination of the digital divide, which is a problem of balanced development and above all social justice."
"The role of public investment in safeguarding the open nature of ICTs should be considered fundamental, in order to guarantee the development of technical resources and cultural tools permitting all citizens to benefit from an ever-increasing volume of communication and information services."
"In order to put good governance into practice and provide all Europeans with full citizenship, we should adopt a European Charter of consumer rights in the digital world – so-called e-rights – with shared principles and guidelines, defining a framework of citizens’ rights."
"The charter should include, in particular, the right to free access, free of charge (which would therefore be non-discriminatory), to transparent, comprehensive and complete information in a secure environment via telecommunications services and platforms based on open, interoperable standards, such as e-mail address portability."
"With the I-2010 Directive, Europe has the vital role of meeting the target of making the information society accessible to all."
". Mr President, I should like to welcome two documents, the report before us and the Commission’s communication."
"I will refer briefly to a number of issues."
"In their broadest sense, ICT services, especially the Internet, must be understood to impact on human beings’ consciousness and indeed on their subconscious too. Accordingly, it is essential to put in place technological, distribution and legal safeguards to ensure these facilities are not used to transmit harmful content."
"I have in mind content likely to deprave, to incite hatred or to promote criminal behaviour."
"It is also necessary to provide effective protection for financial and administrative services, to prevent unauthorised individuals from accessing them."
"Particular care should be taken over material aimed at children and young people."
"The promotion of broadband information networks must be a priority."
"More widespread use of home electric networks for data transmission should be encouraged."
"Educating and informing society on the subject is tremendously important."
"As we identify the tasks to be accomplished in this area we should keep in mind that this is not only a problem for the Union but also for the whole world."
"Let us therefore do all we can to ensure that access to the information network becomes a reality for all our citizens and that they derive the maximum possible benefit from it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the technological developments and changes taking place nowadays in the ICT sector are proceeding at a giddy pace and are hard to keep up with. Thus, a digital divide is appearing between Member States, a digital divide is appearing between regions and, most importantly, a digital divide is even appearing between persons with a small age difference."
"I shall comment on two points which I consider crucial to the achievement of the objectives of i2010."
"The first point is the institutional framework and the second point is the financing framework."
"As regards the first point, with the i2010 strategy which we are debating today, the need is being identified and the review is being planned of the existing institutional framework on the basis of the new situation as regards digital convergence."
"This constitutes a major challenge, given that the new institutional framework must: a) be flexible, so that it can adapt to rapid technological developments and the needs of the market without restricting innovative ideas, b) protect the development and production of content and safeguard unimpeded access for every citizen to information."
"Some of these are contradictory parameters; nonetheless, drastic action must be found which will resolve the problems at the bottlenecks and will allow Europe to be competitive and to take the lead."
"As regards the second point, the new strategy lays down ambitious objectives."
"Nonetheless, as regards financing for research and innovation in ICT sectors, even with the 80% increase in resources proposed by the new strategy, Europe is still behind; to be precise, I would say a long way behind its competitors."
"This fact makes me pessimistic and I consider that it is one of the most basic points on which we need to focus."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, objectives without resources to achieve them are not objectives."
"Mr President, I welcome this report."
"This was of course is one of the top 10 priorities of the UK Presidency, essential for achieving the Lisbon goals."
"Now ICT accounts for 40% of Europe’s productivity growth and for 25% of the EU’s GDP growth."
"One of the key issues for me – as it is for the Commissioner and the rapporteur – is not just the economic goals of Lisbon but that the goals of Lisbon should embrace all."
"Social inclusion is of course a key factor."
"I know of poor single parents in Ely in Cardiff, where I was brought up, who do not have a car."
"When they want to do their weekly shopping it is impossible for them to take a bus; they have countless bags to carry and young children to take with them, and so they book a taxi at the cost of about GBP 10."
"Now if they were to shop online they would not have to pay that GBP 10, and this would make a huge difference to many poor families."
"The demonstration of the practical advantages of ICT is important to ensure that poorer members of our society embrace new technologies."
"Finally, we have to be realistic in relation to ICT."
"The prime investment for the sector has to come from the private sector."
"The state sector cannot respond quickly enough to changes in technology."
"Our responsibility is to provide a stable legislative framework for this kind of investment."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to our rapporteur for his good report and also for his constructive cooperation."
"Digitalisation is bringing massive change into the media and communications landscape; in future, the distinction between infrastructure and content will become less important, for every kind of content will be accessible on any platform."
"Every type of content will end up being accessible using every kind of technology, be it the television set, the computer or the mobile phone, and another revolutionary thing is, of course, that all this content is available, to high quality, on all platforms and via all technologies even now."
"More and more service providers are competing with one another in a market place that includes telecoms companies, cable operators, satellite broadcasters, mobile telephone companies, content providers, ISPs and so on and so on and so on. All of them are devising their own business models, and none of them knows – any more than do we – which of these models will end up prevailing and what, at the end of the day, viewers actually want to access, what they want to see, or the sort of content they would like."
"That does of course present us, as European lawmakers, with problems, since we have to draw up the legal framework and must, in so doing predict these imponderables and the way these things will develop, about which there is no certainty."
"Over the coming weeks and months, we will have a very large number of questions to answer."
"I am very grateful to Mr Paasilinna and to all the Members who have contributed to this report for reformulating essential issues in it and summarising them."
"Let me mention a few of them. How much regulation will still be needed in future in the telecoms field?"
"How much influence should the European Union have on that?"
"How do we want to shape frequency policy?"
"One problem that is extremely vexatious to the public is that of international roaming, for they still incur far too many charges when phoning across borders on mobiles."
"Over the coming weeks and months, we will be occupying ourselves with these questions."
"I look forward to an interesting dialogue with you, and I think that the digital world, which presents legislators such as ourselves with so many challenges, will certainly keep us busy over the coming weeks and months."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to stress in this minute-long speech how vital it is to obtain relevant information."
"If members of the public do not receive information that is essential for their lives, development will not be sustainable."
"Essential information lies at the heart of the information society: it is its most important aspect."
"This is now being obscured by games and an unrealistic world of entertainment, one in which it is difficult to find and glean essential information that people can use to take control of their lives and participate in democracy."
"This is therefore an essential matter as far as democracy is concerned."
"I assume that the Commissioner has pondered this issue and I would like to hear her opinion on the subject of relevant information now, at the same time as she greets this important official."
". Mr President, allow me to thank the draftsmen of the opinions and all the Members who have been involved in this issue, which is extremely important not only for economic and industrial development, but also for the welfare of our societies."
"I would like to start by responding briefly to Mr Paasilinna's question regarding information."
"There are two levels of information, the first being benchmarking, which takes place on an annual basis."
"I am aware, Mr Paasilinna, that this benchmarking and these figures could be improved."
"I too sometimes find it frustrating not to have statistics underlining the importance of the sector and its development."
"One of the difficulties is that the sector is not stable, but moving fast."
"We therefore need to review our information virtually every two or three months."
"The second level is the information received by consumers."
"In this respect, it is very important that we take things in hand."
"For example, I have just launched a survey and consultations regarding RFIDs, because I think we need to develop the RFID economy and industry and also to discuss, with consumer associations and privacy protection bodies, the influence of new technologies on citizens and also, perhaps, the measures that we need to take to protect citizens better."
"Efforts are thus being made, and I am counting on the European Parliament to be the spokesman for these discussions on citizenship."
"Mr President, allow me to respond briefly to some of the questions raised."
"Almost all of the speakers have quite justifiably mentioned Internet security."
"The Internet is a wonderful thing, but, just like any other wonderful thing, it also has a negative side: that includes abuse of the Internet."
"That is why, in the coming weeks, we are going to present a communication on spam, spyware and malware."
"This was the subject of a seminar on 'Trust in the Net' held in February under the Austrian Presidency."
"It is why we are working with child protection and women's protection bodies."
"There are criminals operating on the Net and we need to put up barriers to stop them."
"To this end, in terms of research, in 2007 we are going to present the European Security Research Programme covering all the fields – encryption, biometrics, smart cards, authentication, RFIDs, and so on – in which security problems must remain uppermost in our minds."
"Another recurrent theme, which was quite rightly brought up by all the speakers, is the digital divide and regional development."
"If we give competition free rein, it will of course develop in places where there will be a return on the investment, in other words in our towns."
"Our policies therefore need to enable new technologies to develop outside our towns as well."
"The Commission will be presenting an initiative in this connection at the end of this month, covering both rural and regional development."
"A third theme that was raised by some Members is skills levels and in particular the need for specific measures for women."
"With respect to skills, we are already aware that, in the technology sector, economic development is currently displaying a deficit of 15% due to a lack of technicians and engineers."
"It is therefore of prime importance that we reform education in this field."
"We also have statistics showing a lack of women in the sector."
"I must admit that those statistics are not as bad as I had initially thought – women are doing better than is generally thought."
"We should therefore not be too alarmed, but we do need to take action."
"Therefore, together with the Commissioner responsible for education and the Commissioner responsible for research, we are going to draw up a roadmap to improve the involvement of women both in science training and in research."
"We are also encouraging women researchers to get more involved in technology research."
"In 2007 we are also going to present a European guide to best practice in the field."
"I fully support the call for funding for ICT research."
"I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that today's technological successes − GSM, for example, which has become a worldwide standard, is based on European research − are based on research from the 1980s."
"If we want to remain at the cutting edge of global technological progress in future, it is today's research that will provide tomorrow's results."
"Therefore, if we do not invest in research, we can be sure that, in future, no economic sector will grow in this regard."
"Thus, when I ask for enough funding for technological research, I am not doing it for my own pleasure, but to develop the economy, and hence to create jobs for the future, here in Europe, and to prevent businesses relocating outside Europe."
"Some of you raised the issue of the regulatory framework."
"I will be quite clear on that matter: the Telecoms regulation − which is a very positive example that we are considering using as a basis for reforming the market and regulatory framework in the fields of transport and energy − was intended not to regulate but to deregulate, to open up the markets to competition."
"Our statistics demonstrate one thing: where markets are open to competition, prices fall and the take-up of technologies among the citizens rises considerably."
"In contrast, where markets are closed, where there are monopolies, the take-up is non-existent because there is no choice on the market and because prices are too high."
"Look at the statistics on broadband, for example, and you will see that only competition can make this market work, but − as I said before − competition only in markets that can be competitive."
"We need correctives in markets that are too expensive for industrial economics; in other words, regional policy must pay attention to the regions remote from urban centres."
"That said, the regulatory framework is in the review phase."
"I have launched the initial discussions, and before the summer I will present to you a review of the markets concerned and an initial draft reforming the telecoms package."
"Consultations on this subject will start in the second half of the year, and at the end of the year I will present to you a new telecoms package, which will be much simpler than the telecoms package on the table or in force."
"However − and I would like to make this quite clear − this new package will not allow new monopolies to become established: I am quite resolute on that point."
"Some of you also mentioned roaming."
"As you probably know, last summer I announced that I would not put up with excessive prices for much longer; you will remember that last October I published a price comparison on a website."
"I am in the process of making a comparison of the price changes since October."
"Because I was frustrated with those price changes, I announced a regulation to reduce them, and, miracle of miracles, since I announced the regulation, international roaming fees have dropped, which is a good thing."
"In a few weeks, I will let you know what I am going to do in that regard and I will tell you whether or not we need to regulate."
"I think we will need to regulate, and I will therefore submit to you a regulation to ensure that international roaming fees are based on true costs and not on fantasy prices that strain household budgets."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"One hundred and twenty years ago, Thomas Edison said: ‘Electrical lighting will be so cheap that only the very rich will use candles for lighting.’"
"These days only the very rich can afford not to have a mobile telephone number or an e-mail address."
"In the absence of these, these days it would be very difficult to apply for a job, and it would be hopeless to try to start a business."
"The creation of the information society is not just a means, but also an indispensable precondition of growth and employment."
"We must ensure development in all areas at the same time, in a rapid and flexible manner:"
"We must build networks even in areas where this would not be profitable purely on the basis of the market."
"This must be included in our cohesion policy."
"We must provide the population with affordable access to networks."
"The market will undertake to do this, if we do not place unnecessary obstacles in its way."
"We must provide high standard, safe content."
"This involves up-to-date training, innovation, research and development, and undoubtedly a more efficient protection of intellectual rights."
"If we had waited for too long to switch on electricity, the candle wax would have burnt our fingers."
"If we delay the issues relating to the information society much longer, the globalised ICT economy will be only too pleased to overtake us."
"We must take action urgently."
"The next item is the report (A6-0031/2006) by Jean Louis Cottigny, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on restructuring and employment (2005/2188(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank my fellow Members for entrusting me with this report."
"One of the methods I used in preparing this report was to listen."
"I met all of the social partners, employees and employers, I went to meet the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and I had a meeting with Commissioner Špidla and the Commission's partners."
"We also carried out a great deal of consultation with the shadow rapporteurs and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Bachelot, Mrs McDonald, Mrs Schroedter and Mr Beaupuy for their willingness to compromise and for the quality of their work."
"When we talk about restructuring, there is always a certain impression that people are surprised, and that it is a new phenomenon."
"In fact, it is as old as the hills and completely unavoidable."
"Society changes, moves on, modernises."
"It is quite normal for its economic activity to follow the same evolutionary curve."
"The technical progress made by humans has been resulting in restructuring for centuries."
"I will give you an example that I am sure will not offend anybody here: in the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, our ancestors experienced a great deal of restructuring."
"Having said that, it is true that the acceleration of progress and today's global market have given these phenomena a new face."
"Each new decision we take may result in restructuring."
"That is why I would like, if I may, to congratulate the Commission on having recognised, in its communication, that, since the EU is sometimes the cause for restructuring, such as in the textiles sector, it needs to bear its share of the responsibility by supporting it to the best of its ability."
"As you will have noticed, I have attempted throughout my report to stress the fact that restructuring is necessary, because in my view it ensures that our businesses remain economically competitive and thus safeguards jobs."
"However, in examining this issue, we cannot ignore restructuring based on false pretexts, which is in fact predicated on the hunt for an immediate profit."
"It is quite justifiable to condemn such behaviour as immoral, because it is absolutely unacceptable in today's Europe for a father with a family to support to find the factory gates locked on Monday morning, everything having been cleared out over the weekend."
"The role of our institutions, and of the social partners, is to intervene as early as possible, so as to plan for restructuring better and to soften the blow in terms of the social cost."
"This is because restructuring, whether or not it is justified, often leaves people by the wayside."
"Restructuring is not a phenomenon that affects any Member State in particular."
"We must not heed the siren's call that tries to set us in opposition to each other whenever we discuss employment in this Chamber."
"There are not two blocks with the old Member States on one side and the new ones on the other."
"No, there are 450 million Europeans from Tallinn to Lisbon, any of whom could suddenly find themselves in this situation."
"In my report, I have tried to define three spheres of action."
"First of all, there is a sphere of action to support what we might call good corporate citizens, by strengthening the tools for analysing the phenomenon, in order to prevent it in advance, increasing aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, encouraging continuing vocational training, which is a right for employees and an undeniable asset for businesses, reforming State aid to support growth and, in particular, setting up a globalisation adjustment fund."
"Secondly, there is a sphere of action to punish the 'gangster' companies, if I may call them that – they are certainly very much in the minority, but they are the ones we talk about the most."
"This type of action involves better monitoring of the use of the European funds in order to prevent subsidy tourism, challenging certain instances of restructuring with doubtful motives, and respecting the Community legal and its enforcement."
"Thirdly, there is a sphere of action to support those primarily affected by the phenomenon of restructuring: the workers."
"This involves setting up permanent retraining units to help people to find new positions as soon as possible after losing their jobs."
"It involves strengthening the role of the social partners, who are our greatest asset in dealing with these phenomena, and that is why I would ask you all once again to consider reviewing the European Works Councils directive."
"It also involves encouraging employees to become shareholders in their companies and setting up a one-stop shop to give all EU citizens equal access to care."
"To conclude, I think that, alongside the social partners and beyond any party political affiliations, we can help to provide support for restructuring in order to win the employment battle."
"We need to bear this in mind at a time when, from one minute to the next, it is possible for a decision taken by a board of directors on the other side of the world to completely destroy, here on our territory, the fruit of decades of work."
"This matter gives us the opportunity to get involved in the lives of our citizens, because that is what this is all about, behind all of our technical circumlocutions: men and women who just want to be happy."
"In the spirit of the founding fathers who created a Europe based on peace, it is up to us today to contribute to a Europe based on social peace."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, restructuring is essential, as it will allow the economy to develop, shedding the less productive activities and becoming stronger in key areas."
"It is, however, usually the case that the new jobs are not the same as the jobs that have been lost."
"The greatest number will be in services and in the most skilled professions."
"Industrial and less skilled jobs will disappear."
"This will involve social costs, and it is therefore essential to anticipate restructuring and to ensure that accompanying measures are in place, which is the shared responsibility of public authorities, firms and social partners."
"The communication on restructuring of 31 March 2005 was drafted precisely with this in mind."
"The Commission is grateful to Mr Cottigny and to all of the Members who contributed to the drafting of the report, which in principle supports the general consensus that has emerged on addressing the issue of restructuring."
"The Commission is pleased that Parliament supports the provision of significant funding from the European Union for the purposes of anticipating restructuring and ensuring that the accompanying measures are in place."
"Greater use must be made of the Structural Funds to support economic and social change in the regions and to retrain the workers most affected by restructuring so as to help them secure new and better jobs."
"In addition to this, the Commission recently adopted a proposal to create a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has already been put before you."
"The aim of this Fund is to ensure the necessary level of solidarity in the future between those who benefit from trade liberalisation and those who will lose their jobs as a result of globalisation."
"The Commission notes a number of interesting points in Mr Cottigny’s report, which it will pursue further. These include the idea of a European one-stop shop for restructuring, which I consider to be particularly interesting."
"As for improved monitoring of the way that Community funds are used, the Commission has proposed for the period 2007-2013 that Community funds tighten regulations on company relocations and broaden the responsibility for securing a return on investments."
"The Commission is also proposing that firms which infringe these regulations be obliged to return the aid they have received and that they be barred from receiving any aid in the future."
"If we wish to pursue a positive and constructive approach to economic and social change, the involvement of the public authorities is essential, on European, national and regional levels."
"At the same time, restructuring must principally involve those who are carrying it out and who will have to live with its consequences, that is to say firms and employees."
"It is precisely for this reason that last year’s communication focused also on the European social partners, calling on them to continue in the joint task of drawing up and implementing preventative and positive procedures on restructuring."
"The Commission has also called on the partners to find ways of strengthening the role of European works councils."
"The programme of work for future years, which has recently received the backing of the European partners, provides for continuing work on both of these issues."
"The Commission calls on the social partners to speed up the delivery of results in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, restructuring must not become a synonym for social decline and the loss of economic substance."
"It can also contribute to economic and social progress, provided it has been anticipated in time so that firms are able to manage it rapidly and efficiently, and public authorities are able to contribute with appropriate accompanying measures."
"I am delighted to find this view expressed in the introduction to the report from the European Parliament, and it must be our guide on the path to growth, social cohesion and higher standards of living."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, restructuring brings two worlds together: the economic world, where restructuring is necessary in order to face up to the changes mandated by globalisation and customer expectations, and the social world, where it is often a source of suffering and anxiety for employees."
"This restructuring is taking on a whole new dimension with the emergence of new powers, resulting in a new aspect to work sharing, which will lead to Europe being forced to develop the service sector while giving up on being an agricultural and industrial power."
"We refuse to accept this prospect."
"In this context, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to demonise necessary restructuring, but feels that the European market needs to promote a regulatory framework to absorb the shocks of this globalisation."
"The internal market is not the cause for restructuring – it is the antidote to it."
"Even so, this European model is also a humanist model, and we need to take into consideration the suffering caused to the people and the territories affected by this phenomenon."
"The question that arises is this: how can we encourage socially responsible restructuring?"
"Mr Cottigny's report allows us to look at a number of approaches, to which our group contributed."
"An initial approach involves reviewing the European Works Council directive and increasing the role of the social partners, following in-depth consultation with them: the rapporteur has proposed an amendment in this respect, which we support."
"Other approaches include access to expertise and the exchange of good practices, which is a relevant area for the open method of coordination; vocational training, with regard to which we are pleased that the support fund proposed by Mr Barroso supports retraining for the workers affected and is not devoted to risky salvage operations; and optimising the support for our solidarity policies from the ESF/ERDF structural funds, on condition, Commissioner, that they are not compromised by the delayed financial perspective."
"I will, of course, conclude by mentioning research and innovation."
"I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur Mr Cottigny for his open-mindedness, which made it possible to reach a number of compromises and which should, barring disasters, allow our group to vote in favour of his report."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the transparent way in which he worked on this report and so succeeded in uniting the committee."
"The way he did this was excellent."
"I also share the rapporteur’s view that restructuring is nothing new."
"If I look at my own home town, I note that the big workplaces that existed when I was a child are no longer there."
"Completely new workplaces have grown up."
"Society has changed as a result of this process, and workplaces are now of a higher quality than they were when I was growing up."
"That development will continue."
"What is new is that the process is happening so much more quickly in today’s globalised world, which is why we must have restructuring as an instrument."
"It may be seen as either a threat or an opportunity, but now that we have chosen a path to go down and said that we are not to compete with India and China with their low wages and their particular working conditions but, instead, retain a high level of wages and good social conditions, restructuring must be an instrument used in the Lisbon process."
"The issue is, however, one of how, then, we are to implement the restructuring."
"Firstly, we must have long-term planning."
"There are trends we need to be able to see."
"Moreover, we must act in time for, if we delay taking action, we may delay too long."
"Then, factories will simply have to close down. There will be no alternative."
"Our work to bring about change must take place in time."
"Secondly, there must be participation."
"Both sides of industry, including employees, must be involved in the whole process so that, when the restructuring process takes place in the form of skills updating and such like, people are prepared."
"Thirdly, experiences must be shared."
"I visited the Dublin Institute last weekend."
"There has been extensive analysis of successful restructuring processes, and there is a bank of information about them."
"I know, for example, that, following last year’s closure, 75% of former Electrolux employees in Västervik have now already obtained new jobs."
"There has been cooperation between the company, both sides of industry and the local community with a view to creating new jobs."
"Now that we are creating a new Globalisation Fund, let us not forget the old instruments: the Social Fund and skills updating, together with responsibility taken at national and regional levels."
"I am a supporter of the Globalisation Fund if it is used to strengthen individuals and increase employment and does not preserve old structures."
"However, we must also use the old instruments, such as the Social Fund, to promote the updating of skills."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion this report is pretty exemplary in many respects."
"I think the main reason for this is that the report we have before us sets out the problem well."
"Some of you, including the rapporteur himself, have pointed out that this is not a new problem – it has existed for millennia."
"I would just like to emphasise that these issues of adaptation – because restructuring is simply one aspect of the adaptation of businesses – are absolutely vital in order to be able to respond to the needs of the customer, which includes every one of us here."
"I am not going to repeat the various points made by the rapporteur when he presented the subject."
"What I would like to say, because I think he sets a very good example, is that he has made some very pragmatic proposals, which I would divide into six categories."
"This has been emphasised by several people."
"The first point is the need to take action as early as possible."
"Also, I would remind my fellow Members, if they need reminding, that we do not hear anything about the vast majority of incidences of restructuring, precisely because the decision is taken in advance."
"Secondly, we need the partners to be involved – the partners in the business, obviously, but also the regional and external partners."
"My final point, which has already been raised, is support for workers."
"Nevertheless, I would emphasise one very specific aspect, that of tailored support for employees, because general responses are not the only option."
"A tailored response really is needed."
"Each employee must be able to get an answer, through information, help looking for a new job, and so on."
"As for the companies themselves, we must, as you said, make a distinction between the fraudulent businesses – because there are some – and the most essential businesses, which need to be supported."
"Finally, there is support for disadvantaged regions."
"Mr Cottigny, I would like to thank you for the way you worked."
"As Mrs Bachelot said on behalf of her group, I would say, on behalf of my group, that there is a good chance, a very good chance, that we will support you."
"In conclusion, Commissioner, I obviously hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament's proposals, but I also hope that, beyond our European institutions, the various players – in the Member States, in the regions and in the chambers of commerce – and the various professional players will take note of the letter and the spirit of this report, so that restructuring is not a death sentence but rather an opportunity for these businesses and these workers to bounce back."
"– Mr President, It is indeed the case that the enterprises involved in restructuring always talk in terms of being pressured into it by something they compare to a force of nature suddenly overwhelming them, but I do not believe that they are right to do so."
"Restructuring and modernisation are things that enterprises are constantly obliged to do; indeed, they are a matter of social duty in respect of their workers."
"They are responsible for the continuing development of their skills, and this is where I agree with the rapporteur: workers are entitled to training, whether basic, advanced, or in-service."
"It is of course possible for vocational development and the training of professionals to be undertaken by publicly-funded bodies, but it would be outrageous for businesses to take the line that this was actually an obligation incumbent on the public sector, and that it had to take over responsibility for it."
"I concede that such restructuring or even relocations result in a great deal of unemployment in some regions, but I would remind those caught up in such situations of such instruments as the territorial pacts for employment that we – that is, this House together with the Commission – have put together."
"Studies testify to the fact that what made them really outstanding was that they involved all the local stakeholders."
"They are efficient; they were supported by European structural funds, and they were successful."
"It really does amaze me that the Commission is more reticent about its support for these territorial employment pacts and no longer has recourse to these options in the way it once did."
"Let me just say something about the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Our group, too, is in favour of such a fund, but participation in it must be restricted to those enterprises that actually do take upon themselves the social responsibility for ongoing training and development rather than passing it on to somebody else."
"That is the only way of preventing this fund being a merely token gesture."
"It is for that reason that the involvement of the public sector must be conditional on participation by all the stakeholders, including the enterprises, in social planning."
". This report addresses one of the main problems currently facing the EU, one which has serious ramifications in terms of unemployment, economic and social inequality and which hampers the development and even leads to the abandonment of vast areas."
"We feel it is essential that company restructuring should only take place when it is for the purpose of saving jobs and helping the business to develop, and never simply in order to increase profits at the expense of redundancies or for purely financial or speculative reasons, as is happening with increasing frequency."
"We therefore believe that a strong regulation is needed to combat such restructuring, which leads to investment without jobs and to thousands of redundancies."
"There also needs to be effective public monitoring of how Community aid is used and granted to businesses. The new regulations must ensure that the granting of aid is contingent on the protection of jobs with rights and on regional development in the medium term."
"Otherwise, business will be barred from receiving any aid."
"Consequently, we believe that the workers – through their representatives, namely the European Works Councils – should have the right to be involved at every stage of the process, which means having the right to vote, and therefore call for the directive on the European Works Councils to be reviewed."
". Mr President, I see that this afternoon we are to debate the European footwear sector."
"I use that as a restructuring example, since I live in Northampton, at one time the capital of British shoe-making."
"During the last 40 years the seven or eight big household names, the labour-intensive shoemakers in Northampton, have declined to barely one, while all the town’s engineering firms have gone."
"At the same time, the town has doubled in size and there are twice as many jobseekers, but there has been no unemployment problem."
"The rate in Northampton is currently a little less than the UK average of 5.5%, which is the lowest in the EU – Sweden and Denmark apart."
"So, how did we do it?"
"How did we restructure?"
"It was not done with EU schemes: this all began before the UK joined the then EC."
"Nor were EU funds involved."
"We did it by ourselves, by making our town attractive to the service sector."
"Barclaycard, for example, which is one of the biggest credit card companies, has had its headquarters in the town for a very long time."
"I know you do not like this self-help approach: it does not lend itself to EU interference, rules and regulations and the grand handing back of a country’s own money via unelected regional assemblies and development agencies."
"Only yesterday Mr Schulz complained that the elected MEPs in this House did not have as much say as the Council and the unelected Commission."
"So let us cancel Lisbon mark 2 and let national governments and local councils of Member States do the job they were democratically elected to do."
". Mr President, it is only to be expected that enterprises need to adjust to the new conditions and challenges resulting from a global economy, increased competitiveness and social changes."
"Our role is to take appropriate action to ensure that such changes are aimed at increasing competitiveness whilst minimising the social cost."
"As we consider new legal solutions at European level, we ought not to focus exclusively on the need to improve financial results and profitability."
"Our main concern must always be the good of the citizens."
"They are the people who elected us to represent their interests and promote their well being."
"The resources we have available should be directed mainly at the weakest regions, and most of the latter are located in the latest Member States to join the Union."
"In conclusion, and referring back to yesterday’s debate on relocation in the context of regional development, I venture to point out that many people, including Members of this House, were quick to forget the hopes awakened in the new Member States in the course of the pre-accession campaigns."
"There is also a tendency to forget the commitments made to those States."
"We need to remember that those are the countries where the situation is particularly difficult and unemployment is at its highest."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Today in this Chamber we stand once again at a crossroads: Europe must choose whether to continue opening up the markets in blind observance of the natural laws of competition or, on the other hand, to decide to protect its workers from the risks connected with excessive liberalisation."
"Once again, as a reformist, I believe that the right path is the middle way: preventing restructuring is an idle dream."
"What the EU can and must do is to hedge it about with incentives for small businesses, to make them as competitive as possible internationally, and disincentives against so-called subsidy tourism."
"An appropriate strategy should also be introduced to facilitate by all possible means the full, satisfactory integration of our human resources in order to combat unemployment and prevent a brain drain outside our borders."
"In cases of inevitable restructuring, the EU also ought to provide all the support necessary to restrict dismissals and give fair protection to workers, with the help of the funds that the rapporteur rightly called for."
"Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner when he said on opening this debate that restructuring is necessary so that activity which is no longer sufficiently productive can be cut back."
"The issue is how restructuring should be managed and who should do the managing."
"Again I agree with the Commissioner that this should be for the companies themselves, for the employers, and the workers directly involved."
"This report was originally due to be voted on in the February part-session, but the major political groups quite reasonably agreed to delay this for a month, to give time to try to improve it."
"This extra time has certainly been necessary."
"Progress has been made in terms of some of the amendments now tabled."
"Indeed, my colleague Mrs Bachelot-Narquin has been very active in this regard and I thank her for that."
"But we should not only be adopting the positive amendments, we really should be deleting some of the original paragraphs entirely."
"Until we do, this report will primarily be about resisting change and promoting the power of the trade unions to deal with it."
"It should be about enabling change and promoting the power of the workers to cope with it."
"It will be clear to the rapporteur that I still do not like his report."
"It needs not just improvement, it needs – may I say – restructuring."
"As he knows, I was one of those who voted against his report in committee, in part to help us table further amendments for this part-session, but I should say now that my fellow UK Conservatives, as well as certain other national delegations that I know of, reserve the right to vote against it in the plenary sitting tomorrow."
"Although it is a non-legislative report, it would be a pity to vote down a report on such an important subject."
"But it would still be better to vote it down than to give the wrong message that this Parliament is more concerned with trying to preserve the past than with helping employers and employees come to terms with the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Hutchinson report, which we debated yesterday evening, the Cottigny report sets out the debate on the restructuring and relocation of businesses."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for having raised these socio-economic problems, which create more anguish and social insecurity for our fellow citizens than almost anything else."
"It is fortunate that Parliament is debating these issues, because, Commissioner, the Commission must take steps as a matter of urgency."
"These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees."
"In the minds of European employees, relocation and restructuring are connected and practically synonymous, because they have the same effects: the same loss of their jobs after years of working in the same sector, sometimes even in the same company, and the same questioning of their value on the labour market."
"This need not be the case, because restructuring is sometimes a sign of progress, technical progress."
"Restructuring does not have the same economic causes as relocation, and the legislator needs to provide an appropriate solution to each problem."
"I would like to focus on the issue of restructuring of companies caused by technical developments, which is actually the central point in Mr Cottigny's report."
"This issue sets the European Union the challenge of adapting to the increasingly rapid developments of our age of technical progress."
"It really sets us the challenge of anticipating those developments."
"It has been said that to govern means to foresee."
"Equally, to do business, to be at the leading edge of production and economic competition, also means to foresee."
"It is a matter not of adapting to progress but of anticipating it, of inventing it."
"In this respect, the responsibility rests solely with the companies – they must produce and they must help their employees to anticipate by providing them with continuing training."
"That is the issue raised by the Cottigny report, and I would ask you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to support these proposals."
"– Mr President, I am very grateful to Mr Cottigny for the very hard work he has done on this report."
"I do, however, doubt that the report’s underlying goal – that of lessening the social impact of restructuring – is actually capable of being achieved."
"Firstly, the European Union sets enhanced competitiveness in global markets as the goal of economic activity and hence also of restructuring, and that amounts to nothing other than an attempt to seek out and find the weak areas outside the EU, to which the losers can be transported."
"Secondly, if society really is to be able to alleviate the consequences of restructuring, the funds for those who lose out to globalisation would have to be so substantial that they would themselves reduce competitiveness."
"If, then, we in the EU are not to export our problems, we should say ‘yes’ to restructuring, but ask ourselves how it should work."
"What is needed is another way of managing things economically, another way in which society’s goods can be produced, that really is founded upon social and global sustainability."
"The object of this must not be to beat our competitors at any cost, and we must not allow this to shape our thinking."
"That is the real challenge that we face."
"– Mr President, words are fine, but we need to move on to actions."
"We need to go and say everything that is heard here in this Chamber in your constituency in Thessalonika or in Macedonia or in Naoussa, which is a dead town: relocations have brought unemployment, they have brought poverty, they have brought social injustice and death."
"That is the truth."
"IKEA opened in Athens and two and a half thousand small shops and handicrafts closed."
"How are they supposed to restructure?"
"As you know, when big business arrives, small businesses drown."
"It is now a jungle; it is an ocean in which the big fish eats the small fish."
"Carrefour arrives with 20 000 square metres and all the small shops in the entire region close."
"So what are we to do there?"
"What shall we do?"
"How can we help?"
"This is the reality."
"We have a major problem."
"We have unbridled capitalism, which invades life and buries the dreams of the weakest."
"Nothing is working today."
"We have approximately 20% unemployment in Macedonia, which was once the worksite of the whole of Europe."
"What are we to do there?"
"How are we to save this world from want and poverty?"
"Let us make a new army of ."
"That is the problem."
"That is where you need to intervene, that is where you need to help."
"Mr President, the Commission’s proposal on restructuring and employment contains the conclusion that policies aimed at blocking change and freezing economic structures can only defer the problem and thereby exacerbate the negative effects."
"Various measures concerning restructuring that are mentioned in Parliament’s report, however, unfortunately go in precisely this direction and could make it difficult for businesses to adapt to changes in the markets."
"The report’s analysis of the situation and conclusions conflict with the measures proposed."
"For example, the report mentions the slow growth of the European Union’s economy, the low competitiveness of businesses and workforce mobility."
"Later in the report, however, it is suggested that restructuring should not be used to increase business profitability by reducing the numbers of workers."
"The report’s proposal for a growth adjustment fund is yet another example of short-term thinking."
"The best way to preserve jobs is to create new jobs."
"The report ought also to emphasise this aspect."
"Thus, in the field of restructuring, policy ought first of all to be directed towards implementing those socio-economic models that are geared towards permanent change."
"The measures taken ought to foster the development of self-regulatory capacity in the Member States and the European Union as a whole."
"Only thus will it be possible to balance growth and high employment in the long-term too."
"Mr President, much has been said in this House about the fact that nowadays economies are increasingly globalised and competitive."
"This is the way things are and entrepreneurs therefore need to implement modern management."
"A key feature of the latter is the ability to react in a flexible manner to changing market conditions, particularly with regard to new competitive challenges."
"Given the circumstances, it is not possible to manage enterprises effectively without ongoing cost analysis and a readiness to undertake necessary restructuring."
"It is important to keep in mind that the consequences of shying away from appropriate restructuring are always painful for both the entrepreneurs and the workers."
"We should keep this constantly in mind as we debate Mr Cottigny’s report on restructuring and employment."
"I am sure the quality of the document is much improved as a result of the work by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Nevertheless, I am bound to say that in my opinion the text is still controversial, because it adopts an overly distrustful stance towards entrepreneurs restructuring their business or planning to do so."
"As a Member representing one of the countries that recently joined the European Union, I am particularly concerned about the proposals to impose penalties on companies transferring all or part of their activities to those parts of the Union where the production costs are lower."
"Entrepreneurs taking decisions of this nature are certainly not resorting to ‘immoral or predatory tactics’ – I quote from the document before us."
"In my view, precisely the opposite is the case."
"They are demonstrating sound management skills and taking responsibility for the company’s future."
"They are therefore acting to promote the development of the Union’s economy and increase its competitiveness."
"I would remind you that this is one of the fundamental aims of the Lisbon Strategy, so dear to all our hearts"
"Introducing elements of central planning into the European economy is not the right way to respond to the social consequences of restructuring either."
"This has already been proved unsuccessful and not just in post-Communist states."
"The only appropriate response is to improve qualifications, promote lifelong learning amongst the workers and encourage worker mobility."
"I should like to send out a further appeal in that regard and call for the transitional arrangements for access to labour markets to be lifted at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Cottigny on his report."
"In my country, the Netherlands, restructuring and globalisation are weighty topics, and opinions differ as to how to deal with them."
"The Social-Democrats, among whom I number myself, take the view that it is unnecessary to pump funds from the Netherlands to Brussels and back and that that is not the answer."
"Whilst it follows that not everyone in my country is pleased with the proposed European globalisation fund, I should nevertheless like to express my support for it, and would wish to add that I think that we should draw on existing ESF structures as much as we can."
"Why am I, all things considered, in favour of it?"
"It is because citizens need support in order to deal with the adverse effects of globalisation."
"If that support is not forthcoming from their own governments – which, in the Netherlands, it is not in the case of certain regions, the north being one example – then we are happy to receive that support from Europe."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your discussion with interest and I feel that it has emerged from a period of thorough preparation and that the consensus displayed in it is very strong."
"I would like to respond to some of the questions that have directly or indirectly been raised."
"On the topic of informing and consulting employees, this is the second phase consultation with the social partners."
"On the topic of safeguarding the right of employees to be informed and consulted in advance of restructuring measures, this obligation is set out in a number of Community directives."
"These directives must be strictly upheld."
"I would like to stress the fundamental importance of social dialogue in firms, as it represents an instrument for anticipating and managing restructuring, and the communication therefore presents the second phase consultation with the European social partners as something that involves company restructuring and European works councils in equal measure."
"I hope that the social partners will begin to work intensively towards the introduction of mechanisms for implementing and monitoring the reference principles outlined a year and a half ago in relation to restructuring, and to make use of European works councils as mediators for change at a company level."
"The Commission takes the view that this is one of their key tasks."
"The legislative route cannot entirely be ruled out, but in the present phase it would be more appropriate and beneficial to let the social partners handle matters."
"On the question of Community assistance for relocations, I would like to state that the current framework provides for the cancellation of aid from the Structural Funds in cases where a given business undergoes significant change, for example where it is relocated within five years of a decision being made and the allocation of resources taking place."
"I would also say that, in respect of the 2007-2013 programming period, the Commission is proposing an increase of this guarantee to seven years, along with a requirement that any aid received must be reimbursed where this regulation has been infringed, and that any firm that breaches this requirement once would be excluded from receiving further aid in the future."
"The Commission recently adopted a proposal for a regulation establishing a Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"It will be up to you to discuss it with the Council and to decide whether to approve it."
"The Commission is fully prepared to discuss the terms applying to the fund, and I have noted a number of ideas that I regard as important in this respect."
"Among these is undoubtedly the idea that the companies themselves must contribute within the framework of restructuring, and that the strategy of shifting all costs to the public purse cannot be supported."
"I would also like to stress the direct and short-term nature of the assistance provided through this Fund, in contrast to the more structured activities of the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund."
"This means that the Fund is wholly and explicitly conceived of as being complementary to existing instruments, supplementing them in areas where they are not effective."
"As I have already stated, the Social Fund, as well as other Structural Funds, allows for long-term activities aimed at adapting regions, sectors and work processes to economic and social change, in contrast to the short-term demands of specific exceptional situations."
"This is a priority set for the target of the Structural Funds, which is competitiveness and employment in the 2007–2013 period."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the unifying idea in this discussion has undoubtedly been that restructuring provides opportunities, but that the human costs will be unacceptably high if it is not managed properly."
"These opportunities arise from the fundamental structure of our society and the fundamental structure of modern development in general, in that it constitutes a search for ever more effective and more technologically advanced solutions in the economic and social spheres."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a basic component of the EU Treaty that the aim of our efforts should be quality of life in the everyday sense of the word."
"In my view, the communication or report that Parliament is now putting forward is an inspiring document which represents a step in that direction."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report by Mrs Lissy Gröner and Mrs Amalia Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality (COM(2005)0081-C6-0083/2005-2005/0017(COD)) (A6-0043/2006)."
", . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality answers a fundamental demand to provide a new instrument for the European policy of gender equality, enabling further progress to be made."
"I am sure you will agree with me that gender equality is an economic just as much as a political goal, as well as being a fundamental building block of our democratic society."
"It constitutes a defining principle of Europe’s economic, social and political life."
"The full participation of women, with completely equal opportunities and full participation in the workplace has become a key element of the European economy within a Union that has to cope with an aging population and demographic loss."
"The Commission’s reports for the years 2005 and 2006 on gender equality show, however, that progress has been slow in this area."
"There are still major obstacles in the way of this social aim."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we fail to exploit the potential offered by women, we will not achieve the Lisbon objectives, and moreover we will be unable to compete on a global level."
"Gender equality, besides its underlying political aspects, constitutes a key competitive factor for us in the fierce arena of global competition."
"In the interests of eliminating all remaining inequality between men and women, it is now a priority of the first order to redouble efforts at Union and Member State levels, paying regard particularly to the increased heterogeneity of the enlarged Union."
"For these reasons, the creation of an instrument operating at a European level has since 1999 been viewed as essential."
"The European Council, in June 2004, therefore called on the Commission to submit a proposal."
"The Commission submitted the proposal to set up an institution which would be a technical instrument assisting European bodies and especially the Commission in developing policies and in guiding Member States on their implementation."
"The priority task will be to gather, analyse and distribute objective, reliable and comparable data within a Community setting."
"The institute will also develop appropriate methodological resources, aimed especially at incorporating a gender perspective into Community policies."
"Eventually, it will also contribute to the greater visibility of Community policy, which is particularly important at the present time and which is in principle also a building block of the democratic political process, as it is imperative that issues are there for all to see."
"Where an issue is not in view, or has been concealed, it is very difficult to mobilise public opinion and to achieve majority consent."
"Our proposal is the outcome of numerous analyses and it takes account of the results of two studies into operability, as well as the countless discussions that have taken place."
"One of the studies was carried out by the Commission and the other by the European Parliament, which has backed the establishment of the institute since 2002."
"The proposal takes account of budgetary restrictions and does not represent new expenditure against the European budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wants this institution to become a centre of excellence."
"At present, no such centre exists on a European level."
"There are some excellent university or other such bodies, but no centre of this type."
"It is therefore necessary for us to respond, and the Commission has therefore decided to meet the pressing demand of all subjects."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this House has, for a long time, been calling for an Equality Institute; not only do we raise this demand every year on International Women’s Day, but we also want to see real improvements in the quality of equality policy, and that is why we endorse the Commission’s proposal."
"The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with the object of guaranteeing broad support, entrusted the work on the report to the two major groups, in the persons of Mrs Sartori and myself."
"We agreed on compromises and jointly tabled a series of amendments generally aimed at slimming down the administration and ensuring the primacy of policy-making."
"We want to avoid duplication and prevent overlaps with other agencies."
"We want to ensure that all the expertise on equality issues that is to be found in the national institutes – the gender experts, the universities, the non-governmental organisations – can be drawn together into one network."
"We have proposed additions to the Commission proposal with the intention of involving civil society in an advisory role."
"The Gender Institute will have a very important role to play in ensuring that we, as political decision-makers, can speedily draw on the results of gender research and thereby improve the lawmaking process."
"It is intended that the Institute should be a centre of excellence, and independent, although it will, of course, follow the guidelines set by the European Union and by our policies."
"It will be a milestone, and will have an effect far beyond the borders of the European Union, but there is a risk that people will say – as some Members of this House are already doing – that we do not want an institute specifically for gender issues, but that it should, instead, be combined with the Human Rights Agency."
"The great danger of that, I think, would be that it would no longer be ensured that the European Union’s programmes were visible to the public."
"As with the equality programme, what is needed is an instrument with an outward effect."
"I do not believe that PROGRESS has enabled us to ensure visibility, and we must have the certainty that the Equality Institute will do that."
"What is needed is a small, high-class institute that works to powerful effect."
"Saying ‘no’ to it today would be a major setback to the European Union’s equality policy, and a major setback too to the equality roadmap that was so convincingly presented last week."
"It was Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, who set out the timetable last week."
"Let us, by saying ‘yes’ to the Sartori/Gröner report today, ensure that the timetable can be kept to and that there are no delays."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my voice to that of my fellow Member, Mrs Gröner, in support of a vote on this Commission proposal that meets a need felt in all the countries of Europe, and not just by women."
"In reality, as has already been explained by both the Commissioner and Mrs Gröner, this issue has been under debate for a long time: the idea of setting up a gender institute goes back to more than ten years ago, at the suggestion of the then Swedish minister for equal opportunities."
"The work continued for five years, and debate was thorough; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women."
"The European Commission prepared a feasibility study and presented it, and one year ago, on 8 March, this decision was taken."
"It has already been said that this study was a joint and very significant effort by our Parliamentary committee, which took action to ensure that the institute becomes what we all wanted to see: a very flexible technical instrument, with the task of collating all the data supplied by statistical bodies and of disseminating this information in order to give all operators and all those responsible for legislating and taking action the opportunity to make choices that take into account the gender viewpoint."
"Some people will wonder whether a gender institute is really necessary."
"I definitely believe that it is, and this is confirmed by data available to all."
"As an example, the European directive on equal pay was adopted thirty years ago, in 1975, but today in Europe we still have an average inequality of 15%, while in some countries the figure is very close to 30%."
"Employment data also tell a story: Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market, not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence."
"In my view there is a need for this institute; we still require an institute of gender for women, aimed at women."
"The structure will be highly consolidated: there will be nine members of the governing board, plus a representative from the Commission and a representative for every country in the consultative committee."
"I would like to end by saying that the opposing positions are of two kinds: some people want to merge everything into an institute for human rights, and there are already plans to set this up in Vienna."
"If I wished to assist Commissioner Frattini I would agree, but I believe that this is not what women need."
"Others believe that it would cost too much, but my reply to that is that in Europe we have four bodies working on employment and they cost EUR 66 million a year; this body, on the other hand, will only cost EUR 8 million."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that we in the European Union need another effective instrument to enable us to take greater strides towards equality for women and men, for if we carry on mincing along in the way we are now, establishing equality will still be a struggle even for our great-grand-daughters."
"The planned Institute for Equality Issues can be that additional instrument, but, as we European parliamentarians – and we women in particular – want not only to work hard, but also to do so to lasting effect, the future gender institute must also have the right framework conditions in which to operate, and those include the funding available to it, with which it will have to manage."
"There are two comments that the Committee on Budgets and its permanent rapporteur on agencies would like to make in this regard."
"Firstly, we already have 23 agencies, many of which are being set up or in the course of restructuring, and all of them need a lot of money."
"If our agreement with the Council on the next financial framework results in less money all round than this House has proposed, this will affect the decentralised agencies too."
"Secondly, the Commission has proposed – and to this proposal this House has not objected – that the Gender Institute should be fully financed through the Fifth Strand of PROGRESS."
"In June of last year, this House, in its position on the Financial Perspective, allocated over EUR 850 million to PROGRESS, but the Council, in December, cut almost 300 million from that amount."
"Without adequate funding, though, we will be unable to achieve any lasting effects where equality is concerned."
"Real policy-making and real work require real money if we are not to find ourselves building yet more Potemkin villages, frustrating workers, and throwing sand in the public’s face."
"– Before I offer a few thoughts of my own, I would like to express support for my colleague who spoke shortly before me about the importance of funding for the successful work of the institute."
"I speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I wish to express my satisfaction regarding the proposal for the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality."
"I did in fact propose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that it should be called an agency rather than an institute."
"Through this amendment I sought to stress the political commitment of the institution, rather than its academic dimension, which would be conveyed by the word institute."
"In any event, to coincide with international women’s day as it were, by taking this decision the European Parliament is encouraging a new step in the establishment of equal opportunities, something I consider to be one of the fundamental ambitions of a modern Europe."
"I hope that the institute will not be simply a passive statistical office there to measure equality or inequality, but will also be an active proponent of new strategies that will ensure actual progress in respect of equality."
"I cannot resist the temptation to tell this distinguished Chamber about Slovenia’s candidacy to host the institute."
"If Slovenia is chosen, this will be an encouraging decision, for while on the one hand we have been particularly successful in our transition, the data do indicate, however, that men have enjoyed greater success than women."
"On the other hand the authorities are striving actively to change things, and in this light establishing the institute in a new Member State would be an auspicious decision, since it would encourage positive shifts."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Mrs Gröner and Mrs Sartori for their excellent teamwork within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"Let me take the liberty of asking an iconoclastic question: could we do without a monitoring centre dealing exclusively with the differences in the treatment of men and women?"
"Thirty years on, despite all of our European directives, the continuing lack of equality in the treatment of men and women in all economic activities is an insult to our democracy."
"The demographic issue has not been resolved."
"In the interests of fathers, mothers and children, we must reconcile family life and professional life as a matter of urgency."
"The Lisbon Strategy has been far from successful."
"Who takes the creation of the human capital of future generations seriously?"
"Who takes solidarity between the generations seriously?"
"These informal, unpaid economic activities are hard work, and are mostly performed by women."
"Neither is the role of men in the process of gender equality taken into account at all."
"I consequently think it is worthwhile to promote methods of monitoring and condemning the unacceptable differences suffered by women compared to men."
"Any initiative that objectively condemns these injustices cannot fail to be welcome, going beyond any political differences of opinion."
". – Mr President, the strength of one’s commitment to gender equality should not be measured by support for the establishment of a Gender Institute."
"The rapporteurs explain that they support that body: ‘since it ensures that the overarching objective of gender equality ... will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level’."
"This misconceived objective explains why a separate institute is in fact a bad idea."
"There is no hierarchy of oppression."
"The promoters see it as more important to have the kudos of an exclusive body than the reality of an across-the-board transformation of society."
"The Gender Institute should in fact be part of the new EU Agency on Fundamental Rights, just as the Anti-Racism Monitoring Centre will be."
"If gender is the only equality objective that stays outside the Fundamental Rights Agency, that will create an unbalanced model as well as weakening the latter agency."
"It may also ensure that gender equality becomes an isolated backwater rather than the highly visible flag-carrier that its supporters want."
"It seems to me quite defensive to say that you need a separate institute to ensure that gender equality remains high on the EU political agenda."
"On the contrary, women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"That is the opinion of the UK’s Equal Opportunities Commission and I endorse that."
". – Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance gives its wholehearted backing to an independent and effective gender institute, and endorses Mrs Gröner’s and Mrs Sartori’s report in its entirety."
"Many in this House ask why we need a new Institute."
"Why do we need one?"
"We need one because gender equality is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, for the European Union has said that we see equality as one of the European Union’s values, and because we know that women are still being discriminated against."
"Contrary to what Mrs Ludford has just said, we are not talking here only about violations of human rights."
"This discrimination is going on in the labour market, in sport, and in many other areas."
"We know that women have a part to play in shaping the future, not only in terms of their potential in the Lisbon process, but also, for example, in terms of demography, where their role is positively crucial."
"Mothers, in particular, have a central role to play as regards the violations of the rights of women migrants."
"Yesterday, we heard from Commissioner Frattini how we still have too few statistics on forced prostitution."
"This European Gender Institute is what we need."
"In the past, the European Union was a beacon of equality policy."
"A ‘no’ vote would be a disaster; it would mean a real rupture in the European Union, and would amount to an admission by this House that its equality policy had nothing left to offer."
"It is for these reasons that I urge the House to vote in large numbers in favour of this Equality Institute."
"It needs to be made visible in this way."
"The Gender Institute is not, however, a substitute for legislative initiative."
"We will be vigilant in ensuring that equality policy does not run into the sand."
"The Gender Institute must not be allowed to become a means of appeasement or of distraction from the lack of legislative action."
"A Gender Institute will not make equality policy any less necessary a component in legislation, and we really will hold the Commission to that."
"So let me again ask for really strong support for this report."
"I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, especially Mrs Gröner and Mrs Sartori, for their committed work on this issue."
"I fully support this, as does the whole group."
"We realise that an institute cannot in itself bring about increased equality but appreciate that, if it is designed in the right way, it can be an incredibly important tool for successful work in promoting equality."
"I should like to indicate two proposals that would further reinforce the work of the institute: firstly, that it be possible effectively to evaluate the consequences for women or, as the case may be, for men of decisions at all levels; and, secondly, that the board be composed of six people from the Council, six from the Commission and a further three from, as appropriate, an employees’ or employers’ organisation and a voluntary organisation."
"I think that these last three should also have voting rights and that the voluntary organisation should be a women’s organisation."
". Mr President, in its effort to achieve equality between the sexes the European Commission intends to devote EUR 50 million to the activities of the planned European Institute for Gender Equality."
"This body is to be charged with ensuring equal pay for equal work, doing away with gender stereotypes and also promoting equality between the sexes beyond the European Union."
"I would, however, like to remind the House that almost 70 million of the 450 million inhabitants of the European Union are living in poverty."
"This represents 15% of the population and is a clear indication of inequality."
"It is also a violation of fundamental human rights and an affront to human dignity."
"In the interests of peace it would be appropriate to help the poor, do away with unemployment and sort out the situation in the health service."
"That would be far more beneficial than encouraging ill feeling between men and women, which always has negative consequences for women."
"Any inequalities relating to remuneration could be remedied by means of a single legal act, which would not require such extensive funding."
"Instead of attempting to even out the natural imbalances in various areas of the economy and professional life, and promoting equality beyond the Union, we ought to be focusing on equality within the Union."
"The aforementioned funds would be more usefully spent on helping at least the children living in poverty by improving their living conditions."
"Promoting the family should take precedence over the elimination of gender stereotypes and would help reverse the current trend to relegate the family to the level of an outmoded cultural curiosity."
". Mr President, equality between men and women is an oft-repeated mantra within the European Union."
"Common sense tells us, however, that this is not at all a straightforward matter."
"Men and women are referred to as such precisely because they are different."
"They are equal in terms of dignity but they are different."
"This is obvious in the world of sport mentioned earlier."
"I have recently been attempting to discover how the European Commission understands this formula, especially as the formula is very often accompanied by the corollary in all areas."
"So be it."
"I therefore enquired if this equality stems from the law of nature or from statute law, and what can be done to enable men to bear children."
"Commissioner Špidla replied that the principle of gender equality only applies to work and to access to goods and services."
"That is contrary to fact."
"After all, Article 23 in Chapter III of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union clearly refers to all areas."
"If the European Commission is unable to resolve the problem in European law, I doubt the planned institute will manage to do so."
"Mr President, one thing is certain: there is no lack of structures and networks of all kinds devoted to studying and standing up for women."
"There are the Institute for Gender Equality, various NGOs, ad hoc committees, fundamental rights agencies, consultative forums on women's rights, the European women's lobby, and our own committee within Parliament."
"Therefore, is it really reasonable to set up a new European Institute for Gender Equality?"
"In this cloud of structures, not always operating in perfect harmony in terms of the exchange of information, will this new body, which is supposed to network all of this information, have actual resources allowing it to exist?"
"To be clear, can we now be sure that, beyond its future operationality, it will be completely politically and financially independent?"
"It would appear not, as the Commission is not inclined to give this future institute very much room for manoeuvre."
"Indeed, its reluctance to allow the director of the institute to be answerable solely to the management board and not to the Commission is very revealing in that regard."
"For all these reasons and more besides, I cannot vote in favour of this initiative to create what I would describe as just yet another labyrinthine system."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the founding of a European institute for gender mainstreaming, a substantial long-term task highlighted by the Treaty of Amsterdam and positively influenced by the process that followed the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, has become a theme of political discussion between supporters and opponents of the Institute."
"I am one of those who support the shared view of the rapporteurs, Mrs Gröner and Mrs Sartori, who have managed to find a common solution on behalf of the two largest political groups in the European Parliament."
"I admire and appreciate their work on this report, and in particular their patient awareness-raising campaign advocating the setting up of the Institute as a coordinator whose task will be to provide technical support for EU gender policy implementation, stimulating and acting in partnership with existing institutions, disseminating information and enhancing the visibility of issues relating to gender equality."
"I do not support the amendment suggesting that the Institute be integrated into the EU’s Human Rights Agency based in Vienna, as the entire problem area would then become part of an existing agenda, and this would certainly not fulfil the EU’s ambition to strengthen its equal opportunities policy."
"As the most recent reports also suggest, inequalities between men and women still persist."
"The existence of inequality is a matter for society as a whole and not just for women."
"Establishing the Institute will be a major building block for the recently adopted roadmap on implementing equal opportunity policy."
"In financial terms, the Institute will not be a significant burden, as funding will come from sources that are already in place."
"The added value of the Institute will also include activities targeted outside the European Union, especially with regard to enlargement, where equal opportunities are, and will remain, a topical agenda."
"In conclusion, I am convinced that locating the Institute in one of the new Member States will further the cause of even-handed institutional decentralisation in the European Union."
"– Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteurs on their report and express my satisfaction with the Commission’s efforts to provide the European Union with an independent body specifically dedicated to gender equality issues."
"I would like to emphasise the need for the Institute to have full independence, without conditions of any kind."
"This is a fundamental objective if the Institute is to be able to fulfil its objectives, which go far beyond simply providing the Commission with technical assistance."
"As a working method, I believe that the idea of creating a European gender equality network is clearly very innovative and effective, above all with a view to meeting the essential time and distance requirements for the sharing and exchange of knowledge, information and policies."
"With regard to the structure of the Institute, I believe that an acceptable solution to the issue of the composition of the Management Board has finally been found. This provides for a fair and effective distribution of functions amongst the three institutions, and one appropriate to the actual situation of a body that will unfortunately be under-funded and under-staffed."
"In this regard, I would like to emphasise that, in order for the Institute to be able to fulfil its objectives, adequate funding that gives credibility to the European Union’s commitment to gender equality is essential."
"This is something that we must all bear very much in mind at the moment in the negotiations that are taking place amongst the different institutions with regard to funding."
"– Mr President, I am in favour of establishing a separate, active and independent European Institute for Gender Equality."
"The EU’s firm policy on equality would be a resource."
"Women are participating more and more in the labour market, and men less and less."
"In the future we cannot afford to neglect or ignore existing human resources."
"The Gender Equality Institute could, however, have an influence on this situation."
"Within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the equality standpoint carried a lot of weight at first, but it has been forgotten about."
"The issue of equality should be made far more prominent, and in respect of that an active Institute could work to make the EU stronger and more competitive than ever."
"– I would like to thank the rapporteurs for drafting this report, which should culminate in the establishment of the European Gender Institute."
"The task of the Institute will be to collect and analyse gender equality data in the EU countries, as well as to organise conferences and campaigns."
"It seems to me entirely wrong to call into question the establishment of the Institute and, in this regard, I also object to the way that doubt has been cast on the Slovak Republic as a potential location for the Institute."
"I am not going to list every institution that is based in the territories of the fifteen old Member States."
"I respect the fact that during the founding of the European Union such centres had to be established and further developed as part of a coordinated joint action."
"I therefore urge you to cast your votes in favour of establishing this Institute."
"The Gender Institute could function as an ombudsman for women, a mediator between the government and non-governmental organisations in eliminating injustices, such as discrimination in labour relations."
"After all, it is widely known that the lowest wages are commonly found in so-called ‘female sectors’, that is, in education and healthcare, whereas the highest wages are typical of male-dominated occupations, such as the armed forces and police."
"Are the health and education of future generations perhaps less important?"
"Mr President, I would of course like to congratulate the two rapporteurs and all of the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who have done so much work on this report."
"I believe that this Institute needs to be a useful instrument, but how useful it is will depend on whether or not the governments really have the political will to achieve equality between men and women."
"I say that because, as Mrs Sartori has said, there has been legislation to ensure that men and women are paid the same for the same job for more than fifty years."
"Nevertheless, we are in 2006 and many women still earn less than men for the same job or have contracts that do not correspond to the work that they are actually doing."
"These effective measures, therefore, which are what women need in our European society, require that laws be put into practice and not that more and more laws be created."
"To this end, we need political will expressed through money, money that has to be provided for in the budgets, both national budgets and European Union budgets."
"I want genuine equality, and what, of course, I do not want is political propaganda."
"When governments that claim to be very progressive present plans such as, for example, the National Reform Plan that has been presented by the government of my country, they often include phrases such as ‘benefits will be given for the contracting of young unemployed males of under thirty years of age’ while at the same time not providing for any measure for women of under thirty years of age, amongst whom, in my country, there is a much higher rate of unemployment than amongst men."
"I call this demagoguery: saying one thing but doing another, and that is precisely what we must avoid in the European Union."
"I therefore say yes to this Institute, but it must serve a genuine purpose."
"I would like to thank the two co-rapporteurs, Mr Gröner and Mrs Sartori, for their excellent work."
"Indeed, this report adds to the Commission's initial text a number of improvements that I had also proposed in my draft opinion in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I would like to point to four of them."
"First of all, there is the proactive role given to the institute, particularly through its analysis and expertise missions and the option it is given of submitting its recommendations and guidelines to the Community institutions."
"Next, there is the importance of cooperation with the fundamental rights agency."
"Then there is the need for balanced participation of men and women in the management board, and, finally, there is the role of the European Parliament, particularly concerning the nomination of the director of the institute and of the members of the management board and monitoring their work."
"This Gender Institute is a vital part of a true Europe of citizens, and I was extremely disappointed that my draft report was rejected by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, 18 votes to 18, because part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and part of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wanted to prevent this institute from seeing the light of day."
"That said, I am also pleased to see that the co-rapporteurs have incorporated the essential elements of my concerns into their report."
"– I am delighted with this report."
"I believe that it is very important for the identity of the new modern Europe."
"The equal opportunities problem is especially relevant in the states of Eastern Europe."
"Indeed, it is no accident that Slovenia, Slovakia and Lithuania aspire to establish this institute in their countries."
"Women in Eastern European states are still frequently regarded as homemakers and are not integrated into economic processes."
"The European Parliament has its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"In many European states there are ministries, departments and other institutions dedicated to gender equality."
"That is why I believe it is logical to establish such an institution across the entire European Union."
"I, therefore, endorse the efforts of rapporteurs L. Gröner and A. Sartori, together with their argument that an independent institute can operate much more effectively than one which is part of another agency."
"I would like to stress that the institute is needed for men as well as women, and it is a shame that the majority of those speaking today were women."
"– Mr President, the feminists’ ridiculous slogan about gender equality is detrimental to women."
"This slogan ascribes great value to male characteristics and suggests that women also possess them."
"That is not the case."
"Women possess female characteristics and the latter must also be valued."
"References to wives that do not work are insulting, because these women work very hard in the home."
"Their work should be valued and recognised as being worth at least as much as work undertaken by men if not more."
"One of the most unfortunate features of contemporary society is that women are being forced to work outside the home for financial reasons, because it is impossible to bring up a family on a single wage."
"This is happening against a background of high unemployment."
"Women cannot be asked to contribute in the same way as men."
"For example, they cannot be expected to work shifts or to spend several days away from home."
"This is because we simply are not equal."
"Women are of inestimable value due to their role as mothers, which is why they deserve special consideration and protection."
"They do not need an institute."
"Mr President, a European Institute for Gender Equality is urgently needed, because even in the heart of Europe in the 21st century we are regularly witnessing discrimination on the grounds of sex."
"Women account for 52% of the population of Europe and they are constantly experiencing discrimination in many areas of their lives."
"This new Institute must not simply restrict itself to gathering statistical data if it is to promote and implement a gender equality policy effectively in the enlarged Union."
"It must focus instead on analysing the data in detail and drafting the advice and guidelines needed to mainstream the concept of gender equality effectively in the European legal system."
"It should be borne in mind that gender equality, which the Institute is charged with promoting, is a fundamental right and a priority Community policy."
"It is enshrined in the Treaty and must be implemented across all areas of social and economic activity, notably as regards access to employment and entrepreneurship."
"It would be appropriate for the Institute’s seat to be located in the new part of the united Europe, perhaps in Poland."
"Poland is the largest of the new countries, and a country where not only is discrimination widespread, but is also played down by the authorities."
"Emile Zola said that a woman is the axis around which civilisation revolves."
"This institute should become the axis around which European gender equality issues and its implementation revolve."
"To make the European Institute for Gender Equality a reality, all there needs to be is an understanding of the problem, political will and some funding."
"It is considerably harder for the institute's work to change attitudes towards women, and to eradicate the discrimination they endure in many European countries."
"The institute should employ not just any specialists, but people of both sexes who are passionate about its activities."
"The influence of the European Parliament in the formation of the institute's team and constant parliamentary control are a necessity."
"The institute should evaluate the situation in every area, in every country and present proposals."
"On this basis, EU institutions would take effective measures and would demand the same of national governments."
"The institute should begin its work in one of the new EU countries."
"Vilnius offers not only what Lithuania can achieve through the implementation of equality, but also the opportunity to combine the experience of the leading Scandinavian countries with the potential of Central Europe, and indeed the whole of Europe."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your discussion and I hope you will allow me to touch on several of the issues that have been raised."
"First of all I would like to express my appreciation for the exceptional quality of the report by the rapporteurs, which can only be described as brilliant, in view of the complexity of the subject matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the debate a number of arguments and opinions have been put forward, which in my view require a response."
"The first opinion to be expressed was the view that this institution should become part of the human rights agenda."
"A series of speakers in the discussion have taken the view, which I fully support, that the question of equal opportunities goes far beyond the simple issue of human rights, albeit that human rights are of fundamental importance."
"The issue of equal opportunities is a broader issue."
"There was a question as to whether it was right for the European Union to promote equal opportunities even in its international relations."
"I must state my firm conviction that there is a need for this."
"The EU is involved in countless international connections, both with the Member States and in the context of development aid and at a multilateral level, and each of these offers the opportunity of effectively reinforcing gender equality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that gender equality, promoted and backed on a global scale, will provide a major source of global stability and is capable of pacifying many of our current conflicts."
"I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct."
"I fully support this argument."
"It is also right to remind ourselves, as was frequently stated in the debate, that we have much work still to do."
"Clearly, we are trying to define policies on the basis of argument, and that is one of the civilised outcomes of life in today’s Europe."
"I might add that these are policies based on practical proofs and practical opinions."
"Even from this perspective the institute can enhance quality."
"It is, in my view, apparent that there is a wealth of important information that is not being used effectively in political decision-making."
"Which of you, for example, knows that in Spain men spend 52 million hours a year taking care of others while for women the figure is 200 million hours."
"This is certainly an important indicator of how unequally we share some of the duties and responsibilities that we have as human beings – men and women."
"And yet none of this information feeds into political decision-making."
"I am convinced that the institute will make many things possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, one of the sound principles of European parliamentary life is multi-lingualism and we often discover that a given matter can be expressed more elegantly and accurately in some other European language."
"I hope you will therefore allow me to quote the German expression ‘."
"I am fully convinced that to stay where you are means in reality to retreat."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express an opinion on the amendments that are defined in the report, or which form part of your upcoming vote."
"The committee’s attitude regarding the nature of the institute allows us to be flexible and to accept most of the amendments that strengthen the role and working methods of the institute, including the creation of the network for the institute."
"These amendments are acceptable in their original form, either in part or after reworking."
"The second category includes the amendments that increase the readability of the text and which the Commission equally can accept in their original form or after a small amount of reworking."
"The third group are the amendments that relate to the legal presentation techniques, which, although they are constructive, mark a departure from the original provisions of the existing instruments and therefore cannot be adopted, for reasons of maintaining cohesion."
"Finally there are the amendments that relate to horizontal questions, in other words to all agencies and organisations, in respect of procedures for selecting directors, extending their contracts and assessing organisations."
"These amendments cannot be accepted, because it is necessary to maintain a certain principle of cohesion in relation to all agencies."
"I have left to the end the question of the composition of the governing council."
"We are delighted that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has come out in favour of limiting the number of members on the governing council and that it has followed the European Parliament resolution from December last year on an operational framework for future regulatory agencies."
"We can now be guided by this proposal, although the number of Commission representatives is not the same as in the case of the Council."
"The equilibrium between the two organisations and between the two levels of interest, which is to say the national level and the Community level, may be further secured if, in accordance with the proposal and where the Commission has responsibility, the voice of its representative carries the same weight as the voices of all of the Council representatives together, in the very limited number of cases involving the approval of budgets and programmes of work."
"We therefore accept Amendments 66, 82 and 85 relating to the composition of the governing council and voting regulations."
"In the same spirit we agree that the number of members can be reduced to a mere 25 representatives of the Member States, as stated in Amendments 67 and 83, and we consider it sufficient that participating parties are present at meetings of the governing council without voting rights."
"We hope that the Council will be able to adopt your proposal for the governing council, which, together with the rotating system, will allow representatives from all Member States to alternate over a period of three mandates."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that we took pains to adopt as many of your amendments as possible."
"The Commission can now adopt Amendments 2 to 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38 to 42, 44, 45, 48, 53, 55, 59 to 69, 74 and 76 to 85."
"The Commission cannot adopt Amendments 1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 to 23, 27, 30 to 34, 37, 43, 46, 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56 to 58, 70 to 73 and part of 75."
"We should also pay regard to the discussions in the Council, and we must take every effort to ensure that an acceptable compromise is achieved by the end of the year."
"The Commission is counting on the support of the European Parliament to set up this much needed European institute, and it is important to ensure that the organisation begins work in 2007, in the interests of progress and to raise the profile of the gender equality policy."
"I will of course be submitting an opinion on individual amendments in writing later."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The June List believes that gender equality issues are important and that it absolutely goes without saying that women and men should be treated equally under all circumstances."
"The EU’s new Institute for Gender Equality is to analyse equality in the EU by comparing data from different Member States."
"The obvious question to be asked is: what added value will this authority contribute?"
"Will the authority help increase gender equality, or will it mainly constitute a type of alibi and way of showing that the EU cares about equality issues?"
"The arguments presented in the report are unconvincing."
"The authority’s tasks could be carried out within the framework of existing structures."
"The EU already has its central statistics agency, Eurostat, which is able to produce comparative statistics on gender equality in EU countries."
"There are also national authorities that work on equality issues and that can cooperate across national borders."
"The Commission consists of 18 men and 7 women."
"Approximately 30% of MEPs are women."
"The EU institutions should begin by applying equality within their own structures and in that way setting an example, before new centralised EU authorities are set up."
"Cooperation can also take place in more decentralised forms, without the EU growing larger as a result of new authorities being created for every important issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will facilitate the elimination of all forms of gender discrimination throughout Europe, is of paramount importance."
"I agree with the wish expressed by the rapporteurs that the activities of the Institute should not be restricted merely to data collection, record keeping and research."
"The analyses should be integrated in the policies of Member States innovatively, with the objective that equal opportunities become a main political guideline and mainstreaming for legislators."
"At the same time, the results of the research should be made available to the general public, to enable European citizens to adopt a conscious position regarding the issues surrounding gender equality."
"However, this requires that the relationship of the Institute with the civil sector and the forums responsible for communication issues is strengthened and institutionalised."
"I would like to call attention to the fact that cooperation with the media and the employment of modern means of communication constitute an important task of the Institute!"
"Resources must be made available to ensure that the results of research go beyond the professional sphere and are available and useable as widely as possible."
"The work of the Institute will only be effective if it really operates as the European network of gender equality, if it is able to coordinate Member State centres, organisations and specialists involved in the general implementation of equal opportunities, and if its message reaches the governments and the citizens of Europe."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs and propose that the document be accepted!"
"Thank you for the floor!"
"The next item is voting time."
"Today's voting time will be divided in two to make space for the formal sitting devoted to the address by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany."
"I will now suspend the sitting for a few minutes prior to President Köhler's address."
"We will return to the votes immediately following the formal sitting."
"Mr President of the Federal Republic of Germany, ladies and gentlemen, before welcoming our illustrious guest today, I must inform you that, during the meeting we held with President Köhler before coming to the Chamber, we heard the sad news of the death of Mr Lennart Meri, who was President of Estonia from 1992 to 2001."
"As you know, President Meri was seen as a symbol of Estonia’s fight for freedom and national identity, and his death deprives us of an important European personality, whose memory we shall honour here today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me and the whole of the European Parliament to welcome you to this formal sitting today."
"Mr President, please allow me to stress your personal commitment to the European project, which is particularly useful and necessary at a time when the situation in the European Union is causing many doubts amongst the citizens."
"I know that this is a cause for concern for you, which you express with passion."
"I know that you are very aware of the responsibility we all share in relation to the problems of concern to Europeans today, which cannot be resolved without more Europe."
"We are aware of the initiatives that you are taking to extend and deepen the European debate."
"One example of this was your invitation to your counterparts from Finland, Italy, Latvia, Austria, Portugal and Hungary to a meeting that was held in Dresden – about which I am sure you will speak this morning – with students and personalities from those countries, in order to debate European identity and the future of Europe."
"This important initiative is not an isolated one."
"You take every possible opportunity to exchange opinions with the citizens and in particular with young people. Strangely enough, it is they who express the greatest scepticism about this project which is so important to their future."
"You also combine words with actions: you do not just talk about ‘Europe’ at official events, but you also work every day on specific issues on the European agenda."
"Your personal experience makes you almost the model European."
"You were young, a child refugee, during the final stages of the Second World War."
"During my visit to Germany, you told me, very directly and personally, of your experiences: how you suffered the war and the exodus from the refugee camp, how you made a success of your life in a ruined country that was also gradually building its future upon the wreckage of history."
"Your personal experience took you away from Europe. You have lived outside Europe and you have watched us from that standpoint and, for that very reason, because you have had dramatic experiences inside Europe and have watched it being built from the outside, you know that Europe has no option other than its European Union project."
"You also know, however, that those values and projects must be actively defended every day and that they do not come free or automatically, and I would therefore like to thank you for being here with us today to communicate your ideas to us, which will undoubtedly make a great contribution to our broad debate on Europe."
"President Köhler, I am very pleased to give you the floor."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, your honourable House is the centre of public politics and democratic opinion for the EU, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this place about Europe and its future."
"Europe presents a puzzling aspect to the world."
"Why, so soon after its reunification, does it already appear so divided?"
"Why, when the European internal market has been so successful, does it not have more confidence in its advantages?"
"Why, with all its strengths and opportunities, does it display such hesitancy?"
"When I was working for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and for the International Monetary Fund, I got to know many countries around the world."
"Looking at Europe from outside gave me a sharper picture of it, and I learned how other countries see our continent and the European Union."
"For us, democracy founded upon freedom, the peaceful settlement of disputes and mutual solidarity among the twenty-five Member States have long been a fact of daily life."
"Looking in from the outside, though, one sees much more clearly to just what an incredible achievement we owe what is now ordinary, a mere two generations after the Second World War and half a generation on from the removal of the Iron Curtain."
"It is for this achievement that Europe is an object of admiration for many people around the world, but, while they admire us, they are slowly beginning to grow impatient with us and to be baffled by us."
"Too many Europeans they see as remarkably lacking in self-awareness, beset by doubt and lacking in courage, and they say, in a friendly way, ‘Europe, if you are tired, step aside, we want to move forward’."
"What do we say to that?"
"What I say to that is this: Europe will always be full of creative ferment; we Europeans do not fear challenges – we make use of them, and that is why the European Union has a good future ahead of it."
"I want to back up the three things I have just said."
"Those who want to understand Europe must consider its history and understand what are the ideas and ideals that bind us Europeans together."
"What we regard as central is the inalienable value of all human beings, in all their uniqueness, along with their dignity and freedom."
"Even thousands of years ago, people in Europe regarded these things as gifts of which one proved oneself worthy only by using them to the utmost and, if need be, by fighting again and again to secure them."
"That is precisely what Europeans did – tirelessly and in the teeth of every dreadful setback."
"Their use of their talents opened up to them the depth of the mind and spirit, in the shape of philosophy, the sciences and the riches of the arts."
"In so doing, people in Europe also learned to question their own beliefs and to demand – and give – good reasons for every action, and this process of enlightenment will never come to an end."
"It was very early on that we understood and took to heart the importance of social cohesion, self-determination and autonomy, not only in the city-states of ancient Greece but in the republics of medieval Italy, with not only the self-awareness of Spain, France, Poland and England, but also the colourful diversity of the ‘Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation’."
"In all these places, Europeans were as god-fearing as they were industrious."
"Not only at home, but also in the outside world, they understood work as a religious obligation; they traded and learned how to co-exist with people of other faiths and cultures and live with them."
"It is true to say that in doing this, Europeans more than once sinned terribly against other peoples and cultures and also against one another, but they did learn the right lessons from that, in that they now contend for human rights, peace and democracy and wish others to learn the same lessons that they have had to learn."
"Europe also bears the stamp of a culture of active love of one’s neighbour and of active striving for social justice."
"These good qualities are, of course, to be found on all continents, and Europe has learned from them, but the specifically European blend of love of freedom, the striving for truth, solidarity and creative ferment is unique and found to be good by the many outside Europe who expect us to make our contribution to the peace and well-being of the world, just as it will be by those who will come after us."
"Yet again, great challenges lie ahead of the European Union and its Member States."
"Around the world, new growth regions are emerging, and the shape of competition is changing; there are new spheres of influence, and new lines of conflict are being drawn."
"In many European countries, unemployment is at intolerably high levels."
"The public and the electorate are becoming demonstrably alienated from the European Union, and the European constitutional treaty failed to win the approval of the people of two of the founding states of our Community."
"So many challenges, so many opportunities!"
"We must again think back to how often Europe has succeeded in facing times of trial, precisely because it was capable of renewal."
"You need only consider the European internal market and economic and monetary union."
"Thirty years ago, the Dutch foreign minister, Van der Stoel, said that the motto of the European Communities was no longer ‘completer, deeper and wider’ but rather ‘inertia, reversal and flight’."
"Europe was, at the time, in a profound economic and institutional crisis."
"Twenty years ago, the Single European Act set the internal market as a goal."
"At that time, there were so many obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital that, to take one example, Philips had to produce seven different versions of the same electric razor for the European market and Siemens had to produce twenty-five different electrical plugs."
"Ten years ago, the goal of the internal market had largely been achieved."
"The European Union has now put it on an institutional foundation and increased economic and social cohesion between the Member States."
"Since then, European firms have had a domestic market of what are now 450 million customers for their products."
"New opportunities for success have come into being, not least for service providers from the smaller Member States, who are now able to produce their goods in larger quantities and hence in a more competitive way."
"And, above all, the internal market is a first-rate programme for making European businesses fit for global competition."
"Those who manage to prove their worth in it, have no need to fear competition from overseas."
"Economic and monetary union was and is the logical outcome of the internal market, shielding it against the possibility of again being split up through arbitrary devaluations, against monetary crises and waves of speculation of the kind that we in Europe were still experiencing at the beginning of the 1990s."
"It gives businesses the security to plan ahead, enables consumers to compare prices without difficulty and does away with high charges for currency exchange and the high costs of hedging against exchange risks."
"That is why the euro – like the internal market – has long been a success story, and its strength on international currency markets testifies to the world’s confidence that was learned long ago is still true today, that Europe is capable of turning challenges into opportunities, and that is something you need to recall, again and again, day in and day out."
"We will succeed again, albeit subject to two conditions: we must not allow our tried and tested principles and achievements to be undermined, and we must, earnestly and honestly, set to the task of correcting what has gone wrong and putting things in order where they need to be."
"All that needs to be said about the first condition is that those whose protectionism weakens the European internal market are, at the end of the day, harming themselves."
"Those who now revert to the old attitude that everyone should look after themselves first are misjudging the dimension of global competition and offering their citizens a false security."
"In the long term, they are undermining Europe’s ability to maintain its position in the world, create lasting jobs and accrue the resources for a more equitable society."
"It follows, then, that only the other way remains. Europe must regain its fitness."
"For each and every one of us, that task begins at home."
"Some Member States have made considerable headway with the necessary structural reforms and have what is needed; others have yet to make more efforts in that direction."
"There are many examples that show that the effort is worth it, and we must not fail to make it."
"The European Union, too, is in need of reshaping."
"The first issue to be addressed is that of where it, as a Union, should become active."
"At the end of the day, it needs to do not everything that can be done, but rather everything that needs to be done, and that does not include those things that can already be done quite adequately at the local or regional level or by individual nation states."
"Respect for the subsidiarity principles means respecting in so far as possible the personal responsibility and identity of the EU’s citizens, and anyone who knows how decisions are really arrived at in the European Union will know that this is an obligation incumbent not only on the governments of the Member States but also on the institutions of the European Union."
"If, though, the European Union takes action with good reason, it needs to do so with as little administrative red tape as possible and in a way that people can understand."
"After all, we are heirs to a great tradition of law and administration in Europe, and that should encourage us once and for all to let some air into the bureaucratic apparatus."
"Our former enthusiasm for legislation has left us with plenty of places where we can do this, and so it is a good thing that the European Commission has set in motion a major programme of cutting through the thickets of legal verbiage that we have at present and simplifying European law."
"I have just had a good discussion about this with Commissioner Verheugen."
"The public will also appreciate it if decisions in Europe are arrived at in a more transparent way."
"At present, the decision-making processes at EU level are often a world away from the people they affect, many of whom have little concept of who in Europe is actually responsible for what and of who, at the end of the day, is to be held responsible for what goes on, and, as a result, they become apathetic or suspicious – both of which are damaging."
"The public, though, want to be more than spectators who understand the plot; in addition to the European elections, they seek as much democratic involvement as possible; they want to be heard, and they want to be able to take the initiative in influencing what the European institutions do."
"To that, you will say that all these things – subsidiarity, democratic participation, the right to a citizens’ initiative – are to be found in the European Constitutional Treaty."
"Indeed they are, and the treaty contains much else that is good and right, which should not too readily be surrendered, not least in view of the fact that 14 Member States have already voted to approve it."
"Europe has now prescribed itself a ‘pause for thought’, termed in German a ‘’, which can mean both a pause for thought and a pause in thought."
"We should use this period of reflection as an opportunity for a thorough rethink."
"By then at the latest, we must talk to each other soberly and seriously – not only in the European institutions and parties, but also in all the Member States’ public fora for political debate."
"What that will demand of the Members of your honourable House is ideas and tireless effort – not least in discussions with those who were less than satisfied with what I have had to say."
"This European debate cannot do other than benefit from diversity and creativity, but the only thing that will count will be the power of sound argument."
"It will be enlightening in the best sense of the word if there is in-depth discussion in the Member States about the purpose and substance of European integration."
"It will, in the long term, do public acceptance of the EU some good."
"I have confidence in the people of Europe, in the European public; they must be trusted with something at least."
"We Europeans expect good reasons and give them; that is something I regard as characterising us."
"I believe, then, that there is more than one good reason why Europe should, in the new world order that is coming into being, speak with one voice on matters of foreign and security policy."
"It gives us more weight, for example when discussing with others in the world the international dimension of social responsibility and the protection of the environment, and the public have long been aware of the fact that, in worldwide competition, we must be all the better the more expensive we are."
"For Europe’s future prospects and for the far too numerous young people without work, then, education, training, research and development are crucial, and that is a good enough reason to reallocate considerable sums from the European budget in that direction and thereby to earn a tribute of appreciation from our nation states."
"The public will also be appreciative if the EU sets itself new goals and takes the sort of actions that make Europeans’ lives easier and keep them safer."
"That is indeed possible, as has most recently and resoundingly been demonstrated by energy policy."
"It must surely be plain to every rational person that all the Member States have a vital interest in the safe and affordable supply of environmentally-friendly energy and that they must work together to find the most effective way of achieving this."
"The ‘everyone should look after themselves’ attitude will not hold water."
"The European Commission has presented a Green Paper on energy policy, and that I very much welcome."
"Where these matters are concerned, we need the right decisions, and soon."
"The debates of which I have spoken and which will ensure the European Union a good future, are already underway."
"Let me give a small example of this; a few weeks ago, I was in Dresden with six other European presidents."
"We were continuing a dialogue initiated by the former Portuguese President Sampaio, and we talked to young people, with a hundred students from seven Member States, and we asked them what they thought about Europe, what benefits they could see accruing from it, and what expectations they had of the European Union and its Member States."
"These students were not hand-picked; they had been found by a public lottery, but these young people were well prepared."
"They had spent a day and a half discussing among themselves and called what had emerged from their own deliberations the ‘Dresden Demands for European Cohesion’."
"They are thinking, for example, in terms of a single right to vote and would like to see a European House of History."
"They suggest setting aside five per cent of the gross domestic product for research and development."
"And they want a European army and European non-combatant service."
"Further to this speech, I am presenting, for the documentary records of your honourable House, a copy of what these young people wrote down."
"Granted, their group was hardly representative, and they appear idealistic in what they call for, but their idealism is impressive."
"It has about it much of the enthusiasm of the people who rebuilt Europe after the war and who fought for its unity in freedom."
"There it is – the typical creative ferment."
"There they are – the Europeans who expect something of Europe and are ready to do something for it."
"They are to be found in Europe."
"By the way, some of these students had benefited from the Erasmus programme; let us be glad of this Erasmus generation and make more of them."
"And while I am on that subject, trainees and apprentices too should be given more opportunities to learn from their neighbours and learn from experience the value of Europe."
"It was Jacques Delors who proposed the European Training Cheque, and I urge your House to draw on it!"
"Let us take the enthusiasm of these young people as an example."
"Let us show ourselves to be real Europeans."
"Let us, rather than being disquieted by the future, be filled with creative restlessness, for Europe and for the European Union."
"Let us join together in transforming all our challenges into opportunities, for the benefit of all; then Europe will still be what it is today, a good place in which to live and a force for good in this one world of ours!"

"Thank you, Mr President."
"Before continuing with the sitting, I would like to say a few words of thanks to the President for his speech."
"It is true that there was a time when we had twenty-five different kinds of plug: now we have the same plug, but twenty-five different electricity networks."
"As you have pointed out, the next step is to move ahead with the Europe of energy and with many other aspects which must become common."
"Thank you very much for your words and your encouragement, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we will now return to voting time."
". Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment 9, to remove the reference to civil society."
"The rest of the amendment will remain unchanged."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"That concludes voting time."
".I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mrs Kauppi, on the proposal for an amendment of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the capital of public limited liability companies."
"At the same time as protecting the rights of shareholders and creditors, it was becoming urgent to simplify the means of maintaining and altering the capital of public limited liability companies in view of the large number of different situations facing economic operators."
"Expanding on the lines of thought underpinning these legislative developments, I believe that there is a need to engage in a broader political debate."
"The aim of such a debate, particularly where natural or legal persons not resident in the European Union are concerned, will be to regulate access – both direct and indirect – to the capital of companies operating in the European internal market."
"Mr President, let me say, for the sake of clarity, that I have voted against the Gröner report, not because I am opposed to gender equality, which is far from being the case, but because this report and the institute for gender equality to which it refers are typical of the suffocating, political correctness which is gradually tightening its grip on Europe."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, a politically correct, left-wing policy document enforced by an equally politically correct office for fundamental rights, along with job quotas and the other measures proposed in the now deceased but ever-looming European Constitution, are framed by the same ideology."
"I urge you to ignore those issues in favour of what really matters, which is that women are entitled to the same employment and must receive equal pay for equal work."
"We are all agreed on this."
"All the rest is mere political correctness."
"– Mr President, I wished to emphasise that I am absolutely convinced of the need to safeguard human rights, of both men and women, but I am not sure that this specific text safeguards these rights or the subsidiarity of the Member States on the issues to which it relates."
"We voted in favour because we recognise the importance of setting up a European Institute for Gender Equality. We also wish to stress that this Institute must not solely be involved in studies, analyses and the preparation of statistics, however important this activity may be."
"Cooperation and dialogue with NGOs and bodies that specialise in the field of equal opportunities must be stepped up, at national and European level, and with third countries. Measures to put an end to discrimination must also be supported."
"It is also essential that we analyse and monitor gender mainstreaming in all policies and in the EU’s budgetary process, especially with regard to the impact of relevant national Community policies on men and women. This was something that we proposed but that, regrettably, was not adopted."
"Lastly, we hope that adequate Community funding will be forthcoming and that common sense prevails when it comes to the appointment of the management board."
"The report proposes that a new European Institute for Gender Equality be set up."
"The June List’s basic attitude is that issues of equality have very high priority."
"Equal treatment of women and men is an imperative demand that all EU countries must fulfil."
"This does not, however, mean that the EU should set up another bureaucracy for the purpose."
"Sweden has come a long way with its work on equality, and the June List is convinced that this work is best done at national level."
"An Institute for Gender Equality at European level means increased bureaucracy and less efficiency."
"The fight for equality must be conducted from the bottom up in the Member States and not from the top down by appointed Eurocrats, if citizens of both genders are to be engaged in it."
"Eurostat can take care of the need for comparative statistics in this area."
"We have thus chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues are strong supporters of equality of opportunity in society."
"We believe in both men and women playing their full role in the life of our own nation and elsewhere and oppose any discrimination on the ground of gender."
"However, we have voted against this report today as we do not support the proliferation of new EU agencies and institutes that will add to the burden of the taxpayer and increase bureaucracy without any proven benefit to the people they are supposed to serve."
"The creation of a separate institute in regard to this issue risks ghettoisation by leaving it open to single-issue pressure groups and thus easier to disregard and marginalise."
"The issue of gender equality should be dealt with in the framework of the global approach to fundamental rights."
". The Commission announced the creation of the European Institute on Gender Equality even before Parliament had delivered its report on the subject."
"Procedurally speaking, that is the wrong way to go about it."
"We are voting on it today, and Parliament’s voice carries weight in this matter."
"The intention is that an Institute should be created, with a budget of EUR 54.5 million, with the specific function of monitoring men’s and women’s equality of opportunity by producing statistics and reports."
"This House has, however, for practical and financial reasons, and as recently as last year, recommended that the Institute for Gender Equality should form part of the European Human Rights Agency."
"More action and more resources are needed to address equality issues in an effective way, but no provision is as yet being made for them."
"It follows that the original idea of combining the two agencies in one single Agency for Fundamental Rights deserves support."
"It is for that reason that I have tabled Amendment 73."
"Rejecting the creation of an independent institute on Gender Equality is not in any way to be seen as an expression of hostility to policy on women’s issues."
"The money available to us should be invested in women’s education."
"That would be the first step towards equality."
"The current debate on the reduction of bureaucracy is another reason why an additional agency does not make sense and would not be something readily explicable to the public."
"It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report."
". I have, for over 40 years, campaigned for women’s rights and for gender equality."
"I cannot therefore be accused of lacking any sympathy for this matter."
"I do wonder, though, why a European Institute for Gender Equality is supposed to be necessary, quite simply because the idea of a Gender Institute was hatched over ten years ago, since when a lot of time has passed and we now set different priorities for spending money, which is in short supply, in a more effective way."
"I can think of better ways of spending over EUR 50 million, and thereby promoting equality of opportunity for women and men, than by creating an Institute whose functions and powers would overlap with those of many bodies at national, European and global level."
"The sight of this shopping list – which is what these 85 amendments amount to – causes me to worry about the eventual costs of what will be an oversized playground for women’s libbers with outdated ideas."
"I endorse the amendment that reminds us that this House has already resolved that such an institute should form part of the European Union’s Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"That would, at any rate, limit the damage it could do."
"In view of the many things in it that make no sense, and of the absence from it of any financial perspectives, I cannot vote in favour of this report today."
". I welcome the report, in particular the effort to create an independent body focusing specifically on gender issues."
"I agree with the idea of a body dealing exclusively with gender equality matters, since it ensures that the objective of gender equality, as set out in the Treaty, will not be second to any other anti-discrimination policy at EU level."
". The fact that opinions are practically policed and that one-track thinking has all but been established has turned serious, relevant debates addressing pressing issues into reaffirmations of faith in certain policies."
"This is clearly the case when it comes to so-called ‘gender policy’."
"It is one thing to acknowledge the need for a better balance in society, which is characterised by a distribution of labour more in keeping with the modern world and by greater freedom of choice, yet policies that supposedly implement these ideas are all too often forced upon us."
"It is as though some policy areas precluded the possibility of divergent opinion on methods and mechanisms."
"This is the nub of my primary objection to the idea of an EU Institute for Gender Equality."
"The fact that I support, as I said earlier, greater balance in the way in which our societies are organised does not lead me to advocate the creation of this Institute."
"Making freedom bureaucratic does not strike me as the right way forward."
"The end does not always justify the means."
"What is more, the proliferation of ‘agencies’ and 'institutes’ does not strike me as an appropriate model for the organisation of Community institutions."
"We, the Members of the European Parliament belonging to the Austrian People’s Party, are in favour of gender equality and also of politics playing an active role in this area."
"We therefore believe that having this matter handled by the planned European Human Rights Agency would send the right message and wish to reiterate our agreement to issues of gender equality being seen as an important task for the Agency, as stated in the European Parliament's resolution of 26 May 2006 on the Kinga Gal report."
"We are, however, opposed to the establishment of additional independent institutions, the ultimate result of which will be the existence of new and expensive bureaucracies, and, since the financial issues have been left quite unresolved, reject the planned unspecified financial obligations to the tune of some EUR 52 million."
"The EU has too many authorities and agencies."
"In spite of that, I am voting in favour of this institute being set up."
"Gender equality is a disaster, symbolised in particular by outdated rules governing parental leave, the complete lack of gender education, very poor legislation and the fact that 83% of top positions are occupied by men."
"It may be worth spending a few million euros on trying to improve this situation a little with the help of an institute designed to supplement the one that already exists to combat discrimination against minorities."
"It may actually make sense to have an institute to combat discrimination against the majority, who are women."
". This is an excellent report."
"We have become starkly aware of more frequent and more severe natural disasters across the EU and the world."
"Upon recalling the last 15 months, for example, we have witnessed the tsunami disaster in Asia; the strong tropical cyclone in Louisiana and Mississippi; the devastating floods in Romania, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France; the serious drought in Spain and Portugal and the fires that have destroyed nearly 180 000 hectares of forest in Portugal."
"It is clear that natural hazards pose a global threat and warrant global responses."
"I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament's report, specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters."
"Prevention is in every way as crucial as reaction to natural disasters and I welcome the inclusion of the concept of prevention in the report."
"I also agree that the legal basis is clearer under Art. 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and support the rapporteur."
"I agree that the EU´s civil protection doctrine has to be founded on a 'bottom-up' approach and that primary responsibility for civil protection activity should be with the Member States."
". The Christian Union and SGP MEPs are unable to endorse the recommendation to the Council for the rapid response and readiness instrument for major emergencies."
"In particular, we do not support the change in the legal basis, the extension of the instrument’s scope to enable the funding of preventive measures, or the budget increase."
"We specifically regret the change to the legal basis, particularly since Parliament did decide in favour of Article 308 being the only correct legal basis in previous, analogous votes."
"Stretching the definition of Article 175 of the Treaty, so that this instrument can fall within its scope is not the right way forward, and can only be interpreted as a majority position in Parliament in order to extend its influence to include topics that are not considered to fall within its remit in the Treaty."
"In addition, the financial consequences of the deployment of aid teams should not be ruled by a Community instrument, but are rather a question of solidarity among countries."
". Although there have been a lot of improvements where the response to an emergency due to a disaster is involved, I think that unfortunately there is still a lot more to be done, and thus there is the need for a collective effort so that we will be prepared as much as possible for these disasters to be avoided."
"I think that we all agree that when we commit ourselves to work to prevent national-scale disasters, we would also be saving our countries and the European Union huge costs which we are facing due to our present policy."
"We have to be ready to invest both money as well as human resources so that a study would be carried out to clearly indicate, or better still, evaluate, the places and regions which are most prone to disasters."
"In that way we shall be ready for every eventuality which could occur and as I pointed out before, we would not only be saving many millions but we would be fulfilling our moral duty to protect the life of those more prone to these disasters."
"I believe that we should give a political direction so that, through it, any country would be able to rely on help from the Union to launch projects to improve the standard of living of those who live in these regions which are, mostly prone to large-scale problems."
"I believe that prevention is better than cure, and so we have to focus our energy in order to be ready for every eventuality."
". Recent natural disasters, for example the floods, extreme drought and forest fires affecting not only EU countries, but also countries outside the EU – for example the Asian tsunami and the hurricanes in the USA – demonstrate the importance of effective civil protection mechanisms."
"The Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies proposed by the Commission is aimed at enhancing the EU’s response capacity in the context of the civil protection mechanism and at maximising assistance in terms of preparedness and rapid response to major emergencies."
"It does not, however, address the issue of prevention. We therefore feel that this report must be adopted, given that it attaches priority to this issue, proposing that it be included in the scope of this instrument."
"We also wish to highlight the proposals on integrated environmental and natural resources, including the management of forests, of areas most at risk from flooding, of wetlands and other fragile ecosystems, and risk assessments in urban areas. Furthermore, we welcome the prominence given to remote and outlying areas, greater information and awareness-raising among the public and more and better training for those working in the sector."
". The text put forward by the Commission contains some good proposals on European-level civil protection."
"Measures and activities for which this instrument can be activated will bring major benefits in terms of preparedness and response to emergencies."
"With the amendments tabled in Parliament, the prevention of these phenomena now has a part to play in the instrument. This is a crucial factor in the drive to implement objectives as important as protecting communities, the environment and property."
"In a country like Portugal, stricken year after year by forest fires and drought which have left indelible scars, this proposal will make it possible to train specialised personnel, to establish preparedness mechanisms and to share equipment and best practice with countries that are more advanced in this regard."
"As such, I endorse the Papadimoulis report and the amendments to the Commission’s text."
"There are good reasons for the Member States’ governments to give priority to measures that reduce the risk of natural disasters striking."
"We nonetheless question whether the EU should have the prominent role that the European Parliament wants it to have in this connection."
"Among other things, the European Parliament wants:"
"– the EU to play an active role in preventing disasters such as serious drought in Spain and Portugal or fires in southern European countries;"
"– the EU to become involved in disasters outside the EU through, for example, civil protection intervention;"
"– and the budget for a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument to be increased by EUR 105 million (in excess of the figure proposed by the Commission) for the period 2007–2013."
"We believe that it is primarily the task of each Member State to take action in connection with natural disasters."
"Many forms of natural disaster (such as drought and fires) are recurrent and can be predicted."
"It should be entirely possible for the Member States independently to make the investments that minimise the risk of this type of disaster striking."
"What is more, the UN already has a system in operation for helping countries hit by disasters and serious accidents."
"The Member States might do well to use this system instead of developing a parallel structure and thus risking unnecessary duplication of effort."
"On the basis of this reasoning, we have chosen to vote against this report."
". I voted in favour of this regulation."
"I very much welcome the improvement of the European Union's civil protection mechanisms for emergencies."
"This Community response instrument needs to be visible, coordinated, and very responsive, as natural disasters trigger a race against the clock."
"The key to success in these activities is complete cooperation between the various parties involved."
"I hoped to use the amendments to put the emphasis on the preventative aspect: whilst it is important to know how to respond to disasters, it is even more important to know how to avoid them."
"Prevention is a fundamental part of risk reduction."
"For example, fires are very often caused by human activities."
"Therefore, a call for vigilance accompanied by information on the associated penalties is a preventative measure that we should not ignore."
"However, before we draw up action plans, we need an inventory of the existing material and human resources."
"This inventory should be drawn up by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States."
"Finally, the initial responsibility for civil protection rests with the Member States."
"These Community mechanisms must therefore complement the policies pursued by national, regional or local authorities."
". We naturally endorse the proposals in the report aimed at, , introducing and prioritising the dimension of prevention in the context of this instrument, as a key factor in reducing the risks of natural disasters, at stepping up the UN’s role in managing emergencies and helping communities, and at ensuring the protection of public health and cultural heritage."
"Yet the debate on solidarity between different countries in the event of a disaster also serves to demonstrate – or rather, to show in stark relief – the appalling waste of resources of the arms race and the militarisation of international relations led by the main capitalist powers, and their ringleader the United States."
"One wonders what could be achieved by channelling the colossal financial resources of militarisation and war into prevention, emergency help and immediate response, and the recovery of areas in the event of disasters."
"How many lives, how much suffering, how much waste of economic, social and environmental resources could be avoided if there could be a policy of in international relations, peaceful resolution of conflicts, disarmament and effective, mutually advantageous cooperation between different countries and people?"
". The British Conservatives support the concept that there may be emergencies of a major nature where the Member States will wish to express European solidarity by means of a collective contribution through the EU budget to supplement the efforts of an individual Member State or States."
"We are therefore voting in support of the report as a whole."
"But we do not support the proposed changes in the legal base, nor the idea of extending the response to emergencies outside the EU, nor the increase in budget."
"If the response were to apply worldwide, no conceivable EU budget would be enough to support it."
"Parliament should not raise hopes that the EU will not want to fulfil."
"– The facts demonstrate that the poor, grass-roots classes are the first victims of what is often a criminal lack of appropriate measures to safeguard them from natural disasters."
"The huge floods in New Orleans killed thousands of people, even though they knew how to and could have taken preventive measures."
"By contrast, in Cuba, where there is universal government prevention and protection, there were no victims."
"In this sense, preventive measures are needed to protect health and the environment for which the government alone, and not NGOs, are responsible and, of course, adequate resources needed to be provided."
"The Commission proposal ignores the question of prevention, because then it would need to address the social and economic reasons which cause or exacerbate the consequences and provide the necessary resources, which are still inadequate."
"However, it is curious how emergencies and the need for Community solidarity against natural, industrial or technological disasters include solidarity for terrorist actions."
"Thus the most repulsive article of the 'European Constitution' about solidarity in the event of terrorist actions has come in through the back door because, as we know, the definition of terrorism is elastic and is adapted by Euro-unifying capital to circumstances and directed mainly at the mass, grass-roots movement and its fight against the anti-grass roots, repressive policy of the EU and the governments."
". The EU has been proactive and has shown solidarity in response to Member States’ requests for help in the event of major emergencies."
"That being said, recent major disasters, such as extreme drought and forest fires in Portugal and Spain, have demonstrated that strengthening the Community’s civil protection mechanism should be an immediate priority before fresh emergencies occur."
"The text before us clearly improves upon the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the regulation and to increase funding for prevention, preparedness and assistance in the event of a disaster."
"There is also the issue of maritime pollution. After all, we must acknowledge that a coastal country cannot deal alone with an environmental emergency caused by a large-scale oil-spill hitting its coastline."
"We are also an open Union with policies aimed at international solidarity."
"We must do as much as we can when other communities are affected by major emergencies, the crucial priority in this issue being to strengthen mutual assistance between EU Member States."
"To sum up, these measures will enable us to react in the most appropriate manner to requests for assistance and this is why I voted in favour of this report."
"The EU countries should develop structures for helping each other in the event of forest fires and other natural disasters. These are typically areas in which international coordination is constructive and necessary."
"Parliament is also changing the legal basis, a development that will increase civil society’s opportunities to exercise influence."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the proposal, in spite of the fact that I was in a minority in opposing the proposal to include terrorist attacks."
"I believe that such attacks are of a quite different character to other disasters and that, in order to protect ourselves against them, quite different methods are required."
"They should not, therefore, be covered by the fund. A different kind of intervention is required in the case of terrorism, and only the purely civil aspects of such intervention, such as helping with reconstruction after an attack, should be covered."
"Terrorism mainly affects countries with colonial foreign policies. Instead of changing these policies, as they ought to do, these countries want, however, to export them, together with their consequences, to all the EU countries."
"Now, only an exceedingly small proportion of the fund will probably be used for these purposes, however, and so the proposal is still acceptable."
"The IMF is one of the Bretton Woods institutions, which, like the World Bank and GATT/WTO, have served to entrench unequal development between the centre and the outer edges of the capitalist world. This has helped to liberalise trade in goods and services and has promoted the prevailing neoliberal ideology, which advocates, , the reduction of the role of the state, privatisations and a more flexible labour market, all of which form part of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’."
"The structural adjustment plans are an attempt at what they consider to be the adaptation of the economies of southern countries to the so-called market and competition economy, whereby the markets of such countries will be opened up to foreign investment and economic specialisation models that favour the centre will be ushered in."
"The disastrous economic and social consequences of these plans are well known."
"Even the much-vaunted stabilisation that they claim to aim for does not happen. What is more, the international monetary system is becoming more unstable and crises are happening with greater frequency."
"What we need is a different monetary system, with the UN at its core, based on mutual advantage and the promotion of development."
"The IMF reform, even if it were based on greater involvement among developing countries, which is not in fact the case, does not alter its nature."
"Hence our abstention."
". I welcome this report which encourages the close coordination of Member States in negotiation inside the IMF."
"It is essential that, given the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc, with delegatory powers agreed by Member States, individual EU Member States continue to represent themselves inside the IMF."
"There are many key issues, such as development, which rely upon many voices to get a point of view across."
"I welcome close coordination of Member States in negotiation inside the IMF."
"I believe that, in the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc, with delegatory powers agreed by Member States, individual EU members should continue to represent themselves inside the IMF."
"This is in line with many other international bodies such as the UN."
"There are key issues including development issues which rely upon many voices at the table to get a point of view across."
". The EPLP welcomes close coordination of Member States in negotiations inside the IMF."
"It believes that, in the absence of full recognition of any EU representative bloc, with delegatory powers agreed by Member States, individual EU Member States should continue to represent themselves inside the IMF."
"This is in line with many other international bodies such as the UN."
"There are many key issues, such as development issues, which rely upon many voices at the table to get a point of view across."
"Reducing the EU's voice to one may, in certain circumstances, have an explicit effect on the weight of international opinion."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to explain why I have voted against this report."
"It is a report that is superfluous, unbalanced and not based on any real results, only on assumptions that are not rooted in fact."
"An extension of the protection deadline from five to seven years is unacceptable and goes against the principles of free movement."
"If we continue to issue further regulations, instead of removing restrictions on business and freeing up the market for labour and services, this will not help the EU economy, but on the contrary will lead to its further stagnation."
"In the main, we Swedish Social Democrats support Mr Hutchinson’s report, but we take the following view of relocation."
"We do not believe that EU resources should be used for moving production because, in practice, this means that unemployment is moved around and that employees in different regions are pitted against each other."
"We do not, however, believe that all relocation is wrong as a matter of course."
"It must be possible to relocate industries if these are to be developed."
"An increased level of knowledge and skills in a region or country may give rise to a need for relocations if it is to be possible to develop the region."
".I voted in favour of the report on relocation in the context of regional development because it is crucial to reassure our fellow citizens of the fact that the European Union is the source of solutions with regard to today’s profound economic and social changes, and not the cause of problems."
"The seriousness of the economic and social issues linked to relocation requires a strong European policy aimed at reconciling the necessary changes with the objective of cohesion."
"I am very pleased to emphasise the request aimed at obtaining any future, objective information on the relocation phenomenon."
"This information will be crucial to us, particularly in the context of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation on economic sectors that are very exposed to these changes, which can be very brutal."
"Equally, it was becoming urgent to clarify the European aid arrangements with regard to relocation, not least by creating a link between aid and the obligation to produce on EU territory."
"Finally, I welcome the request to introduce social clauses into the international treaties, and this on the basis of the International Labour Organisation’s priority agreements."
". I voted in favour of Mr Hutchinson's report on relocation in the context of regional development having participated in the discussions in committee and having amended it."
"This report proposes preventing the Structural Funds from promoting measures that contribute to the relocations that have such a high social cost in our regions."
"It advocates establishing a European strategy to combat relocation and setting up a European Relocation Observatory to assess the real impact of European aid on relocation."
"This has nothing to do with returning to an administered economy, nor of damaging free and fair competition, which is the foundation of the common market."
"Nor is it a matter of controlling all businesses or of preventing the development of the new Member States."
"However, it is important to bear in mind that the Structural Funds must be tools for development and social cohesion, not weapons for a war between our regions, because, even in the richest countries in the European Union, there are still poor regions where workers watch with despair as their jobs disappear, often leaving them with no possibility of retraining."
"An ever more globalised world creates new requirements."
"It presents new problems to get to grips with and gives rise to new opportunities to make the most of."
"Today, the European Parliament is voting on Mr Hutchinson’s own-initiative report on relocation in the context of regional development."
"We have chosen to vote against the report as we think that it goes the wrong way about tackling the problems of relocating companies."
"We agree that there is no justification for using EU resources from, for example, the Structural Funds to fund improved conditions of competition for European companies that shortly afterwards decide to move their activities outside the EU."
"However, neither the state nor EU authorities should intervene to control how companies manage their affairs and to stipulate what is required to prevent companies from taking rational decisions in order to survive."
"We shall not create full employment through increased state control."
"We shall do so by making life easier for more companies and by facilitating new investment in the private market."
"We cannot therefore vote, either, in favour of further limiting the movement of companies in the internal market, as proposed in this report."
"In order to overcome the problems and manage the relocations involved in a globalised market, we need a point of departure other than this new trend based on economic patriotism."
"."
"I voted in favour of Mr Hutchinson's report on relocation, which emphasises how urgent it is for the EU to take account of the seriousness of the effects of company relocation on people and regions."
"We need to shed more light on the course of this phenomenon and on its consequences, and an observatory will enable us to do so."
"However, this also needs to go through a more restrictive legislative framework within the EU, and the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in international trade."
"The interests of employees and protecting jobs must be at the heart of our political concerns."
"This is vital if we are going to achieve the goal of full employment and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as recommended in 2000 – we will not be able to achieve these objectives without a European industrial policy."
"This report, which exists outside the legislative procedure, deals with an important subject."
"We should, however, have liked to have formulated the problems relating to this issue differently."
"We believe that the relocation of companies to third countries outside the EU is something in which we cannot interfere."
"It is, as a rule, market considerations that should determine where in the world companies are finally located."
"In this context, EU Member States can make efforts to compete when it comes, for example, to offering knowledge, skills and stability."
"Where the relocation of companies within the EU is concerned, we must attend to the problem arising from the fact that individual Member States supplement the EU’s structural aid in the form of discriminatory tax relief and state subsidies."
"This happened in 2002 when the tyre factory in Gislaved was closed down and the company concerned, Continental, instead invested in a tyre factory in northern Portugal."
"That something like that can happen in the EU’s internal market is, in our view, a major problem."
"In his explanatory statement, the rapporteur also states that a European Relocation Observatory could be set up within the EU."
"Instead of establishing a new monitoring body, we should make it the job of the Commission to monitor closures as a result of restructuring and discriminatory tax systems."
"We therefore choose to vote against the report."
"We believe the matter to be important in principle, but we should have liked to have seen a resolution with a different approach to this important issue."
"The resolution adopted by Parliament on company relocations was the only feasible resolution, because, by rejecting the amendments that we proposed, the compromise agreement between the dominant political forces, namely the social democrats and the Right, turned its back on a more far-reaching resolution. Our proposals were as follows."
"- To highlight the fact that, in most cases, the purpose of business relocations is to derive the maximum profit, secure tax breaks and financial support, and to exploit cheap labour deprived of rights;"
"- To highlight the fact that relocations form part of the worldwide liberalisation of trade and the deregulation of the labour market, under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation;"
"- To set up a regulatory legal framework which, among other aspects, addresses: the contractual definition of a minimum seven-year period, guaranteeing stable and lasting employment and regional economic development, providing for sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance with contractual obligations (return of aid granted and prohibition from receiving any more Community aid), and protecting the workers by keeping them informed and giving them meaningful involvement, including voting rights;"
"- To draw up an annual communication on relocations and the impact thereof."
"We do hope, however, that what has been adopted will at least be implemented."
". In calling for the reimbursement of European aid paid to companies that relocate their activities, Mr Hutchinson's report adopts one of the proposals made by the in Île de France during the regional elections, with regard to subsidies from the regional council."
"The European institutions are starting to take notice of the economic and social consequences of their political choices: many of our businesses have been forced to relocate their operations because the destruction of borders has put them in competition with producers with very low labour costs."
"In order to protect our economies from this social dumping and to protect our social model, we must pursue a different policy: rebuild our borders, and make our businesses more competitive by funding our social security from a social VAT rate instead of contributions."
"For this to be possible, the national governments need to retain their sovereignty over taxation."
"Those are just some of the common-sense economic and social measures that could be taken, not by the current Europe of Brussels that the people of France disowned last year, but by a Europe of free, sovereign nations."
". The VVD delegation felt it should vote against the Hutchinson report on relocation in the context of regional development, because this report openly supports the Commission proposal to set up a globalisation fund, to which the VVD is strongly opposed, on the grounds that this form of state intervention runs counter to the internal market."
"Social policy is a matter to be addressed by the Member States themselves."
"What is more, there is already a European system that provides for the possibilities to retrain workers, in that the existing European structural funds give the Member States the financial leg room to (re)train their people."
"The Hutchinson report also contains a number of unnecessary and interfering bureaucratic provisions that curtail the freedom of establishment and cause the internal market to lose its momentum."
". I welcome this report on relocation in the context of regional development."
"Through the principle of partnership, it is the Member States’ and the Commission’s responsibility to deny any involvement in the structural funds to companies which, having received European Union aid, relocate their activity to another Member State or third country within seven years after the granting of the aid."
"In this regard, it is essential that the EU establish a European strategy to combat relocation in coordination with all the Member States as well as a European Relocation Observatory to study, evaluate, follow up and make concrete proposals on the subject of long-term agreements in the field of employment and local development."
"Given the rise in statistically affected regions in Scotland, it is now more important than ever that positive measures are taken to ensure that allocated funds are spent effectively and respect the length of the entire programming period."
". Creating a single market between 25 States with very different labour, social and fiscal costs was bound to lead to the relocation of businesses to the countries with lower production costs, and that is indeed what has happened."
"The ten new Member States are attracting businesses from 'old Europe' and even US businesses based in Mexico."
"It is particularly shocking that these countries are providing an attractive tax climate, and then getting their sanitary, social, road network and other improvements paid for by the western countries, which, by increasing their taxes to pay for the ten new countries, are worsening their own production problems."
"For relocations outside the EU, there is a basic solution."
"We need to invent customs duties using new technologies with three characteristics."
"They must be variable according to the difference in costs between the two countries in question."
"They must be reimbursable, with the customs duty paid by the exporter becoming a 'tax credit' deductible from purchases from the importer's economy."
"In other words, the customs duty would give the exporter a drawing right on the importer's economy, which is a win-win situation for international trade."
"Finally, they must be redeemable when the importer wants to grant a benefit to the exporter."
"The customs credit would thus become a matching credit of the kind already in existence in international tax law."
"."
"My support for the report rests essentially on the diagnosis, whereas, to my mind, the medicine that has been prescribed follows a path that has proved largely unsuccessful."
"In this context, despite these objections, I share the idea expressed in the report that we all too often look into relocations after they have taken place."
"This strikes me not only as being of little use, but also indicative of a terrible inability to anticipate situations."
"I therefore feel that a number of legislative measures should be put forward with the aim of preventing the misuse of the public purse and prohibiting the use of public aid, when private entities are not managed with a proper sense of responsibility."
"I do not feel, however, that some forms of relocation are avoidable."
"I also take the view that this debate could not be held without taking account of the entire balance sheet, including both the upsides and the downsides."
"In other words, in addition to totalling the number of jobs that have been lost on account of the opening up of the markets, we must factor the jobs that have been created into the equation, not to mention the advantages to the consumer."
"Yes, we must prevent the ‘law of the jungle’ from prevailing, but must not at the same time dismiss something that is necessary."
"Quite the opposite, we should be trying to derive the maximum benefit from it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have abstained from voting on the Matsakis report into the Commission’s strategy on mercury, and I would like to explain why."
"My formal background is that of a dentist, and I know that the amendments concerning the prompt banning of amalgam from dentistry are not feasible, especially in the new Member States, and primarily for economic reasons."
"As dental fillings made from materials other than amalgam are three times more expensive, their application would impose an unreasonable burden on health insurance companies."
"At the same time, the evidence concerning the harmful effects of amalgam is both unclear and incomplete."
"We should certainly improve the disposal of amalgam waste in dentistry departments, but we should not ban dentists from using mercury."
"I also believe that the Member States should be responsible for the relevant legislation."
"This view is shared by the Slovak Chamber of Dentists, and that is why I did not vote for the report to be approved."
". While the Christian Union and SGP MEPs can endorse the draft resolution on the mercury strategy, they would like to add that exceptions to the ban on the use of mercury in measuring and control equipment should remain possible."
"One of those exceptions should apply to the production of traditional mercury barometers, as indicated in the adopted text of the resolution."
"The quantity used for production is minimal, and its environmental risk, since it is contained in glass, relatively small."
"Various small businesses in the EU rely on the production of these for their income and would, due to a lack of sufficient suitable alternatives, have to close down if an absolute ban were introduced."
"We think that the production of this European heritage should remain permitted in a controlled environment."
". The purpose of this proposal by the Commission is to plug gaps and to propose a European strategy for the coming years as regards the production and use of mercury in Europe."
"Among the important points raised in this report are an end to mercury exports, an end to the use of mercury in measuring equipment and in dental amalgam, controls on emissions, and studies into the effects of mercury in vaccines, something that could bring major benefits for public health."
"The licence provided for in Amendment 2 safeguards the activities of small producers under controlled conditions, museum exhibits, traditional barometers and items with historical value."
"Amendment 6 brings forward the deadline for restricting exports. This may prove a precipitous move and may harm Europe by favouring only third-country mercury exporters."
"I endorse the Commission’s proposal and the main thrust of the Matsakis report."
"The June List supports the proposal that measures be taken to reduce and eventually phase out mercury emissions."
"This is a cross-border environmental issue for which a joint and coordinated strategy is justified."
"We have thus chosen to vote in favour of this report."
"We nonetheless have views concerning individual points in the European Parliament’s proposal."
"We believe, for example, that the Member States are fully capable of carrying out independent information campaigns concerning the health risks entailed in exposure to mercury."
"Moreover, we are of the view that it is primarily the task of the Member States, rather than of the EU, to deal with the social consequences of mercury mines being closed down."
".I voted in favour of this text."
"We must have a firm Community strategy with regard to mercury."
"Having said that, being firm also means being realistic."
"Merthiolate, which contains mercury, is used as a preservative in some medicines, including in vaccines."
"There are around 1 million doses of vaccine that are produced using merthiolate as a decontamination agent."
"That represents 0.0000003% of the mercury used annually in Europe."
"In view of the tremendously positive impact that vaccinations have on public health, including in developing countries, it would not therefore be justifiable to impose an immediate ban on the use of this product in vaccines."
"For all that, it is advisable to encourage research into alternative methods so as to reduce or eliminate the future use of merthiolate."
"I would also point out that, under pharmaceutical legislation, manufacturers must prove that their products do not harm the environment."
". I welcome this report on the Community strategy for dealing with the impact of mercury on the environment and on humans."
"Mercury is a highly toxic substance and it is vital that scientific evidence is used to establish where it can be used safely and where it should be banned."
"I urge the Commission to bring forward the results of its investigation as a matter of urgency."
". Labour MEPs support the strategy to control mercury proposed by the Commission."
"Mercury is a highly toxic substance which must be subject to strict controls."
"However, we believe that bans/restrictions must only be introduced after dialogue with interested parties and after a thorough impact assessment of the consequences, with industry being given sufficient lead time to adapt to change."
". My grounds for voting the way I did on the Matsakis Report on a Commission strategy for dealing with mercury in the environment are that the Commission has identified the areas it wishes to investigate further before recommending further EU legislation/action."
"My approach is to recognise that mercury is a highly toxic substance and to support the Commission strategy and impact assessment."
".By adopting, on Tuesday, the report by my colleague, Mr Matsakis, on the Community strategy concerning mercury, the European Parliament has just sent a powerful signal to the international community: the most highly toxic chemical substances must be strictly controlled, and the Europe of 25 must set an example by swiftly banning their export."
"Such is the fate that will be reserved in the future for mercury, a heavy metal that is toxic to human beings and ecosystems and of which Europe is the world’s leading exporter."
"I particularly welcome the adoption of paragraph 17, which proposes to restrict the use of mercury in dental amalgams by the end of 2007."
"Parliament thus confirms its vote of 25 January 2005 on my report relating to the European Environment and Health Action Plan, point 6 of which proposed the use of safer alternatives to the mercury used in dental amalgams."
"Common sense has prevailed here."
"Human exposure must be restricted to an absolute minimum."
"That is why it is just as crucial that the European Union quickly find a solution to the problem of handling the 12 000 tonnes of mercury waste that the chlorine and soda industries will produce in the next 15 years."
". Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human beings, eco-systems and animals in the wild."
"Mercury is classified as a priority hazardous substance under the Water Framework Directive and also retards microbiological activity in soil."
"Mercury is a persistent substance and can change in the environment into methyl mercury, which has enormously adverse effects on human health."
"Dental amalgam, which is discharged in the course of dental surgery and from crematoria, is a significant source of mercury emissions."
"This makes it necessary for dental amalgam waste to be properly disposed of."
"The use of mercury in dental amalgam is a live issue."
"The approach to be endorsed is that all the potential dangers involved in the use of mercury in dental amalgam should be examined, and action taken on the basis of what emerges from that examination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make some observations as an explanation for voting against the report on a European Information Society for Growth and Employment by Mr Paasilinna."
"The aims of Project 2010 include innovation and investment in research."
"I was surprised to discover that the report does not cover the issue of research in much detail and does not give it the attention it deserves."
"Research is mentioned only in connection with support for research into individual technologies."
"On the other hand, however, research gives rise in all fields of human endeavour to demand for information and communications technology."
"It is precisely this aspect of feedback that seems to me to be lacking in this report, and yet it can be one of the motors for economic growth and job creation within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The passing reference to the Seventh Framework Programme is not commensurate with the importance of this programme for growth and employment."
"Work skills in digital technologies are now viewed as one of the key competencies and we must develop them within a framework of lifelong learning."
"– Mr President, here we are now, seeking new ways of making more and more things digital."
"The idea is that digital libraries, digital equipment for recording journeys, biometric passports and -government will bring miracles to pass."
"The fact that information and communications technology accounts for 40% of economic growth is indeed impressive."
"With all this euphoria about new technologies, though, we must not lose sight of reality."
"Even though there are, again, encouraging signs of growth in the digital sector, these will do more to put an end to jobs than to create new ones, for the fact is that the high-tech sector is a particularly mobile one, moving first to the eastern Member States and then, in due course, to such countries as India and China."
"Yet again, the EU’s dreams of a corporate job-creation machine will not become reality, but it is good to see that small and medium-sized enterprises are tending more and more to upgrade their equipment, with the aim of becoming more productive and competitive, and of opening up new markets."
"It is to these small and medium-sized businesses that we will have to give more support."
". – I voted in favour of the report on a European Information Society for growth and employment because I believe that access to information and communication technologies is a prerequisite for economic development and social progress."
"The use of these technologies affects practically all of the technical, administrative, commercial, cultural, social and health sectors, among others."
"It is imperative that all the inhabitants of the European Union have equal opportunities when it comes to accessing these technologies, and this at a cost that corresponds to standard market prices."
"I welcome the idea of combating the digital divide, and it is worth pointing out just how much the European Union has missed out by not applying a coherent policy with regard to the licences of the third generation of mobile telephones – the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecom System) – which were sold at auction by the Member States in appalling conditions given the possibilities that this technology offered in terms of political coherence."
"This mistake cannot be repeated."
"I wholeheartedly support the need to invest in research and innovation in these technologies, which are important catalysts of competitiveness, growth and employment."
"We are disappointed that the amendments to this report tabled by our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, were not adopted. Our amendments were aimed at guaranteeing free access to technology and knowledge, freedom of movement and exchange of knowledge, and at strengthening the role of intellectual property in relation to the free movement and dissemination of knowledge."
"Otherwise, there is a risk that a knowledge-based society would be confined to an elite."
"The report supports the continued policy of liberalisation and the use of communications for the purpose of transmitting ‘European ideas and values’, in other words that of turning Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into yet another EU propaganda tool."
"Although the report refers to the role of ICT in promoting social and territorial cohesion and warns that new technology can serve to deepen social exclusion, it fails to develop the theme and does not put forward any proposals to prevent this from happening."
"We abstained on account of the contradictions in the report."
". I support the main thrust of the Paasilinna report and I fully recognise the significant contribution that ICTs can make towards the realisation of the Lisbon goals."
"However, I oppose the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax as I believe the principle of subsidiarity should apply and decisions in relation to taxation should be retained at national level."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on his important and timely report on a European Information Society for growth and employment, to which I lend my full support. I particularly welcome the call for the early adoption of the 7th Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (2007-2013), both aimed at providing the appropriate financial resources to support the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a driving force for competitiveness, growth and employment."
"These two programmes will help to develop entrepreneurial spirit and a culture of entrepreneurship in the EU, which are vital to regional development, as they will put an end to 'digital isolation’ and support SMEs in developing innovative projects."
". I welcome this report, which was launched in June 2005 to foster growth and jobs in the information society and media industries."
"The report has three main priority objectives."
"Firstly, to promote an information space without borders, secondly to stimulate innovation through investment and research, and thirdly to make ICTs accessible everywhere and to everyone in the EU."
"Despite concerns over further regulation, I am encouraged by the fact that i2010 should benefit all citizens in helping to bridge the digital divide and narrow social and regional imbalances."
". There are two key ideas in this report that led me to vote in favour, although I take exception to other points raised in the report."
"On the one hand, I feel it is extremely important to realise that in terms of new technologies, almost everything that is said reflects a backward-looking approach."
"We do not know what the future will be; we only know that it will be fast-moving and new."
"Accordingly, the purpose of this regulation should be, on the one hand, to open up the markets to competition, and on the other to boost investment in innovation."
"Europe's economy will only be competitive if it is an innovation-driven economy and if it becomes an economy of the near future and not one of the present."
"That being said, I share the concern over issues of privacy and information security."
"The society being created is at risk of becoming a vigilante society under constant surveillance, and this will be a major modern tragedy in terms of public freedoms."
"Lastly, we recognise that innovation, in particular new technology, has been responsible for a democratic revolution in modern societies, and this is something that should be welcomed, preserved and encouraged."
"The next item is the oral question by Enrique Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, to the Commission, on the state of the European footwear sector one year after liberalisation (O-0005/2006 B6-0007/2006)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the footwear industry is an important economic sector in the European Community, known throughout the world for the excellence of its products."
"This sector is largely made up of small and medium-sized businesses, located in many cases in regions where they are the main source of employment."
"In 2005 there were more than 11 000 companies, employing more than 500 000 workers directly or indirectly and producing around 700 million shoes, representing 10% of world production."
"I should also point out that, in response to the opening-up process, the footwear industry has been extensively restructured and now concentrates its production on the higher price range in particular."
"I would say that Europe’s most obvious speciality is the leather industry."
"Just as in the case of textiles, the impact of the liberalisation process has been important in terms of putting an end to the quota system."
"The monitoring system introduced by the Commission clearly demonstrates that imports, from China in particular – but not just from China – have seen a spectacular increase."
"Last year, the average increase in imports in terms of value and quantity exceeded 450% and, in some cases, it was as high as 900%."
"The average price of imported footwear has fallen significantly, but the retail price of products has not. This does not support the thesis – a thesis that we all believe should be defended – that the true beneficiaries of the process of trade liberalisation should be the consumers."
"A year ago, the European Confederation of the Footwear Industry presented a complaint about dumping practices in the leather footwear sector."
"This is one of the biggest cases to have arisen in the European Union, and it affects many industries to the tune of more than EUR 800 million."
"On 23 February, Commissioner Mandelson announced to the media that the Commission was going to recommend an increase in tariffs of 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam."
"Children’s and other footwear, which represent a very significant proportion, were not subject to this kind of measure."
"The fact is that the Commission adopted an unprecedented decision, introducing provisional tariffs for a period of five months by way of an antidumping measure."
"It should be pointed out that, given the unit value of the products, this measure cannot be seen as extreme. It is a relatively small percentage."
"I am not going to say anything more about dumping."
"In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, however, I would like to make a few comments on the basis of an initial premise, and that is the need to respect the rules that we have laid down within the framework of the WTO, both inside and outside the Community."
"I am aware that this is rather more than a simple case of dumping."
"In some cases, we are talking about the survival of the sector in Europe and also about the possibility of relocation as an appropriate response to developments."
"As you know, everybody has their arguments in these cases; however, it is inconceivable that the entire European industry should move out."
"At the same time, it should be pointed out that China is trying to achieve market economy status within the WTO."
"Certain aspects of the Community’s investigations indicate that, in this case, China has clearly not complied with WTO obligations, either in the field of subsidies, whether hidden or not, or in the field of counterfeits."
"This is therefore an opportunity, Commissioner, to demonstrate to the citizens that the Commission is going to do everything in its power to ensure that the trade rules are respected, including, if necessary, having recourse to the WTO’s dispute settlement body."
"These distortions of the market are not restricted to the footwear sector."
"There are well-founded suspicions that certain forms of illegal support for Chinese exporting companies are offered regularly."
"Commissioner, in view of the expectations of the industry in question and the sensitivity of European public opinion, I would like to know what actions the Commission will take to ensure that that country respects WTO rules."
"Political considerations must not take precedence over technical conclusions where antidumping is concerned."
"The measures that you have proposed are controversial."
"The European industry and certain Member States are not satisfied with your proposal."
"Public objections have been expressed to the 'creativity' demonstrated by the Commission in its application of the well-established rules and practices in the field of antidumping."
"I do not know whether these allegations are true."
"What I do know is that antidumping investigations are based on laws that must be applied fully without any kind of parallel consideration."
"In conclusion, I can tell you, Commissioner, that the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade is going to follow the whole of this process very closely, because we believe that the step taken by the Commission is a first step and that it must be accompanied by an attitude in favour of China and other countries, such as Vietnam, having greater opportunities within international trade while jointly respecting the rules we have laid down."
". Mr President, in response to the very welcome questions, let me stress that I am strongly committed to developing the two-way trade and investment relationship between Europe and China and with other Asian markets, including Vietnam."
"There is no greater prize, in my view, for European trade policy in the coming years than the prize of getting those relationships right."
"I believe that Europe must respect and adjust to the natural advantages those economies have, shifting our own focus to sectors and to products where our own skills and technologies give us the edge."
"That is how trade grows and that is how Europe’s economies have grown over centuries."
"The European footwear industry is in the front line of global competition."
"For all their ingenuity, creativity and excellence, Europe’s leather-shoe makers are faced with an extraordinary challenge from Asia’s producers."
"However, the case of dumping requires me to distinguish between this tough new competition, on the one hand, and genuinely unfair trade on the other."
"Europe’s trade defence measures target unfair trade."
"They cannot protect us from tough competition."
"They cannot shield us from Asia’s natural and legitimate low-cost advantages."
"However, when those comparative advantages are topped up by unfair and uncompetitive practice, we have a right and an obligation to act."
"That is why, having been presented with a preliminary analysis and assessment by my services, I have recommended to the Commission and to Member States provisional duties in this case."
"There is clear evidence of serious state intervention in the leather footwear sector in China and Vietnam: cheap finance, tax breaks, non-market land rents and improper asset valuation leading to dumping."
"That dumping is causing serious injury to EU producers."
"The dumping duties that I am recommending will ensure that retailers with goods in transit are not suddenly faced with unexpected costs at the border."
"I am suggesting that they be phased in over a period of five months, beginning at about 4% in April."
"It means that importers can plan ahead over the next six months with a maximum of transparency and predictability."
"It nevertheless means that after six months the full duty will be in place and the damaging effects of dumping will be counteracted."
"As I am required by law to do, I have pondered the question of consumer and retailer interest in this case very seriously."
"I have proposed to exclude high-tech sports shoes which are no longer produced in significant numbers in Europe."
"I also propose to exclude children’s shoes so as to be sure that even small price rises are not passed on to poorer families."
"I know that some are worried about the possible impact on consumer prices."
"I believe, on the basis of the facts, that there is a margin within the supply chain to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain."
"As I have said, these are proposals for provisional measures."
"They will be discussed with Member States and must be confirmed by the College of Commissioners."
"I believe that I am proposing a balanced solution that deserves the backing of Member States and this House."
"It corrects the injury but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers."
"There will be no quotas, no limit at all on imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam."
"I have told the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments that I want to work with them to see how they can address the concerns raised by the EU investigation."
"Imposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism."
"It is not a question of asking consumers to subsidise uncompetitive European producers, because the easy comparison is too often made."
"It is also worth being clear that shoes are not the next textiles."
"The textile issue concerned fairly-traded textile imports."
"Our proposed anti-dumping measures on leather shoes tackle, in contrast, unfair competition."
"The Commission has a legal obligation to investigate such a claim and a legal right to protect European producers against such practice."
"Some of your questions address the overall situation in the European footwear sector."
"Let me address this briefly."
"The contraction of the footwear sector is a long-term process that began long before trade in footwear with China was liberalised in 2005."
"Nonetheless, it is clear that there have been winners and losers from this change."
"Some producers have increased their exports and others, including Turkey and some of the ACP countries, have seen their exports to the EU and elsewhere hold steady or fall."
"Clearly, it is China, equipped with a staggering production and export capacity, that has benefited most."
"Here in Europe, more than 40 000 footwear jobs have been lost and more than 1 000 footwear companies have closed down since 2001."
"European production of leather shoes has fallen by 30% and profit margins have been heavily squeezed to just over 1%."
"However, we should not pretend that this intense competitive pressure on European footwear producers is related solely to dumped goods."
"In large part, these are the consequences of changing production and consumption patterns in the global economy."
"I believe we should accept this, while helping those affected to adjust to these changes."
"We should also acknowledge that European producers have significantly contributed to the change by relocating their production to Asia in quite a number of cases."
"As a result, we need to take into account a range of European producer interests in assessing our interests in this matter."
"Rising to the Asian challenge places great demands on our businesses and workers."
"The Commission’s growth and job strategy is built on the idea that Europe must commit itself to equipping today’s Europeans to respond to this challenge and to create tomorrow’s jobs."
"We cannot block globalisation and economic change."
"I do not believe it is in Europe’s interests to try."
"Those who think that the Trade Commissioner can reverse global economic change are asking King Canute to hold back the tide."
"However, we can shape globalisation, even harness its dynamic potential for renewal and, indeed, for innovation in Europe."
"I believe that the broader footwear issue confronts us with that imperative."
"We must invest in change, invest in those affected by change, but face up to the changing world in doing so."
"We must also be robust in our defence of the rules and of fair competition."
"We need to recognise that if we want to win the wider political argument for free trade, we must be ready to defend and stand up for fair trade."
"However, we cannot deny Asia its comparative advantages or the competitive industry that is lifting hundreds of millions in the developing world out of poverty."
"The only sustainable balance to that competition is the creativity, innovation and commitment of European companies themselves, reinforced with the appropriate help from political authorities."
"I am happy to return to any of these points in detail and to answer points that any Member may subsequently raise."
". Mr President, I am a little bit worried that we, and the Commission in particular, have not learned anything from the problem of the ‘bra wars’, as they became known, when we had to readjust our position."
"I fully understand the situation on anti-dumping measures and agree entirely with the Commission’s outlook on it."
"However, Commissioner, you said one or two things in your speech which concern me."
"You said that, when you looked at Vietnam and China, there were circumstances where they had financing, special financial agreements and tax breaks etc. Does that never apply in some cases in the European Union?"
"Are there not cases where this quite often happens in the European Union?"
"In particular, have European funding, structural funds, etc. never been used?"
"Would there be a risk of us perhaps being taken to the WTO on the extent of anti-dumping measures or support?"
"Could you also answer one or two other questions?"
"I understand the situation with China very clearly and I would accept your position, but one of the things that we are trying to do in the Western world at the moment is make poverty history."
"This is something that we have been talking about quite a lot."
"However, Vietnam, 30 years ago and even 10 years ago, was a very poor country, probably poorer than many sub-Saharan African countries."
"Why have they had the need?"
"Surely they have been able to compete without actually putting in a support mechanism?"
"Could you answer that?"
"This is a country which has dragged itself from being one of the poorest and now at least has some sort of infrastructure."
"I am concerned that we are going to be protective of the European shoe industry."
"You say not."
"However, I still feel concerned."
"I should like you to answer one final question."
"I think we as MEPs and you as the Commission have missed an opportunity to get the message across about dumping."
"People see us as being protectionist."
"Your staff told me that a pair of designer boots from China cost about EUR 180 in Europe and yet only EUR 10 coming from China."
"If the effect of the 19% is passed directly on to the consumer, will the 19% be calculated on the EUR 180 or on the EUR 10 that it costs to bring them in?"
". Mr President, I have a few questions and I will not be able to speak on behalf of my group in this case because, as with the anti-dumping cases, I think we are pretty much divided and have our own views on this issue."
"Nevertheless, I want to thank the Commissioner for presenting his point of view and for intervening."
"My starting point is that the anti-dumping measures and instruments need to be taken quite seriously."
"On that point, I support my colleague Mr Sturdy, who is right."
"If we do not use the instrument in a transparent and fair way it could become quite complicated for us."
"My first question to the Commissioner is: will the EU produce an overall assessment of the conditions of competition and state intervention in the People’s Republic of China?"
"The European Parliament would also like to receive a report on China’s compliance with WTO rules and accession commitment five years after its accession to the WTO."
"Would the EC take WTO action if China and Vietnam do not stop their unfair actions within a reasonable period of time and what would these measures be?"
"Commissioner, do you agree that the EC agreement and the results of the AD investigations are confidential and that leaks of information may lead to market distortions?"
"Could you explain in detail the rationale behind the exclusion of children’s footwear, especially in view of the fact that in some countries children’s footwear is worn by adults?"
"Could you explain why the publication of the results of the anti-surveillance system were so delayed?"
"If I am not completely mistaken, it was one year."
"One small point: how do you see this investigation relating to another evaluation which is currently being undertaken as regards giving China market economy status?"
". Mr President, Commissioner, recent figures from your offices, of which you seem to have been aware for a long time, have taught us that since the liberalisation of European imports last year, the monthly shoe imports from China have risen by 400%, and in some cases, by no less than 900%."
"You have not announced any dumping levies until now."
"Some may say that this is too little too late."
"They believe that you could have prevented things from getting worse by being more alert and responding more rapidly."
"The European shoe industry is a relatively small sector, restricted to some four European countries, and already delocalised to a great extent as it is."
"The question that arises is whether this is a good enough reason to let the whole sector go down the drain, certainly if it has to come up against – and you termed this very aptly yourself – unfair trade practices, such as dumping, or direct and indirect state aid."
"Today, the free market is a socially adjusted one in which rules that apply at global level must be observed by all the players."
"This is clearly not the case here."
"China is keen to enjoy the benefits of WTO membership but overlooks the obligations that this entails."
"It is obvious that the whole of the world market is at risk of being thrown out of joint."
"Textiles yesterday, shoes today, what will it be tomorrow?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner why the Commission did not react any sooner."
"Can it really be that it is scared of rubbing the big yellow giant up the wrong way?"
"Most of all, can the Commissioner explain to us how we can convince the workers in the European shoe industry, who are at risk of losing their jobs as a result of unfair competition, of the benefits to be derived from globalisation of this kind?"
". – Mr President, there is a certain sense of déjà vu in this debate."
"Although anti-dumping is indeed different from the example of the multi-fibre arrangement, I believe it is no coincidence that this crisis follows the end of quotas."
"It is clear that in a world of completely deregulated and unfettered free trade the so-called ‘China price’ will drag costs and standards down right across the globe, with the harshest impact on the poorest."
"I believe we will see more cases of this kind until we recognise that the way forward is through a system of quotas that enables everyone to benefit from trade, rather than just a few."
"Mr Mandelson talks about Europe being able to adapt by moving up the value-added chain, but we have had this discussion many times."
"He knows my view that essentially China is going to do exactly the same, and why wouldn’t it?"
"That is not going to provide a solution for Europe and it is not going to provide a solution for the rest of the world either."
"What is interesting about this case is the extraordinary lengths that the Commission appears to have gone to in order to give the impression that this is a much less serious case than it is."
"It almost feels as if the neo-liberal dogma and ideology are getting the better of the facts on the ground."
"There are, therefore, some key questions to be answered, including the level of duties, based on injury, that the Commissioner has found: 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam."
"Those are apparently based on adjustments never used in the European Community before."
"There is real concern in the industry that they will not be enough."
"The exemption of children’s and sports shoes has the effect of excluding around 42% of footwear imported at dumping prices, yet for which dumping duties will not be paid."
"I do not believe that is fair to European producers; but it is not fair to Chinese workers either, who are working for pitiful wages – around USD 12 per week, as mentioned in reports of – while at the same time social rights are reduced to an absolute minimum."
"Unless we suppose that the consumer is benefiting, I believe it is worth noting that the anti-dumping duties are not likely to lead to increased consumer prices, but to decrease the profit margins of the importers."
"I believe that we need to be genuinely concerned about the impact of competition from companies based in China – not just on Europe, but on poorer countries such as the EuroMed countries – and recognise that until we have a system of managed trade, the winners will always be concentrated in a handful of ever fewer countries and the losers will prove to be the majority."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for ten years the European Union and the United States have been leading negotiations on China’s entry into the WTO."
"Now Beijing has learned the lesson and is not hesitating to apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation with a merciless resolution worthy of its masters."
"It appears that the anti-dumping measures in no way comply with Community legislation or case-law and may have an extremely negative impact on the whole system of EU trade policy and consumers: we should therefore conduct a wholesale rethink of the WTO’s laissez-faire doctrines."
"We believe that it is important for the European Union to retain an economic model that places at its centre respect for social clauses and the rights of workers in all parts of the world."
"Europe ought to be more active in the various international bodies to promote work with dignity."
"Europe ought to bring in regulations designed to promote labels for ascertaining geographical provenance and compliance with social and environmental rules."
"If we do not call into question the WTO’s laissez-faire policies, then after textiles and shoes will come a long list of other products."
". – Mr President, I should like to express my sympathy to Commissioner Mandelson."
"Commissioner, you have got an impossible job."
"How can 25 countries have one single trade policy?"
"One size does not fit all, whether it is trade policy or shoe sizes."
"You have also got the problem that you yourself are a free trader, a globalist, a moderniser."
"You recognise what is going on in the world, but you are battling against the revived economic nationalism that exists within this European Union."
"You simply cannot do your job and you are overseeing a regime that is laced with protectionism and sheer hypocrisy as we, of course, subsidise our own agriculture and will keep export subsidies in place until 2013."
"But, in line with what John Blundell, the Director-General of the IEA, said just the other day: do you recognise that the overwhelming majority of British businesses now want British withdrawal from the common commercial policy and for us to get back to running our own trade policy?"
"Do you recognise that?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the footwear market since 1 January 2005 has led to an increase in imports from China equal to 500 per cent in one year, giving rise to a further contraction in the EU footwear sector, more bankruptcies and higher unemployment."
"Import prices are artificially low; there cannot be any fair competition when the starting points are so wide apart and there is no equity when dumping is the rule."
"The consequences of this situation have also affected suppliers of footwear and of parts from non-EU countries, including applicant countries and developing countries that have been driven out of the Community market."
"Following complaints by the European industry against China and Vietnam the Commission has opened an anti-dumping enquiry, which is the largest of its kind ever launched by the EU."
"Good intentions are not, however, enough for Parliament; we call for information on specific points."
"What impact has the disappearance of the quota system had on the EU industry and on developing countries?"
"How does the Commission intend to tackle the need to restructure the European footwear sector?"
"What assessments can the Commission provide on the results of the EU monitoring system in the sector?"
"How are the anti-dumping enquiries proceeding and what are the prospects for the protection of EU interests?"
"Does the Commission intend to launch further initiatives internationally, as was the case for textiles, or is it expected to be too late?"
"Has the Commission considered the need to launch an enquiry regarding China within the framework of the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism?"
"The level of protection laid down in the proposal is too low, and is inadequate, especially if it is spread over six months, during the course of which the Chinese will not wait for the duty to reach 20% to export huge quantities of shoes."
"This, Mr President and Mr Mandelson, is not what the free market is."
"Mr President, it is abundantly obvious that Europe needs to protect itself."
"The scale of the threat before us can be readily understood if we consider that the import of footwear from China has risen by several hundred per cent."
"The situation is far worse with regard to Vietnam as the latter is an even more dynamic country."
"Clearly, we need to resort to certain instruments that are only apparently contrary to the spirit of the free market."
"I say only apparently, because in continents such as Asia production in the sector we are discussing has nothing in common with the free market, as the local labour force is cheap in the extreme."
"It stands to reason that the European Union is entitled to defend itself and to resort to standard economic procedures and instruments."
"I would, however, appeal for consistency."
"A study of the broader situation reveals that unemployment in this sector has affected a couple of states in the European Union in particular."
"It also reveals that those same states are refusing to recognise the free market within the European Union."
"In my view, this demonstrates a certain lack of consistency and I appeal to the governments of the Member States in question to remedy the situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have supplied us with the figures: today, footwear production in Europe has decreased by around 30%, import prices have fallen by more than 20% and, above all, the sector has lost nearly 40 000 jobs."
"Six months have passed since the textile industry affair and, just as we had predicted at the time, the Community market once again finds itself faced with unfair commercial practices."
"In fact, we have – as you pointed out – evidence of state intervention and of the granting of backdoor subsidies to manufacturers from China and Vietnam."
"Faced with the evidence of such a violation of commercial practices, the European Union has a duty to react and to repair the damage caused to the Community industry, and this in accordance with WTO rules."
"That is why it is necessary – as you have demonstrated, Commissioner – to implement antidumping measures in relation to these imports."
"To establish a law for products that are subject to dumping does not amount to asking the consumer to subsidise uncompetitive European businesses."
"Rather, it is a question, in fact, of guaranteeing the conditions for balanced trade, which protects the interests of both consumers and manufacturers."
"Thus, to intervene with the aim of limiting the harmful effects of dumping should not be regarded as protectionism."
"The European Union aspires to harmonious and open relations with its Asian partners in order also to free these populations from poverty."
"However, it also aspires to enforce fair and equitable trade rules for all."
"A year after the latest restrictions on footwear imports from China were lifted, we are in a good position to make an objective assessment of the impact of trade liberalisation in this sector."
"There has been a sharp rise in imports, with the consequences that that entails for European manufacturing sector."
"This new situation makes it all the more necessary to monitor the ongoing restructuring process in the footwear sector, whereby the business world must be encouraged to adapt, and the economic structure of the regions most directly affected by the social impact of the ongoing changes must be rearranged."
"At the same time, however, the Commission must commit itself to detecting and combating glaring examples of unfair competition, which is exacerbating an already problematic situation."
"Unfair competition is the biggest ally of protectionist impulses."
"The EU must take a particularly strong lead in this area."
"In this context, we should welcome the Commission’s decision to adopt anti-dumping measures, after it emerged that China and Vietnam had resorted to unfair practices, such as the artificially low pricing of its exports in this sector."
"Such practices are especially unacceptable in view of the fact that these countries already enjoy extraordinary advantages over their competitors."
"There is therefore no justification for any kind of manipulative approach."
"Although the adopted measures are broadly welcome, we do have one or two concerns."
"The gradual implementation of anti-dumping rights, from a low starting point, may lead to an immediate increase in advance imports from China and Vietnam, which would make the current situation much worse."
"This is a serious concern."
"On the other hand, the idea of excluding certain categories of product from the scope of measures also deserves thorough analysis, given the threat of aggressive behaviour, which can only be combated if – as we are hoping – these imports are strictly monitored."
"Mr President, in September I stood here and called on the Commissioner to demonstrate greater foresight in the first post-quota era."
"Little did I know then that since June, the Commission had statistics showing almost a 700% increase in imports of footwear from China, which indicated the serious state intervention in the sector that the Commission revealed five months later."
"The cynic in me suggests that these statistics were swept under the carpet in order to end the ‘bra wars’, another sticking plaster when the EU needs long-term solutions."
"To add insult to injury, the Commission then went to the press with its plans for anti-dumping duties on leather shoes before even the Member States received the proposals, let alone this Parliament."
"Commissioner, EU manufacturers and retailers who fear the future in a market swamped with cheap Asian exports need answers, which you hide from them."
"They need confidence and hope, which you take away from them; and above all they require innovation, ideas and management from you, which you seem unable to provide."
"Commissioner, first it was textiles, now it is shoes, next it will be furniture."
"Unless you demonstrate greater foresight and communicate fully with your EU partners we will not be able to work together and help European industry to face the challenge of these emerging markets."
"– Mr President, not even a year after the problems in the textile sector, Europe is about to engage in a fresh trade conflict with China."
"Time and time again, the rapid economic development of Asian countries takes Europe by surprise, and Europe is once again divided."
"The EU should not be paralysed, though, by the opposing views adopted in the northern and southern Member States."
"Once again, the Commission’s policy constitutes a weak compromise between free trade and protectionism."
"For that reason, the Commission should, as a matter of priority, develop a solid and unambiguous trade policy with the Asian region, so as to break the chain of sectoral conflicts."
"While I can understand the frustration felt by the importers and the Member States that do not have an industry of their own, I do take the view that it is vital to remind China of the WTO’s rules."
"As these words must be backed up by action, I would call on you, Commissioner, to include the documented state intervention in the shoe industry in the negotiations on market economy status for the People’s Republic of China."
"– Mr Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, it is the same old story: having abolished all restrictions on the import of footwear products from the Far East and having caused such damage to the European and Italian industries in the sector, with the obvious consequences for employment, we are laying the foundations for definite risks in the future to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They will finally be crushed by the unfair competition of goods at the very lowest prices, produced without any proper monitoring of the conditions in the production and distribution chain, either with regard to environmental impact or the social security benefits and employment benefits enjoyed by the labour force."
"These are the factors of production on which the business costs advantage operates, unfairly distorting every competitive capacity and transforming it into, instead of the free operation of the market, open dumping that runs counter to the interests not only of one sector, but of the entire Community."
"I ask for the Commission to take action to defend the footwear sector against unfair competition from products imported from countries outside the EU, partly in the light of the fact that the monitoring measures so far taken by the EU have proved, in practice, to be useless."
"We are calling not just for vigilance, but also for active defence of the special expertise and quality of the European footwear sector, through strict limits on imports, the imposition of duties and the certification of the social and environmental ethical qualities of products, as I have already requested on other occasions."
"– Mr President, I belong to those who support a multilateral, balanced, free world trade system with institutional and political consistency."
"I mean a system based on even stricter rules, on stronger institutions, on more transparent and democratic procedures."
"The increase in imports of leather shoes of up to 500% in 2005, a percentage which Mr Baron Crespo raised to 900%, is not just the product of liberalisation and that must be understood."
"It is the product of unfair practices in violation of the rules of international trade on the part of China and Vietnam, on the part of two emerging economies."
"As other Members said, we lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of productive units disappeared in the European textile industry yesterday and today it will be the shoe industry."
"The European Union needs to send a clear message, as you intimated Commissioner, and we are all with you in this message."
"We are behind you."
"Yes to competition, no to its evident or concealed distortion."
"The anti-dumping duties – and this should be understood – are not a protective measure; they are a measure of legal commercial defence and, if this measure is to be effective, the duties must be proportionate to the degree of dumping."
"To all those who use the better price argument against the imposition of duties, I would counter with the following question: have consumers benefited from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation?"
"My personal opinion is that the few suppliers of products from China and Vietnam have benefited."
"The Commission should organise its institutional attack, an attack of systematic convergence and effective protection of intellectual and industrial property, an attack against ecological and social dumping, against opaque and unfair practices and state interventions."
"Otherwise, the accumulation of experiences of violation of the rules of international trade, with the Union reacting after the event, may jeopardise the confidence of European citizens in the fundamental principle of the liberalisation of the world trade system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the quota system was abolished last year, imports from China have, as has been mentioned, spectacularly increased by around 500%."
"That has serious consequences for the competitiveness of the European footwear sector which, faced with this flood of very low-priced imports, is seeing a number of tragic bankruptcies, to say nothing of the job losses that go with them."
"Furthermore, our traditional suppliers in the form of candidate countries and countries in the Euromed area have been ousted from the Community market."
"The Commission remains silent on this matter and does not seem keen to assess the impact of the damage done by this liberalisation."
"Following the complaint lodged by the operators in this sector, you opened an antidumping inquiry."
"The alarming results of that inquiry bring to light unquestionable evidence of state intervention and of social dumping practices, which cause material loss to our industries."
"In order to combat this distortion of the fundamental rules of international trade, you are proposing some measures to us today."
"I am worried, however, about the gradual entry into force of these antidumping laws over a five-month period, a precedent that I feel is inappropriate and legally questionable and will not be without pernicious effects."
"These laws should make it possible to eliminate either dumping or the losses it causes."
"In fact, the proposed progressive rates do not fulfil either of those two alternative conditions."
"What is more, the exclusion of children’s shoes seems to me to be unjustified and incomprehensible."
"Your proposals could very quickly prove to be insufficient faced with the extent of the losses suffered by our businesses."
"Other initiatives could be taken to counter these unfair commercial practices."
"For example, it would be possible to open an inquiry in the framework of the provisional safeguard measures applicable to Chinese imports, measures that have the advantage of being simple and effective."
"If the Member States asked you to take such initiatives, would the Commission envisage doing so?"
"Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law?"
"Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened."
"After textiles last year and footwear now, which other sectors will have to be subjected to these unfair practices in the future?"
"Mr Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian situation in the footwear sector prompts me to call for a significant change to the measures proposed by you and in part accepted by the Italian Government."
"Italy is already paying very high prices in terms of employment."
"Mine is a request not in the name of protectionism, but in the name of a calculation of the social impact."
"It is not a case of affirming or refusing globalisation or the market, and its analysis is measured, in theoretical terms, and also realistic."
"It is a question of emphases: the path between heaven and hell is a narrow one."
"Just as there is a fine distinction, as you have said once again here, between tough competition and unfair competition."
"I base myself on your words: China and Vietnam have broken the rules."
"I think, quite frankly, that your measures should be revised, with changes to both the figures and the deadlines."
"In other words, duties should be applied immediately, not in a few months’ time, and they should be increased, by also excluding high-tech sports shoes from the exemption on duties Otherwise, neither European producers’ nor European consumers’ interests will be protected, nor will the market be well served."
"– Mr President, in the town of Romans, in the department of Drôme, the unemployment rate stands at 18% – twice the French average – because the footwear sector there is devastated and traditional skills disappearing."
"This collapse is due to the anachronistic application of the Ricardian model underpinning your policy."
"The new international division of labour has encouraged low-wage countries to specialise in labour-intensive industries, while high-saving countries concentrate on very capital-intensive industries."
"Today, growth-starved capital is also leaving those countries."
"Thus, the countries of the European Union, which used to have a high level of productivity and high wages, are being surpassed by countries that are just as productive but that pay low wages."
"In order to prevent a fatal outcome, we must re-read the work of the liberal Maurice Allais, we must rediscover the virtues of the common external tariff of blessed memory and we must protect ourselves outside the Union in order to be free inside it."
"If we do not do so, then all of our labour-intensive industries will follow in the footsteps of the footwear industry."
"Commissioner, EU history where anti-dumping is concerned is scary."
"Well-organised special interests are allowed again and again to impose customs duties in their pursuit of small profits, which turn into large costs for consumers."
"When the Commission introduced customs duties on TV sets, consumers had to pay SEK 2.00 for every krona earned by the industry."
"In the case of the duties on bed linen from Pakistan, every krona that went to the manufacturers cost consumers SEK 3.00."
"In the case of Norwegian salmon, matters were even worse: every krona earned by the salmon producers cost consumers as much as SEK 70.00."
"The Commission is therefore failing to take sufficient account of consumers and, thus, of Community interests."
"Now, the process has begun of making the same mistake once more – in connection with shoes from China and Vietnam – but this time we know the cost of the policy in advance."
"The Danish Government conducted a study showing that the costs to consumers in the EU was eight times greater than manufacturers’ profits and that, in total, the EU was losing more than SEK 2.5 billion."
"For Sweden, the figure is even more appalling."
"Each krona earned by Swedish manufacturers costs Swedish consumers SEK 44.00."
"In total, Swedish consumers can count on paying almost SEK 60 million more for their shoes."
"The only EU country in which the business is estimated to be profitable is Slovakia, where SEK 300 000 is estimated to be earned."
"It would be cheaper if we in the European Parliament were to pool our money, in that way preventing people from having to pay duties."
"To be honest, I do not believe that that would be a mistake."
"In spite of everything, the Commission has consciously chosen to make comparisons with expensive shoes from Brazil and measured the increase in imports before the quota was abolished against that after the quota was abolished."
"Not a single factory has been given market economy status, in spite of its being acknowledged that factories buy leather and labour in a way that is adjusted to conditions in the market."
"I am seriously concerned about the increasing protectionism I encounter in the EU, and I hope that this is the last time the Commission gives way to the demands of protectionists at the expense of citizens."
"Mr President, the European footwear sector is experiencing difficulties for two reasons: on the one hand, it is suffering as a result of unfair practices, and, on the other, Commissioner, it is still facing tariff difficulties and other practical obstacles when it comes to accessing third-country markets."
"I believe that all of this makes it necessary to take effective action to tackle dumping, enabling us to react fairly, but swiftly, in order to prevent speculative movements and ultimately a greater increase in imports while we are waiting for measures to be taken, as happened in the case of textiles."
"The Commission’s proposal on the antidumping procedure relating to footwear from China and Vietnam is reasonable and balanced, but it contains surprising elements that many people cannot understand, such as not applying the measures that you have proposed either to children’s shoes – which, as you know, are worn not only by children – or to special technology athletic footwear (STAF)."
"Where dumping exists, duties will have to be imposed that are effective in guaranteeing fair competition conditions and, in this regard, the level of duties and their practical application should be based on their effectiveness, that is to say on how effective they are in eliminating dumping."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, what is lacking in the European Union is a strategy for facing up to globalisation."
"The globalisation fund now provides us with a means of dealing with the past, but what solutions do we have for the future?"
"My initial reaction to this was that this is the same sort of protectionism that we find with regard to textiles, and that would be a bad thing, for we need free and fair access to markets throughout the world."
"That is important to our producers within the European Union, and it is important that we in the European Union should keep to the rules, just as we demand that our trading partners should do."
"After I had got my hands on more information, it became clear to me that this is not protectionism, but dumping, and it became clear to me that the measures you are putting in place are, technically speaking, better planned than those you took to deal with textiles back then, but I can also see that our actions, now as then, are inconsistent, and inconsistency will be seen by the Chinese as a sign of weakness."
"I can still see why we have taken sports shoes out of the procedure, but why have we done so with children’s shoes?"
"Either this is dumping that we are dealing with or it is not."
"I do not think it makes any sense whatever to argue on the basis of the effect on consumers, for in no way have they benefited from the reduced import prices over the past few years, and, when one considers that a shoe imported for EUR 6.50 can retail for EUR 120, it becomes clear that there is no justification whatever for the importers' warnings of price increases, which, it is claimed, will be of the order of 20%."
"Let us take a look at the issue of China."
"What lies behind this dumping?"
"One aspect I find deeply disturbing; businesses are unable to keep proper accounts or ensure proper management."
"That is part of the reason."
"On the other hand, though, I am also seriously worried about the ever-increasing role played by the state in dumping, about the unjustified prices for land, about the tax reliefs for export businesses, about the banks’ unrecoverable loans, about the subsidised costs of raw materials, and about much else besides."
"It simply makes no sense, then, to do as some in the Commission seem to want to do, and recognise China as a market economy."
"Here too, we must be consistent."
"In all these respects, I would like to see us, in future, demonstrating more consistency and making a better job of keeping to the rules."
"I wish to begin by expressing my support for the proposal to adopt anti-dumping measures in the footwear sector."
"This was the least we could ask for given that dumping destroys the very essence of freedom of trade."
"Europe’s industry must not die of apathy and of complicity with such practices."
"Given the lack of time I shall limit myself to two remarks."
"Given that we know dumping takes place, it makes no sense to allow it to be tolerated. This is what will happen with the proposed gradual approach to implementing anti-dumping measures."
"There is no justification for this gradual approach."
"My second remark is that excluding children’s footwear is totally unacceptable."
"There is no justification, no legal basis and no technical foundation for such a move."
"To pursue this and other unjustified exclusions totally undermines the credibility of these measures."
"I therefore call for a complete rethink of these aspects."
"Lastly, it is crucial that the Commission abandon its constantly reactive position and begin to achieve results in its political priority of opening up third-country markets for European footwear exports, and in particular the Japanese market, mechanisms of access to the Russian market and indeed the Chinese market."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for learning from its past experience."
"I am glad the decision has been taken not to impose quotas on import issues since this would have been disastrous for the whole supply chain and for consumers, and I think we all agree on that."
"However, we need to ask in whose interests these anti-dumping duties are being imposed."
"I cannot see how consumers will benefit."
"Whether we like it or not, European citizens are voting with their wallets and buying imported footwear."
"Imposing duties could punish consumers by increasing the price they pay for their footwear."
"I agree that some of the predicted price rises may be alarmist, but there will be price rises."
"We are told that a 20% duty on the import price of shoes should not lead to a large increase in the retail price."
"Retailers and others in the supply chain are expected to absorb the duties."
"However, in this day and age I am astounded that the Commission believes that it knows best how retailers and shoe companies should run their businesses and how much they should be charging their customers."
"What has happened to the laws of supply and demand between sellers and European citizens and consumers?"
"If the Commission truly feels that retailers are making too high a margin on shoes, then it should launch an investigation into the competitiveness of the shoe industry, not punish retailers and the supply chain by using the blunt instrument of anti-dumping duties."
"Is pushing up the prices of shoes from China and Vietnam really going to help European producers, or will it simply force retailers to source their shoes from other non-EU markets, such as India?"
"Finally, can we really take the high ground and complain about the Chinese Government subsidising the footwear industry when we spend so much of our EU budget on subsidising inefficient farmers?"
"Let us in the EU throw away the post-war protectionist model and take a lead in embracing globalisation."
"Mr President, Mr Mandelson, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say that I have the impression that this measure is now devoid of substance."
"Sports shoes have been excluded, but how do we define sports shoes?"
"Children’s shoes have been excluded; I and many, many other women still wear these shoes despite not having been children for some time."
"The application of anti-dumping measures has taken place with a sluggishness that has not been seen before, and above all anti-dumping duties are being proposed that are not sufficient to tackle a situation of unfair competition that the Commission itself defines as serious."
"So I ask you: do you not believe that lurking behind the defence of consumers, in particular poorer families, as you wrote in Sunday’s , there is also, or perhaps chiefly – I do not know – an attempt to protect the interests of multinationals?"
"Do you not believe that the Commission’s policy, which I consider to be at times ambiguous, might endanger the important, if not unique, instrument of European commercial policy?"
"Finally, I would like you to comment on what is happening in the bed linen sector since, in this case too, the action taken by the Commission is not easy to understand."
". Mr President, if you do not mind I shall not go along the course of answering the point about bed linen at this precise moment."
"In the time I have available I think it would be better to stick to shoes, but I can assure you that the question of any anti-dumping duty on bed linen will be properly assessed and properly applied as, in my opinion, it is at the moment."
"I think that the value of debates such as this and the important role of this Parliament are demonstrated by the very important and insightful observations that have been made during the last 45 minutes."
"My role on behalf of the Commission is to listen to what honourable Members have to say and to reflect very carefully on the points and arguments that have been raised."
"I can assure you I will reflect on them and on the observations made by Member States so that when I come back to the Commission with final recommendations I will be able to do so having heard the variety, diversity and range of different points and arguments that have been made."
"However, having heard so many people this afternoon complain that my intervention is protectionist, unnecessary and unjustified, alongside a slightly greater number of Members of this House who have complained that I am not going far enough, my actions are inadequate and that I should go further, I am tempted to make the easy observation that perhaps I have got the measures just about right between those two rival points of view!"
"However, tempting as it is to make that rather cheap observation, I am going to avoid doing so."
"I should like to say, though, that I agree particularly with Mr Papastamkos and Mrs Saïfi, both of whom see the need to intervene against anti-competitive and trade-distorting behaviour by our partners, but at the same time to do so with a degree of perspective and balance that I think it behoves me to uphold."
"I think Mr Assis is right in that, in the provisional measures that are introduced, it is important that we maintain careful monitoring and surveillance of the effect of what we are doing so as to ensure that, if there is circumvention of our duties, we are able to review the situation and perhaps take revised action when we come to the definitive stage of our measures later this year."
"Let me very quickly respond to some of the other points that have been made."
"Some have drawn a parallel between the proposed action on shoes and the action that we took on textiles."
"They are very different cases."
"In the case of textiles, we were dealing with fairly-traded goods, albeit subject to a dramatic and sudden increase in volume following the lifting of quotas on Chinese textiles at the beginning of 2005."
"We therefore took a safeguard measure by the introduction of quotas, as we are entitled to do."
"We were not, as in this case, dealing with anti-competitive measures – dumping actions – that attract an anti-dumping measure in the form of a tariff duty – not a quota and not a physical limit."
"Therefore I do not anticipate our running into the temporary teething problems that we had in the case of textiles."
"This should be remembered by those who describe the textile period as involving us in some sort of war or battle with China."
"Far from it."
"We were able to agree with China the measures that we took, in a very unwarlike way."
"Two other points were raised by a number of Members."
"One concerns the impact on consumer prices."
"Let us put this case into perspective."
"It concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every 100 pairs bought by European consumers; in other words, a fraction of the product range."
"A duty would be just over EUR 1.50 on average wholesale prices of EUR 8.50 on shoes which then sell for between EUR 40 and EUR 120, as opposed to a duty which would simply amount to EUR 1.50."
"Please do not tell me that EUR 1.50 cannot be absorbed across the supply chain by importers and retailers, especially importers and retailers who have benefited from low import prices from China and Vietnam but who have not passed on the effects of those cheaper import prices to consumers – a question that consumers may put to their retailers if they are able to encounter them at some stage in the future."
"A number of Members have asked me why I am proposing to exclude sports technology shoes and children’s shoes."
"In the case of the sports shoes, these are excluded from the investigation because they are not produced in Europe in sufficient quantity to qualify as being potentially harmed by dumping."
"There is therefore no injury to European producers because they barely exist in the case of these sports shoes."
"In the case of children’s shoes, the exclusion I am proposing is on the grounds of Community interest."
"Young children need three to four pairs of new shoes per year."
"The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes."
"In my view, parents should not see any potential hurdles put in the way of buying good-quality shoes for their children."
"Those who want me to reclassify the customs segmentation for these shoes should bear in mind that the customs classification for children is up to size 37½ with heels less than 3cm."
"Whilst I am prepared to discuss that with my colleagues in TAXUD, it is a classification that I am given, not one that I propose."
"Let me make just briefly one or two other quick observations."
"There was a suggestion that the investigation had taken too long."
"This sampling takes time."
"I am obliged by the regulations that exist within the European Community to observe very strict procedures and use very strict reference countries and companies when I am investigating those of another country that does not enjoy market economy status."
"Therefore, just as I cannot anticipate dumping complaints – some Members were complaining that I do not show enough foresight, as if I have a crystal ball before me that is going to reveal where the next dumping complaint is going to come from – I cannot pre-empt proper procedures and investigations that are laid out in our regulations and which I am obliged to follow in detail."
"Let me reply to the suggestion that somehow there was a breach of confidentiality."
"I do not understand this."
"Member States received the Commission’s working document before my press conference on 23 February."
"The moment these working documents go out to Member States I can assure you that they are as good as published to the media."
"I therefore have to clarify them immediately and explain and justify what I am doing."
"This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commission’s services."
"I shall leave the matter there, except to say in conclusion that it is very important that we see what is happening in China, Vietnam, India and other Asian countries in some perspective."
"Of course there is tough competition and there is a difficult challenge for European producers and manufacturers to rise to, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help European producers rise to this challenge and to help those employed in companies adjust to the challenges and the new circumstances of international trade which we are experiencing."
"I do not believe that a proper and legitimate way of helping people to adjust to these new forces in the global economy is to encourage people to shelter from them or to pretend that, if we close our eyes or cover our heads with a blanket, these changes, challenges and new sources of competition will somehow go away and leave us alone so that we do not have to respond to them."
"Any politician giving that sort of message to the public would be guilty of false leadership, and poor leadership to the public, who need to understand what is going on and help to respond to it."
"We cannot maintain the pretence that we in Europe, by retreating from the competitive challenge we are facing in the global economy, will somehow be able to hide from it and, at the same time, maintain our living standards and our prosperity in the future."
"We cannot and will not do that."
"We have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness, innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future."
"If we do not rise to that challenge and do not set that out to our public, we cannot blame them subsequently for reacting with fear and mystification to what is taking place in the global economy."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he could make a short comment on a question raised by many of our colleagues on granting market economy status to China."
". Mr President, China is not yet qualified to receive recognition of market economy status by Europe."
"There are technical criteria that China needs to fulfil, and it is making progress towards doing so."
"Indeed we can, should and are giving every assistance to China to enable it more easily and rapidly to make the technical changes that will enable it to fulfil those criteria."
"It is important to do that."
"Let me add this related comment."
"The environment in which Member States and Members of this House come to judge the market economy status of China will be helped and encouraged by China doing more than it is at the moment to open its markets to our exports and to others’ trade, to make sure that it is in full compliance with its WTO accession commitments, and to make sure that where it is taking longer than is reasonable to move towards full compliance with those commitments and WTO rules it makes the necessary changes sooner rather than later."
"If China were to do that, and to respond to the anxieties felt in Europe and around the world about the growth of its export capacity in a way that rebalanced the terms of trade – so that as well as people seeing goods coming in ever-growing numbers from China, they were also to see those containers being refilled and returned to China with European and other goods – it would do more than anything else to still public anxiety about what we are seeing in China."
"Understandably, people in Europe see the growth of China’s market as a threat, but we must understand it as a huge opportunity for us in Europe to sell our own goods and services to that market in future."
"However, China has a responsibility to make sure that no artificial or unreasonable barriers remain in place to European goods and services being sold to the Chinese market in ever-growing numbers."
"When we get that equation right, then perhaps people will be able to look more sympathetically, as well as technically, at the issue of China’s market economy status."
"The debate is closed."
"I welcome the Commission’s diligence in listening to the demands of small and medium-sized European enterprises worried by the increase in imports from non-EU countries, and the latest proposal for compensatory anti-dumping duties on leather shoes, against China and Vietnam."
"I believe, however, that the measures put forward are still totally inadequate given the severity of the issue."
"The duties proposed are inadequate because they are too low and therefore ineffective."
"The phasing-in period (six months) is inadequate, since it is a procedure that is too feeble for such a serious case of dumping."
"The exclusion of non-professional sports shoes and children’s shoes (which can also include women’s shoes) is also unacceptable."
"I would also point out that another fundamental request, which is the compulsory introduction of a label of origin for products entering the EU, has been dragging on for two years without the Member States being able to come to agreement."
"It is also necessary to tackle the worrying increase in swap practices – in other words, anomalous movements of products with the aim of bypassing more stringent customs controls (imports from Belgium have increased by an amount of 17.8%, which is absolutely inexplicable)."
"The calls by the Commission to make innovative changes are reasonable and interesting, but they make sense only in a genuinely equitable and fair competitive environment, and the Commission has a duty to ensure that the international market is just that."
"I want to raise with the Commissioner the plight of a factory in my constituency – 'Dickies' in Midsomer Norton, near Radstock in Somerset – whose future and workforce are threatened by any adverse outcome from your services' current investigation of an anti-dumping complaint regarding protective footwear imported from China."
"I have met with representatives of both management and the workforce, including trade union representatives from GMB, and they are united in stating that jobs and livelihoods are at stake should the Commission impose anti-dumping duties on this particular sector."
"The imported footwear from China underpins the distribution and manufacturing sections in the Midsomer Norton plant."
"Those who introduced the complaint do not manufacture generally in Europe, but source form other third countries rather than China."
"I believe the investigation will find that no damage has been done to European industry by these imports from China and in fact the plants concerned, most of which have applied for market economy status, have not engaged in dumping."
"Stop this threatened tax on protection, relieve people's understandable concerns and close the file as soon as possible."
"– The situation in the footwear sector is alarming, not least in Portugal."
"Just by way of an example, dozens of businesses – among them Ecco and Rhode – in Aveiro District, closed down or laid off workers in 2005."
"Unemployment and the risk of poverty have increased, a case in point being C [amp] J Clarks in Castelo de Paiva, where workers were promised work, training and subsidies, only for them to be laid off just two years later."
"Once again, we must report that:"
"- With the steep rise in footwear imports from third countries, it was not the so-called consumer whose wallet became fatter, but the large retailers and distributors who accumulated fabulous profits;"
"- It is not third countries that are responsible for the closure of businesses and the loss of jobs; it is the EU, which is at the head of the queue to promote competition and liberalisation of international trade and which maintains the euro at a level that harms manufacturing and exporting, as in the case of footwear."
"The real losers in this policy are the workers, small, medium-sized and micro-enterprises, and countries such as Portugal, as borne out by studies and, more importantly, reality."
"It is clear that the EU is facing new competitive challenges on the world market, challenges which cause anxiety and uncertainty for our industry, our workers and our consumers."
"Yet as we adjust to the new global environment we must avoid the populist appeal of protectionist measures which are at best a short-term panacea for long-term ills."
"In this instance, however, it appears that there has been a well-documented case of dumping and injury to the European industry."
"Whilst I fear that some EU companies with good employment standards and interests in the Far East (for example Clarks shoes) will be hit by these measures, I am pleased to see certain exemptions to the punitive tariff proposed by the Commission have been obtained, namely in the sensitive children’s footwear sector."
"On balance I think that the Commission has hit the right note here."
"I am inclined to agree with the Commissioner when he states that consumers should be more concerned about the mark-up enjoyed until now by retailers on goods produced cheaply in poor employment and environmental conditions and then sold below the cost of production."
"Our partners must now address these social and employment issues, issues which we ourselves have faced and dedicated much time and effort to overcoming jointly through the European project."
"The next item is the report (A6-0049/2006) by Adeline Hazan, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on evaluation of the European arrest warrant (2005/2175(INI))"
". Mr President, Mrs Gastinger, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity given to us today to debate the European judicial area on the basis of my report on the still very recent, and therefore inevitably fragmented, assessment of one year’s implementation of the European Arrest Warrant."
"We have already had the opportunity to debate this matter."
"Before turning specifically to the European Arrest Warrant, I should like to make one small point, because, underpinning this concept of a judicial area, which was formulated very gradually after the Geneva Appeal in 1996, was the ambition to give Europeans a common sense of justice in an environment in which the authorities do everything possible to prevent Europeans’ freedom – from being circumvented or their rights from being flouted."
"In October 1999, the Tampere Summit marked an important stage, with the introduction of the mutual recognition principle."
"This change has been radical."
"It involves mutual confidence, the exercising of shared sovereignty and the recognition of the European area as a common territory."
"Since then – as we have seen – problems persist and people need to be aware of these."
"It must be said that the inspiration and ambition that motivated the Heads of State or Government at Tampere have not injected the same degree of enthusiasm into the debates on the texts presented since then."
"Mutual recognition has inspired many projects, but it is the creation of the European Arrest Warrant that is undoubtedly the symbolic measure."
"The warrant does, in fact, represent a definite step forward, despite encountering persistent problems."
"What, then, was the aim of this measure, which officially entered into force on 1 January 2004?"
"The European Arrest Warrant applies to a broader range of offences than those covered by the extradition procedure."
"Thanks to this warrant, the surrender procedure has become an entirely judicial, and no longer political, process – which is a bonus."
"The bottom line is that EU law can now be interpreted correctly by practitioners, whereas existing extradition law relies on an abundance of bilateral and national agreements."
"Furthermore, it has been pointed out on several occasions – including in Article 1 of the framework decision – that, when issuing and implementing the arrest warrant, the Member States and the judicial authorities must ensure that they strictly comply with the principles laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Once the principles of this instrument are laid down, how are they implemented?"
"We now have at our disposal an assessment carried out, as I said, over only a short space of time by the European Commission, and we must therefore remain cautious when faced with the results of this assessment, which is not yet complete."
"Some of the planned objectives have been fully achieved."
"For example, the Arrest Warrant came in very useful recently in the prosecution of an Ethiopian suspected by the British authorities of having been involved in the London bombings."
"His extradition by the Italian authorities was obtained in record time."
"Another success was the arrest of a corrupt judge, wanted by her country, Greece."
"The European Arrest Warrant is an undeniable success story, with 3 000 warrants issued in 2004, 1 000 people arrested and 650 people handed over."
"The 2005 figures will undoubtedly show an increase, but they will not be officially available until June or July."
"The extradition procedure has been made much shorter."
"By replacing the old extradition procedure with the European Arrest Warrant, the average duration of the procedures has gone from nine months to 43 days, which is an appreciable gain for both the judges and those standing trial."
"Lastly – and most importantly – the procedure is no longer in any way politicised because it no longer involves governments, but only the justice system."
"It must be said, however, that the application of the European Arrest Warrant has hit several stumbling blocks."
"Last autumn, for example, and in response to Berlin’s refusal to extradite the German-Syrian citizen Mamoun Darkazanli, an alleged Al-Qaeda figure, Spanish law declared the European Arrest Warrant issued by Germany to be null and void."
"Several Member States are also attempting to reinstate elements of the traditional system, such as the verification of double criminality."
"To the optional grounds for non-execution provided for by the framework decision, some Member States have added other grounds for refusing extradition."
"Even more importantly, the issue of fundamental rights has given rise to considerable transposition problems in Poland and Germany."
"This difficulty must be interpreted as a failure to understand the principle of mutual recognition, and yet this principle is precisely the foundation on which the European judicial area is entirely constructed."
"In conclusion, I would say that the European Arrest Warrant marks an important step forward in the fight against crime – above all in terms of serving Europeans - and in the creation of a European judicial area."
"The fact remains that there is still a host of problems and that these problems must not be underestimated."
"The first problem stems from the fact that our judicial systems are too different from one another."
"The second problem is that most of the Member States are still too keen to control international legal assistance."
"Even though the judicial system is a product of history, the issues that arise are going to have to be dealt with."
"To conclude: is more or less harmonisation needed?"
"I believe that more is needed."
"Should more progress be made in terms of the mutual recognition of systems?"
"I believe that, here too, the answer is yes."
". Mr President, Vice-President Frattini, Mrs Hazan, honourable Members of the European Parliament, firstly, let me thank you warmly on behalf of the presidency for this report on the evaluation of the European Arrest Warrant, which I have read with great interest."
"The Presidency shares your view – as indeed do I – that the European Arrest Warrant has, in essence, been a success."
"It has certainly been a milestone in improving cooperation between the European Union’s Member States, particularly as regards our common desire to combat organised crime and terrorism."
"I believe we can also agree that it is of a quite new and exemplary character and has made an essential contribution to the further development of the mutual recognition principle, to which Mrs Hazan refers at several points and on which we agreed at the Tampere Council."
"We in the Council, at any rate, regard the European Arrest Warrant as the foundation for all the further work we will do in this area."
"I am particularly glad that your House shares our view."
"Perhaps we might look back and recall how extradition procedures were formerly very long, unwieldy and, in many respects, dependent on political decisions."
"All of us who are active in this field found this state of affairs intolerable."
"All 25 Member States have now transposed into their own legal systems the framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant."
"If we look at how things stand today, we see that the procedure for handing over suspects is now speedy, efficient and, as a matter of principle, reserved to independent courts."
"That is of quite considerable benefit, and it is this framework decision that has made it possible."
"It is also important that it has been possible – as the honourable lady who spoke before me stated – to quite considerably reduce the time that the extradition process takes."
"Until now, it generally took on average nine months, but the average time has now been reduced to between 40 and 45 days."
"That represents quite substantial progress, particularly in terms of fundamental rights, for you will all be aware that Article 5(3) of the Convention on Human Rights requires us to contribute to the speeding up of the processes by which people are taken into custody."
"This framework decision on the European Arrest Warrant has enabled us to largely comply with this requirement."
"Despite the fears that you voice in your report about the critical views expressed in the rulings of national constitutional courts concerning transposition in some Member States, the presidency is not aware of any fundamental rejection of the European Arrest Warrant at national level."
"I myself am not aware of any, and I am sure that this is not happening."
"On this point, though, we must also bear in mind the fact that public confidence is to a large degree dependent on our conceding the possibility – for which there are certainly good legal reasons – of the implementation at national level for which we are making provision under the Framework Decision being subject to scrutiny by national supreme courts."
"That is a quite essential consideration."
"If such scrutiny reveals the need for some change in transposition at the national level, then that change will be carried out, but what really matters is that the public should have confidence in what we are doing at the European level."
"Something else that is important and could make for repeated difficulties in interpretation – although I do not take as critical a view of this as you do in your report – is the exemplary character of the fundamental rights clause, which is not, formally speaking, a ground for rejection."
"That, too, is a quite essential consideration."
"It is important, though, that we should allow our national courts to perform their essential function within the Member States, that being to examine whether their country’s legal system guarantees protection for fundamental rights."
"I do not believe that there should be any contradiction in this."
"I do, however, perceive a contradiction in this report, in so far as it highlights, on the one hand, the risk of the discriminatory use of the fundamental rights clause, while at the same time – and this is something else I can fully endorse – stressing the need for the European Arrest Warrant, in its application, to specifically protect human rights and personal freedoms."
"Care must be taken that these do not conflict with each other."
"As I have already said, the role of the national courts must be to ensure, on the basis of the fundamental rights clause, that the fundamental rights of our citizens are not infringed."
"That, too, must be part of the procedure under the European Arrest Warrant."
"While I am on this subject, I would like to mention a case brought by Belgium before the European Court of Justice, in which the Court is asked to scrutinise the aspects of the arrest warrant relating to fundamental rights."
"Our expectation is that the Court will deliver an unambiguous ruling not only on the issue of the legal basis but also on that of the list of crimes in respect of which the double criminality test no longer applies."
"This list of 32 crimes has been the subject of recurrent debate, and we look forward to a clear statement concerning it."
"Once such a clear ruling has been delivered, there will, without doubt, be further deliberations as to whether this list needs to be revised, and perhaps we can leave the matter there."
"Further conclusions will then be drawn as to whether that would be proper or worthwhile."
"Let me take this opportunity to point out that the Presidency of the Council sees it as most important that we should treat the uniform application of the framework decision in the individual Member States of the European Union as a core priority."
"That is necessary if we are to make the mutual recognition principle a living reality."
"It is also not a matter of dispute that, when the European Arrest Warrant is executed, the state executing it must safeguard human rights and, in particular, adhere to procedural safeguards."
"That, too, must be our common concern."
"The presidency, like your House, takes it as read in this regard that the application and functioning of the European Arrest Warrant will need to be evaluated by means of thorough and unbiased examination."
"That is a quite essential consideration, and it is for that reason that the Council has already decided on a fourth round of mutual evaluation."
"The work entailed by this is running to timetable."
"From it we expect further results derived from practice, from which detailed knowledge applicable to practical implementation may emerge."
"As for the practical use to which the European Arrest Warrant is put, I would like to state, very briefly in view of the time available, that long-term support for its implementation is available in the shape of information, readily accessible on the Internet, and provided not only by the Council Secretariat, but also by the European Judicial Network, and that the judicial atlas is also rendering outstanding service in this, so that the direct contact between the judicial authorities, which is so urgently necessary to the best possible application of the European Arrest Warrant has thereby been made considerably easier."
"I would also like to highlight another aspect of not inconsiderable importance as regards practical application, which is that the European Arrest Warrant has made it possible for such formalities as certifications and so on to be kept to a minimum in proceedings between one state and another, for we now know that we do not need them if we trust each other and the mutual recognition principle is a lived reality."
"I believe that the European Arrest Warrant has had a quite vitally important part to play in this."
"I therefore look forward to the rest of the debate, following which I will have a few other things to say in my concluding statement."
". Mr President, Mrs Gastinger, Mrs Hazan, I believe that the European Arrest Warrant can be said to constitute a symbolic measure of European judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"It implements – for the first time – the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and will, as I sincerely hope, soon be enhanced by other instruments, such as the proposed European Evidence Warrant."
"In addition to the European institutions, it is very important that we involve national parliaments in the debate, as was the case last October during the fruitful parliamentary sittings organised by this European Parliament."
"I believe that Mrs Hazan’s report has enriched and, on several points, updated the conclusions drawn by the Commission with regard to the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant."
"We will take account of this when drafting our second evaluation report on the implementation of the Arrest Warrant."
"This second report will be sent to Parliament in June."
"As early as January of this year, the Commission presented a version of its first report updated to include Italy."
"A delay in transposition had in fact prevented us from including this Member State in the first report."
"I agree with the bulk of the proposal for a recommendation addressed to the Council."
"As regards acting on the proposal for a recommendation by considering the possibility of extending the list of 32 categories of offence for which the verification of double criminality is abolished, I feel able to say to you that, as far as I am concerned, any possible progress along these lines is, in principle, desirable."
"Nevertheless, the Commission will see to it that coherence between the various instruments of mutual recognition is preserved."
"The Commission therefore reserves the right to present proposals aimed at amending the framework decision once more experience has been gained."
"Mr President, I shall now make way for the continuation of the debate, at the end of which I shall no doubt intervene to make other remarks."
". – Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs President-in-Office of the Council, the report by Mrs Hazan is exceptional."
"I agree with all the recommendations and comments which she makes."
"Congratulations Mrs Hazan."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European arrest warrant tests the willingness to cooperate of and the spirit of mutual respect and mutual trust between the Member States of the European Union."
"It constitutes a huge step in the direction of the creation of a single area of justice and security, as well as a strong measure for combating crime."
"It puts an end to fugitives from justice, an end to the complications of the political process to extradite criminal suspects."
"The presumptuous invocation by certain Member States of national sovereignty, of human rights and of the alleged supremacy of their national law in order to circumvent the institution of the European arrest warrant is dangerous."
"It goes without saying that each Member State individually and all the Member States in general have a fundamental obligation to comply faithfully with and apply human rights in their judicial proceedings and there is no room for needless doubt."
"The institution must be strengthened and three steps need to be taken in order to do so: firstly, the institution of the European arrest warrant needs to be moved from the third pillar to the first pillar."
"Secondly, the Council needs to adopt, as quickly as possible, the proposal to harmonise minimum criteria in criminal proceedings."
"Thirdly, every constitutional obstacle to the application of the European arrest warrant needs to be removed."
"Already in my country, in Cyprus, the Constitution is being amended within the next few days so that Cyprus can come into line with this institution."
"Combating crime is not just a national issue."
"It is pan-European."
"That is why we all need to help to strengthen the European arrest warrant."
". Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for her very thorough work."
"In fact, this report not only enables us to assess the European Arrest Warrant - the first practical instrument of the European judicial area - but also gives us the opportunity to redefine our priorities as far as the implementation of a genuine European judicial area is concerned."
"As we have said, the European Arrest Warrant has been an overwhelming success: 2 600 warrants have been issued throughout the European Union since its creation, with the result that judicial procedures have been considerably speeded up."
"Borders are therefore no longer an obstacle to justice."
"This success shows that the Member States are willing to work together."
"We are thus strengthening the principle of mutual confidence, which is the cornerstone of the European judicial area."
"The European Arrest Warrant has nonetheless encountered obstacles put in the way of its application by certain governments, and I regret Italy’s delay in transposing the legislation."
"This delay meant that the Commission was late in assessing that country."
"Furthermore, the Member States interpret the warrant differently in their national laws."
"This also illustrates the Member States’ lack of political will and the limits imposed by the method of decision making in this area."
"Nevertheless, the success of the European Arrest Warrant demonstrates that it is impossible to limit ourselves to civil law."
"We must be more ambitious and extend judicial cooperation to criminal law."
"That is why we consider it crucial to have recourse to Article 42 and the ‘passerelle’ in order to permit a minimum harmonisation of European criminal legislation."
"We will thus be able to put an end to the unanimity rule, which slows down the implementation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice."
"Furthermore, we must bridge the democratic gap, and only the full involvement of the European Parliament in the creation of the European judicial area will enable fundamental rights to be protected."
"Moreover, how can we succeed in making progress if we limit ourselves to security matters?"
"Let us make progress in police matters, certainly, but we must also set high standards with regard to fundamental rights."
"Thus, the proposal on procedural guarantees must be addressed at the same time."
"To conclude, I have a specific question to ask the Commission and the Council: when will we finally be able to make progress with other practical instruments, such as the exchange of evidence and information between criminal records bureaux?"
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Hazan, Parliament’s rapporteur."
"My group broadly shares her assessment and her concerns."
"I was the rapporteur who took this issue through the House. I had the honour to do so in 2001."
"However, I would not be speaking here for my group today were it not for the fact that our colleague, Mr Duquesne, who was Interior Minister in Belgium at the time and very supportive of this measure, is sadly seriously ill in hospital."
"At the time we took the measure through we believed that the European Arrest Warrant offered practical solutions to the issues of greatest concern to Europe’s citizens: their safety and security."
"Experience has shown that the warrant is Europe’s chief asset in the fight against cross-border crime, allowing our judicial authorities to reduce the extradition process to an average of 13 days in over half of all cases."
"That is 13 days compared to the months of waiting that went before."
"It has been well used by Member States and has generally worked well."
"Nobody would deny that there have been some teething problems."
"In addition to delays in implementation, controversial court decisions in Poland and Germany have raised eyebrows – and accusations that this measure violates fundamental rights."
"Nonetheless, all Member States are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and by European Court of Human Rights case-law, as stated specifically in this measure."
"I have two questions today."
"The first is to the Council."
"Will the Council name and shame the Member States that are blocking the framework decision on procedural rights, which would set to rest any concerns about violations of fundamental rights in this measure?"
"What does the Council believe is the likely timetable for agreement of the framework decision?"
"The second question is to the Commission."
"Could the Commissioner tell us if the warrant has now been correctly implemented in the country he knows best and whether any other Member States are dragging their heels, and will he start proceedings against any Member State that has misapplied the law or limited its effects?"
"Mr President, it is beyond dispute that the European arrest warrant is already paying off in many ways, but while it makes the extradition system more efficient, considerably quicker and also less arbitrary, it still has flaws."
"At the time, my group was opposed to its introduction, because it was not accompanied by agreements on minimum standards in criminal proceedings."
"What has now been done relates only to the tracing of suspects, without putting the necessary guarantees in place for their rights."
"This may have the appearance of decisive action and being tough on crime, but it is at the same time an obstacle to cooperation in the area of extradition."
"Three years after the arrest warrant was adopted, the situation remains unchanged."
"The framework decision for procedural rights of suspects has not yet been adopted by the Council."
"I would join Mr Watson in his appeal to the Council to clarify which Member States are opposed to an improvement in the rights of suspects and for what reason."
"Indeed, what being said, also by Mr Demetriou, is that whilst all Member States must adhere to the rights of suspects and the human rights convention, there are also a huge number of legal cases running in Strasbourg."
"Equally, there are very many differences between the Member States, particularly in relation to those procedures."
"If we were all agreed on the rights of suspects, then the signing of this agreement on procedural rights would, of course, be a mere formality, but that is not the case, because there are many major differences which result in national courts now trying to figure out the conditions under which people are allowed to be extradited."
"This means that in a number of legal cases, people have not been extradited to other EU Member States."
"One example of this was a legal case in Bolzano where the local court refused to hand over an Italian to Austria."
"Once we have common agreements on the rights of suspects, suspects will also be surrendered much more easily."
"I would therefore ask the Council not to consider this to be a bonus for the rights of suspects, but as a necessary component, namely that repression and tracing go hand in hand, while at the same time guaranteeing the rule of law, even at European level."
"After all, the lack of mutual trust between the Member States will also adversely affect the tracing aspect."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to assess the European arrest warrant a comprehensive analysis should be made of the effects that the framework decision has on legal cooperation, the mutual recognition of offences, respect for individual procedural guarantees and civil liberties."
"Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing considerable problems, with some Member States having had difficulties in applying the warrant because they are actually hindered by their national constitutions."
"It would, however, be a mistake to think about distorting national constitutions in order to make the arrest warrant work."
"Today’s evaluation, unfortunately, has had to do without data from one country: Italy, which, in order to protect private interests, due to a decidedly Eurosceptic and anti-European ministry, has not transposed the EU legislation by the required time."
"Finally, it is not possible to think of creating a European arrest warrant without first establishing common minimum standards for criminal procedure and without putting in place shared procedural guarantees."
"Parliament has already expressed an opinion on minimum procedures, and we are waiting for the Council to go forward on this point."
"It has been like building a block of flats starting with the roof instead of the foundations."
"In fact, the European arrest warrant can certainly be a useful tool in removing the extradition of criminals from the political arena, and there have already been some positive examples on this point, but the procedure is vitiated by a fatal flaw, an original sin that has sprung from the haste of having to react to terrorist attacks by enacting emergency legislation."
"I wholeheartedly agree with the evaluation put forward by Mrs Hazan in her report."
"The text has been improved in committee, and we have also avoided extending the list of 32 offences, but our judgment cannot help but spring from the erroneous starting-point brought about by the obsession with security."
"There is an old Italian proverb that says ‘more haste, less speed’."
"This applies perfectly to the evaluation of the first year of application of the European arrest warrant."
". Mr President, I endorse this measure to fight terrorism more effectively."
"In the 2002 debate, I argued that only offences for which a European, or international, definition existed should be put on the list."
"The current list of offences is too broad, and that may result in legal uncertainty and discrimination."
"Member States are therefore seizing every opportunity to apply the criterion of double criminality."
"Mrs Hazan is right in urging the Council to ensure that this double criminality be abolished."
"Initially, she even asked for the list of offences to be extended – a request that the Commission rejected."
"Given the present indicators, this was not at all timely."
"It is preferable to follow the developments in the next two years from a close range."
"I expect that, if anything, an assessment will need to lead to the present list being cut back."
"The list can only be extended whilst guaranteeing legal certainty if all specified offences are defined at European level."
"It would, however, be undesirable, for criminal law to be harmonised surreptitiously on the back of this decision."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue."
"Unfortunately, however, like all of us here in Parliament, the rapporteur seems to be working at somewhat of a disadvantage, because we do not have access yet to the Council and the Commission’s evaluation mechanism concerning the operation of the European Arrest Warrant."
"We can learn some things from the experience we have already gained."
"On the positive side, compared with the old extradition process, the time delay has reduced dramatically."
"Members speak of between 90 days and 42 days, but some extradition proceedings that would have gone on for years between Member States of the European Union in the past have now been reduced to 42 days."
"However, we have to be careful to tread very softly with regard to constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Some courts have put a question mark about the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, whether as regards its transposition into international law by the mechanism used or as regards the way that certain courts have interpreted elements of the arrest warrant process."
"Irrespective of harmonisation, this idea of mutual respect, trust and understanding between the judicial authorities is the first step towards creating a wider and more inclusive area of judicial operation."
"One of the difficulties we face is that we have different legal systems within the EU Member States, which have built up bodies of law and precedent."
"To some extent that affects how we can best utilise this area."
"That is why limiting the categories of offences to 32 was a good idea in the initial stage."
"Now, however, after the experience we have gained, we can look at this more closely."
"My last point is that we should not rush towards achieving all these goals in the short term."
"Let us not forget that some countries have only transposed the framework decision in the last number of months."
"We need more time to look at the evaluation and to ensure that the proper operation takes place."
"Finally, fundamental respect for human rights and freedoms must be at the core of all our work in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, when our state security managed to let Fehriye Erdal, a dangerous terrorist from the Turkish terrorist movement DHKP-C, escape, the day before she was due to be sentenced to four year’s imprisonment, and without even one minister being called to account over it, Belgium was once again held up to ridicule by the entire European Union."
"In other Member States, the DHKP-C has been listed as a dangerous terror group for a long time, but not so in Belgium, where Erdal enjoyed shelter and asylum undisturbed."
"I was, in spite of myself, reminded of this when we started assessing the development of the European arrest warrant."
"If we want to carry out an effective assessment into the uniform rules and procedures to fight cross-border crime, including terrorism, using the European arrest warrant among others, then the only conclusion I can come to when blunders of this kind occur is that the European Union still has a very long way to go."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hazan, on a report that is undoubtedly accurate and rigorous."
"I would like to say that the approval of the European Arrest Warrant — and we must never forget this — was not simply the approval of just one more legal instrument, and nor did it merely replace an obsolete extradition system; the reality is that it was a symbol, it was a response and it reflected a new attitude."
"It was a symbol of the urgent need to create a European judicial and policing space."
"It was the European response to the terrible September 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York and, at the same time, it reflected the political attitude that terrorism had to be combated actively and that security had to be tackled by means of an internal European Union policy, one of the great objectives that we should be making a point of pursuing."
"I must point out that I had the opportunity to present this Warrant during the era when I was in the Council of Ministers and, unfortunately, it was not approved until the 11 September attack happened."
"It is therefore essential that we do not reintroduce verification of double criminality, that we resolve the various forms of incompatibility with different Constitutions and that the national judges do not introduce supplementary instruments before another attack obliges us urgently and hurriedly to introduce modifications to this extremely important Warrant."
"There must not therefore be any obstacles or timidity in relation to this issue."
"Unequivocal will is undoubtedly required, and we must also remember the extremely important work of a Home Affairs Minister of that era, Antoine Duquesne, who is not here today but who played a decisive and crucial role in making it possible for the European Arrest Warrant to be the subject of our debate here this afternoon."
"– Mr President, Minister, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on her report."
"The European arrest warrant on its own is not an adequate tool for the creation of a European area of security, freedom and justice, nor will we achieve its proper application unless we substantially strengthen mutual trust between judges, unless we apply minimum common rules to criminal proceedings which safeguard suspects' fundamental rights and unless we achieve a rudimentary approximation of national laws."
"That is why we are also calling, as a first step, for the approval of the framework decision, with the European Parliament's amendments, on certain procedural rights within the framework of criminal proceedings in the European Union."
"We also hope that the future human rights service will take on a substantial role in the protection of and respect for human rights and personal freedoms and in the field of the European arrest warrant."
"Mr President, the utility of the European arrest warrant was illustrated, especially for my constituents in London, when Hussein Osman, a suspect in the 21 July attempted bombings, was returned to Britain to face justice in weeks rather than years."
"However, two thirds of Member States have introduced explicit grounds for refusal: violation of fundamental rights."
"To the extent that this is valid, it justifies the welcome change of heart by the Austrian Presidency towards a conviction that there must be agreement on minimum standards for fair legal proceedings."
"However, we need to do more to invest in the criminal justice system, as the European Parliament called for a year ago."
"Sadly, many leading politicians give in to the temptation to criticise judges for judgments they do not like."
"Last year the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, boasted of how he had battered the criminal justice system."
"Instead of questioning basic rights, such as the presumption of innocence and habeas corpus, and possibly colluding in torture flights and extraordinary rendition, we need to raise standards, not lower them."
"– Mr President, Mrs Gastinger, Commissioner, in July last year, the German Federal Constitutional Court declared null and void Germany’s law implementing the European Arrest Warrant."
"It quite rightly demanded that the German legislators should fully discharge their responsibility for protecting and maintaining the fundamental civil rights guaranteed by the German Basic Law, and this ruling was without doubt a resounding clip round the ear for them."
"It is with that in mind, Mrs Gastinger, that I find it quite simply incomprehensible that the Council should allow the framework decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings to drag in this way without, to date, doing anything about it."
"That is quite simply unacceptable, and the accused must be given far more rights to take account of the European Arrest Warrant."
"I endorse what has already been said by many Members of this House."
"These rights include, of course, the requirement that the accused be informed of their rights in a language with which they are familiar."
"They must have the right to avail themselves of the services of an interpreter, and it must of course be guaranteed that the documents relevant to criminal proceedings be translated."
"Mrs Gastinger, the Council must at last do something about this; it is quite essential that it should, for the citizens of the European Union must have the certainty that their rights are protected and respected in the same way throughout Europe."
"Mr President, those countries used to Roman and Napoleonic law have to accept that the state governs their lives, but in Britain any such idea is an abomination."
"Where I come from, the state does not exist in its own right and the government of the day answers to us: those who elected it."
"Our safeguards against any attempt by the state to interfere in freedoms and rights go back hundreds of years and are protected by common and statute law."
"No European has the right to detain and remove a British subject from the UK without due process, and that means protection from imprisonment after three days unless a court hears the evidence and decides otherwise."
"It also means no offence can exist that is not an offence in the UK: xenophobia, for example, can stand as a charge in the UK."
"We still enjoy the presumption of innocence, protection of trial by jury and freedom from double jeopardy, despite the disgraceful efforts of the Blair Government to fall into line with what the EU chooses to call law."
"The people of your countries would be far better off enjoying the rights and freedoms of the British."
"Learn that lesson and you might start winning hearts and minds."
"Someone should tell Mrs Wallström ..."
"– Mrs Gastinger, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hazan on her excellent report."
"As Mr Mayor Oreja said, we welcome the creation of the European Arrest Warrant as an innovative and highly effective step in developing judicial cooperation and stepping up cooperation and mutual trust. The warrant will guarantee equal legal protection for EU citizens and will become one of the main instruments in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"Unfortunately, this first assessment has revealed a number of problems preventing it from being implemented in full and undermining mutual trust."
"There have been difficulties in its transposition, for example, recourse to constitutional jurisdiction in various Member States, and practical obstacles in using the warrant, such as the translation, transmission and use of different forms. There has also been resistance among several Member States wishing to retain certain elements of the traditional extradition system, such as control over double jeopardy and the intervention of political authorities in the judicial procedure."
"I should like to highlight three points: Firstly, I wish to reiterate the benefits that adopting the draft Constitutional Treaty would bring to this area of judicial and police cooperation, in particular the removal of the pillars."
"As Mr Demetriou said, we need to make use of the resources at our disposal, including the referred to in Article 42 of the Treaty enabling the Member States to incorporate the European arrest warrant in the first pillar so as to ensure greater transparency and democratic control by Parliament and legal control by the Court of Justice."
"Secondly, I wish to point out that we should draw on the Nordic arrest warrant as a source of inspiration for strengthening the effectiveness of the European arrest warrant."
"The Nordic arrest warrant boasts some innovative aspects, including a more effective system of delivery and shorter procedural deadlines."
"Thirdly and lastly, it is crucial that, as Mr Frattini said, both Parliament and the national parliaments take part in the forthcoming assessment on the progress made in implementing the European arrest warrant."
"Mr President, I should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur."
"In 2002 the European Union proposed a new mechanism as part of its efforts to combat crime."
"I refer to the European Arrest Warrant."
"Now, almost four years later, we are to evaluate the efficiency of its implementation and provide an answer to the question as to what should be done to ensure that criminals no longer feel safe in Europe."
"I would like to make just two comments, if I may."
"Firstly, it is to be regretted that pursuant to the current legal system the European Arrest Warrant is a third pillar instrument and does not come within the competence of either the European Parliament or the European Court of Justice."
"Clearly, a change is required."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that pursuant to the European Constitution pillars will be removed and instruments for the administration of justice developed."
"In addition, more procedures will become part of Community competence."
"As a result, the Union should become more effective and its decisions more transparent and democratic in nature."
"In this connection, it is worth highlighting that the part of the Constitutional Treaty outlining these methods was never the subject of any protest."
"It was not contested in any way in the course of the recent ratification campaigns, which bodes well for this institution."
"My second comment is that despite the success achieved in implementing the European Arrest Warrant, it has come up against a number of significant legal obstacles in certain countries."
"The House has heard about the situation in Germany and in Cyprus."
"We are aware of the position in Belgium and Italy too."
"There are also difficulties implementing the European Arrest Warrant in my own country, Poland."
"It has become part of the Criminal Code and is being implemented, but in April 2005 the Constitutional Court ruled that the Warrant was unconstitutional."
"We were granted 18 months to remedy the situation and now only seven months remain. I would like to hope that Poland will resolve this contradictory situation in time."
"– Mr President, the two basic poles in European cooperation on criminal matters are the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States."
"These two principles complement each other; however, their implementation is difficult to achieve and will take a great deal of time."
"Nonetheless, every possible effort must be made to bring about a common criminal policy in the European Union."
"The European Arrest Warrant constitutes a first, important step in the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal judgments and helps to consolidate a common legal culture."
"Naturally, despite the fact that progress has been made with the procedure to adapt the European Arrest Warrant, there are still certain difficulties which continue, among other things, with the uniform or non-uniform transposition of the framework decision into the national laws of the Member States and the categories of offences whose criminality is not checked."
"Particular attention must be paid to these difficulties."
"Similarly, and I address myself to the President-in-Office of the Council and Austrian Minister, Mrs Gastinger, I wonder why there should be this list of 32 crimes and why we do not simplify the entire process by saying that all offences punished by over three years in prison are subject to this arrangement."
"This would do a great deal to accommodate both national legislation and national judges."
"I am certain that, with the capability which distinguishes you, Minister, you will address this matter."
". Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, in my concluding statement, I would like to reiterate in quite general terms that we, despite the thoroughly justified criticisms that you have made of various points today, can take it as read that the European Arrest Warrant is certainly something of which we can all be proud."
"The fact is that it was a first and vital step towards our jointly combating crime and terrorism on the basis of the mutual recognition principle."
"That is something very important, and it is something of which we must never lose sight."
"Several Members have asked me to say something about the minimum procedural safeguards in criminal trials, and I think this is a very important point."
"Mr Watson, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Catania, Mr Lambrinidis, Mrs Ludford and Mrs Kaufmann have raised the issue."
"I am sure that you are aware that we spent a lot of time discussing this whole area during the informal Council meeting in Vienna on 13 and 14 January."
"I am also sure that you are aware that this framework decision – and I do not hesitate to say what I am about to say – is, at the moment, in a sort of dead-end, and this is something that all of us in the Council very much regret."
"I can assure you that we in the Council most certainly do have the political will to put these minimum procedural guarantees for the accused in criminal cases in the form of a regulation of one kind or other."
"We want thereby to send out a very important political message."
"There are also problems with the framework decision itself, for some Member States have doubts about the legal basis for the adoption of a legal instrument at European level, and that, as I am sure you can imagine, is an issue that it is rather difficult to evade."
"A look at the details reveals that these doubts have to do, in particular, with the scope and similar points, which we are discussing, but I can assure you, on behalf of the Austrian Presidency, that we regard this as a high-priority matter and that we do want to achieve real progress on it during our presidency."
"We must also, however, bear in mind the fact that the minimum procedural guarantees are one point on which we have to add value to the Human Rights Convention, more specifically to its Article 6, for that Article 6 is our common foundation in Europe, and something to which we all feel committed."
"In the course of our presidency, then, we will attempt to reach a solution to this in order to take the next step, which really is essential."
"What is most important to us is that we should be able to move on out of the cul-de-sac in which we currently find ourselves."
"Mrs Roure raised another important issue, that of what progress we have achieved with the other instruments, essentially the European evidence procedure and the exchange of information between judicial authorities."
"What I can tell you about evidence procedures is that quite considerable progress has been made on this at Council level."
"It goes without saying that the list of 32 offences – to which this debate has returned again and again – is back on our agenda."
"I will discuss the question later on."
"That too is an item for debate, but I am full of hope that on this too we will make a great deal of progress during our presidency."
"We may well manage to bring this matter to a conclusion, but, even if that proves impossible, we will be able to hand over to the Finnish Presidency a dossier which is very close to completion."
"If I may turn to the framework decision on the implementation and content of the exchange of information from criminal records between the Member States and the framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the course of police and judicial cooperation, I can tell you that we are discussing this in working parties, and, here too, we believe that we will be able to move forward."
"Mr Varvitsiotis asked why we do not take as a basis a three-year prison sentence rather than the 32 offences on the list, and I am able to say, in response to that, that – as I am sure you are aware – these 32 offences were the subject of long and in-depth discussion in the Council before we were able to agree on them."
"That was a very difficult process, and we are now glad that we have the list."
"What must not be forgotten when considering these 32 offences is that what is laid down by means of this list is that these are the areas in which, in practice, double criminality is not subject to extra scrutiny."
"That is the background to the list of 32 offences."
"Extradition and the application of the European Arrest Warrant continue, nevertheless, to be options in other areas in which only double criminality is checked in order for the European Arrest Warrant to come into play."
"As I have already said, these 32 offences are again a subject for discussion in relation to the European evidence warrant, for we do of course know that some of these offences are very broadly defined, while others relate to very specific acts."
"When seen in today’s light, this is not really coherent, and we are well aware of this."
"Even so, we are glad that it is in place, and, on the basis of the experience gained with the European arrest warrant, we will of course continue to work on this list."
"I would ask you to give us time; we need time if we are eventually going to have a good basis for even better cooperation in this area."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few observations following that interesting debate."
"First of all, I would like to point out that monitoring of the transposing of the law on the European arrest warrant will continue and that Parliament has at its disposal our evaluations on all the Member States, which since January includes Italy, with an additional report; in June there will be another report."
"I would like to say to Mr Watson that, unfortunately, the Commission is not able to launch proceedings for breach in accordance with Community law since this is a third pillar instrument."
"I am particularly happy to hear what some Members said regarding the possibility, with which I would obviously agree, of transferring to the first pillar an instrument that is of such great importance in the fight against terrorism and crime; that would clearly give rise to the positive result of even more effective and forceful monitoring than is currently possible for us."
"We will continue to highlight the strong points as well as the weak points of each transposing law."
"We will do this while remaining in continuous contact, Mr Coelho, with the national parliaments, since obviously we must make them aware of any problems that exist. Sometimes these are linked to constitutional issues and at others to parliamentary issues, and they have made it difficult in some states for the procedure to be fully implemented."
"In my view, this amounts to respect for the principle of proper cooperation between the institutions."
"I would like to conclude by saying that it will be necessary to integrate this European action programme with the European evidence warrant."
"I have already said this, but I say it again now: I find it strange that we have been able to reach agreement on transferring people from one country to another, while we have not succeeded in transferring the evidence, which is a considerably less significant element in terms of invasion of fundamental rights, and of mutual trust."
"There is sufficient trust to hand over a person who has been arrested, and still we cannot succeed in agreeing on collecting a piece of evidence from one country and transferring it to another."
"I agree with Mrs Gastinger’s assessment of the need to make real progress and I hope that with the Austrian Presidency agreement will be reached on the few remaining points of disagreement."
"The same applies to procedural rights: I must thank the Austrian Presidency, which is expending great efforts in the attempt to reach an agreement, and in my opinion it does not seem that the legal basis is a reason for difficulty."
"There are legal arguments, but all legal arguments lend themselves to debate."
"I am convinced that there is a foundation for reaching agreement on a European initiative relating to procedural rights; in political terms this would be an extremely important signal."
"I know that there is a commitment on the part of the Presidency; equally important is the commitment on the exchange of criminal record information."
"At the same time, the repressive approach must constantly be balanced by boosting rights and freedoms, and this will give us one more political card with which to combat crime."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0013/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"There are presently 131 senior opposition figures, including 10 elected members of the Ethiopian Parliament and including professors, judges and journalists, who are being detained in Ethiopia."
"Can the Council state what measures it has taken to highlight these grave injustices with the Ethiopian Government in light of the fact that these detentions are in breach of international law, and taking into account that the European Union is the largest donor in the world of international aid to Ethiopia ?"
". Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Council, I would like to reply in the following terms to Mr Ryan’s question about opposition figures in Ethiopia."
"The Council is observing the situation as regards the detained opposition leaders, representatives of civil society organisations, newspaper publishers and journalists with close attention."
"Following their arrest, the European Union, on 6 November last year, made a statement expressing its concern and calling for the release of all political prisoners."
"The EU also demanded the immediate release of all detainees against whom no charges had been laid in a proper manner complying with certain minimum standards."
"It also urged that all the detainees should be given the right to receive visits from their family members and from the International Red Cross and/or other appropriate representatives of the international community."
"A similar demand was made in a joint statement by the ambassadors of the European Union and the United States of America in Addis Ababa on 6 November 2005."
"Since the arrests at the beginning of November 2005, representatives of the European Union have regularly raised the case of these detainees in meetings with the Ethiopian Government and also brought it directly to the attention of the Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, in the course of the political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The diplomatic representatives of the European Union in Addis Ababa have agreed to raise the subject of respect for human rights and the rule of law as central elements in the political dialogue with Ethiopia, together with the demand that all those persons detained after the political demonstrations in June and November be set at liberty and that their relatives, their lawyers and humanitarian organisations be guaranteed access to them."
"Let me take this opportunity to mention that I have myself discussed these issues with Lord Triesman and with Mr Hilary Benn, since we know – as I have indeed mentioned – that the various steps taken under the British Presidency were of great significance in this respect and I do of course regard continuity in this area as important."
"The diplomatic representatives also agreed that they would insist on the relatives of the detainees being informed as to their whereabouts, and on the detainees being given access to legal counsel and being treated in a humane manner."
"We are also giving particular attention to guaranteeing the presence of local and international observers at the trials of opposition leaders and of other persons."
"The intention is that an observer should monitor the trial of the opposition leader Hailu Shawel and other persons and report back to the EU representatives in Addis Ababa."
"The European Union will continue to raise these issues with the Ethiopian Government and to monitor the situation of the detainees with close attention."
"I am slightly disappointed in the answer to the question."
"Our policy on development aid focuses on good governance and respect for human rights and it certainly does not seem to be the case here."
"If you look at the fact that we gave approximately EUR 900 million to Ethiopia between 2002 and 2005, we do not seem to be getting any respect for human rights in that country."
"A lot of talking is going on, but there is very little action."
"I would like to raise the specific case of Berhanu Nega, the elected Mayor of Addis Ababa."
"What is happening to him and has that case been raised by the Council?"
". On the supplementary question, as the honourable Member knows and as we all know, Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"Parts of the country, in particular in the south, suffer under great strain; there is a shortage of food and we have an obligation to help the population."
"We believe that development aid and development cooperation for the poor of the country should not be used as a means of pressure against the government and should not lead to punishment of the population."
"That is why the European Union does not withhold development cooperation funds but now channels them differently."
"That is the point we should bear in mind."
"So we are reflecting on how we should proceed."
"We are reducing the part of our aid that goes to the government directly and trying to find ways and means of channelling those funds directly to the population, where it is needed."
"On 13 and 14 March, there will be a conference in Paris in which the future of development aid for Ethiopia will be discussed and new ways will be found to help the poor people of Ethiopia directly, without channelling those funds directly to the government."
"As to the case that Mr Ryan mentioned, I have no specific information; I will certainly look into it and will let you know the result of our inquiries."
"Why is Ethiopia one of the poorest countries in the world, as you said?"
"It is because of the nature of the political regime, which distrusts civil society even to channel food aid, as I witnessed when I was the chief election observer in Ethiopia."
"It is also because it is a country where 85% of the population are peasants: they do not own land and therefore have no incentive to produce."
"Did yesterday’s and today’s donors meetings take into consideration the conclusions of the European Union election observation mission, that the elections failed to respect the principles for genuine democratic elections, and which highlighted the reasons for such failure?"
"Why has the Council ignored this Parliament’s calls in three resolutions to enter into dialogue ..."
". I am sorry, but I did not understand the last part of your question."
"As I said, we are very much aware of the political and social circumstances in the country."
"I can assure you that we take them very much into account."
"I can also assure you that the conference that is now taking place has all the information relating to the political, social, economic and financial situation in Ethiopia."
"I agree with the Council that you cannot allow the poor people of Ethiopia to suffer for the inadequacies of their government."
"How will the Council support civil society in delivering aid within Ethiopia?"
"It is clear we should not be channelling any funds through the Ethiopian Government but we should continue to encourage NGOs to be involved in Ethiopia."
"However, they need logistical support to be successful there."
"How will the Council assist NGOs in Ethiopia?"
". There are a number of ways and means in which the Council can and does act."
"We are very interested in – and want to support – the democratisation process in Ethiopia."
"I should like to mention briefly some of the instruments that we are using, one of which is the question of parliamentary procedures."
"We looked into them and took them into consideration."
"We have conducted a number of studies and want to help the parliament to improve its parliamentary procedures in order to enhance the possibilities of the opposition parties and to raise those procedures to international standards."
"In that connection, we are also trying to design programmes and projects to educate parliamentarians."
"We are helping with logistical support for the expansion and construction of a parliamentary infrastructure."
"The parliament, as far as I know, has no facilities for the opposition parties."
"They have no technical means of communication, so we are trying, together with the UNDP, to design projects which would be helpful in that respect."
"We are also helping the parliamentarians – in particular those from opposition parties – to travel to other parliaments to gain experience: to the parliaments of, for example, India, the United Kingdom and the United States."
"As you will know, the party landscape in Ethiopia is still very young, very underdeveloped, and we are trying to introduce those inexperienced parliamentarians to more traditional parliaments so that they can learn from them."
"We are helping to reform the National Election Board, a very interesting initiative in my view."
"Our ambassadors in Ethiopia are working on that to ensure that the National Election Board corresponds to international standards."
"Political developments in Iran are very disturbing."
"The reactionary and anti-democratic mullahs consolidated their power with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president."
"It is now highly important that the international community, including the EU, should support the democratic forces operating in Iran."
"The pressure on those holding political power must increase in response to the lack of respect for human rights, financial support for terrorist organisations, and the development of nuclear weapons."
"Last week, the US Secretary of State revealed that the Administration is to request a further 75 million dollars to promote democracy in Iran."
"Much of this funding will be invested in radio and television for the population of Iran."
"Sustained efforts will also be made to reach the Iranian people via the Internet."
"The USA also intends to increase its aid to the radio station FARDA, which broadcasts news critical of the regime inside Iran."
"What measures does the Presidency intend to take within the EU to strengthen independent radio and television stations and other democratic forces in Iran?"
"– Mr President, as the Council Conclusions of 7 November 2005 also indicate, the Council is agreed on the importance of supporting political reform in Iran and of promoting human rights and democracy."
"The EU obviously wishes to see Iran develop into a society in which human, civil and political rights are fully respected, in which democratic values and freedom of expression are able to blossom, and in which equal treatment and equal opportunities prevail over discrimination."
"At the same time, however, we are aware that the implementation of this objective will require sustained, long-term efforts and patience."
"The Council has endeavoured in the past and will endeavour in future to promote political reform, namely by supporting various authorities and organisations in Iran, including Iranian civil society."
"It is with this objective in mind that the EU has resumed its comprehensive political dialogue, and it is also making intensive endeavours towards restoring a meaningful, constructive human rights dialogue."
"The EU is currently seeking the best way to support political reform and democracy in Iran, and its deliberations include strengthening the role of the media and democratic forces."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, thank you very much for that answer."
"Unfortunately, no human rights dialogue is taking place in Iran."
"Nothing has happened."
"The current human rights abuses in Iran are on a vast scale."
"Iran has a regime that breaches most human rights."
"This is a state of affairs that rather recedes into the background when we debate the nuclear weapons programme, which is of course incredibly important."
"I believe that a well thought-out strategy is required for dealing with the human rights situation in Iran, and I wonder if we might perhaps draw on our experience from the period when we supported the Belorussian opposition by broadcasting to it from Europe in Belorussian."
"I wonder if that experience is something we can draw on."
"– Mrs Malmström, we are aware that we cannot do everything at once, however much we should like to."
"Nevertheless, we believe that dialogue is the only alternative open to us, as breaking off dialogue and ‘punishing civil society’, as it were, is certainly not a viable option."
"It is of course disappointing that the human rights dialogue has not been held since June 2004."
"Indeed, that was why the General Affairs Council, back in November of last year, called on Iran to take steps to resume substantive discussions within the framework of the dialogue."
"I can tell you, Mrs Malmström, that, in recent weeks, Iran has indeed shown interest in resuming this dialogue, although the EU has laid down certain framework conditions for this, as there is no point in dialogue for dialogue’s sake."
"If we succeed in imposing the framework conditions that permit a meaningful dialogue, and which also support civil society, we shall be glad to resume this dialogue."
"We hope to be able to resume the dialogue – which we also hope will be meaningful and beneficial – even before the end of the Austrian Presidency."
"– The question is specifically about strengthening democratic forces in Iran."
"One of the larger democratic forces in Iran is called in English the People’s Mujahedin."
"It is currently on the EU terrorist list, presumably because the Government of Iran put it there."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office to consider raising in the Council the issue of whether this anomaly can be removed at an early stage."
". I can assure the honourable Member that not only will I consider bringing it to the attention of the Council, I bring it to the attention of the Council."
"I was pleased to hear the Council’s response, because megaphone diplomacy is not going to work in the case of Iran."
"When George Bush made his famous speech, naming Iran as part of the ‘axis of evil’, Iran was part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"It is now no longer part of that treaty, partly because it feels exiled from the rest of the world."
"If you treat people as evil, they will act as if they are evil."
"Will the Council assure us that it will continue dialogue with Iran but not get involved in the internal politics, not – as some of my colleagues have suggested – backing individual political parties, but opening up Iran to wider discussion?"
"EU backing for a single political party would be death to that party inside Iran."
". I thank the honourable Member for the encouragement."
"We are trying to carry on a dialogue that is meaningful and not respond in a way that would shut the door on the possibility for dialogue."
"I can assure you that we will continue in this way."
"The Israeli Government recently decided to build a tramline to link the illegal settlement of Pisgat Ze'ev in East Jerusalem with the centre of West Jerusalem."
"This decision, which forms part of the strategy of annexing Palestinian territories to Israel, is a flagrant violation of the principles of international humanitarian law and, in particular, of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions."
"Two private French companies, Alstom and Connex, have already been involved in this construction project."
"What measures will the Council take vis-à-vis the Israeli authorities, who continue to violate international law untroubled?"
"Why does it not make use of the EU-Israel partnership and cooperation agreement to take steps to end the illegal settlements?"
"What measures will it take vis-à-vis France and the French Government to ensure that the companies involved in the construction project respect international law?"
"– Mr President, I should like to give the following reply to Mr Beglitis’s question."
"The EU’s unambiguous position on all the activities contravening international law that are carried out by Israel in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, remains, and is expressed repeatedly, regularly, emphatically and clearly at all levels in the sustained political contact between the EU and Israel."
"The tools used by the EU in following this political line are the Association Agreement between the EU and Israel, which envisages such contact, and the EU–Israel Action Plan, which was agreed in early 2005 within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"This position has not changed; a fact that was revealed once more on the last two occasions on which we were able to discuss the Middle East peace process and the situation in the Middle East, namely at the last General Affairs Council and at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, or ‘Gymnich meeting’, in Salzburg last weekend."
"The EU and all its Foreign Ministers continue to follow this line of fairness and of speaking clearly – including to Israel – when it comes to drawing attention to activities that we consider contrary to international law."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the representative of the Austrian Presidency but, at the same time, I want to express my regret about the bureaucratic way in which he replied, as representative of the Presidency, to my question on an issue which truly constitutes violation of the principles of international law and the Founding Charter of the UN."
"To be honest, I do not understand, Minister, the double language which the European Union uses to the Palestinians and to Israel."
"I see no statement, no measures being taken about the continuing settlements in occupied Palestinian territory."
"I see no reaction by the European Union to the statement by the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Olmert, that he will unilaterally shape the borders of Israel by 2010."
"– I am sorry if the honourable Member felt that my answer was bureaucratic – that was not my intention."
"I believe that I made myself very clear when I said that, wherever the Council considers conduct to be contrary to international law, it is taking every opportunity to say so openly at all levels."
"To cite just a few examples, we have stated very clearly that we consider the wall, the separation barrier erected on Palestinian territory, to be contrary to international law."
"We have unambiguously criticised Israel’s settlement policy on repeated occasions and shall continue to do so."
"I hope that the honourable Member does not feel this to be bureaucratic; indeed, we are not doing it bureaucratically, but in an entirely political manner."
"Since the EU relishes and promotes cross-border infrastructural projects within its own territory, would it not be incongruous and wrong for it to object to such a project in Israel, since improved communication links can only bring cohesion and social and economic betterment to those disparate territories?"
". Yes, I would agree that we should encourage and support all people-to-people contact and all infrastructural measures that promote such contacts."
"However, they have to be in line with recognised rules of international law."
"That is exactly the policy of the European Union."
"We encourage those contacts and projects that are in line with international law, and we criticise when they are not in line with international law."
"Mr President, as pointed out in the question, EU companies are contributing to infrastructural projects in occupied territory."
"These are projects clearly contrary to international law and international humanitarian legislation."
"They include, for example, the tramline link with settlements and the new railway to Jerusalem crossing the occupied West Bank."
"The French company Connex is involved in such construction projects."
"What does the Council of Ministers think about the fact that EU companies are participating in these activities that are contrary to international law?"
"– I can answer this question as to whether the EU should participate in undertakings, as it is not, in itself, incompatible with the remit of the Council."
"I can only repeat what I have already said, and I apologise for this repetition."
"Naturally, the EU supports only projects that are in accordance with international law and that conform to the rules. Differences of opinion are possible as to precisely what is and what is not in accordance with international law but, at all events, the Council’s view is that we naturally support only projects that are in accordance with international law."
"How is it to be ensured that the strengthening of mutual recognition and the simplification of cross-border procedures will not entail a reduced level of protection of fundamental rights?"
"What binding rules are needed, particularly with regard to the protection of fundamental rights, to clarify the application of minimum procedural safeguards in cases entailing cross-border circumstances?"
". – Mr President, this question concerns the protection of fundamental rights and the principle of mutual recognition that has already been discussed."
"I should like to say in reply that the Council has always emphasised that it gives absolute priority to respect for human rights, and that the Council is also actively promoting the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, with particular regard to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the relevant EU guidelines."
"In addition, in the Presidency Conclusions of the Tampere European Council – which has already been mentioned here today – the Council emphasised that the principle of mutual recognition should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation, and that mutual recognition and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate the judicial protection of individual rights."
"In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 26 July 2000, entitled ‘Mutual Recognition of Final Decisions in Criminal Matters’, the Commission stated in this regard that it must be ensured that the treatment of suspects and the rights of the defence would not only not suffer from the implementation of this principle – namely the principle of mutual recognition – but that the safeguards would even be improved."
"This was also confirmed in the Programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters that was adopted by the Council and the Commission."
"On 28 April 2004, the Commission adopted a Proposal for a Council framework decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union, which it presented to the Council on 3 May 2005."
"We have already discussed this more or less intensively under the previous item on the agenda."
"This proposal, which is currently being examined by the competent bodies of the Council, and with which we shall try to make considerable progress under our presidency, is aimed at improving the rights of all suspects and of defendants by guaranteeing them a uniform level of protection throughout the European Union."
"In addition, the Council points out that the EU Member States have to meet their obligations under international law and, in particular, under the European Convention on Human Rights – to which, after all, we are all parties."
"This is confirmed in Article 6 of the EU Treaty."
"The fact that the principle of mutual recognition is being realised within the framework of a purely judicial procedure also means that legal protection is guaranteed by independent judicial authorities, which is a great advantage."
"It should also be borne in mind in this connection that, as a rule, the legal instruments based on the principle of mutual recognition contain a general human rights clause confirming that the obligation to respect fundamental rights and general legal principles pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union is not affected."
"Finally, the Proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which was presented by the Commission in July 2005 and is currently being examined by the competent bodies of the Council, represents a further step on the way to an effective EU human rights policy."
"– I am much obliged to the President-in-Office for her comprehensive answer."
"I should like to put a supplementary question relating to the European Constitution."
"Part II of the Constitution provides that the product of the work of the then Fundamental Rights Convention is intended, as it were, to supplement and also, to a certain extent, to reinforce the provisions of Article 6 of the present Treaty."
"Can we envisage its implementation, as already addressed by the Commission and Parliament, by the Council, too, and could that improve the situation as a whole?"
"– Absolutely."
"Indeed, that is one of the reasons why we regret that the European Constitutional Treaty is not yet in force, because one of the major benefits I can see in this Constitutional Treaty is that it would incorporate that very Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It would no longer be necessary to discuss precisely those minimum standards for procedural safeguards that we were debating in great depth earlier if our Treaties had a single legal basis."
"I see this as a very great benefit, and for that reason it is also important to continue the discussion in one way or another."
"Indeed, I am hopeful that we shall reach a solution to this in due course."
"The state of emergency imposed in response to alleged suspicions of a plot to overthrow the government of President Gloria Arroyo is still in force despite assurances and promises to the effect that it would be lifted."
"Charges are being filed against a growing number of popular democratic leaders and an increasing number of arrests carried out, while reports leaked by the military are seen as evidence of a plot to overthrow the President."
"Does the Council condemn the emergency rule, which many regard nothing less than martial law under another name, resulting in the suspension of fundamental freedoms?"
"Will it call for an immediate end to emergency rule and the restoration of democratic freedoms?"
". – Mr President, the state of emergency declared by the President of the Philippines on 24 February of this year was lifted – as you know – one week later, on Friday, 3 March."
"Both the EU Presidency, which had come to an agreement beforehand with the local Heads of Mission in Manila, and the EU Troika, which was in Manila from 28 February to 4 March for the ASEAN Regional Forum Intersessional Support Group meeting on Confidence Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy, verbally expressed the EU’s concern about the recent development at meetings in the Philippines Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1 March."
"In addition, they called for the rule of law, the right to due process and human rights to be fully respected, and for the prompt lifting of the state of emergency; which, as I have said, was then indeed lifted, on 3 March."
"– Mr President, Minister, thank you for your information."
"However, I must say to you that we may have lifted the state of emergency, but five opposition members of parliament have been arrested and are now in gaol."
"I should therefore like to ask you what you will do to bring about the immediate release of the members of parliament detained and of the trade unionists who are still in gaol."
". – I can assure the honourable Member that, in these cases, as in all cases of flagrant human rights violations, especially those concerning representatives of the people, the EU is continually, regularly, and wherever possible working to ensure compliance with the relevant human rights provisions and standards."
"As has already been correctly pointed out, this does not always take place in public, because that does not always produce the desired effect – sometimes silent diplomacy is better – but it does take place, and regularly."
"It is very often carried out by the local representatives of the EU – including, in particular, the Troika."
"It is carried out in the course of discussions with high-ranking officials from the countries concerned."
"In addition, I can assure the honourable Member once again that we shall of course also continue to work on, and attend to, the cases you mentioned."
"Improved access to justice for consumers, in particular, is a fundamental concern of the Vienna Action Plan and of the Tampere Council."
"Where judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters is concerned some steps have already been taken to make judicial enforcement abroad easier."
"However, it is precisely in cases with cross-border circumstances that there is a need for simple, speedy procedures to ensure that EU citizens obtain justice."
"What procedural simplifications can EU citizens expect in this area in the foreseeable future, and what improvements will these bring about, in particular, with regard to the legal position of consumers?"
". – In response to Mrs Schierhuber’s question on improved access to justice for consumers in Europe, I should like to say that, in the field of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, the Council is currently pursuing the projects envisaged by the Hague Programme of 2004 and the Action Plan 2005 implementing this."
"These include creating new procedures to enable EU citizens to obtain a judicial decision more quickly and more easily in the case of cross-border disputes."
"In specific terms, we are concerned here with two regulations in particular: firstly, the Regulation creating a European order for payment procedure and, secondly, the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure."
"These being regulations, Parliament is very closely involved in both procedures under the codecision procedure."
"Both regulations create new procedural opportunities, which will also, in particular, strengthen consumer protection throughout the EU."
"If consumers are faced with a legal dispute in connection with their cross-border financial transactions, they should now have recourse to the institutions organising judicial cooperation between the judicial authorities of the individual Member States."
"The two new procedures will therefore supplement the instruments that have been adopted up to now in the field of judicial cooperation – the simplified procedure for taking evidence and the minimum standards for legal aid, to name but a few – and thus further augment the legal remedies within the EU."
"The Regulation creating a European order for payment procedure will make it possible in future for EU citizens to obtain a European order for payment upon application to a court, in respect of payment notifications that are possibly uncontested by the debtor."
"If, subsequently, no objection is forthcoming from the debtor, this order for payment becomes final and also enforceable."
"This will make it easier for the creditor to subsequently assert this order in the Member States."
"Further to Parliament’s positive opinion in December 2005, it proved possible to reach political agreement on this regulation as early as 21 February 2006, at the most recent Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"Once the regulation has been revised by the lawyer-linguists, it should be adopted by the Council at first reading as an ‘A’ item in April 2006."
"Even so, we envisage that the regulation will enter into force in two years’ time."
"The establishment of a European small claims procedure – the second crucial point here – should simplify and accelerate the enforcement of cross-border small claims."
"The small claims procedure, which is in principle designed to be conducted in writing, is one in which judicial decisions are taken in respect of claims up to a total of EUR 2 000."
"The desired acceleration is to be achieved by imposing a time frame for even the individual stages of the procedure, which not only the courts, but also the parties to the proceedings will have to observe."
"In addition, the court is free to determine the means of proof and the extent to which evidence is taken, according to the individual case."
"Evidence may also be taken by means of modern communication technology, such as videoconferencing or similar – provided, of course, that this is also admissible in the procedures of the Member State concerned."
"We intend to actively continue work on the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure during our Presidency, and indeed hope to be able to bring it a long way towards completion."
"– I am much obliged to the President-in-Office for her answer."
"She mentioned the European small claims procedure and also cross-border protection for both parties."
"My supplementary question is as follows: how are European consumers to be informed in future about their judicial remedies?"
"– Mr President, generally speaking, there is a great deal of information on offer to EU citizens."
"The Commission’s Judicial Atlas, in particular, which is available to every man and woman on the Internet, plays a very valuable role in this connection, because this enables jurisdiction and similar matters to be accessed very simply throughout Europe."
"That is one very important aspect."
"We are of course concerned that our citizens receive as much information as possible – particularly with regard to access to justice – and so it is important that information also be passed on promptly."
"To this end, it is particularly essential, from our point of view, that cooperation with the vital institutions concerned is very constructive, very swift and very efficient."
"That is a crucial aspect."
"I consider it vital that we carry out a great deal of work in the Member States on obtaining information from the courts, so that the required information can be transferred from the courts to the public."
"That is another crucial aspect."
"A sound legal system in Europe can only function if the public knows where to turn to."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, consumers are increasingly making use of the new opportunities offered by the Internet, including, in particular, -commerce."
"Have there been any deliberations on this with regard to the improvement or protection of legal remedies?"
"How soon can we expect results that improve the current situation?"
"– Generally speaking, of course, the honourable Member is right: the field of -commerce will play a quite decisive role in the Europe of the future."
"There are, of course, regulatory instruments whose provisions are already starting to include consumer protection, particularly in the field of -commerce, since we are aware that frequent abuses are possible in this field."
"I am also aware that individual -commerce providers are already using seals of quality and such like, which is their own form of access."
"I envisage our dealing with these instruments, too, in future, although this will not be done primarily by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, but rather will fall within the domain of the Competitiveness Council."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I, too, believe that the internal market needs a functional legal system and, particularly, a functional system of law enforcement."
"What are the planned arrangements with regard to cost, however?"
"After all, law enforcement is always a matter of cost."
"Is there to be a uniform European arrangement for this, or are we keeping to the system of individual national arrangements, as it were?"
". – The honourable Member has raised a very delicate issue, which, of course, particularly in the case of the Regulation establishing a European small claims procedure, is one of the main issues under discussion."
"Strictly speaking, there are no plans for compulsory representation by a lawyer under the European small claims procedure, which, of course, raises a central question regarding the matter of cost, and particularly regarding the reimbursement of court costs, for which different arrangements exist in the various Member States."
"Generally speaking, we have already been making efforts to establish legal instruments within the framework of legal aid, in particular, and these are already being implemented."
"We shall certainly have to think about further instruments for the other field."
"Meetings of Council working parties have revealed this to be an issue that my experts are discussing and one where we shall certainly be able to work out a solution in respect of the European small claims procedure, too."
"Will the Austrian Presidency renew efforts to get agreement in the Council on a framework decision to combat racism and xenophobia proposed by the Commission in 2001 and strongly backed by Parliament?"
"Given the disturbing picture given in reports from the EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia based in Vienna of the extent of and failure to tackle racist crime in Europe, how can it be justified for the Council not to prioritise this legislation for a pan-European approach to outlaw criminal behaviour motivated by racial hatred?"
"– Mr President, this takes us to another very delicate area."
"There has, of course, been a Proposal for a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia from the Commission, which was presented on 29 November 2001."
"Despite intensive discussions in the Council, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on this proposal in February 2003."
"Following on from this, the Italian delegation presented an alternative version of the Proposal for a framework decision in March 2003, but this, too, failed to meet with agreement from the delegations."
"Subsequently, on 24 February 2005, the Council instructed its working party on substantive criminal law to continue the discussions on the proposal."
"Accordingly, the working party resumed the work on the proposal, based on the state of affairs reached in 2003."
"The debate on this framework decision at the Council meeting on 2 and 3 June 2005 made it clear that there is no scope for consensus among Member States."
"Naturally, this was a bitter pill to swallow, especially for those Member States who have given this framework decision their strong support."
"In view of the past history of this framework decision, which I have just described to you, a resumption of negotiations does not strike the Austrian Presidency as promising at the present time."
"Nevertheless, the Presidency does not want to let this very important dossier – and especially the political message behind it – come to a complete standstill, and so we shall be holding a seminar on this subject, also in agreement with the Commission and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, before the end of our Presidency."
"We expect there to be about 100 participants in this seminar."
"The seminar will take place in Vienna from 20–22 June 2006 and will discuss selected problems connected with this proposal."
"As I am sure you can imagine – indeed, this also emerged from the recent discussions on the caricatures – we find ourselves once more in the midst of the area of tension between our political message – that we unambiguously oppose racism and xenophobia – and freedom of expression."
"It is this very tension that we have to defuse if we are to really make important progress."
"These are also exactly the kind of issues that are to be discussed at the seminar."
"It is intended that two representatives of each of the Member States, acceding countries and candidate countries participate in this seminar."
"We also intend to invite NGOs, in particular, who are familiar with the issues, and also representatives of the Council of Europe, of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, of the EU network of independent experts in fundamental rights, and of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance."
"It goes without saying that representatives of Parliament will also be invited to participate."
"Parliament will receive an official invitation to this seminar in late March."
"The programme will also have been finalised by then, and we shall be able to present it."
"In addition, as already mentioned in connection with Question No 4 on the protection of fundamental rights, I should like to point out that the European Council decided in December 2003 to establish a European Fundamental Rights Agency, a fact it confirmed in December 2004."
"The Council’s ad hoc working party on fundamental rights and citizenship is currently examining the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission in June 2005."
"The Agency is scheduled to start work on 1 January 2007."
"We know that this is a very tight schedule, but we hope to be able to keep to it."
"The Austrian Presidency attaches the highest priority to this issue and hopes to be able to conclude the negotiations so that the Agency can start work on schedule."
"There are some difficult issues – such as Holocaust denial and protecting freedom of speech – but it is scandalous that in 2006 there is still no EU-wide response to the alarming and increasing problem of racist violence."
"It must be possible to get EU-wide agreement on the core issue of preventing the day-to-day racial harassment and hatred suffered by many of our citizens and residents."
"Some countries, such as Greece, Italy and Portugal, currently fail even to record racial attacks."
"Please name the obstructive Member States that are holding up this framework decision agreement and make a big push during your Presidency to outlaw race hate crimes."
"All power to your elbow!"
"– I could not agree more with the honourable Member’s statement."
"From the Presidency’s point of view, we of course have every interest in sending out an important political signal on this, too."
"We assume that the seminar we are holding will objectify the matter again and, by means of expert opinions – particularly large numbers of expert opinions – will produce an outcome that will make it possible for us to strike the necessary balance in future between our shared aspiration: namely, to oppose racism and xenophobia most effectively, but without putting freedom of expression at risk as a result."
"At all events, we wish to make quite considerable progress, and we hope that, given a new impetus, it proves possible for the Finnish Presidency to successfully conclude this dossier, or at least to continue the negotiations, on the basis of our work."
"– Mr President, Minister, racism and xenophobia have even penetrated sport and football."
"I am sure you know full well that we had numerous episodes against coloured athletes and footballers at numerous events and numerous – mainly football – games in England, Spain, France and so on."
"Does the Austrian Presidency intend to recommend that Germany take measures against racism and xenophobia during the World Cup next summer and how will you address them, given that you will still have the Presidency?"
"– We are assuming that Germany is governed by the rule of law and that it is up to the German authorities to take suitable measures to combat racism and xenophobia, including during the World Cup."
"I am quite certain that Germany will take the appropriate measures."
"My question, Question No 8, also deals with xenophobia."
"Ministers go on here with very long replies."
"Is it not possible, out of courtesy to Members, to take questions together when they relate to the same subject?"
"I come here every month to table questions but they are never reached."
"We reach a very small number of questions, and answers are allowed to go on forever."
"The very next question in my name addresses the issue of xenophobia and I do not know why it was not taken together with Question No 7."
"Mr President, on a point of order, the Minister of Justice of Austria has come all this way."
"We were told to table questions to her."
"We had to wait until March."
"Some of these questions were tabled in December, but we waited patiently for three months to put the questions to her."
"Now she has been allowed to answer precisely two questions in three months!"
"It is not her fault, we are delighted she came – thank you for coming, Minister – but would you please convey to President Borrell that this is a failure."
"It does not work."
"It is not a good system for the Minister to come and answer two questions after three months."
"Does the Council have a coherent plan of action to address the rising levels of xenophobia that are being experienced across the EU, especially as regards citizens from EU Member States living and working in other EU Member States as minorities?"
"– Madam President, I have actually answered Questions Nos 7 and 8 by Sarah Ludford and Gay Mitchell together, but I of course welcome supplementary questions."
"Given that xenophobia and racism is often evident at sporting events, would the President-in-Office consider, as part of the plan, using sport as a way to fight xenophobia?"
"From acorns grow oak trees."
"In my own constituency, Crumlin United Football Club – a club for young people, where Robbie Keane came from – each year holds a sports festival weekend where people not only play sport but also have cultural exchanges."
"Would the President-in-Office consider having a weekend across the European Union where similar sporting and cultural exchanges take place, so that we use sport to fight xenophobia?"
"– Madam President, Mr Mitchell, I think that that is a good idea in principle, as I, too, believe that we must together fight to ensure that racism and xenophobia in Europe do not stand a chance."
"I also see that sport is capable of building bridges in this regard, because when young people, especially – who are our future, after all – and often adults, too, exercise together, they can then go on to undertake activities together."
"It is not only sport that has a potential role to play here, however; I also see definite opportunities in the field of culture."
"Even though the two are not directly connected, we have to try to build these bridges in many different areas."
"Racism and xenophobia are very often connected with prejudice. Prejudice tends to arise out of unfamiliarity with other cultures, because unfamiliar things are often associated with fear."
"Since fear, in turn, gives rise to negative feelings, it is entirely possible, of course, for racism and xenophobia to arise."
"For that reason, everything that could result in our getting to know one another better, getting to know other cultures even better, is welcome as a means to beat xenophobia."
"The question is – since the honourable Member specifically addressed me as a Minister for Justice – whether the Council actually has the competence to do this under the EU Treaty."
"I do believe, however, that this is an important political message that all of us together should pass on."
"My sincerest thanks for these comments."
"We shall discuss them with the Council Presidency and consider how to proceed next time to the satisfaction of all parties."
"– On a point of order, I am not sure that the point has been understood."
"The Austrian Presidency chose to change the system for answering Council questions, which meant a three-month wait for many people who are listed here, including myself."
"Mr Newton Dunn made that point."
"We have waited for three months."
"The Minister has been very gracious."
"It is not her fault that the Presidency decided to change the system."
"The Minister has been incredibly gracious in answering an extra question."
"I have never seen that happen before."
"However, can you please now review that decision and go back to the old system?"
"This one simply does not work."
"We have put down serious questions on radicalisation and other issues, which have now not been answered after three months."
"Please consider going back to the old system."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council."
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B6-0013/2006)."
"Madam President, please excuse me for taking up a little time before we begin Questions to the Commission, but I wish to express my surprise, even consternation, at what has happened to one of the questions that I had presented specifically for this sitting."
"While last week I was told that my question on the maintenance or modification of the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators in the European Commission was going to be the third question to be replied to during this Question Time, last night I received a communication indicating that the President of Parliament had judged my question to be inadmissible."
"I have received a letter today from Mr Harald Rømer, the Deputy Secretary-General, in which he explains to me that this decision has been made because an oral reply was given to a similar question from me in February."
"Mr Rømer has surely only read the title of my question, which is the same, but has not read the text."
"The text of my question in February and that of my question this month are entirely different."
"Could anybody tell me, for example, when the Commission has said whether it is going to reduce the number of translators in the Spanish service to 67 by the end of the year or how it is going to sustain such a decision at the next European Union-Latin America Summit, which will take place in Vienna."
"I do not accept the statement that my question is inadmissible."
"I believe that it infringes my rights as a Member of Parliament, and I demand that my question receive a reply, if not during this sitting, then next month."
"The budget allocated by the Commission for the Trans Crime project is only sufficient for the EU-15."
"Since most large-scale organised crime originates from outside the EU to the east and south-east, would it not be better to expand the project’s budget to allow for all 25 EU Member States to participate?"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the question raises an important issue since it refers to funds for a project that is essential for us, specifically, a research project on the issue of crime."
"For technical reasons it is not possible to increase the funding, as Mr Newton Dunn requests, since this is a project from 2004 that is to finish in 2006; it is possible, however, within the framework of that programme, to organise seminars covering the activities and analyses of the new Member States, as Mr Newton Dunn would like to see."
"In addition, there is another different programme, again financed by the Commission, which specifically applies to all the Member States, including, therefore, the new Member States, and covers precisely the collection of statistical data and information on five types of serious offence: corruption, fraud, illegal trafficking in cultural assets, counterfeiting, piracy and the sexual exploitation of children and pornography."
"On these issues the project under way covers all the EU Member States."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for that."
"I think we are on the same wavelength here, and he knows that."
"We actually had the same objective."
"So thank you for that information, Commissioner."
"I would just like to ask when you expect the results to be available."
"When will the programme be ready so that we will actually have some harmonised statistical collecting across the EU?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the project currently under way will finish in April 2006, in a few weeks’ time; the next project has already started and will finish during the course of the year."
"We can therefore confirm that this year we will have up-to-date statistics, both for the Member States who were members before 2004, and later, by the end of the year, for all the other Member States."
"Is the Commission worried about the rise in interest rates at a time when inflation in Europe is showing no signs of speeding up?"
"What consequences does it think this rise will have on the beginnings of economic recovery in Europe and on employment in the euro zone?"
". The question concerns interest rate policy and monetary policy."
"On behalf of the Commission, I must say that monetary policy – and therefore decisions on interest rate changes – is the sole responsibility of the European Central Bank."
"Its independence is enshrined in the Treaty."
"It is the European Central Bank’s primary objective to maintain price stability in the euro area by ensuring that medium- to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability."
"The European Central Bank supports economic growth and job creation in the euro area."
"The current level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remains low by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms."
"As regards the last part of the question on the economic outlook, in its last interim forecast the Commission expected economic growth in 2006 to accelerate to between 1.9% and 2% in the euro area, which is close to estimates of the area’s potential growth rate."
"However, the Commission is cautious about commenting on the policies of the European Central Bank, as that is the Bank’s sole responsibility."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the necessary institutional respect and caution does not prevent us from making political assessments of the decisions of the institutions, as in the case of the European Central Bank, whose interest rate rise, at a time of low economic growth and lack of job creation in the European Union, is rather worrying for millions of Spaniards, millions of European citizens, millions of small businesses throughout Europe and millions of families with mortgages."
"That is why I said, Commissioner, that I would urge the Commission also to make a respectful political proposal to the European Central Bank."
". The political message is that the European Central Bank is a very independent body, as determined in the Treaty."
"As an economist and former Central Bank leader, I can elaborate on this subject."
"I can only say that Europe’s monetary policy objectives are based on the fight against inflation, which has great social importance, and in this context the adjustment of monetary policy is quite a sophisticated mechanism."
"All borrowers want an interest rate which is as low as possible."
"These rates are very low at the moment in Europe and they do not harm economic growth."
"I can only speak as an economist."
"The position of the Commission is that interest rate policy remains in the hands of the European Central Bank."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course, interest-rate policy also has a decisive influence on public debt."
"What are the Commissioner’s views on interest-rate policy in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact?"
". Throughout history governments and central banks have adopted different and radical measures."
"For instance, in the United States interest rates were raised suddenly to 17% and the additional money supply was then really pressured down."
"But, at this stage, the change of interest rate is quite modest in the Central Bank."
"It is in accordance with the forecasts, economic considerations and outlooks."
"We do not intervene in those policies."
"Commissioner, three states – Slovenia, Lithuania and Estonia – are going to join the eurozone next year."
"If those three small economies succeed in joining, what impact will that event have on interest rates and inflation in Europe?"
"Are there signs of any change?"
". As to changes if these countries join the euro, you all know the situation and that the criteria adopted in the Maastricht Treaty are very strict."
"I can only discuss this issue as an economist."
"As a citizen of one of these countries, of course I support enlargement of the euro area, and countries with proper financial policies will definitely strengthen the euro area."
"It would also mean enlargement for the euro and its influence in the world."
"These countries have a stable budget policy so they will increase the credibility of the euro."
"In planning the new series of programmes (Culture 2010, Lifelong Learning 2007-2013, Education and Training 2010 and Youth in Action 2007-2013), what practical steps and what measures to simplify the procedure and eliminate bureaucracy will the Commission take to use the new opportunities for education and training which are designed to promote the full intellectual and scientific development of young people and to enable them to acquire the necessary resources and vocational qualifications while, at the same time, strengthening their sense of belonging to Europe, so that they can contribute to the economic, social and political life of the EU?"
". The question concerns simplification and a more user-friendly space for educational mobility and programmes connected with youth, culture and citizenship."
"As you know, the proposal on education and the new generation of programmes in the field of lifelong learning, youth and culture were adopted in 2004 for the period 2007-2013."
"We are preparing for this, the programmes are still not fully adopted, but they will replace existing programmes and will also contribute to clearer and simpler conditions for users."
"The new programmes, once fully established, will enable individuals to benefit more from a true common European area of mobility."
"Hopefully, appropriate funding will be available."
"These programmes will allow institutions in the fields of education, training and culture to improve the way they operate together."
"In this context, the simplification of administrative and financial procedures is a key issue."
"Successive evaluations and large-scale public consultation exercises have demonstrated that the current programmes would indeed benefit from simplification."
"That, however, requires efforts at different stages, at the level of the administrative arrangements for the programmes themselves and at the level of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules."
"At programme level, it is proposed to reduce the number of programmes in the area of education and training by putting Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig under the same umbrella: an integrated lifelong learning programme."
"The design of the new programmes – especially in the youth, culture and citizenship area – is intended to simplify access for the potential beneficiaries."
"For example, in the new Culture 2007 programme we have created a more open and accessible programme in terms of its very structure, with three main objectives compared to the former eight."
"It is thus easier to grasp its essence, specifically because it takes a non-sectoral approach, where any player can feel welcome, and is explicitly aimed at the diversity of beneficiaries."
"Furthermore, the Commission aims to simplify the application and the reporting systems involved and, of course, to accelerate the selection procedure."
"We have included provisions to that effect in the draft decision."
"During the ongoing codecision procedure for adoption of the programme decisions, both Parliament and the Council have supported the Commission’s aim to achieve maximum simplification, not only in the form of the programme actions but also in their administrative and financial requirements, and to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards on the other hand."
"As regards the Financial Regulation, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments which are currently under examination by Parliament."
"These amendments will, inter alia, introduce the principle of proportionality, which means that the administrative and accounting requirements should be proportional to the size of the grant."
"As to the implementing rules, progress has already been made because in July 2005 the Commission amended the detailed rules for the implementation of Financial Regulation No 1, which led, among others, to the following improvements in terms of simplified procedures."
"Firstly, the requirement for external audit in support of payments is now obligatory only for intermediate payments or payments for the balance where the grant exceeds EUR 750 000 for actions and EUR 100 000 for operating grants."
"The second amendment is that the limit on flat-rate amounts has been increased from EUR 5000 to EUR 10 000."
"In addition, several flat-rate amounts are now possible in one grant and the Commission can authorise the use of flat-rate amounts even if they are not specified in the basic act."
"– Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your full and informative reply."
"I am delighted about the simplification measures you presented."
"However, should we perhaps understand that simplification also applies to the financing of these programmes?"
"Citizens fear that these programmes will not be financed as lavishly as in the past."
"Are these fears justified?"
"Madam President, we are currently talking about integration and a sense of belonging to Europe, and a few minutes ago we were talking about racism and xenophobia."
"I believe that there are common elements in all of this."
"A few months ago I visited Canada, and there I saw a very complete programme of integration of immigrants and their families."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether it intends to create any programme for integrating young immigrants, so that we too may reduce racism and xenophobia, since these new European citizens also have a sense of belonging to our community."
". I am sure that using education as a tool against racism and xenophobia for social inclusion and for integration is also a very acutely perceived and common task."
"An integrated, free, democratic Europe can be based only on integrated, free, democratic societies."
"Member States, their governments, public authorities in the broader sense and European institutions are thus invited to support such tools."
"Some of the programmes are already being used to that end."
"The European Youth Pact, adopted last year, is one of the special tools for integration and provides some answers for the youth of Europe, young people who have many difficulties or are in vulnerable situations in individual countries."
"Social inclusion is one of the most important parts of social policy."
"I do not want to speak on behalf of my colleagues, but these issues are taken into account and promoted via different programmes which we have in our remit."
"More can be done on the basis of coherent policies at European and national levels."
"This is an ongoing issue, to be dealt with not only via education but also via sport, culture and intercultural dialogue."
"These are very useful and efficient tools for promoting social inclusion and integration and for combating problems such as violence, hooliganism, racism and xenophobia."
"– Madam President, like all his colleagues, the Commissioner speaks of simplification, and these complicated European procedures are a major point of contention."
"Could he perhaps give me a couple of specific examples of what is being newly simplified and what is now going to improve?"
"Secondly, are records being kept of the effective costs of managing the programmes and of the amount of funds from these programmes that will directly benefit the European public in future?"
". I mentioned Erasmus because the German President used that example."
"I believe he was right to mention it because it is probably the most famous and popular programme."
"There have been 1.4 million Erasmus alumni since 1987."
"They are very influential programmes for individuals and societies."
"People get a lot from those programmes."
"They are asked for more and more."
"I have expressed gratitude for the support in Parliament for these programmes because they have impact."
"The future of Europe without those programmes would be more in question."
"The programmes have an impact on other areas: Erasmus was the driving force for the Bologna Process, which is very influential for any student, any professor and any university in Europe."
"I mentioned some of the proposals that are already in the implementation rules adopted by the Commission."
"The Commission has proposed more than 100 amendments to the Financial Regulation."
"It is now your turn to decide, and to improve it."
"As of January 2006, we have established a new executive agency that deals with all individual cases and individual projects and works closely with national agencies."
"This centralised system for the operation of our programmes is a reasonable tool."
"National agencies operate in Member States in concrete national languages."
"They are much closer to citizens, which helps to provide the best service for the users of the programme."
"Perhaps we can go into more detail in future, when we discuss the Financial Regulation itself."
"There are some concrete measures and proposals on how to simplify life for the user of small grants, in contrast to the millions used for infrastructure or research projects."
"We also want to put more money, for example, into Erasmus or lifelong learning programmes because we believe the EUR 125 per head, per month, is not very substantial European support when we look into the real costs of daily life in our countries."
"So ‘more’ also means more in the social dimension."
"This money is often decisive for those who need European grants to study abroad."
"I should like to refer to the Commission’s plan to foster entrepreneurship via education, from primary school to university."
"In its plan, the Commission refers to the need for increased economic growth and more entrepreneurship in order to keep the European social model going at a satisfactory level."
"I fully agree that these are needed."
"I am concerned, however, about the risk of education playing second fiddle to the logic of competition and the market. I believe it is vital for the European social model and for individual advancement that education should aim to ensure that citizens are free, independent and discerning."
"There are several examples of good practice from which we can no doubt learn a lot – such as increasing the amount of work experience schemes – and I do not wish to detract from business-related studies, but a North-American-style education with too much focus on business cannot be our reference model."
"Does the Commission not think that, in the interests of the future of education as a pillar of citizenship, we should be focusing our efforts on revising educational curricula in the Member States in order to improve education in all areas, including culture and the humanities?"
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Action Plan known as the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship was approved in 2004."
"Under the Action Plan five strategic policy areas were established for the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship during the current years."
"The first of these areas deals with stimulating entrepreneurial thinking among young people."
"Recently, on 13 February, the European Commission adopted, as part of the Action Plan, a communication called Fostering Entrepreneurial Mindsets through Education and Learning."
"In the communication, the Commission outlined a set of recommendations for the Member States, since the European Union does not have any formal power or competence in this area."
"The idea is to strengthen the role of education in shaping an enhanced entrepreneurial culture in Europe and European companies."
"Education should stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit in young people and open up new possibilities for their future, along with the means for developing basic entrepreneurial skills."
"One of the objectives of the communication is to improve the way that young people are being prepared for their future lives, future occupations and jobs."
"The Commission believes that the benefits of entrepreneurship and education in the field of entrepreneurship should not be measured merely by the number of new companies or innovative enterprises and new jobs."
"Entrepreneurship is first and foremost a key competence for all, as it helps young people to be more creative and enterprising, to have more self-confidence, and to work and take decisions in a more socially-responsible manner regardless of the activity in which they may be engaged."
"Viewed in this light and against the broader scope of competences being advanced under the 2010 Education and Professional Training Programme, entrepreneurship is one of the elements in the reference framework of eight key and basic competences for lifelong education."
"We consider these key competences to be crucial for self-fulfilment, social inclusion, active citizenship and employability."
"They also include a civic, cultural and educational dimension."
"According to the communication, the Commission considers the fostering of entrepreneurial mindsets through education and professional training to be fully consistent and compatible with the aims we have set ourselves and with those formulated by MEPs, including even the author of this question, Mrs Maria Badia i Cutchet, within the context of improving general education in all areas and ensuring that in the future European citizens shall remain free and independent, with better conditions for development."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your words, which have definitely reassured me a little, because, having read this Communication, I am rather concerned that we might be going too far in subjecting education to the exigencies of competition and the market."
"I am currently coming into contact with many students and I am convinced that some of them intend to be entrepreneurs in the future, but many others may have completely different interests: cultural or humanitarian interests."
". I am sure that we are not all business people, nor will all our children be business people, but it is important that we understand how businesses operates."
"We believe – and when I say ‘we’, I also mean Member States, because there is strong consensus on the set of key competences, which include entrepreneurial initiative – that it is about an ability to understand the complexity, an ability to take initiatives, to turn initiative into action and take up personal responsibility."
"This is also good for employees, not only for employers: employees who are active and creative are good employees for any serious company."
"That is why we believe that such ability is very helpful for the whole of society and individuals and that it is not just about propagation and production of businesses and business people."
"It is about a mentality which should also be more mature in a changing environment, in an environment which requires a deeper understanding of influences and dynamism."
"– Commissioner, in principle, it is good that the Commission is taking initiatives in the field of entrepreneurship, such as the CIP, and also here. After all, jobs only arise where something is being offered for sale."
"Does the Commissioner envisage any prospect of these initiatives being presented to a rather wider public, including as part of the Commission’s public-relations activities together with Commissioner Wallström?"
". This should be part of a communication or promotion by colleagues in the Commission and this House alike, because Europe tends to compare its potential with that of many other partners."
"I think we have the potential, but most blockages or obstacles stem either from our rules, that is to say, how we organise our economies or societies, or from our mentality."
"That is why I fully support Mr Rübig’s point that this basic concept – the key competences including education for entrepreneurship, education for culture, cultural awareness, citizenship and, of course, languages, mathematics, science, digital literacy and learning to learn – is important for everybody."
"Lifelong learning is and must be based on some basic competences, and these include an entrepreneurial ability or mindset."
"Therefore, I also would like to invite you and all friends of SMEs, all friends of initiatives taken by our citizens and institutions, to promote the important concept of lifelong learning."
"I was not surprised but encouraged during the last Question Time when a colleague spoke of lifelong learning as a right of citizens, a right of an individual vis-à-vis the State or its authorities to have access to lifelong learning, not just to basic or secondary education."
"To implement such systems, we also need greater mental readiness."
"Thank you and let us work together on this."
"Question 48 was declared to be inadmissible (Annex II(A)(3) of the Rules of Procedure)."
"For one year, Turkey has issued a one-lira coin (worth EUR 0.60) that bears an incredible similarity to the two-euro coin."
"For example, the portrait of Kemal Atatürk displayed on the one-lira coin can easily by mistaken for King Albert II."
"Owners of vending machines in the EU have suffered considerable losses on account of the technical similarities between the coins in terms of weight and thickness."
"There are also problems concerning sorting machines in banks, not to mention ordinary citizens, who may not even be aware of the risk of confusion."
"How does the Commission view this latest move by Turkey?"
"To what extent is it permitted for a country to issue coins bearing such striking similarities to the euro?"
"What does the Commission intend to do to protect European citizens?"
". The question concerns Turkish coins issued from the beginning of 2005, which are quite similar to EU coins."
"Of course the Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member of Parliament about this issue."
"That sort of thing should not happen."
"The right to issue coins is one of the most fundamental sovereign rights of a country."
"However, informal consultations are recommended."
"There is a network called the Coin Registration Office, established by the International Mint Directors Conference."
"Member mints are assumed to have consulted the Coin Registration Office when preparing a new coin, so that similarities can be avoided."
"Obviously that was not done properly in this case, so coins have appeared which are similar to euro coins."
"That was not the first time such a thing has occurred."
"In 2000, in some countries, some coins were very similar to euro coins."
"Even in my own country, when I was in charge of that area, we issued coins which were similar to Deutschmarks and we therefore had to change our production."
"The Commission is working with the Turkish authorities and they have promised to modify their coins slightly."
"The production of coins is very expensive and a large exercise."
"However, there is no panic and the risks are very limited."
"The vending machines – which are the main issue – can be adjusted."
"Our estimation is that there are some old models of vending machines that are more difficult to adjust, but the majority of new ones can be properly adjusted so that they can take the correct coins."
"Visibly they are quite different."
"If these coins are handled in the retail trade, they can easily be distinguished."
"So the risks are limited."
"The Commission has also worked with manufacturers of the coin mechanisms to keep them informed that mechanisms must be adjusted to this problem."
"We are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure that the new production of coins will be slightly modified so that they will not be so similar to euro coins."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I do realise that there are no grounds for panic, as you say."
"Nevertheless, I should like to ask you whether it would perhaps be desirable to raise this issue as part of accession negotiations with Turkey, to ensure that such coins are taken out of circulation very quickly."
"After all, there is also the temptation for the Turkish parallel societies in Europe – in Germany or Austria, for example – to misuse these coins."
"Would it not be possible to speed up the process – even though, as you say, minting coins is very expensive – in order to reduce the harm to Europe and the European economy?"
". This must be negotiated in all frameworks, including the accession negotiation framework."
"There is some kind of gentleman’s agreement that this sort of thing should not happen."
"If it does, then the producers of smaller coins must make some adjustments so that the situation with the use of similar coins can be avoided."
"This will be negotiated."
"I will have an opportunity to meet the members of the Turkish Government soon, so I will definitely raise the issue within a certain time, because, as I say, the production of coins is a huge and very expensive exercise."
"In time we can solve this problem, but until then we will work with the producers of coin mechanisms to avoid possible damage."
"The Board of Governors of the European Schools has established the criteria to be used in deciding which language sections will be opened in the fourth Brussels European School in Laeken."
"The working party () chaired by the Secretary General of the Board of Governors has indicated in a number of official documents that the Italian section from the Brussels II school will be one of those proposed to the Council for transfer to the fourth school."
"No doubt this conclusion is the result of a comparative analysis that matched the criteria with the various language sections."
"Can the Commission give the details of this analysis?"
"If such an analysis was not carried out, can the Commission explain how this outcome was arrived at and, in particular, describe how the other language sections came to be excluded?"
"We are of course aware that at this stage no final decision has been taken, but it would nevertheless be useful to know in detail the procedure followed so far by the working party in order to ascertain whether it has been subject to sufficiently rigorous scientific criteria to justify proposals which could have extremely damaging effects on the families of hundreds of officials from the Community institutions."
"The Board of Governors of the European Schools is in the process of deciding on the language sections to be set up in the Brussels IV school at Laeken."
"One of the options submitted to the Board of Governors is to transfer the Woluwé Italian- and Dutch-language sections and the Ixelles German-language section to Laeken."
"Does the Commission realise that children from the Woluwé and Ixelles catchment areas will be sitting in school buses for a total of between three and four hours a day if they are transferred to Laeken?"
"What alternatives has the Commission considered to the enforced transfer of sections, and how would they be put into practice, or is it relying on the experience the Secretary-General and Board of Governors have had with such removals, which, because of the way in which they were carried out when the Ixelles school was opened, brought about an intolerable state of affairs?"
"Is the Commission prepared to disclose, and explain, the voting instructions given to its representative on the Board of Governors?"
". Questions 50 and 51 are quite similar but, if necessary, I will answer them separately, although the concept will be the same."
"I must begin by saying that the European Schools constitute one of the most complicated issues in my area of responsibility, and there are a lot of problems."
"The system is very independent and complicated."
"Governance of the system does not fall to the Commission, and in fact the Commission is just one member of the Board of Governors, which consists of 29 members."
"The rapid enlargement of the European Union has brought a lot of people to our locations – not only to Brussels – and we have a lot of problems regarding the lack of places needed for children in schools and other facilities."
"One solution, which is extremely necessary, would be to open a fourth Brussels school in Laeken in 2009."
"Why Laeken?"
"That decision was taken by the Belgian Government."
"Belgium is the host country and makes quite a significant contribution to the school infrastructure."
"All the infrastructure is provided by the host country."
"I have been in touch with the Belgian Government and ministers."
"President Barroso has taken this issue up with the Belgian Government to speed up this process, and 2009 is earlier than originally envisaged."
"Now it is a matter of deciding the school’s internal arrangements for the language sections: which language sections will be opened and which will be transferred."
"First, it is too early to say that anything has been decided."
"It is still under discussion and the Commission is only one part, and definitely not the dominant part, of these discussions."
"The Board of Governors will take the decisions."
"Of course, the Commission tries to provide input based on its experience and knowledge, and to participate in this process and secure the interests of parents of the European institutions as well as to ensure transparency and fair process."
"At its meeting on 25 and 26 October, the Board of Governors adopted a list of criteria on how to deal with the language sections."
"A working group, the , was established and the Secretary-General of the European School presented a preliminary document to this group."
"Again, the Commission is actively participating in this group, but we are only one partner."
"Finally, that must take all considerations into account and come up with a proper solution."
"Some preliminary solutions – options A and B – were discussed, but it is really too early to say that one solution is preferable to the other."
"That group is now discussing intermediate options which adopt the best parts of both solutions, which include one principle – supported by the Commission – that the children currently enrolled in one of the existing schools in any section should not be obliged to move to Laeken."
"That is probably a good idea for parents whose children already go to those schools."
"It is very difficult to imagine that the definitive solution will satisfy everybody, but we must find a solution which ensures that the pupils will get the best education."
"We are working with the Board of Governors and with the Dutch Government, which is presiding over the Board, about the reform of the European schools, because there are a lot of problems, including structural problems, and, obviously, this system must be modified."
"This is my conceptual answer and I cannot say today that we have prepared any hidden agendas or solution."
"We work with the very seriously and I can assure you that we take these issues very seriously, but it is a very difficult area and a lot of problems have accumulated, and now we have to find final, long-term solutions."
"We will work hard with the Belgian Government and the Brussels authorities to find some transitional solutions to solve short-term problems and shortages in all our facilities."
"That is the picture today."
"You are right, of course, Commissioner: Questions Nos 50 and 51 should be taken together, as the subjects are interconnected."
"There are also very large numbers of Members who are interested in this subject."
"First of all, however, I shall give the floor to the two authors for their supplementary questions."
"Mr Kallas, thank you for your reply."
"Since option B clearly seems better than option A from many points of view, I wonder whether you are now able to rule out the idea of the Commission raising a costs issue?"
"Specifically, can you say that the issue of a slight increase in costs will not lead the Commission to block the option which of the two appears to be by far the better?"
". Of course, the Commission is footing most of the bill of the European Schools and the problem of cost is also a serious issue."
"However, I would not focus primarily on that issue of cost; I would focus mainly on the working system and on providing the best possible education for pupils."
"In that regard, option B is not the best one."
"With regard to option B, which foresees having almost every section everywhere, there will be much fragmentation, with small groups and small classes, in which case we will be faced with the problem of ensuring good quality teaching and good quality education."
"Therefore, option B is not the best one."
"Yes, it is also much more expensive, but we in the Commission do not regard the cost issue as the first and most important issue."
"The most important issue involves securing the efficient functioning of the system of European Schools, and there are also many problems concerning the future quality of education."
"– Madam President, the Commissioner speaks of complicated procedures, a complicated situation."
"We are all aware of this, but the situation is further complicated if the Commission is not prepared to introduce greater transparency into its decision-making process."
"After all, the decisive meeting of the Board of Governors is coming up in mid-April."
"Why is the Commission not prepared to simply say, on the basis of its own criteria: this is how far we have come, these are the figures, and this is how far we can go?"
"If the Commissioner just perpetuates the obscurity, he cannot expect an improvement in satisfaction within the language sections."
". Thank you very much, but I do not share the opinion that we are not being transparent in this process."
"The whole process has been transparent for all parties and those options have been there."
"If you like, the Commission will be taking the greater initiative in preparing those options."
"Logically, however, a final consensus must be reached that involves the parents’ organisations, the schools themselves and the teaching staff."
"The Commission is providing its input and is most definitely considering all possible options put forward by other parties."
"We are trying to play a part in finding a final solution that is more or less acceptable to everybody."
"We have been transparent throughout this process and we are now thinking about some kind of compromise solution, an intermediate option between options A and B. So the process has been transparent and involves very complicated negotiations with all parties."
"Here the Commission is one negotiating partner and it also wants to respect the other parties, including the Belgian authorities, who have a substantial input to make."
"Mr Kallas, if option A, to which reference has been made of the two under consideration, namely the option that provides for a transfer of sections, were adopted, would there be a risk that many families would have their children in different schools?"
"Given that, from the data disseminated within the , it appears that the demographic increases in some sections, such as the Italian section, will be greater over the next few years than that of many other nationalities, is this not a factor that should lead the Commission to choose option B from among the alternatives cited?"
". The final decision will be taken by the Board of Governors."
"You mentioned that the children could end up attending different sites."
"I read in the basic concept papers about the criteria for this."
"The Commission’s opinion is that we should endeavour by all means to avoid that kind of thing."
"Children of the same family, siblings, must go to the same school."
"Option B has some tremendous weaknesses in terms of the future development of education."
"We do not share the view that option B is the best one, but intensive work will be done to find solutions that satisfy as many parties and parents as possible."
"Mr Kallas, I return to the same issue: criterion F, of those adopted in October, stipulates that if a section exists in more than one school then it must be located in schools on the outskirts and in central schools."
"I would like to make it even clearer: if option A put forward by the were chosen, the Italian section would be the only one to be penalised by being located in two schools on the outskirts: Uccle and Laeken."
"Do you not consider, Mr Kallas, that the aforesaid option A is discriminatory in respect of Italian pupils?"
"I ask you therefore to make an undertaking on this point, by rejecting option A and adopting option B."
". I will not say that we will support option B. I have not said that we will support option A either."
"We are trying to find a compromise solution. If you want me to say that I will give all appropriations to option B, I cannot."
"I must reiterate that the decision-makers are the Board of Governors, along with the working party – the – which includes parents and other interested parties."
"That is the process."
"With this kind of complicated question I always try to find some kind of compromise solution."
"That is probably also the case in this complicated area."
"The next meeting of the Board of Governors will take place at the end of April."
"All possible solutions and aspects will be discussed."
"Your question about the Italian section has been raised many times and others are also involved."
"We have tried to find a balanced solution and not to penalise anybody."
"Can the Commission provide information on the consequences for EU citizens of the enlargement to take in Bulgaria and Romania in the area of personal law and, in particular, for the rules governing adoption across what will become internal EU borders? Can it also state if existing adoptions will be guaranteed or will be subject to review?"
". I am deeply aware of the pending cases of international adoptions of Romanian children and the understandable anxiety surrounding this issue among the families who would like to give these children a new home."
"As part of the legislative reforms in preparation for acceding to the Union, and with the support of the European Parliament over the years, Romania recently adopted new legislation on child protection."
"According to this legislation, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, international adoption is a last resort, if a suitable in-country solution, ranging from smaller homes to foster care, cannot be found."
"Through this law, Romania has aligned itself with the legal provisions of the European Union in this area, as also embodied in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"The application of these provisions must be seen within the context of former abusive practices relating to international adoptions in Romania."
"As to the more precise legal aspects, it should furthermore be noted that there is currently no Community legislation in the field of international adoption."
"In fact, Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003, which provides for mutual recognition of judgments on parental responsibility, explicitly excludes adoption from its scope."
"This means basically that the in the area of child protection has been implemented in Romania and Bulgaria."
"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is taken as a foundation in both Romania and Bulgaria."
"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child does not distinguish between the internal and external borders of the European Union."
"This question is not the only one on the subject; there are also Questions Nos 55 and 56."
"If the honourable Members are in agreement, we can take these questions together."
"First of all, however, I should like to give the floor to the author of the question, Mr Medina Ortega, for a supplementary question."
"Madam President, I believe that the adaptation of Bulgarian and Romanian legislation to European rules represents progress, because, when it comes to adoptions, the most important thing is the protection of the child."
"Unfortunately, however, we know that in these countries, as in others, there are children who are not living in comfortable family situations, and we have families here in the European Union who would be prepared to take on a parental role with every kind of guarantee."
"I know that there is no European legislation on this issue, but there is the possibility of the European Union mediating, in some way, with the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in order to guarantee that European Union families who are prepared to take this kind of action do so under the best possible conditions and in order thereby to facilitate adoption by European Union families, when necessary."
"I would like to know whether you believe that there is any possibility of action on the part of the Commission in this area."
". We are working together with the Romanian Government in a very consistent manner."
"We recognise that it has revised its legislation and that, on the basis of that legislation, an expert group is reviewing the pending cases."
"That expert group should finalise its work in the course of this month."
"We are in regular contact with the Romanian authorities on this issue."
"Our view is that as long as they respect the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and European legislation, then it is up to the Romanian Government and authorities to look for a solution."
"As regards the situation in the childcare sector, it is our understanding, on the basis of the very detailed progress reports, that it has improved on the ground, not least because the European Union has provided substantial support for the restructuring of the childcare sector, accounting for around EUR 160 million in the last 15 years."
"In overall terms, the screening process of applications for inter-country adoptions registered before the entry into force of the new legislation is expected to be completed this month."
"We expect that the Romanian authorities will inform all the applicants individually."
"Mr Rehn, you have already partly answered my question, which deals with the problem of pending adoption cases; on the basis of calls made by the European Parliament in various resolutions, a group of experts has been set up to examine the suspended cases on an individual basis."
"I would like to know if there is any news available on the timetable with which the requests are being dealt with and thus if we will have information on the results of the work achieved to date by this group."
"We are in regular contact with the Romanian authorities, and as a response to the honourable Member I would say that the Romanian authorities are on track concerning the solution of pending petitions for adoption, filed before entry into force of the new law on 1 January 2005."
"The Romanian authorities have established a working party which should finalise its work on 31 March, and the Commission is committed to a close follow-up on this issue."
"We will report to the Council and Parliament on this issue in our comprehensive monitoring report which will be adopted, as scheduled, on 16 May."
"Concerning the other elements of your question, the 82 000 children currently under social protection, residential care, foster care or placement in enlarged families are benefiting from a child protection structure in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and this is also the case for access to health care and education."
"In light of the Commission’s Comprehensive Monitoring Report on the readiness of Romania to accede to the European Union in 2007, which notes the Commission’s concerns relating to Romania’s lack of progress in certain areas in the field of child protection, as well as in the disabled and mental health care system, could the Commission specify how much weight it attaches to these issues in its ongoing negotiations with the Romanian authorities?"
"Furthermore, does the Commission feel that sufficient progress has been made and will continue to be made to allow Romania to accede to the European Union in 2007?"
". I have partly responded to this question, so I will cover only those parts which have not yet been covered."
"First of all, in addition to a general evaluation of child protection and the situation of the disabled and mental healthcare system in Romania, we have organised a peer review on mental health in order to assess the situation on the ground."
"The expert report resulting from this peer review is awaited."
"We are conducting a total of 15 expert reviews, or peer reviews, both in Bulgaria and Romania, on a number of critical issues, and this is one of the essential areas in which we are conducting this peer review, which is done by both Commission officials and the best Member State experts in this field."
"Concerning care for disabled people, the main focus is now on developing an inclusive strategy that aims at closing and restructuring large residential institutions by developing alternative community-based services, support for families and smaller residential units."
"We provide, for instance, up to EUR 15 million."
"Moreover, a public awareness campaign is ongoing in Romania in order to raise awareness on rights of people with disabilities."
"Although reform in this sector is still very much in its early stage, from the point of view of the Commission we estimate that the country is now on the right track in this regard."
"Finally, the persistent problem of ill treatment in psychiatric hospitals in Romania needs to be addressed immediately."
"This was stressed in our comprehensive monitoring report of October, and the significant deficits in living and care conditions in some establishments need to be tackled."
"We have strongly advised the Romanian authorities to make mental health a priority area and devote sufficient resources for this purpose."
"The Romanian authorities are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the current PHARE assistance and draft a strategy and action plan for the mental health reform."
"Of course, the key is implementation."
"The feasibility of the practical arrangements made should be demonstrated, for instance through allocating sufficient financial resources."
"This is what the peer review will look at and this will be part of the progress report in May 2006."
"– Commissioner, could you address the issue of caged beds in Romania?"
"When we talk about issues of concern, it is a valid question that you might take up."
"We have huge concerns about that."
"In terms of the peer review, which I welcome, will it involve going in without notifying institutions of visits?"
"I believe that is crucial."
"Have you any estimate – at Commission level – of how long it will take Romania to tackle what is a huge problem for the country?"
"Are you convinced that should Romania accede next year, it will continue on that path towards reform?"
"I believe that it is only by pressure that we will make progress."
"I should like to ask, when we talk about children who are abandoned in maternity hospitals and the issue of inter-country adoption, that we put the child at the centre of this issue, rather than any other concerns."
". I am ready to provide further details of the peer review if needed."
"They normally carry out both previously agreed and on-the-spot missions with visits to different kinds of establishments in different fields, ranging from the rule of law – i.e. the court system and prosecutors’ offices – to the field of childcare and mental health."
"They carry out the same kind of actions."
"How long does it take in this field?"
"That is a very relative concept."
"Our concern is that there has to be a credible track record which shows that Romania is genuinely on the right track."
"This will be the focus of our peer review."
"You touched on the crux of this whole issue: childcare must be at the centre of our evaluation and this is what we are aiming to do when we conduct and present the results of the peer review."
"In this context we have also studied the suspicion about the use of caged beds in Romania."
"I can assure you that during the Commission’s 15 years of follow-up we have never had any suspicion proven about the use of caged beds in Romania."
"The Commission will follow the issue up within the framework of our regular contacts with various non-governmental organisations."
"– Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and to say that we all agree that we need to help Romania improve the conditions and protection of children and to improve healthcare."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission can channel more Community resources within the framework of 'twinning projects' in order to improve healthcare, protect children and improve conditions in mental hospitals."
"I should also like to ask if the European Commission can cooperate with the World Health Organisation and with other international organisations in the health sector to improve the situation in Romania."
". We have twinning structures with Romania in a number of fields relating to the reform public administration in Romania."
"We have found that for Eastern and Central Europe – the so-called new Member States, as well as the future Member State of Romania – twinning has been one of the most effective arrangements for disseminating knowledge."
"Yes, we intend to consider twinning also in this field more and more in the future."
"It is a very useful practice and the Phare framework programme provides for it."
"We have to study it more carefully to see what practical arrangements can be made."
"Commissioner, if you really have not seen the evidence of the caged beds in Romania, I refer you to the front page story of a recent edition of the London and to the well-documented cases published by the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre."
"I hope that you will say to Romania, as indeed to the other countries that have engaged in this barbaric practice, that caged beds are inappropriate for children, the confused elderly or for people with mental health problems in any civilised country, and certainly in a Member State of this European Union."
". I have already responded on the basis of a very careful assessment by the Commission."
"As I said, we have never had any proof about the use of caged beds in Romania but, if you have some concrete evidence in this regard, I am willing to study it and I will ask my civil servants to take another look at it and we can then raise the matter with Romania if need be."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report (A6-0028/2006) by Mrs Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social protection and social inclusion (2005/2097(INI))."
". Mr President, at midday today, President Horst Köhler stated that many people fail to understand present-day Europe."
"If somebody sees the enormous amounts of energy that Europe has been investing in the reformulation of its migration policy, I am convinced that they would find the problem of child poverty in Europe incomprehensible."
"While we talk about the lack of highly trained migrants, we register unavoidable and huge losses as a result of child poverty, losses that future generations will rightly call us to account for."
"Therefore, it is not a mere coincidence that the report on social protection and social inclusion tabled before you focuses mainly on child poverty, because while 15% of European citizens are at risk of poverty, this figure is 19% in the case of children, and based on 2004 data, in 12 of the 25 member states the risk of child poverty is at least 25% higher than in the adult population."
"I would like to emphasise that this is not an emotional or perhaps a legal issue, because the International Convention on the Rights of the Child contains binding clauses in this respect."
"Europe is also faced with the problem that in the following decades, as a result of the population growth crisis and the aging of society, it will need fifty million new migrants in order to maintain current employment levels."
"Child poverty, the exclusion that accompanies it and the high rate of early school-leaving cast a doubt on the possibility of developing a knowledge-based society without leaving social strata further and further behind."
"The Commission is right to treat the issue of child poverty with priority, but on the other hand we find that we do not have accurate data, that there are no comparable data concerning child poverty."
"It is obvious that this situation must be rectified urgently."
"In my report I would have liked to emphasise that social inclusion represents added value to the Lisbon process."
"European social policy requires a new solidarity between generations, because the damage caused to the human resources of the future by child poverty and the related undereducation should not be underestimated."
"I could obviously mention many other problems presented in the report, but as time is short I shall only mention one more, namely the displacement of older work force from the labour market."
"Although there is an anti-discrimination directive in place in this area, discrimination still exists, but it is more difficult to track."
"I am convinced that the Commission chose the right direction when it set clear and traceable objectives for the modernisation of social protection."
"And last, but not least, I would like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their excellent cooperation, and to express my thanks for the amendment proposal of my colleagues."
"And not least, I would also like to thank them for being here and participating in the debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, for her report, and I am delighted that I can report complete agreement between yourselves and the Commission regarding the fact that the Lisbon Strategy is based on the positive combined operation of economic policy, employment policy and social policy."
"I appreciate the backing expressed in the report for the Commission’s initiative aimed at modernising and making more effective the open method of coordination for the areas of social protection and social inclusion."
"The question is one of how to contribute more through social policy to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, while at the same time strengthening the coordination of these policies."
"Contributing more through the Lisbon Strategy process of social coordination involves developing active functions of social protection and demonstrating added value on the basis of the jobs and growth created."
"From a practical viewpoint, both the new common goals for the open method of coordination and the partial thematic goals just adopted by the Council will be carried across into national strategies."
"The new national bodies will first of all present a strategic approach for every Member State regarding the modernisation of their policy in specific areas."
"The Member States will then present the three thematic plans: social inclusion, pensions and health care."
"The Commission has also adopted a communication that initiates a public consultation on possible targeted measures at a Union level relating to adjustments in minimum wages and the inclusion of persons excluded from the labour market."
"The consultation also includes the European Parliament and other organisations, of course, but in view of the theme under discussion it will be extended to public bodies at all levels, as well as to organisations, interest groups and social partners."
"Your report also ushers in the possibility of new inter-institutional agreements which would cement the role of Parliament in implementing the open method of coordination."
"It is true that the participation of Parliament in work within the context of open coordination remains limited by the fact that there is no overall statutory framework in place."
"For my part, I can assure Members that I am backing the efforts of officials in my departments to pursue further dialogue with Parliament."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the report by Mrs Bauer, which we have debated in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunity and which we support."
"The report presents its aims from the perspective of an equal position for men and women, outlining the needs of women especially in the area of social inclusion."
"I would like, however, to discuss not only women but also the ways in which poverty and social exclusion affect children and young people."
"Let us not forget how our attitudes to poverty in developed countries have changed compared to the past, in an environment where the display of wealth and prosperity has led to a lower living standard coming to be regarded as something diminishing."
"I would go so far as to say that it is viewed as a humiliating and abnormal state, which people can sort out by themselves."
"What I mean by this is that the media and advertisers present a picture of overwhelming affluence, and people who do not achieve this suffer from feelings of helplessness."
"Success and the material abundance that comes with it are apparently open to all, so that those who do not achieve it are excluded from the advantages that society has to offer."
"This exclusion does not relate only to material factors but also to education, health or security in old age, and is passed on from generation to generation."
"Children from constrained social environments have difficulty securing access to higher education, travel less and have lower living standards."
"Poverty is of course not as drastic here as it is in developing world countries, but even so, in the way that it is concealed through shame and statistically under-reported, it leads to feelings of exclusion from the normal world, and to a sense that something that is normal and everyday is at the same time unattainable."
"Why should this be so?"
"How do we explain to a child that, in contrast to others, they must do without various things?"
"It is true that social differences have always existed and have determined children’s development over their entire lives. Never, however, has abundance been taken for granted as the norm to such an extent, and the lack of financial means has not excluded people from as many opportunities as it does today."
"This is the paradox of developed societies."
"A decent standard of living is more widely available than before, but so much the worse for those who, for various reasons, do not achieve it."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that this is not a matter merely of material effects, but also of inadequate social protection, above all in the case of children and young people, and this has both moral and personal safety consequences for the future of society, since social injustice leads to tension, which as we see all around us, can explode in the form of violence or can lead to a withdrawal from reality through drugs or escapist entertainment."
"I do not undervalue charitable works, but it remains the case that social protection and social inclusion must be incorporated into a system, and people must be entitled to use it."
"Charity is a gift and in modern societies that defend the dignity of man it should be a matter of extreme resort, which cannot replace a good social policy that corresponds to the needs of Europe in the 21st century."
"– Mr President, the first joint report by the European Commission on social protection and social inclusion is already an old text which was written in January 2005 and which needs to be examined together both with the conclusions of the Presidency of the European Council and the interim report on the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Bauer report is a carefully constructed text and for that I congratulate its rapporteur."
"It is divided methodically and presents all aspects of the urgent need for the central objective of the Lisbon Strategy to continue to be a drastic reduction in poverty and social exclusion by 2010."
"The two rounds of the open method of coordination on social integration at the level of the 15 and, since 2004, the 25 Member States have demonstrated that the rationalisation of the open method of coordination needs to be safeguarded in social protection and in social integration."
"Certainly, economic growth and increased employment are the means by which higher levels of social cohesion will be achieved, in conjunction with effective systems of education and training."
"From this point of view, the Bauer reports reminds us that measures need to be taken which aim to prevent early departure from education and training and help students who graduate with poor qualifications in particular to move into school and the job market."
"Particular mention is made of investment in education and lifelong learning, in that participation is stagnant, which is why private initiative is also called on to participate in this."
"It is a very strong means of combating poverty and social exclusion."
"Attention also needs to be paid to eliminating child poverty and that is why the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, quite rightly emphasises that the intergenerational inheritance of poverty needs to be addressed by speeding up the Commission's work with a Children's Charter, the objective of which will be to uphold their rights."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla, and Mrs Bauer, for the report and for the initiative regarding social protection and inclusion."
"That we have close to 70 million people living at risk in the European Union is a shameful statistic and is not acceptable."
"Poverty is a result of the actions of human beings and it can be resolved by the actions of intelligent human beings."
"We know what solves poverty, yet our economic system continues to reproduce misery for tens of millions of people and, as has been pointed out, continues from generation to generation."
"We do so because we fail at national level to integrate the various economic, social, cultural and environmental policies that we pursue."
"We fail to mainstream the solutions that various boards and reports have identified."
"One of the single most important solutions is not, as is often argued, a job; it is actually education: education from pre-school, certainly primary education, and at a minimum through to secondary education."
"Employment obviously plays a key role, but it must be remarked that too many of our homeless, and indeed our poor, actually have a job."
"It is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty."
"I would argue as well that social protection has to be seen as broader than simply social security."
"Our public services should be seen as mechanisms for social protection."
"Health services, education services, transport and cultural services not only help to protect those who are at risk of poverty, but also keep tens if not hundreds of millions out of poverty by their very existence."
"If they did not exist there would be many more millions of people on the breadline."
"I would argue too that the notion that social security is simply a safety net needs to be avoided and that in reforming our social security systems we have to give particular attention to eliminating poverty traps."
". Mr President, esteemed Chairman, colleagues, the elimination of poverty and social exclusion is one of the European Union’s strategic priorities."
"The Lisbon Strategy’s interim report was critical of the Member States’ actions, or rather inaction."
"15% of the population of Europe, or 68 million people, a third of whom are children, live in poverty."
"Disparities between the wages of men and women are on average 20% to the disadvantage of women."
"Poverty naturally breeds poverty."
"Social equilibrium serves the interests of the whole of society."
"Personal failure is not the main reason why people fall into poverty."
"Social inclusion, taking every policy into consideration, and an end to the wasting of human capital would provide a direct stimulus for the progress that we wish to achieve through the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is also emphasised by the report presently under discussion."
"Europe must get its house in order once again."
"The Scandinavian countries are a good example of this."
"These countries have economies that are without doubt within the top ten in the world, and at the same time have the most effective social protection systems."
"I would like to emphasise particularly the call made in the report to begin negotiations for the selection of policy areas in which the Open Method of Coordination will be applied."
"Europe must consider that if we now have 38 non-working pensioners for every hundred workers, this may double in the coming decade unless a change in employment policy is implemented."
"This problem must be dealt with today, however."
"Lifelong learning and the raising of employment among older people are crucial objectives."
"The legislation of several Member States unfortunately contains provisions that promote age discrimination in the labour market."
"Such practices should be eradicated from the European judicial area."
"In addition to other risk groups, the greatest danger of exclusion is among over women over 50, and this becomes more severe in retirement."
"The fact that the report devotes great attention to this is very welcome."
"It calls on Member States to ensure that when their pension is calculated, women are not punished for gaps in their employment history arising from parental or childcare leave."
"A part of the report I consider essential is the appeal to all Member States – especially the new ones – to review their solidary pension systems, taking into consideration men’s shorter life expectancy and the great wage differences between the sexes, which are reflected in the size of the pensions earned by widowed pensioners, and often push them below the poverty line."
"I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her expert work, and I hope that the principles set down in this document will soon be implemented in the legislative practice of the Member States."
". – Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Bauer for the work she has done on this excellent report, and the Commission for its initial document."
"One of the points that comes through from the report is that there is multiple deprivation often linked to discrimination; that if you look at some of the groups that are particularly affected – women, as we have just heard, people with disabilities, those from black and minority ethnic groups and those both older and younger – you can see why the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination are so important and why they need to be implemented as fully as possible."
"The concentration on child poverty is welcome."
"We know that there are links between poor nutrition, poor housing, a poor environment – the poor often live in the worst environments – and poor educational prospects, which then follow through people’s lives and indeed those of their children."
"I welcome the call for a Green Paper on child poverty."
"We need to look at that in the context of social cohesion overall, because it has implications for the gap between rich and poor."
"Mr De Rossa mentioned the difficulties about education and employment."
"The real cause of poverty is not having enough cash."
"You cannot simply rely on a trickle down from growth in the economy."
"You have to take specific action to address those at the bottom."
"Take the example of the UK, which comes out quite high in terms of risk of poverty."
"Despite the number of efforts made by our government at the moment, you see that the share of the poorest 10% in the population’s net income is 2.8%, while that of the richest 10% is 28%: ten times as much."
"You can see it in my own region, inner London, the richest area in the European Union, which also has tremendous levels of poverty."
"We need to change those percentages and increase that of those at the bottom."
"I agree about the importance of public services and the role that social security has to play within this."
"Member States should be looking at whether their social security systems operate to allow people to go through training and to take up educational possibilities, or whether they in fact constrict them because these people have to be ready for work at any moment."
"I would also echo the comments made about the open method of coordination and the role that the European Parliament should be playing in this, not least in reviewing the national action plans and their outcomes."
". – Mention has already been made in this debate of the high levels of poverty and social exclusion, which affects over 70 million people in the EU."
"As the report says, in 14 of the 17 Member States for which figures are available, child poverty increased in the 1990s."
"The current trend is for the situation to worsen, with higher levels of unemployment, increased precarious and poorly-paid work, flexibility, the privatisation of core sectors and services."
"Given that poverty is a violation of human rights, greater attention must be paid to its causes. Accordingly, the necessary measures must be taken to promote social inclusion, as viewed from a multidisciplinary perspective."
"Hence the proposals that we tabled, aimed at changing macroeconomic policies and at moving social inclusion, employment with rights, public health, education, and access to justice, culture and decent housing to the top of the political agenda."
"We therefore advocate replacing the Stability and Growth Pact with a genuine development and progress pact, and the Lisbon Strategy with a proper economic and social cohesion strategy. In turn, we believe that the accent should not be placed on the proposal for a directive on the creation of the internal market for services."
"Experience has taught us that the open coordination method provided for in the Lisbon Strategy has not reduced poverty."
"As a result of the Lisbon Strategy, the priorities have been liberalisation and privatisation of public sectors and services, which have served to exacerbate poverty and hinder social inclusion."
"Given that these measures were mandatory, the open coordination method did not force any Member State to reduce poverty, and that is the difference with this hypocritical process."
"Public policies are crucial to reducing poverty and to guaranteeing human rights, hence the need for, on the one hand, a universal public social security policy that is marked by solidarity, and, on the other, for the privatisation of health systems to be rejected, as we have proposed."
"Similarly, the State has a vital role in guaranteeing high-quality public education and labour rights that do not infringe the dignity of the workers."
"Consequently, we insist that it is not enough simply to regret poverty."
"The neoliberal policies at the root of the increased number of people at risk of falling into poverty must be reversed. This is the challenge that we put to the Chamber, in the hope that this will not be simply yet another toothless debate."
". In paragraph 37 of Parliament’s report, which taken as a whole is to be welcomed, we read the conclusion that the rapid change arising from globalisation and the wide use of information and communication technologies increases people’s vulnerability to social risk."
"Globalisation and information and communication technologies are assessed as risks."
"In my view, it is a society in which the rapid change arising from globalisation is not accompanied by the wide use of information and communication technologies that is under threat."
"Threats arise when the benefits of change are regarded as risks."
"The wide use of information and communication technologies increases people’s educational and training opportunities, and also their opportunities to join the employment market, especially for the most socially vulnerable groups such as the disabled."
"With the help of e-government, social groups or individuals can be directly involved in social dialogue with national government."
"For this reason, too, in social policy we ought to emphasise those measures that help people to make use of these opportunities."
"Welfare society and information society development policies ought to be coordinated."
"Let us leave fears about the rapid spread of information technology to the dictators of North Korea and Belarus."
"Mr President, it is regrettable that according to the latest statistics, the increase in the number of billionaires in the world has not been mirrored by an increase in the wealth of all citizens."
"The opposite is the case."
"The number of people living in poverty is constantly increasing in the countries of both the old and the new Union."
"Clearly, poverty, lack of social protection and the necessary social inclusion are problems experienced more acutely in the new Member States."
"In Poland, for example, we have a paradoxical situation."
"A former Socialist state is now providing less protection for its citizens than states that have always been capitalist."
"To the social problems of the countries of the old Fifteen we add our own specific ones, such as high unemployment amongst well-educated young people or the lack of access to general medical care."
"Commissioner, the Union is often criticised for a surfeit of regulations, but it seems to me that it lacks a particularly important one."
"The Union should oblige Member States to set a social minimum."
"This would enable all citizens to feel safe."
"In addition, it would promote social inclusion by lowering the level of fear about survival."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that today’s debate on the subject of social protection and social inclusion is highly pertinent, since although there was a 3% decline in the level of relative poverty in the years 1995–2000, the level of 15% is undoubtedly alarming."
"I fear that, in view of the numbers and the current situation, it will not be possible to eliminate poverty and the social exclusion it produces by 2010."
"These phenomena are the result of structural changes that accompany the social and economic development of our society."
"There are changes on the labour market, technological changes in society, demographic changes, ethnic diversity, changes in the make-up of households and the redefinition of the roles of men and women."
"Assistance must therefore be aimed primarily at the groups most under threat, the unemployed, single-parent families, the elderly, those living alone, families with a number of dependents, ethnic minorities and disabled people."
"The fact that poverty often has an impact on children too is in my view extremely sad and alarming."
"Of all the key political priorities for solving issues of poverty and social exclusion, I would emphasise education."
"The issue is to ensure the right level of education, a smooth transition from educational institutions to the workplace and the integration of disadvantaged groups into the education system through the use of e-learning."
"Education is not just school, it is a targeted system of lifelong learning."
"The fulfilment of these and other priorities requires financial resources, however."
"The new Member States in particular are not able to make sufficient use of the financial instrument for this area, which is the European Social Fund."
"I therefore call on the new Member States, especially the Czech Republic, to do as much as they can to ease the bureaucratic burden on applicants in respect of the recently drafted programme documents for the period 2007–2013."
"I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Bauer for a fine report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, pension policy, poverty reduction, and health and long-term care are key tasks for us and key issues for all citizens of the EU."
"Parliament must therefore considerably increase its involvement in open coordination in all aspects of social protection and social inclusion."
"The current procedure is totally unacceptable."
"The state of affairs we are discussing today is already outdated."
"The Council has already discussed the Commission’s follow-up communication."
"For this reason, an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed."
"The Commissioner has said today that he is committed to a dialogue with Parliament."
"I am most obliged to him for this, but we do not want just a relaxed dialogue; what we really want is the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement laying down crystal-clear rules."
"Furthermore, in future, the issues of the reconciliation of professional and family life should increasingly be dealt with, and particular attention paid to childcare, within the framework of the open method of coordination in the field of social protection."
"Mr President, increasing globalisation leads to restructuring of both enterprises and the labour market."
"Another consequence of globalisation is the emphasis on the international level, not just the local and national."
"There is a growing tendency for large enterprises to force small and medium-sized ones off the market, with a significant impact on the livelihood of the local communities."
"The nature of restructuring varies from region to region."
"In the old Member States it raises concerns about job losses, and in the new Member States the concerns are about stopping production and wholesale redundancies."
"In the new Member States the labour market has been hard hit by the development of hypermarkets and supermarkets, especially those built in town centres and on large housing estates."
"These large shopping centres have wrecked the livelihoods of small traders and service providers in the immediate area, many of whom have been forced to close down."
"For every job created in a hypermarket, five to eight are lost in the surrounding area."
"Investors often fail to take the human factor into account, or the individual’s natural environment and historic legacy."
"Mrs Bauer was very right to identify this issue in her report."
"To sum up, the primary victims of restructured workplaces are their workers and suppliers, including agricultural producers."
"Help and support must be provided to these groups of people."
"They should be offered the opportunity to find new jobs, new professions or new markets for their products."
"I believe that the most socially committed country is one that creates the conditions for high-quality jobs and ensures equal opportunities for its people."
"And high-quality jobs can be ensured through investment in human capital, lifelong learning, the encouragement of flexibility in the labour market and through legislation that favours the economy."
"Citizens need favourable external circumstances in order to do their work and be creative, as well as to satisfy their basic needs."
"It is a different story, however, for at-risk groups such as the elderly or young people without working experience, the sick, disabled persons and single mothers or families with several children."
"All these groups need our attention and help if they are to be socially protected and not excluded from society."
"However, I cannot understand the Council’s decision, in the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, to reduce the funds earmarked for education and grants for young people, an area where relatively modest funds can be used to make a significant impact in education, the study of foreign languages, the development of international links and attitudes towards the European Union."
"We are striving for these values in almost all of our documents."
"While we continue in the European Union to adopt concrete measures that are specifically at odds with our words and our understanding, we cannot arrive more rapidly at the goals we have set."
"Perhaps never before in human history time has passed by as quickly as it passes today, and there is nothing to indicate that this tempo will slow down."
"For this reason we also need rapid and simple solutions in adapting to these changes, in order to achieve greater economic growth and better social protection for at-risk groups in the population."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a Social Democrat I believe that work is the only source of wealth, and yet labour is losing its position to machines – in other words, capital – as a factor in production."
"Many pensioners in the old Member States enjoy a comfortable retirement, because the governments of these countries have legislated so that the workers are required to support them at a certain level, while many people who make do with a low wage when they are working in the benefit of society are in danger of falling below the poverty line once they reach retirement."
"In all too many of the Member States, pension systems are basically pyramid systems."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the last to join the system – the young – will no longer be able to find the people who are supposed to support them later with their wages."
"Their work, wages and financial liabilities do not make it possible to have children or save money."
"I commend Mrs Bauer’s report, but pension problems cannot be solved with a single report."
"We can, however, take steps today to secure the future."
"Both state and private sector pension schemes must contain tangible money, and not be based on promises alone."
"Estonia’s transition to a funded pension system has been successful."
"Europe’s competitiveness and sustainability would benefit greatly if the old Member States were able to replicate that success."
"I hope that our parliament will soon return to the topic of pension schemes."
"– Mr President, The real challenge for the European Union is to provide an opportunity for breaking out of the vicious circle of social exclusion."
"It is unacceptable that 15% of European citizens, approximately 68 million people, live with the awareness of the risk of poverty, as described in the European Commission report released on 27 January, 2005."
"It is unacceptable that social exclusion affects the most vulnerable social groups, women and ethnic minorities."
"These are the groups that suffer disadvantages in obtaining and maintaining a job, the wages received, welfare, healthcare, education and access to cultural assets."
"The report states that in Hungary the percentage of those threatened by poverty is lower than the European Union average, that it is under 10%, similar to the figures in the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark and Slovenia."
"However, in the Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, Greece and Portugal this figure is 20%."
"Commissioner Vladimir Spidla emphasised in his speech that during their lifetime, women spend four times more time caring for others than men."
"When we acknowledge the social value of this fact, we will be providing a real opportunity for bridging the gap."
"The poor and the vulnerable groups of society can only break out of the vicious circle of social exclusion if we create work opportunities for them, if we ensure a market-oriented training for them."
"Finding work means having an income, which facilitates social integration and improves the financial situation of the individual."
"This is the real challenge, let us meet it!"
"I propose that the report be accepted."
"– I would like to thank Mrs Bauer for her skilfully prepared report."
"However, it would be better if we could see a system, showing which priorities need our attention first."
"In my opinion, the most important priority is the child, as he/she is the beginning, and an adult is only the consequence of the upbringing of that child."
"If children do not attend school, they will not have jobs to go to."
"If children are constantly hungry, they will begin to beg and even steal."
"If children experience violence or are sexually abused, once grown up, they will become violent themselves."
"If children have no parents or are separated from them, then the street will be their home."
"All the cases mentioned are a splendid pretext for the criminal world to give refuge to such children and to bring them up to be offenders."
"Such children will not enter the job market, as they can only do those things which are unsuitable for the job market."
"Therefore, the basic priority ought to be the eradication of the causes which make children unsuitable for the job market."
"If we fail to eradicate the causes, then the other measures named in the report will only be a battle with the consequences."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the high standard of this debate and of the proposals submitted by Members, and I would like again to confirm my willingness to work alongside you towards fulfilling the aims of the Union and fulfilling the role given to us by the citizens of Europe."
"I can assure you that the Commission is contributing determinedly to further raising the profile of the social dimension in the Lisbon Strategy."
"I would like to suggest to you some ideas for our work in the future."
"We must first raise the profile of European coordination."
"We have managed to develop a balanced approach, which places emphasis on the need to combine social aims with financial targets."
"This is a great achievement and it is fundamental to reinforcing the faith of citizens in the reforms."
"We must enhance the partnership between the Member States and the Union."
"The European strategy for growth and employment and the social agenda do not belong to the Commission or to the European bodies."
"They are based on the obligation of all participants, Member States, European citizens, parliaments, social partners and interest groups as well as all the institutions and organs of the Community."
"Success in this partnership will require a clear separation of roles."
"The Member States will implement the intra-state level reforms and the structural policies approved within the framework of the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"The Union will continue to support reform efforts and will at the same time make use of all new instruments, assistance from the Structural Funds, respect for fundamental rights, support for social dialogue and the establishment of proven approaches."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0058/2006) by Mr Grech, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure – Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII(A) and VIII(B) and on the European Parliament’s preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2007 budget procedure"
"Section I – European Parliament"
"Section II – Council"
"Section IV – Court of Justice"
"Section V – Court of Auditors"
"Section VI – European Economic and Social Committee"
"Section VII – Committee of the Regions"
"Section VIII(A) – European Ombudsman"
"Section VIII(B) – European Data Protection Supervisor (2006/2021 (BUD))."
". Mr President, the report which I have presented for Parliament’s consideration and approval outlines the main guidelines for the 2007 budget pertaining to other institutions."
"The main part of my report, however, is dedicated to Parliament’s budget."
"The report places major emphasis on the need to consolidate what has been successfully achieved in these last few years."
"No major projects are being contemplated for 2007, which should provide us with enough time to carry out an in-depth stocktaking exercise and enable us to examine and evaluate critically and objectively what needs to be done in the coming years."
"In a framework of budgetary constraint, we need to implement budgetary rigour in all ongoing activities, ensuring added value for taxpayers’ money."
"I wish to stress the importance of the application of activity-based budgeting, which would result in more rational and analytical estimates."
"Moreover, appropriations should relate to specific activities."
"This would help to avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year."
"The institutions have to base their estimates on well-defined needs, avoiding duplication of functions, focusing on core operations and eliminating malpractice and all bottlenecks."
"In this respect, the institutions are invited to make better use of their resources, leading to more interinstitutional cooperation, which should be conducive to more efficiency and hopefully more savings."
"It is reasonable to assume that some administrative tasks could be shared amongst the institutions, without the latter losing their independence."
"This could create economies of scale and increase the effectiveness of services."
"Another key issue in the report relates to information policy, which addresses Parliament’s objective of bringing Europe and its institutions closer to its citizens."
"In order to improve the perception that the citizens have of the Union, the implementation of an effective, strong information strategy is crucial."
"Having said that, however, I still contend that in any information project particular attention should be given to the extent of participation and cooperation of political groups, the pluralism of opinion, the value of its contents and its cost structure."
"In the final analysis, the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on EU citizens."
"In terms of staffing, keeping in mind the exceptionally strong recruitment exercise which took place in the last three years and the Streamline software system, which should be in place by the end of the year, it would be justified to assume that with the exception of enlargement and an extremely limited recruitment of specialised staff, no new employment should take place in 2007, which would result in real economies in the future."
"In my report I also addressed a number of additional priorities for 2007, relating mainly to buildings policy, enlargement, assistance to Members, a statute for Members’ assistants, and training."
"Regrettably, in view of time constraints, I will be unable to deal with all those topics in any detail."
"It is unfortunate that this budgetary procedure starts in a context of uncertainty, due to the absence of a new interinstitutional agreement."
"Understandably, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives but not at any cost."
"We cannot and should not pay lip service to high-flown buzzwords such as ‘growth’, ‘employment’, ‘research’, ‘social solidarity’ and ‘enlargement’ and at the same time not provide the funds or flexibility to achieve them."
"In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is."
"Moreover, and under these circumstances, it would be advisable, at least at this stage, to work on the assumption that we will be retaining the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of Category 5 expenditure."
"Having said that, however, we know that the self-imposed ceiling is not an irrefutable and fixed law."
"In future we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are truly convinced that it makes more financial and budgetary sense to do so."
"In conclusion, I trust the various guidelines highlighted in this report, if effectively adopted, will improve the efficiency, quality, performance and transparency of the European institutions, offering more added value to the European citizens and hopefully more added value to the institutions’ credibility."
". Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Grech, for his excellent proposal and the agreeable levels of cooperation we were able to achieve during discussion of the report."
"Mr President, Parliament’s budget has to be dealt with effectively, responsibly and credibly."
"This is conditional on several factors."
"Firstly, we have to stop talking about an annual 20% increase or ceiling."
"We should be talking about and implementing only a budget based on actual needs."
"We must always consider our accountability to the taxpayer."
"This will cultivate the credibility expected of Parliament."
"One important example of this is information policy."
"We should not embark on ambitious projects, such as our own television channels, but instead we should always ensure that the political groups are actively involved in all of Parliament’s fields of information."
"We must also plan all the information we give out well beforehand in order to determine the costs of projects and the personnel needs involved."
"The best example of the provision of information is visitor groups, and now we must really make haste to ensure that the EUR 5 million which was decided on last year is made use of as quickly as possible."
"I would furthermore like to mention one amendment connected with Parliament’s day nursery."
"This perhaps does not sound like a very politically important issue, but the issue of how we treat employees with children is very important from the point of view of the status of Parliament as an employer."
"This is a question of equality more than anything else, and we cannot punish single parents and women who have children and who wish to work in Parliament."
"For this reason, a nursery should be maintained as close to Parliament and public transport services as possible."
"The proposal that has just been made to stop using the Eastman Nursery is obviously very alarming, and I hope that agreement can be reached on adopting this amendment."
". – Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Grech for his hard work and the excellent report he has produced on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure."
"I really hope, as the report suggests, that the institutions can submit realistic requests based on budgetary rigour in the light of the current tight financial situation."
"Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that in all the institutions we can work more cost-effectively, without compromising standards."
"I would urge all those responsible – which means each of us and all members of all the institutions – to keep this in mind and change our working habits accordingly."
"I should like to highlight some other aspects of the report that I believe are particularly important."
"We have had a reference to the area of information and communication."
"I applaud the emphasis on results as opposed simply to spending."
"Expensive solutions are not always the most effective."
"As the rapporteur suggests, we should not be afraid to discontinue tools or strategies that are not delivering the desired results."
"That means regular monitoring and clear and appropriate distribution of responsibilities."
"We have had a reference to information tools."
"One idea that has been explored is web-TV."
"I am firmly in support of that idea."
"Very many young people actually get most of their information from the internet."
"If it is properly managed and properly handled, it could be a new way of connecting with citizens and pushing forward our objectives."
"We need to find better ways, but this needs to be properly handled."
"I am very much in favour of the idea of having web-TV and seeing how all the institutions can work together to get our information across to different members of society."
". Mr President, Mr Grech has drafted an excellent report on next year’s guidelines for the Sections of the Budget other than that for the Commission."
"My warmest thanks go to him accordingly."
"A feature of next year’s budget is once again the establishment of the new activity-based accounting system in all the institutions."
"Just as the rapporteur insists, it is important that all institutions should adopt the same budget nomenclature, in which case Members of Parliament and other interested parties would be better placed to monitor implementation of the budget."
"It is important to obtain comparable data on the costs and results of different activities."
"A feature of next year’s budget is the anticipated enlargement."
"Romania and Bulgaria are very likely to join the EU next year."
"This will result in special requirements which have to be taken into account."
"We need to emphasise the importance of organising the linguistic service and the employment of staff."
"That way we are assured of a smooth transitional phase."
"The rapporteur quite rightly focuses attention on the fact that Parliament’s budget should remain under the 20% mark for all EU administrative expenditure."
"This will be an indication of Parliament’s administrative discipline."
"Mr President, the intention in next year’s budget is to pay very particular attention to the provision of information."
"This in itself is a very good thing."
"We must nevertheless insist that the provision of information remains relevant and appropriate."
"We cannot afford solutions that are too costly, especially if there is no corresponding benefit to be had."
"We need to focus attention on services for visitors and visitor groups."
"Although there have been improvements to the current facilities for showing visitors around, they leave a lot to be desired."
"There are too few rooms for visitors to assemble in, and there is too much queuing."
"It would be good if there could be greater use made of experts from the EU institutions from outside Parliament on Parliament’s premises so that visitors could be given a more diverse picture of the organisation than they are now."
"The real costs of visitor groups should be met more effectively."
"More important than increasing the number of visitors is the more comprehensive reimbursement of the travel expenses that current visitors incur."
"With regard to further discussion of the budget, we would hope that next year’s appropriations will be proposed right away in the preliminary draft budget."
"All too often there tend to be more and more demands concerning the budget while it is being debated throughout the autumn, which should be regarded as unacceptable."
"With these remarks I wish to express my support for the draftsman’s proposal."
". Mr President, I shall speak about the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee."
"Both these committees have had their day."
"Their value to the EU is disproportionate to the costs entailed in current integration."
"The original idea behind the committees was that they would increase the EU’s democratic legitimacy."
"However, the European Parliament has now in large measure taken over this role."
"What instead remains is a Committee of the Regions whose own freedom from responsibility is called into question by the majority of the Committee on Budgets’ members."
"We have also seen how both unions and employers have conducted successful campaigns outside the Economic and Social Committee."
"No one questions the fact that these parties are nowadays well established and can make their voices heard without the help of an EU-funded institution."
"We in the EU should instead seek submissions from the parties concerned directly. In doing so, there would be opportunities not yet taken advantage of for making savings."
"What is more, it would be advantageous to obtain responses from organisations and parties that are not necessarily completely dependent on the EU budget."
"I therefore believe that the appropriations in the 2007 budget should be substantially limited."
"– Mr President, in a parliamentary democracy, people’s representatives can, must, should and may set an example."
"If so many of us are now forced to require the people in our countries to make sacrifices, this can only function, in the spirit of democracy, if we, too, make sacrifices."
"Reducing Parliament’s budget from EUR 1.2 or 1.3 billion to under EUR 1 billion is the way to achieve credibility."
"To make a couple of suggestions, the many Members who have promised to claim only those travel expenses actually incurred from now on should pay back the surplus."
"In 2004, just 37 Members accounted for a ludicrous EUR 234 000."
"We know that EUR 26 million are squandered because of incorrect use of interpreting services."
"The many minutes of needless silence here cost further millions, and so it goes on."
"EUR 100 million a year have been spent on something or other, and so we look for something to enter it against."
"Let us have an end to this."
"We would have no problem at all in saving the EUR 300 million; and in so doing we would not only spare ourselves negative headlines in the international press, but also earn ourselves positive ones."
"I am saying this as a pro-European."
"You will wake up again tomorrow to read something you call scandalous, but no, it is what is happening here that is scandalous."
"I am sorry, but Europe cannot progress unless savings are made right here, at the top, at long last."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to what my group believes should be the inspiration behind Parliament’s budget, that is to say maximising the efficiency of Parliament’s work while minimising its cost."
"When drawing up the European Parliament's budget, we should respond to questions such as these: are we providing the Members with the instruments they require to carry out their duties?"
"Do the Members of the European Parliament have access to interpretation into all languages, to the rapid translation of documents and correct legal and technical assistance?"
"Do the Members have a good computer system and sufficient auxiliary staff?"
"From an external point of view, do the Members receive the correct information?"
"Do the political groups participate in the drawing up and control of that information?"
"Do the Members of the European Parliament need new information systems, or do they need to make better use of the existing ones?"
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented specific amendments in response to these questions."
"Furthermore, we should think about minimising the cost."
"Is it necessary to reach the 20% ceiling?"
"Would it not be better for this House too to be demonstrating that austerity and saving are basic principles of behaviour?"
"I hope that 2007 will follow the trend of 2006 and that under no circumstances will we return to generalised spending."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Grech, for the clarity and rigour of his report, which is both comprehensive and pragmatic."
"The paragraphs dedicated to our institution – the only democratically elected representation of the people of the EU, in the words of Mr Grech himself – captured my full attention, particularly those relating to visits to Parliament."
"The recent debates on the Constitutional Treaty and the outcome of the referendum in my country, which I personally deplored, highlight the fact that too many of our fellow citizens are unaware of the meaning and importance of the European Union for their everyday lives."
"Fears and received ideas often take the place of information."
"From my brief experience as a new MEP, I have also learnt that, each time that I have had the opportunity to receive visitors – in Brussels or in Strasbourg – no matter what their age, their origin or their socio-professional background, they have returned home convinced, I hope, of the value of the European Union or, at any rate, better informed about it and still interested in it. Of that I am sure."
"One well-known rule of marketing says that a dissatisfied customer tells eleven people and that a satisfied person only tells four people."
"So let us increase the number of satisfied citizens, because if they are better informed, they are in a better position to spread the European idea among our nations."
"Yet in order to do that, we must act on the Grech report and increase the number of visitors per MEP. I support Mr Grech’s request."
"Recently, the European Parliament’s information office for France organised a fascinating European forum in my constituency on the theme ‘A Dialogue on Europe: bringing the European Union and the citizen closer together’."
"Many participants regretted that the number of sponsored visits to Parliament was not higher."
"This is a genuine request."
"I have one more point to make: as far as welcoming our visitors and organising our work are concerned, our assistants have an invaluable role to play."
"They share our lives as elected representatives and freely make their time and brainpower available to us, but wide disparities exist among them, and their social situation is often precarious."
"As Mr Grech points out in his report, they truly deserve finally to be granted a genuine and meaningful statute."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, for my part, should like to begin by lending my support to the work of our fellow Member, Mr Grech, and commending the very high quality of his report."
"In the present context, and given the problems that we are encountering in the framework of the negotiations with the Council on the 2007-2013 financial perspective, this report is timely in taking stock of the financial resources that should be implemented in 2007 for the purposes of funding the main institutions of our Union: Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice and so on."
"I wish to lend my support this evening to the requests concerning both the principles of sound management and those designed for the purpose of achieving added value, but I should like us to extend these principles to all of the institutions and also, of course, specifically to the EU agencies."
"We must make even greater efforts to optimise our working tools, the management of information tools, the costs related to data transmission and, finally, our human resources policy."
"I, for my part, should like to emphasise our communication policy: it must allow our fellow citizens genuine access not only to information, as was explained a short while ago, but also to all the different facets of the Union."
"In fact, it must be genuinely possible for EU citizens not only to understand the decisions that we make on their behalf, but also to embrace this magnificent blueprint for a society that we are building not only for, but also – I hope – with, them."
"To this end, we must step up our communication efforts and allocate resources in line with the implementation of a communication policy that is modern, effective, educational and, in short, adapted to our times, not least through the use of tools such as Web TV"
"In the same way, I feel that I must stress the importance of also making greater efforts to host visitors and the press at the various buildings in which the part-sessions are held."
"With the prospect of future enlargement, there is no doubt that there is a lack of adequate infrastructure."
"I very often find myself receiving delegations in the Parliament building’s corridors."
"Mr President, as a British citizen I strongly oppose the budget settlement that Mr Tony Blair purports to suggest that he negotiated in December."
"I prefer to call it ‘the great giveaway’."
"Opening your cheque book and asking how much is not my idea of negotiation."
"Allowing Britain’s contribution to rise from an average of GBP 3 billion net to more than GBP 6 billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcher’s hard-earned rebate."
"I therefore voted against acceptance of the budget when it came before this Parliament, but I suspect that my reasons were somewhat different to those of most of the other Members of the institution who also voted against it."
"No major political party in my country, except my own, is prepared to campaign honestly and openly on European issues at election time."
"It is the famous elephant in the room that everybody avoids talking about."
"They are helped by a supine media that is only too willing to participate in what is effectively a cover-up."
"Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election."
"However, there is a downside."
"How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayers’ money, most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries, at the expense of under-funding our own domestic infrastructure?"
"I have looked at the guidelines in this report and most of it is just a glorified wish list full of buzzwords like ‘European heart’ and ‘raising the game’."
"In my view, if the EU really is interested in raising the game, it could start by asking for less money, not more, and it should initiate a major study on the means necessary to return the powers it has taken from democratically elected governments."
"Well, that is my wish list."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Ingeborg Gräßle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (COM(2005)0181 – C6-0234/2005 – 2005/0090(CNS)) (A6-0057/2006)."
". Mr President, today I would like to congratulate Parliament on a very important day that finalises our discussions on the Financial Regulation."
"It is an important week because Parliament’s opinion will be put to the vote in this House."
"I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs on the job they have done."
"I acknowledge the huge job done by them in tabling these amendments."
"I would like to confirm that the Commission will include the vast majority of Parliament’s proposals in its new revised proposal."
"I would also like to confirm that the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are more or less the same."
"In light of these shared objectives regarding the simplified rules and the reduction of red tape, I am pleased to announce that we will, very soon after Parliament’s vote, put forward our new revised proposal."
"We know that the Council is ready to give us a final decision and final opinion very soon."
"I would like to give you a few examples of the many amendments we are very eager to include in our new proposal: an explicit reference to the principle of proportionality – this will help to define a lighter procedure for smaller projects; information for grant applicants and standardised application forms for the same policy areas; and reinforcing the division of procurement contracts into specialist and/or partial lots."
"The fourth element that we are positively evaluating is the two-step procedure in the grant application process, which will avoid unnecessary costs in the initial phase."
"The Commission and Parliament are not the only two players in the current legislative process."
"The European Economic and Social Committee and the Court of Auditors delivered their opinions between October and December 2005."
"The Council is about to complete its first reading."
"I should like to stress that the legislative process of revision of the Community financial rules has now made substantial progress."
"Our common goal is to have new, simpler and more modern financial rules, better adapted to the new generation of spending programmes, hopefully applying from January 2007."
"That is why the timing is so important and why we cannot miss our deadlines."
"I am committed to working hard in the forthcoming interinstitutional negotiations and encouraging a conciliation process aimed at achieving an effective consensus between Parliament and the Council."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, today I am tabling 135 amendments to the Financial Regulation in this House."
"I was delighted at the Commissioner’s announcement today that she intends to incorporate some of the quite fundamental points of this report in the Commission’s revision."
"Parliament is using this initial rolling revision of the text – a text so important to the administration – as a means to eliminate fundamental problems."
"We have heard some very fundamental, harsh criticism of the bureaucratic procedures."
"Numerous organisations applying for grants, companies participating in supply and service tenders, and indeed those in the Commission and other institutions who apply the Financial Regulation, have contributed to our reform and to Parliament’s amendments."
"I am very much obliged to you all."
"Your professional advice will enable the improvement of the procedures."
"Those in this House to whom I am particularly obliged include President Borrell and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, primarily Mr Pahor and everyone who has worked on the proposals in the intergroup over a period of months."
"It was not only thanks to the constructive cooperation, but also to the general sense of the pressure to reform, that the two committees adopted the report either by a vast majority or unanimously."
"My personal assistant, Mr Sichel, has accomplished a great deal in this regard; I should also like to thank him most sincerely for this."
"In addition, those in the Commission to whom I am obliged include Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Director-General Mr Romero, and Mr Taverne and his staff for the numerous fruitful discussions, which I sincerely hope will continue, and really look forward to."
"Everyone – including myself, with my years of experience of dealing with the Financial Regulation – is wondering what kind of Europe this is that requires such complicated, costly application procedures."
"Up to one third of the amount of each grant is lost on the cost of the application procedure."
"Year after year, organisations throw away substantial sums on participation in European policy tenders, even though they have no prospect of success."
"Forty pages of forms and an additional 500 pages of manuals is not the exception but the rule."
"Only 5–25% of applications are successful."
"At costs of up to EUR 200 000 per application, you can imagine the money that is being squandered in Europe every time an organisation participates in an EU tender."
"What kind of Europe is it in which companies no longer wish to participate in tenders because they have to submit two annual balance sheets, even for routine applications?"
"Indeed, the Commission has already worked very intensively on this, and it will continue to work on it and to make changes to the important implementing rules."
"I should also like to encourage Commissioner Grybauskaitė in this, and would be most obliged to her if she were to take up all of Parliament’s proposals, as we do not want the Commission to be equated throughout Europe with ponderousness, red tape and money-wasting; we want it to be seen as a service provider for all those wishing to implement and support European policies."
"Our most important amendments will be put to a roll-call vote tomorrow."
"As Commissioner Grybauskaitė has already announced, some are to be incorporated."
"I should also like to present a few more."
"One concerns a database for the notification of applicants, avoiding the submission of multiple copies of documents and thus saving time and money at the application stage."
"We should also like to see Commission decisions rather than voluminous contracts."
"This could make procedures less protracted and – particularly in the case of small grants – less burdensome."
"Our main point is that, in future, the Commission should assist applicants with the procedures."
"This is a cultural revolution, but it will be beneficial all round, particularly to the reputation of the EU."
"Our objectives are improvements in predictability, reliability and legal certainty, and, for the purposes of improving flexibility, an amendment has been tabled regarding the limited transferability of commitments, which would otherwise lapse."
"I shall be tabling another oral amendment tomorrow, which, whilst refraining from specifying an amount, nevertheless refers to a maximum sum."
"The negotiations on this will depend on the Financial Perspective."
"I would appeal to the Council not to leave the situation as it stands."
"What kind of procedures are they that block outflows of funds whilst Member State organisations are losing so much money?"
"This Parliament has recognised that we cannot go on as we are doing, especially as the complex bureaucratic procedures are not even particularly successful at achieving the objective of protecting Community funds."
"That is the reason for my final request: let us strive for a new version of the Financial Regulation in the medium term."
"In the Member States, financial regulations are simple documents for administrations, because they have to be used daily."
"The EU’s Financial Regulation must not count as the most complicated the administration could have conceived for its self-management."
"This item, too, remains on Parliament’s agenda."
"I should like to thank you all once more for your cooperation, and I hope to be able to count on your support tomorrow."
"– First, two expressions of thanks; the first is to rapporteur Mrs Grässle, who has been a great inspiration to all of us who worked with her throughout the preparation of this report."
"Then also to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Fazakas, who under this great pressure of time did everything to see that the two committees enjoyed excellent cooperation in bringing this report before Parliament."
"As co-rapporteur and draftsman of the opinion regarding the Financial Regulation, I would stress that the main purpose of the report was to make the Financial Regulation and its rules of implementation less bureaucratic, easier to understand, simpler and, most importantly, more user-friendly."
"In this way we might also ensure a more effective use of budget funds."
"As the rapporteur has stated, the report devotes special attention to the area of public procurement and donations."
"Indeed at a number of meetings we heard, particularly from non-governmental organisations, that they no longer wished to cooperate with the European Union, since the bureaucratic procedures were too long and above all too expensive."
"No one, myself included, would wish to change anything in the Regulation in such a way as to render the use of taxpayers’ money less transparent."
"In drafting the report, we were attempting to find some kind of new, more successful balance between the effective use of money on the one hand and democratic control over such use on the other hand."
"In particular, the committee chaired by Mr Fazakas, the Committee on Budgetary Control, is extremely sensitive with regard to this issue."
"That is why the opinions of the Court of Auditors have frequently been of decisive importance for both rapporteurs and especially for the Committee on Budgetary Control, and why they have also been accommodated in this report."
"May I close by saying that no one, especially in politics, wants any financial scandals."
"And no matter how well written they are, there is of course no set of rules that can entirely prevent them, yet they may facilitate the more or less successful management of budget funds and the more or less general confidence of the public in its legality and effectiveness."
"Finally I would make so bold as to claim that this report is headed in the right direction, that the proposed solutions enable a kind of new, successful balance, and I look forward to the report being adopted tomorrow."
". – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her splendid and bold work."
"This report sends a clear and strong message to citizens that the European Parliament wants them to have easier access to EU funding."
"A lot of importance is given to the debate on the Financial Perspective, which is about how much money will be in the EU budget."
"That is fine, but we should not neglect the equally important issue of how that money should be spent and how we can make it easier for citizens to benefit from it."
"What is the use of speaking of large sums of EU money when people on the ground are feeling increasingly frustrated about excessive bureaucracy in accessing funding, long and incomprehensible applications and officials who do little or nothing to explain them?"
"No wonder many people simply give up before even trying."
"That is wrong and we should change it."
"We should change it by reforming the Financial Regulation and making sure we make things easier and more accessible."
"That is what the rapporteur's report does: it introduces several measures to make access to funding easier and, in that sense, it turns virtual EU money that one may get into real EU money that one can actually access."
"That is good news for citizens, but it is also good news for NGOs and small businesses."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to be our ally in this reform."
"Our message is clear: if we truly want to reconnect to the people, we should make things simpler."
". – Praise in this case is no mere formality, but an acknowledgement of the rapporteur’s extraordinarily coherent, committed work aimed at achieving two clear objectives, namely the simplification and proportionality of the scope of the rules."
"From this perspective, this is an extremely good report, for which we should not be sparing in our praise."
"I should like to say at this point that it is vital, in my view, to analyse the next steps in this process of reform of the financial regulation."
"We must ensure that, throughout the next financial perspective, we in Parliament continue to exercise the power of codecision, as we did in the past, so that we can accomplish four key tasks in the near future."
"The first such task is to update the budgetary guidelines in certain areas, for example the annuality principle and budgetary flexibility mechanisms; secondly, to reduce exceptions to the absolutely essential minimum – in so doing, we would confirm the overriding importance of the financial regulation on sectoral legislation, and put an end to duplications and discrepancies between on the one hand, the basic regulation, on the other, the implementing regulation and, between the two, the sectoral regulations; thirdly, to clarify the duties, powers and responsibilities of the various budgetary actors and ensuring that these duly reflect budgetary accounting standards."
"The fourth and last task will be to incorporate the financial regulation and the financial framework agreed upon in the Interinstitutional Agreement and to make them consistent."
"These tasks may seem simple, but are in fact complex and require very careful attention."
". Mr President, firstly I wish to thank you, rapporteurs Mrs Gräßle and Mr Pahor, for the enormous task you have undertaken in preparing this topic."
"The amendment to the Financial Regulation has been an immense job of preparation, and one that is very technical and tough-going."
"It has taken a lot of time and concentration."
"Mrs Gräßle has untiringly chaired many meetings of work groups."
"The very fact that Parliament’s opinion is clear to everyone is precisely due to this excellent preparatory work."
"My warmest thanks go to them for that."
"The Commission’s proposal aimed to revise the Regulation that had been in force for three years."
"The main objective has been to eliminate and simplify bureaucracy and increase flexibility, while at the same wishing to guarantee financial security."
"The background to this is the development of a new administrative culture."
"In 1999, after the crisis which ended with the Commission’s resignation, a work group of experts proposed that the administration of the EU be organised in such a way that personal accountability would be clarified and at the same time financial administration simplified, this legislative package included reform of the budget structure to make it activity-based and a revision of the Financial Regulation and the implementation acts relating to it."
"Now is the period of interim evaluation."
"One could say that the original ambitious objective has been partially achieved."
"Currently we are obtaining a clearer picture of the costs and results of the EU’s various policy areas."
"There is still a great deal of bureaucracy, however, and there are considerable controls and checks in place."
"The Commission’s proposal to amend the Financial Regulation is along the right lines, I believe, although modest in its aims."
"The delegation of power and responsibility still lacks boldness, and activity-based administration is still a long way off."
"In our opinion, the rapporteurs adopted just the right approach in endeavouring to relate necessary administration to a manageable sum of money."
"At present the procedures are sometimes so complicated and expensive that action does not result in the achievement of the objectives we aspire to, such as cooperation with the private sector."
"The report adopted by the committees is, we believe, too cautious."
"We would have liked a bolder, more liberal approach."
"In our view, Parliament is still involved in ‘microadministration’."
"The main issue in administration is results, and not the procedures involved in its implementation."
"Complicated administrative processes only serve as protection for ineffectual civil servants, freeing them from having to make decisions."
"Financial administration must be based on rational decisions and personal accountability."
"These comments aside, we are nevertheless prepared to support the report in its entirety, and we await the forthcoming debate on the implementation acts."
". Mr President, I too should like to extend warm thanks to Mrs Gräßle for her work, for even sacrificing her Christmas break, as I understand, and for the many fruitful meetings we have had together."
"Reform of the Financial Regulation really is desperately needed."
"The dismissal of the Santer Commission brought about stricter rules and a review of the control mechanisms, something to which my group has always been committed."
"We have also had to conclude, though, that this clean-up process has overshot the mark somewhat."
"It has led to excessive bureaucracy for subsidy applications, and it is mainly the NGOs, the non-governmental organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises that have borne the brunt of this."
"There is now such fear of inappropriate spending that European officials, where possible, will pass the buck to the subsidy applicants."
"As a result, we still have not got what we set out to achieve, namely a Commission in which officials are really responsible and can also shoulder that responsibility."
"I am, then, very much in favour of the amendments that are before us, the majority of which aim to simplify procedures."
"The principle of proportionality is being mooted and I am also delighted with Amendments 110 and 101 which deal with the percentage rule."
"The situation at the moment is that when beneficiaries raise own resources, it is likely that they will need to pay back much of the grant, with the counterproductive effect of giving a disincentive to raise own resources in future."
"The Commission has pledged that it will adopt a number of basic points from those amendments, but, as ever, the devil is in the detail, of course."
"As you saw with the proposals that are before us, it is this House’s intention to simplify procedures."
"This is not only dependent on the Financial Regulation; much will also depend on the implementing provisions which the Commission will be drafting."
"I therefore hope that you will adopt the principle that simplification must be introduced, which will really lighten the load."
"There is much talk at present of reducing the pressure of rules imposed by Europe, and people immediately think of the large enterprises which would otherwise be obstructed in their competitiveness."
"It is also just as important, though, for the small enterprises and non-profit organisations to start to benefit from a reduction in administrative costs."
"While it is important that the Commission should bear this in mind when it drafts the implementing rules, I hope, too, that the Council will accept that this is not just about large enterprises, and that smaller businesses and NGOs should also benefit from a reduction in the administrative burden imposed by Europe."
". Mr President, as I take the floor in the debate on Mrs Gräßle’s report on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Community, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following issues."
"Firstly, the European Commission believes that after three years’ operation of the Financial Regulation there is no need to change its structure or the fundamental principles and concepts it contains."
"Secondly, the Commission does, however, propose a whole series of changes affecting fundamental budget principles and the validation of claims amongst other issues."
"According to the proposal, the Community’s claims are to be dealt with by the Member States in the same way as national financial claims."
"In addition, the proposal sets a five-year period for them to extinguish."
"This is to apply to both public procurement and contracts."
"These provisions incorporate the changes required to adjust to the new Community directive adopted in 2004 concerning public procurement and grants."
"The aim is to simplify provisions on controls and guarantees."
"The rapporteur proposes a whole series of amendments to the regulation amended by the European Commission."
"The changes are intended to make implementation of the Union’s budget easier and to facilitate access to budget funds by the beneficiaries."
"I support most of these amendments and earnestly hope that the Financial Regulation, as amended by the European Commission and Parliament, will enable funds set aside in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective to be distributed in a more efficient and transparent manner than has been the case to date."
"This will be particularly important for the new Member States who are due to receive several times more funding for 2007-2013 than they have in the past."
"As I conclude, I should like to thank Mrs Gräßle for a good report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, like the last time we reviewed it, we are debating the financial Regulation today during a night sitting."
"I hope that, like last time, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will be receptive to our proposals and not be a wary Presidency which wants to maintain the status quo, ignoring the fact that circumstances have changed and that the operating rules must be improved in order to improve budgetary execution."
"Like last time, we again need the Commission to be understanding towards Parliament and demanding towards the Council."
"The rapporteur has obtained the support of a large majority for her proposal, both in the Committee on Budgetary Control and in the Committee on Budgets, and has included valuable contributions aimed at eliminating bureaucratic obstacles and protecting the taxpayers’ financial interests from fraud."
"With regard to the amendments presented, I would like to draw attention to the rapporteur’s compromise proposal."
"The proposal of other political groups to authorise carry-over for all of the unused commitment appropriations is unrealistic and may affect the principle of annuality and, above all, it does not favour our position on the recycling of unspent funds, which is part of the negotiating strategy in the financial perspective."
"Restricting the sum, as the rapporteur does in her compromise amendment, seems more reasonable and, above all, more effective in terms of defending this strategy."
"Furthermore, Mr President, I believe that the strategy should clearly separate the vote on the legislative proposal from the final adoption when we have a definitive wording from the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of both the rapporteur, Mrs Gräßle, and the draftsman, Mr Pahor, and by congratulating them on the quality of their report."
"As MEPs, we had a duty, in fact, to review the financial regulation, and this for several reasons."
"It was becoming urgent to reform it."
"To prove this, I only need mention the various problems that we have had to tackle as representatives of the people of Europe, especially where providing Europeans with information was concerned."
"We need to be better at communicating with people and to communicate with them more often."
"Reviewing the financial regulation is one way of doing this."
"The lump-sum payments with regard to procurement procedures and to the award of grants are to be welcomed as a step in the direction of better financial management."
"The same goes, moreover, for the protection of the Communities’ financial interests, to be achieved, by the amendment tabled in relation to the recovery, suspension and implementation of contracts and penalties."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the amendments concerning the simplification measures."
"The challenge for us is to strike a balance between simplification and sound financial management."
"I welcome the approach of the rapporteur and the draftsman, aimed at making the rules simpler for the beneficiaries, thanks in particular to the simplification of administrative procedures and the simultaneous tightening of controls on the way in which our budget is spent."
"We must provide the resources for an ongoing dialogue with civil society and not discriminate between organisations – between those that have the resources to respond to Community programmes and those that do not."
"The report will in fact make it possible to safeguard Parliament’s rights in the future, whether in terms of its power of control or of its right to information in its capacity as a branch of the budgetary authority."
"Similarly, I should like to point out that the provisions concerning the funding of political groups or political parties are of the utmost importance."
"We are concerned here, in actual fact, with the formation of European citizenship, a citizenship to which Parliament must contribute in order to ensure the development of the European public space."
"Mr President, I am addressing the twenty practically heroic Members who are here during this night sitting."
"It is shameful that we have to discuss such important issues at night."
"Our fellow Members decided that there was no need for Friday sittings, and here we are, at an inappropriate time, which is not worthy of the quality and dignity of our parliamentary work."
"I will say secondly that we must congratulate Mrs Gräßle on her good work and say that this Parliament is obliged to ensure that the money that the citizens give us is not wasted on administrative costs and that it arrives on time and effectively, and that is the intention of Mrs Gräßle’s report."
"There are two different philosophies here, and I am delighted that the majority of speakers share this new philosophy — which is different to the one in place when I came to this Parliament four terms in office ago — the philosophy of believing that we must get the best from the people who work on the administration of the budget and that we must establish responsibilities."
"The political position of imposing bureaucracy on spending is born of distrust in our civil servants, of we politicians not wanting to run any kind of risk."
"The idea is to get rid of civil servants who make mistakes, and we therefore tell them that, each time they have to buy a pencil, they must follow a long procedure in order to assure us that the pencil has been purchased properly."
"We do not permit the tiniest error, and there have been cases of our getting rid of civil servants who have done things right many times, but who have made a mistake just once."
"The philosophy of making the spending procedure less complicated is therefore going to allow Community money, which the Council rations more and more — it is only going to give us 1%, rather than 1.2% — to arrive more efficiently and on time, because there are plenty of examples of Community money reaching the taxpayer, the European citizen, late and inefficiently as a result of our Rules of Procedure and our lack of responsibility as politicians."
"Thank you very much for this excellent report, Mrs Gräßle."
"The revision of the Community’s ‘financial bible’ affects not only the institutional framework of the European Union but also its citizens."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Grässle, has done an excellent job in dealing with the Commission’s draft, and we now have an excellent proposal before us."
"I am going to focus on those points that I find most substantive."
"We must clearly define the tasks and joint responsibilities of the Member States regarding management of the Community’s financial resources."
"In respect of structural funds, and in the interest of transparency, reliability, efficiency and the good reputation of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens, we must put in place transparent and expeditious administrative procedures with clearly defined responsibilities for the individual actors."
"The same applies to public procurement."
"Ambiguities and unnecessary procedural delays often occur in this area as well."
"As a former mayor, I have had negative personal experiences in this respect."
"I believe that by approving this document we will contribute to the better functioning of the financial system in the European Union and thus make the activities of the EU easier for its citizens to comprehend."
"– Mr President, I should like to make three points."
"Firstly, I wish to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Gräßle, who has done a tremendous job, a great job."
"We can only congratulate her on this achievement."
"Secondly, if there is any point to this work, then surely it is that it represents an attempt to improve the efficiency of the administration of our programmes and our funds."
"This also means, however, that the Commission’s work should be increasingly judged by its efficiency in future."
"The significance of this to future discharge procedures in this House is that we shall have to change our methods and start to move away from a know-it-all attitude towards the application of more efficient standards."
"Thirdly, as a Member coming from a small Alpine region, I expect the Commission – including in the context of the oft-heralded transparency initiatives – to provide information on the average size of the companies participating in the European programmes, the average size of the small or medium-sized enterprises benefiting from European funds, for example, and the length of time, in the final reckoning, for which an enterprise has to provide pre-financing in order to receive European funds."
"That, too, is very important as regards the future assessment of the Commission’s work and of the implementation of European programmes."
"Mr President, at the close of this debate stretching into the night, I would like to say a few words as the President of the committee involved, COCOBU, and as a MEP of a new Member State."
"MEPs of the new Member States have participated in the parliamentary preparations for the Financial Regulation with great joy and enthusiasm, not only because they have an enthusiastic commitment to parliamentary work, but also because they are convinced that we serve a better, simpler and more effective Europe."
"This is because our experience of almost two years has shown us that the financial regulation of the European Union is often over-bureaucratised and anti-productive."
"Changing this situation is not only in the interest, but also the duty of all of us."
"In awareness of this, all Members of Parliament involved in this process have cooperated with one another, showing a good example; the two committees reinforced their cooperation and appointed two excellent rapporteurs, and then, starting from the organisation of the public hearing to the voting, they did everything they could to achieve a result."
"We trust that the Commission and Council will follow this good example as soon as possible, in the interest of the common and good new Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Seán Ó Neachtain, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on more environmentally friendly fishing methods (2004/2199(INI)) (A6-0019/2006)."
". – Mr President, I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack."
"Because of illegal actions by the few, there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals."
"I say to colleagues and especially to you, Commissioner, that this has to stop."
"Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector?"
"Of course there are, just like in every other sector – economic or otherwise – known to man."
"If someone is guilty of criminal activity then let the full force of the appropriate law apply."
"On the other hand, we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty."
"We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest, dedicated and extremely hard-working people."
"Furthermore, no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women."
"In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has, to a large extent, developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing."
"In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology."
"The objective of maintaining sustainability must, most centrally, embrace the question of how we fish in the future so that we harvest our marine resources in the most environmentally favourable way."
"The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority."
"To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable."
"I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks."
"This is an urgent matter. The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic: 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year, equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches."
"In the words of the then Irish Presidency, over-fishing is part of the overall problem; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term."
"I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens, and that we must do something positive about it."
"It is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful side-effect of the fishing industry."
"The proposed environmental programme includes a review of all existing technical conservation measures within the next two years, to reduce ecosystem and environmental damage."
"It includes the proposal to fast-track the development of more selective fishing gear."
"It proposes the simplification of our current rules with a view to facilitating those changes."
"I started my presentation in defence of fishermen."
"I conclude my presentation by underlining that it is our fishermen and women who will have a central role in deciding the future of the European fishing industry."
"Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils, which will have an extremely important role to play."
"There is no doubt in my mind that fishermen will fully subscribe to this new environmentally friendly approach."
"They will do so because it will contribute to sustainable fisheries."
"They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks."
"They will do so because it will ensure that fish stocks are properly preserved for future generations."
"Commissioner, if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives, including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear."
"I hope that you will agree with me, Commissioner, that in the current context that will be a small price to pay."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, and the Committee on Fisheries for the constructive report on more environmentally friendly fishing methods and for the interest they have shown in the communication from the Commission."
"I cannot agree more with what the rapporteur has just said regarding the honesty and integrity of fishermen; the abuses of the few should not be blamed on everyone at large and we need to clamp down strongly on the real culprits."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the development of more environmentally friendly fishing methods."
"Improving selectivity is one of the objectives of the technical measures that we propose in that context."
"In that regard, I am pleased to note that some progress has been achieved on the technical measures in the Baltic that were adopted by the Council in December, and the Commission intends to increase selectivity and the new technical measures to be proposed for the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and North Sea."
"I have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing."
"The Commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle."
"Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for 2006, to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures – also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban – are adopted, hopefully, during this year."
"I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets."
"The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention."
"The reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea."
"It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account."
"The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC."
"The Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose."
"Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden."
"Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively."
"The Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany."
"This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year."
"This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards."
"Bycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO."
"This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO."
"Most of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea."
"As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, long-term management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures."
"I have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission."
"They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification."
"Turning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment 1 on centralisation and co-management, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decision-making process."
"The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment."
"I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French square-meshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which – for safety reasons – the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries."
"It is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment 2, since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way."
"They will hopefully be concluded by April."
"However, the draft proposal from the Commission already provides for socio-economic compensation linked to recovery plans, and I can assure you that this topic will be given the necessary attention."
"Mr President, let me first of all warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, for a brilliant own-initiative report on introducing environmentally friendly fishing methods to the EU fisheries sector."
"He has produced a very fitting conclusion to an initiative that, as he reminded us, was first started by the Irish Presidency."
"I agree with him and I agree with the Commissioner on the need to decriminalise honest fishermen."
"That is a crucial point that he brought out in his presentation."
"However, his report stresses two other points that I want to expand upon."
"First of all, there is the need for the Commission to take a more wide-ranging view of measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, in particular by studying factors other than over-fishing that may cause fish stocks to be depleted, such as pollution and global warming."
"As you know, Commissioner, there is mounting evidence that over-fishing has not been the only cause of the collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea."
"If that was so, the dramatic reduction in the number of fishing vessels that are now fishing for cod in the North Sea – numbers have collapsed by 60% through decommissioning in the last five years – would have led to a remarkable recovery in cod stocks, but that has not been the case."
"It seems to me that the other factors – such as global warming or pollution or whatever other factors may be evident – should now be the basis of your review of the cod recovery programme, which I am delighted that you have agreed to carry out."
"Indeed, the other point from Mr Ó Neachtain’s report that I want to emphasise is the point he strongly made on discards, when he emphasised that over 20 million tons of fish are discarded worldwide every year."
"One million tons are discarded in Europe every year."
"Commissioner, you said that two pilot projects were already under way."
"I thought you were also carrying out pilot projects in the North Sea."
"If you have any further information on the pilot projects and evidence concerning discards and how this may be tackled in the future I would very much like to hear it in your winding-up speech."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Ó Neachtain on his excellent report."
"Our group is satisfied with the report and we also support the two amendments tabled."
"The report is very timely."
"Last month, it became public knowledge that a number of deep-sea fish are threatened with exhaustion and even extinction."
"There are no two ways about it: the fish stocks are in a desperate fix and a change of tack towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly fisheries is desperately needed, and affects us all."
"Let me begin by saying that fishermen will need to adjust to the depletion of fish stocks."
"While there is a need for technical measures, such as acoustic deterring devices, electric impulses which will render the disturbance of the sea bed unnecessary, adequate mesh sizes and fish hooks in order to minimise bycatch, non-technical measures are at least equally important."
"I am mainly concerned about preventing illegal fishing and introducing marine reserves so as to replenish fish populations."
"This sounds simple, but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not."
"Our group stresses the need for fishermen to be encouraged to apply sustainable methods."
"The fisheries sector is having a tough time, not least due to increasing oil prices."
"In this light, we need an active and involved government in order to promote sustainable fishing."
"The governments must also stand surety for control and enforcement."
"Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties."
"Without effective control measures, this situation will irrevocably lead to a tragedy of common sense."
"Everyone stands to lose and soon there will be no fish left to catch."
"Thirdly, consumers must also be involved in sustainable fishing."
"Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish, but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable."
"Certification and quality marks are therefore important."
"Sustainable fish is, first and foremost, fish that is not overfished, without unnecessary bycatch and discards, and good information to consumers is needed in this respect."
"Only then will consumers take an informed decision in favour of sustainably caught fish."
"Finally, in order to make a change of tack possible, we as politicians must shoulder our responsibility."
"We must constantly draw the attention to sustainable fishing and we must act; we must respond to the fishermen who make the temporary introduction of marine reserves possible, thus ensuring that they do not lose their incomes in the short term."
"The report that is before us constitutes a few sound steps in that direction and these must be fleshed out in the near future."
"Needless to say, the fishing industry must be involved in the measures."
"Only with responsible politicians and active government, innovative fishermen and involved consumers can both the fishing industry and the fish look forward to a sustainable future."
". – Mr President, the ALDE Group congratulates Mr Ó Neachtain on his report."
"It is clear and succinct and yet comprehensive in its coverage of the issues."
"We particularly endorse the references to biodiversity and to the need for action in relation both to ghost fishing and discards, as well as the call for the Commission to continue to promote the adoption of an FAO International Plan of Action on bycatch reduction."
"On ghost fishing, we stressed the importance of monitoring the existing transitional measure, to ensure that it is not simply leading to displacement of effort, and the importance of the full involvement of the European Parliament in discussions relating to long-term controls."
"We entirely agree with the report’s emphasis on the role that regional advisory councils can play in the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing methods and with the necessity of affording them increased technical and financial support."
"We regret that we cannot vote for either of the amendments."
"Whilst we sympathise with the approach expressed in Amendment 1, particularly on decentralisation and co-management, we have difficulties with some of the wording and feel that the points are effectively addressed in paragraph 19."
"In the same way we believe that the issue of compensation, as raised in Amendment 2, is already adequately covered by the existing paragraph 6."
"In conclusion, we commend the report to the Commission, the Council and Parliament as a whole."
". Mr President, I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, and assure him of my full support for his report, which I hope will be adopted unamended."
"I know of no one with any interest whatsoever in fisheries who would not support the principle of environmentally friendly fishing methods: the people with most to gain, after all, from protecting the marine environment and ensuring a balance between conservation and harvesting of fish stocks are the fishermen themselves."
"Most of the fishermen I know are not just fishing for today but are hoping that, one day, their families will be able to follow them into the business."
"However, there is much more to environmental protection than just technical measures, important as they will always be."
"The CFP itself, I would contend, is not environmentally friendly: TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed."
"Discards are by the CFP, rather than prevented by it."
"Many people in Scotland’s fisheries-dependent communities are totally disillusioned with the European Union’s management of fisheries; so much so that, today, the Scottish Parliament’s European Committee considered a petition based on 250 000 signatures calling for withdrawal from the CFP."
"The Scottish Parliament agreed to ask for legal advice on this."
"That was not done lightly, but because there is a real and serious need for more radical reform than we have had thus far."
". – I should first like to commend the rapporteur on his openness and his focus in the course of drawing up his report, which we broadly endorse and which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries."
"There is no doubt that the sustainability of fisheries resources is crucial to the long-term survival and viability of the fisheries sector."
"The sustainability of resources needs to be based on a wide-ranging approach to measures to protect the marine environment and to rebuild depleted stocks, in which other factors such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, deep-sea dredging and maritime transport are also taken on board."
"This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations."
"That being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas."
"Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions."
"Consequently, we have retabled an amendment calling on the Commission to propose social and economic compensation measures aimed at providing Community funding for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks."
"Similarly, as we believe that fishermen and their representative associations should be involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, we have retabled an amendment stating that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation, who will be applying such measures."
". – Mr President, there is no doubt that the common fisheries policy and the traditional quota system have resulted in depleted fish stocks."
"The more recent day-at-sea approach does not guarantee environmentally friendly fishing and bizarrely rewards the use of smaller mesh."
"I am hopeful that policies developed under the newer system, where you have all-stakeholder consultation, will be better than the top-down policies."
"I support closed boxes such as the recent Celtic Sea cod box, which, though difficult, has been supported by fishermen."
"I believe that we must increase mesh size to prevent unnecessary discarding of juvenile fish."
"Ninety millimetres should be the minimum mesh size in order to protect nursery areas and reduce discards."
"More R[amp]D is needed to tailor selectivity devices such as square mesh panels and sorting grids to make them even more effective in protecting young fish."
"This year gill netting has been banned in waters deeper than 200 metres."
"However, further measures are required, including restrictions on the length of gear and measures to prevent the stripping and dumping of nets at sea."
"Mesh sizes for fixed gears must be harmonised."
"I am confident that the measures outlined above, and others, can contribute significantly to sustainable fishing and ultimately lead to sustainable fisheries."
"– I should first like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. I also wish to say that I wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's initiative in issuing a communication on promoting more environmentally-friendly fishing methods."
"The technical conservation measures have a more important role than ever in the future of the sector."
"It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and, therefore, the possibility of catching fish at the right size, taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species."
"The satisfactory reproduction of fish, and in turn increased stocks, will only be possible if there are appropriate management measures, such as the temporary closure of certain fishing areas, to reduce bycatch to sustainable levels, and the effective practice of monitoring of vessels and fishing areas by means of satellite technology."
"It is also necessary to become aware of the specific characteristics of fishing practices in the various Member States. This knowledge will help to implement appropriate, well-balanced measures that will ensure the recovery and management of fish sources and safeguard the overriding interests of fishermen and vessel owners."
"It is accordingly necessary to adopt a decentralised approach taking account of the specific characteristics of fishing areas and different species."
"In spite of the Commission’s good intentions, a more decentralised approach is sometimes needed on important and sensitive questions regarding the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries."
"Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel."
"I should like to finish by saying that the development of scientific research and technology sharing at Community level are key factors if we are to adopt more environmentally-friendly fishing rules."
"In this context, I feel that we need to pay close attention to the channelling of funds that will be available as part of the new Community framework for supporting research."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my warm congratulations to Mr Ó Neachtain."
"This report concerns a Commission communication which lies at the heart of the common fisheries policy."
"I feel that in this and other areas, and using other instruments, we need to find solutions to the problems that we are facing, and that, accordingly, this debate today is of vital importance."
"In the autonomous region of the Azores, considerable progress has been made in recent years, not least the prohibition of bottom gillnets and bottom trawls."
"I do feel, however, that much remains to be done, in the autonomous region of the Azores and in all Community waters, as regards these more environmentally-friendly methods."
"What is needed is, firstly, more first-hand fisheries management, with the fundamental concept of the marine habitat placed at the heart of fisheries policy implementation."
"Secondly, we must prioritise the problem of discards, as the rapporteur has done."
"We know that there are other countries within and outside Europe that operate a ban on any discard and I see no reason why we should not act more quickly and follow suit in the EU."
"There is also the crucial problem of satellite systems for monitoring and detecting vessels, on which there is much to do if they are to comply fully."
"Lastly, I should therefore like to ask the Commission to take on board the need to implement these systems at the earliest opportunity and to ensure their effective use."
"Mr President, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, promoting environmentally friendly fishing methods demonstrates that the European Union has become fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by this sector and the need for structural action for responsible exploitation of aquatic resources."
"Reducing fishing pressure, because fish stocks are in a bad condition, optimising catches by avoiding huge quantities of fish being thrown into the sea because they are immature and reducing the impact on particularly sensitive habitats: these are the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, which we can endorse."
"Adopting measures designed to protect and conserve living aquatic resources, to ensure that they are used in a sustainable way, to identify compensation measures for lost income and to support the development of research and innovation are priority commitments set out in the report under consideration."
"This report has our firm support; in fact, if fisheries activities are made more environmentally friendly this will also contribute to promoting positive socio-economic conditions."
"I am convinced that it will only be possible to correctly apply the technical rules governing fishing if fishermen are willing to comply."
"It is therefore necessary to reinforce cooperation, agreement and participation by all those involved in the assessment, implementation and drafting of all technical measures to be adopted, and to promote a decentralised approach; in this way, once again, the European Union will decide not for its citizens but together with them."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the thought that has gone into the report and for its presentation."
"The search for environmentally friendly methods of fishing is as long as the history of fishing itself."
"Even in ancient times legal and technical measures were put in place in order to limit catches and avoid depleting the stocks and damaging the biomass and consequently the environment."
"Only in the particular circumstances of the early 19th century were all restrictions on fishing lifted."
"At the end of the century things returned to normal, in other words, protective restrictions were reintroduced."
"It seems that more complex protective measures based on scientific research were developed mid-way through the 20th century."
"These favoured so-called optimal fishing that involved regulating the age of the first catch."
"There followed provisions on the permitted size of fish caught and the principles of selective fishing gear."
"On the other hand, they simply restricted the limits, fishing effort and fishing potential."
"As to specific issues in the document before us, I believe it is worth mentioning the new approach to protective principles."
"In contrast to the protective measures applied to date, which mainly related to selective fishing, it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch."
"I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble."
"It would seem to be a case of political correctness as applied to fish."
"Will this really be beneficial to the environment, though?"
"Experience has shown that selective fishing always weakens the biological strength of desirable species in the ecosystem."
"The less useful species can take over the niche vacated by the more desirable ones."
"It is therefore vital to recommend ongoing monitoring of the population of both groups and the relationship between them."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to add that, despite the actions taken by the European Union, fish stocks are under constant threat and that this is due to three very important factors: firstly intensive rates of fishing, secondly fishing methods and thirdly maritime pollution."
"The Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January, the purpose of which is to promote environmentally-friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures, such as the definition of fishing areas, fishing periods and fishing tools."
"We all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction."
"As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:"
"Firstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area."
"Secondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure."
"In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application."
"Thirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income."
"It is therefore important to make provision for adequate resources to support efforts."
"Fourthly, it is very important that stricter measures be taken to protect seas from contamination either from land or sea and"
"Fifthly, seas know no borders."
"The European Union must find ways of ensuring that measures to protect the seas are applied not only by the Member States, but also by third countries."
"To close, I wish to emphasise that it is the sacred duty of the entire world to leave clean seas with fish in them to future generations."
"Mr President, I shall be the last tonight to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very good report."
"However, one line jumped out at me, and that is that TACs cannot control fishing mortality because they control landings but not catches and discards."
"This has been central to the problem of the common fisheries policy for decades and nothing that has been put in place by way of improvement has worked to date."
"The cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective."
"Fishermen in my region of Northern Ireland have faced closure in the Irish Sea for a long number of years and we have not seen any concrete evidence that this has been a success."
"We need to look at where we are going."
"Let us put the past behind us and start with a clean sheet of paper."
"It is in every fisherman’s interest that future stocks are protected and, if we must have controls, then let the industry be part of the decision-making process."
"You cannot continue to shut them out and blame them for non-cooperation."
"We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process."
"Let us bring everyone on board and let the industry be listened to and, above all, take on board some of its very good ideas."
"It is a nonsense that if a fisherman says something, it must be wrong."
"This cannot be the bottom line for us in the future."
". Mr President, I could not agree more that ultimately we need to take a broad view on the reasons for depleted stocks."
"However, I will also stress that our communication deals with fisheries and how to come to grips with depleted stocks because, unless we reverse the trend as regards over-capacity and fishing effort, we will not deal with the problem effectively."
"Regarding the point made concerning pilot projects on discards, there are indeed proposed projects in the North Sea aiming at increasing selectivity by new technical measures."
"I need to underline however that calling for a complete ban on discards from Community waters is easier said than done. This point was also raised by Mr Stevenson and by Mr Casaca."
"Even with regard to Norway, where fisheries are much less mixed and less complex, it has not been without problems."
"We are however looking at various ways of reducing discards, as I indicated in my initial presentation."
"On another point made by Mr Stevenson concerning the studying of factors other than over-fishing, such as pollution and global warming – a point also raised by other honourable Members of Parliament – we are certainly willing to do this and we are doing so."
"The problem exists independently of the problem of depleted stocks, and we need to address it if we want to regain sustainable fisheries in the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves."
"In fact this is what we are trying to do by virtue of the proposed new technical measures and the communication we are preparing on maximum sustainable yields."
"With regard to the point raised by Mrs Corbey, we are looking at the question of certification and labelling regarding sustainable fisheries by means of the eco-labelling proposal, which we hope to present during the course of this year."
"I would also like to pick up the point that was made by Mr Hudghton, that environmentally friendly fishing methods are in the interests of the fishermen first and foremost."
"However, I would not agree with his point regarding the abandonment of the common fisheries policy, which I consider to be a cornerstone and the very basis of sustainable fisheries in the European Union."
"With regard to the point raised by Mr Guerreiro, let me reiterate that the issue of compensation for socio-economic measures is being dealt with in the context of discussions on the European Fisheries Fund, which I hope will be adopted at the April Council."
"In response to Mr Freitas’s point regarding the Vessel Monitoring System, I would like to state that the Commission considers that satellite technologies offer a powerful means of detecting the presence of unauthorised fishing vessels in closed areas and many protected areas and strongly supports the use of remote control technologies for control of the major part of the European Union fleet."
"The Commission supports VMS purchase and installation costs, and in fact the maximum amount paid during recent years has been in the region of EUR 2 250 for each blue box."
"In parallel, the Commission encourages the use of vessel protection systems which allows identification of the presence of vessels with VMS systems through a satellite image."
"I agree with the point made by Mr Braghetto, Mr Gklavakis and Mr Nicholson on involving the fisheries sector – the various stakeholders and the industry – in the management of fisheries and in the various measures needed to attain and maintain sustainable fisheries."
"I also agree on the need to base our advice on scientific assessments."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Attwooll, Mrs Sinnott, Mr Chmielewski and Mr Casaca for their views and for their very valid comments and remarks."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
"Before moving on to the items on the agenda, I must inform you of something you already know. We will not have the opportunity to listen to President Mahmoud Abbas today."
"A few hours after arriving in Strasbourg yesterday, our guest today, President Mahmoud Abbas, had to return to Ramallah."
"This was of course due to the dreadful and deplorable events that took place in Jericho and which have created a violent and dangerous situation."
"Last night I informed him that Parliament understood perfectly well that the crisis created in Palestine obliged him to return to his country to take control of the situation."
"Destiny and fate have led to a highly symbolic situation."
"His having to leave Strasbourg having just arrived without being able to come to Parliament has something of the symbolism of Greek tragedy about it."
"Mr Abbas represents the majority of Palestinians who still support a negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel despite all of the suffering and all of the disappointments they have been through."
"He represents those people who, despite everything, still believe that it is possible to find a solution by peaceful means."
"He is a man who has been trying to achieve peace through negotiations since the seventies and his presence here amongst us today would therefore have been a golden opportunity to support his approach; another opportunity missed as a result of an unnecessary and illegal military operation and the violence that it has caused."
"The whole world is now wondering why and how such a military operation can help to strengthen Israel's security, why and how the humiliating pictures we have seen on the television or the destruction of that prison by bulldozers can contribute to Israel's security."
"We Europeans will have to pay for a new prison, like so many other things destroyed during these tragic confrontations."
"The violence that has followed this military action is extremely worrying."
"As you know, the news this morning confirms that there are three western hostages, including two European citizens − two French citizens."
"There have been rumours of more kidnappings, but they have not been confirmed."
"Last night, before Mr Abbas left for the airport, I visited him in his hotel and he told me of the efforts he had been making during the day to stop this military operation and to prevent the spiral of violence before it became uncontrollable."
"The President of the Palestinian National Authority asked me to explain to you his reasons for having to return to his country, in order to try to control the situation and to prevent any more kidnapping of Western citizens, which is currently causing huge concern."
"The European Union staff who were controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt have also had security problems."
"Furthermore, I must inform you that President Abbas has promised to return to Strasbourg and to speak to the European Parliament as soon as he can: probably during the next part-session in April."
"If that happens, we will then have the opportunity to hear how he intends to tackle the serious crisis in his country."
"I asked him whether he wanted the speech that he was going to make today to be distributed to the Members of Parliament in writing."
"Mr Abbas felt that it had become out of date and that it was better to see how the current situation develops, and that he wanted to come to see us as soon as that situation allowed him."
"I believe that this is a good time for the leaders of the political groups who wish to do so to speak."
"Some of them have asked to do so."
"Those who wish to speak may therefore do so for the relatively brief period of three minutes."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are all deeply concerned by the events that have occurred in the Middle East, and our group very much regrets that the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is unable to speak to the European Parliament today."
"At your proposal, Mr President, the chairmen of the groups decided to invite Mr Abbas here, because we see him as a man of self-control, conciliation and peace."
"We therefore deeply regret that he cannot speak here today."
"Mr President, you have explained the circumstances surrounding this."
"In such situations, we are really pretty much helpless."
"I would warn against jumping to hasty conclusions: we must be circumspect, and we must not exacerbate the spiral of violence."
"However, we must demand an investigation into the storming of the prison in Jericho."
"We must get an answer as to why this happened, and this answer must be convincing, if indeed there can be an answer at all."
"As I am warning against hasty conclusions, at a time like this it is worth reminding ourselves of the principles."
"We advocate an Israeli state within secure borders, but we also want a Palestinian state within secure borders."
"The Israelis have the same status as the Palestinians, and the Palestinians have the same status as the Israelis."
"I am convinced that, despite the pictures we have seen on television, the majority of people in both Israel and Palestine want to live peacefully."
"We want to encourage everyone to follow this path to reach an understanding."
"We call on all parties to put an end to the violence and to release the hostages – both European and non-European – because human dignity is a right for everybody."
"I hope that the European Union will be able to make a contribution to peace in the region, in an objective, fair, non-partisan statement."
"Our group supports anything that can help bring peace to the Middle East."
"We very much hope – as you said, Mr President – that the time will soon come when the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abbas, can make his speech to the European Parliament."
"That is our heartfelt wish."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the comments made by Mr Poettering and, in particular, by you, Mr President."
"We all deplore the events of the last few hours."
"We particularly regret that Mahmoud Abbas is unable to speak to us."
"We regret it not for our own sake but because he would have been able to come: the fact that he was already here, that he was able to come to this Parliament, that he could accept our invitation, was an encouraging sign, in particular that we are able to receive the elected Palestinian president here."
"In so doing, we were providing a situation in which – as Mr Poettering just said – we are working together step by step towards a Palestinian state, by giving Mr Abbas his due, namely the future leadership of a state, representing his country in the region as an equal partner on the basis of full sovereignty."
"That must be our aim."
"And every little contribution that we can peacefully make to that is a job well done."
"It would have been good if Mr Abbas had been able to take advantage of this situation, but that has now been postponed."
"We quite deliberately say postponed, because we hope that we will be able to welcome Mr Abbas here as soon as possible."
"With regard to the recent events in Jericho, however, which I discussed, last night and this morning with those Members who have been in the area as election observers for the past few weeks, my group is asking the question that always arises in international politics in such circumstances: ?"
"Who benefits from what happened?"
"Of course, we can only speculate about that, and speculation is not an answer."
"However, I do have three questions."
"The first question is: does it actually benefit anybody to storm this prison?"
"The answers we are currently getting from the Israeli media are not adequate."
"I do not think it makes sense that a state whose services are able to carry out targeted assassinations needs to storm a prison when it comes to the potential release of detainees held there."
"Surely there are ways to prevent that without needing to storm the jail."
"My second question is this: Why was this action carried out at all, when international observers were monitoring this prison as part of an international agreement?"
"Why was this international commitment not honoured?"
"Why was it not used?"
"Thirdly, I hope that this action was not motivated by any internal political reasons in Israel."
"It would be fatal if the internal political events that are due to take place in March were the real reason."
"We would find that very regrettable, because it benefits nobody."
"It might bring short-term domestic success, but it would harm the entire region in the long term."
". Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Group, I too regret the fact that Mr Abbas has had to return home in such circumstances and I express my group’s thanks to you for the statement that you made last night on this matter."
"It certainly seems to us that where the tectonic plates of the world’s three great monotheistic religions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – are rubbing up against each other and causing sparks to fly, we need to proceed with extreme caution."
"This House should not underestimate the risk of a wider conflagration in the Middle East."
"The tragic events of 9/11 and the equally tragic response have seriously threatened the chances for continued peace in our world."
"Just as European Union diplomacy with Iran is being undermined by George Bush riding roughshod over the Non-Proliferation Treaty in his dealings with India, so our diplomacy on the Middle East is being jeopardised by the actions of Israel yesterday."
"I hope that the European Union, through the Council and Commission, will protest in the strongest terms to the Israeli Government about these actions."
"There are questions to be asked about whether there was a conspiracy between the British and American monitors guarding the prison who left shortly before the Israelis moved in, and I hope the Council will come back to this House with a report once we know the full facts of the situation."
"Nothing can justify the attack on the prison."
"Nor can anything justify the hostage-taking that followed."
"I hope we will be able to move quickly to restore calm and confidence and I hope that we will be able to see Mr Abbas back in this Chamber in a much more serene set of circumstances, so that we can discuss seriously with all sides how we can create a secure and lasting peace in that troubled region."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Mahmoud Abbas was unable to speak here is not tragic, but hard to tolerate politically, because this would have been a forum for presenting a perspective of the current situation in the Middle East."
"Unilateral policies like the ones currently being pursued in that region lead to catastrophe, and by that I mean the unilateral policies of both sides."
"Unilateral mutual contempt leads to a dehumanisation of action."
"We can see this in practice in that region."
"In principle, we in the European Union, the Council, the Commission and Mr Solana must insist on one thing: there must be no more unilateral politics."
"Israel cannot decide on its own what the Palestinian state should look like."
"That is not on, and the international community cannot tolerate it."
"The Palestinians and their Hamas-led government cannot decide on their own how and when force may or may not be used against Israel."
"Europe and the world cannot simply close their eyes to this."
"If both sides believe that their legitimate position can give them a universally valid right to action, allowing them not to talk to each other and to hold each other in contempt, then the international community must put an end to it."
"That also means that the decision of when and how Israel takes action in the Palestinian areas cannot lie purely in Israeli hands, even in the event of security problems."
"Mr Schulz, it is perfectly clear: there are domestic elections."
"Mr Olmert and the Kadima party said they would return settlements."
"By so doing, they scored points with the left wing."
"Now they want to score points with the right wing, and so they took this action."
"Let us have no illusions: it was pure electioneering."
"The worst aspect of this affair is that the future of this region is being sacrificed for an election."
"I would therefore say to everyone here: we must not deceive ourselves."
"The Israeli action was outrageous."
"The prison in Jericho was no longer a prison."
"That is also the truth. They could hold a press conference with 500 journalists in there."
"I would like to see a prison anywhere in the world – and I have been jailed a few times – where you could hold a press conference with 500 journalists."
"Both were unilateral, unacceptable actions, and we must simply recognise that."
"If you want to release someone from prison – which is quite possible – there are ways of doing so under the rule of law."
"That is what the Palestinians, and Hamas, should have done."
"However, Israel does not have the right to storm an institution just because something is not right."
"Therefore, let us be honest: what we have to fight against is unilateral, arbitrary actions by both sides."
"Mr President, the speed with which President Mahmoud Abbas accepted your invitation showed the importance he attached to visiting the European Parliament, a fact that highlights the seriousness of the decision he had to take to return home suddenly."
"Indeed, he considered that his country could be placed in an extremely serious situation by this new and, as you rightly pointed out, deliberately humiliating escalation in Israeli violence and its inevitable consequences, all of which, like the kidnappings, were totally unacceptable, as well as being, however, unavoidable and foreseeable."
"I think that this matter is of concern to the European Union on several counts, firstly because a Member State, namely the United Kingdom, had concluded an agreement with the United States and the Palestinian Authority under which it would be these two Western countries that oversaw the prison concerned."
"It is that agreement that Israel has flagrantly violated, despite there not having been any problems at all in the prison for four years."
"No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so."
"If, moreover – and I would address Mr Cohn-Bendit now - Israel had thought that there was a problem, President Abbas had proposed to the Israeli Government that the prisoners be transferred to Moukata under proper, indeed international, surveillance."
"There was therefore no excuse or basis at all for Israel’s decision."
"Can we accept that?"
"The second reason why I think this matter is of concern to the European Union is – if I may speak frankly – the EU’s systematically indulgent attitude towards, formerly, Ariel Sharon’s government and, now, that of his successor."
"How otherwise is it to be understood why an aspiring prime minister should dare be so reckless as to risk inflaming the already explosive situation in Palestine and in the region solely in order – and here I agree with my fellow MEPs – to appease the most extreme fringe of his electorate."
"It really is hard to credit."
"If he can allow himself to do this, it is because he knows that, on the one hand, American leaders give Israel carte blanche to do whatever it likes and that, on the other hand, Israel has got used to enjoying de facto impunity, courtesy of European leaders."
"We now have to ask ourselves the following question: given the results of this policy, are we going to continue blithely to look on while this new blow to peace progressively weakens the position of those Palestinians most committed to peaceful solutions including, in the first place, President Mahmoud Abbas?"
"These are the questions that, I believe, we have to ask ourselves."
"For my part, I shall submit three precise proposals tomorrow morning to the Conference of Presidents, all calling for an immediate reaction by our Parliament, the idea being formally to demonstrate our commitment to the rule of law and to a just peace in the Middle East."
". Ladies and gentlemen, this is yet another display of intolerance between two states that we respect but that fail to respect each other."
"An attack on a prison and on political prisoners is never regarded as acceptable anywhere, nor has it ever been in history."
"Even political prisoners have the right to be in prison without being exposed to the threat of extra-judicial judgments."
"Today’s assault on the prison reminds me in a way of the enforcement of just such a judgment."
"Naturally, this event will provoke further reactions and tensions on both sides, leading to what might be described as a ‘never-ending story’."
"I was truly looking forward to today’s speech of the Palestinian President in this House, at the press conference and during our joint lunch, and I expected to learn about the vision that Palestine intends to bring to the negotiating table in the hope of securing peace for the citizens of that part of the world."
"I was hoping, and perhaps expecting, the European Parliament to assume the role of mediator."
"It is my devout wish that we might offer assistance in this way, since both sides now need peace at last."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those moments when one is very uncertain, not knowing what might happen next, and when one is therefore concerned that it might be the start of some negative developments, after we had hoped for many years following the start of the Oslo process that agreement could be reached in this key area of world politics."
"President Abbas, who was elected directly by his fellow Palestinians and therefore has legitimacy, seemed to be taking on a mediation role, in order to negotiate between those who advocate the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist and Hamas, which has not so far recognised this but has won an election, so that Hamas can be brought into the fold."
"I am afraid that it is now obvious that this role is being abandoned and we do not know who else can fill it."
"The action in Jericho was a significant, emotive event, which leads to problems on the Palestinian side."
"However, I am much more worried that the withdrawal of the international observers from the United States and the United Kingdom will lead to the Quartet losing its credibility as a stabilising influence and a guarantor of stability."
"I am afraid that it all goes much deeper."
"On the other hand, Fatah's actions in Gaza showed that those who were previously in favour of the renunciation of violence under Mr Abbas are taking on a new role now that they have lost the elections and have lost their sources of profit."
"And on the other side Hamas is not yet there."
"Those who used to advocate the renunciation of violence are moving away from that position, and the others have not yet reached it."
"That seems to me to be the current situation."
"Both President Abbas and the Quartet have lost credibility in putting things right."
"That is how it looks to me at the moment."
"In our own interests, I hope that this depiction of the situation will prove to be false."
"Mr President, together with my fellow Member, Mr McMillan-Scott, I had the opportunity yesterday evening to spend three quarters of an hour with President Abbas, and I should like sincerely to convey to you how shocked we felt at the latest events and how angry they made us feel."
"You said, Mr President, that these were fateful or chance events."
"In fact, they had nothing to do with either fate or chance."
"The fact that the prison in Jericho was attacked at a period when the Palestinian President was in Europe to plead his cause, taking Saeb Erakat, the strong man of Jericho, with him, owes nothing to chance."
"The current pantomime of half-naked, blindfolded prisoners with their hands tied together owes nothing to chance in a country that, as we know, is in torment."
"The least thing can spark off violence, and caricature is never far away."
"We are therefore faced now with an extremely serious event which, as Mr Brok has just said, is aimed at undermining the man who is the guarantor of stability between Palestine and Israel but who is also the guarantor of resistance to Hamas, which he would see become a force for peace."
"It is these objectives that an attempt has today been made to undermine."
"I do not know who will benefit from this crime, but what I do know is that we in the European Parliament must neither be fooled nor share responsibility for this crime, which we must condemn."
"It is true that the situation is difficult and that negotiations were under way concerning the prisoner, Mr Saadate. It is true that the latter had been implicated in the murder of an Israeli minister, a murder that itself followed on from the killing of a PFLP leader."
"Are we to continue this cycle of violence?"
"No, we must not. We need to keep a cool head, but we also need firmly to condemn what happened yesterday."
"The situation is really extremely serious."
". – Mr President, as you say, I chaired the delegation from this Parliament to the presidential elections in January 2005, when President Mahmoud Abbas was elected freely and fairly by the people of Palestine, and again in January 2006 when the parliamentary elections took place in such controversial circumstances."
"Nevertheless, they were free and fair."
"We find ourselves with a man – Mahmoud Abbas – whose history you have described back to the 1970s, his commitment to peace, and his presence here today in an Assembly of 25 nations, directly elected, representing the very values that we are seeking to encourage in other parts of the world and especially in the Middle East: human rights, democracy, the rule of law, the free media, and so on."
"Speaking as a Briton, and with a deep commitment to the process of peace and democracy in the Arab world, I find it paradoxical, ironic and tragic that the two countries which speak so much about democracy in the Arab world are the very countries – the United States and the United Kingdom – which walked away from that prison, which abandoned their international responsibilities instead of reinforcing the prison’s security."
"We knew there was a problem; they knew there was a problem."
"It was their duty to deal with it."
"They did not: they walked away."
"I hope, Mr President, that, when the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, over which you preside, meets in Brussels in a few days time, we will hear a statement from the Commission and the Council on precisely what happened, why it happened, when it happened and who took the orders."
"There is a case to answer here and a case that may need to be answered to the international community, but starting in this Parliament."
"Mr President, Mahmoud Abbas was supposed to appear before your House today to give a speech, but, for reasons of which you are aware, this speech had to be cancelled."
"It is therefore natural that the leaders of the groups and other important Members wished to speak."
"However, I would like to take the opportunity to express briefly, on behalf of the Council, our deep concern regarding the continuing and escalating violence in the Middle East."
"The Austrian Foreign Minister and President of the Council, Mrs Plassnik, has condemned the violent attacks by radical Palestinians on EU institutions and has also given her support to the appeals by the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this connection."
"The top priority is to restore peace and order and to protect human lives."
"We must remind all those responsible that they have a duty to protect human lives and to free the hostages still detained."
"As Mr Poettering quite rightly said, this is not the time for hasty conclusions."
"The Council, too, will now discuss what specific steps need to be taken."
"I also agree with Mr Schulz, who said that all the institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are duty-bound to act responsibly to ensure that the Middle East peace process does not break down irrevocably, but can continue."
"We call on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to exercise restraint, in order to avoid further escalation."
"In this context, I would also agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that we need to prevent and avoid unilateral action."
"That is not the way to resolve the problems in the Middle East."
"Over the last few weeks and months, the foreign ministers have repeatedly grappled with the problem of the Middle East, most recently in Salzburg last weekend at the informal meeting of foreign ministers, on which Mrs Plassnik will report today."
"Attacks on institutions, hostage-taking and all other kinds of violence do not just contradict our own values."
"They also disrupt and run counter to the peace efforts."
"We hope that, together, we will be able to get the peace process back on track."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I share the widespread disappointment in the House that President Mahmoud Abbas has not been able to deliver his address here."
"I personally had a meeting scheduled with him and am saddened that this has not taken place."
"In any event, Commissioner Ferrero Waldner had a meeting with President Abbas yesterday, and, on the Commission’s behalf, expressed our support for the quest for a peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict."
"Let me state very clearly that we unequivocally condemn all forms of violence, regardless of which side perpetrated it, and we call on all parties to act responsibly and to exercise the maximum restraint."
"We share the concern expressed by some speakers at the extremely dangerous situation in the region."
"We must of course highlight the fact that some Europeans have been taken hostage and that the interests of the EU and of some Member States in the territories have been attacked."
"I wish to point out that nobody has helped the Palestinian people more than the European Union."
"The EU has been and continues to be a donor to the Palestinians, and so we appeal loudly and clearly for violence against EU interests or against our nationals to be avoided at all costs and call on all sides to exercise restraint, in order to prevent the situation from worsening. We shall work together to ensure that the people of Israel and the Palestinian people can live in peace."
"At the end of the speeches, I would like to point out that the Conference of Presidents will examine the proposals that the chairmen of the political groups make and that in ten days time the plenary sitting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will take place in Brussels, marking the end of the European Union’s Presidency of that institution."
"I would like to call upon everybody to ensure that this meeting is used to ensure that the dialogue that everybody has mentioned this morning takes place properly."
"In particular, I would call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that their presence in that Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is a match for the circumstances, because at previous meetings they have perhaps not been as present as we would have liked or as we requested."
"I hope that at that Euro-Mediterranean Assembly the Commission and the Council can present reports, measures and proposals that contribute to the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and the contribution that Europe can make towards resolving the problems in the Middle East, which have certainly not been improved following yesterday’s events."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 142 in conjunction with Rules 132 and 137 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Democracy can only work if the representatives of the people do not personally act in complete disregard of the wishes of the electorate and of the promises they made."
"When we call – as we sometimes need to – for sacrifices to be made, when public budgets get tight, I would like to call on you once again to start your sittings on time; today we once again started five minutes late."
"Your personal behaviour regarding the cumulative delays has already cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro."
"I call on the Members whose central election pledge was that they would use funds honestly – based on the world's leading daily newspapers today, the and the – finally to keep that promise."
"It is pretty hard to take that you are now trying to prevent me from speaking."
"Mr Martin, of what does your point of order consist?"
"Mr President, I made the observation and expressed the wish that you should please try to get here on time."
"Your predecessor Mr Cox saved the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro by doing so."
"The same applies to the committees."
"This wastes EUR 12 million a year."
"We cannot then say that we have no money for important social projects."
"Mr Martin, that is not a point of order."
"I would like to remind you that the time you are wasting also costs the tax-payer money."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order."
"I do not wish to delay the House long, but I have to raise this point because it is a serious matter."
"Under Rule 191(8), relating to the Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member, a petitioner to the Parliament can insist on anonymity."
"However, in a recent case being considered by the Committee on Petitions, the anonymity of Mrs X, a former member of Lloyd’s, was breached, and as a direct result of that, Mrs X is being pursued by the British Government to the full extent of the law."
"This could not have happened if her anonymity had been preserved."
"It is essential, therefore, that this Parliament protect her position, maintain the rights of petitioners and stand up to the British Government."
"The chairman of the committee has written to you as a matter of urgency, but has not yet even had the courtesy of a reply."
"When will you respond, Mr President, and will you protect the rights and privileges of this Parliament and its petitioners?"
"Mr Atkins, you have the right to ask what you like, but not in the form of a point of order."
"The procedure you followed is not the appropriate one either."
"I would ask all of you to use the appropriate procedures laid down in the Rules of Procedure in order to make your points."
"This is not a point of order relating to today's sitting."
"Nevertheless, I shall look into the situation of the letter that you say you have addressed to me and the reply which I imagine must be being dealt with."
"Please do not make use of points of order procedures which relate exclusively to the work of the sitting under way to raise other issues which, however important they may be, cannot be used for the purpose of the kind of requests you are making."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council and the Lisbon Strategy."
"Since we have altered our order of business as a result of the cancellation of the formal sitting, this debate will be extended until approximately twelve o’clock."
"The vote will take place following the debate."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one week before the Spring European Council, today's debate represents an excellent opportunity for us to get together to discuss the key priorities on which this summit will focus."
"As you know, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will be central to the summit."
"It goes without saying that the best way of ensuring the success of such a venture is to prepare thoroughly, and the Council formations responsible for the various topics have therefore examined the priorities of the European Council from their perspective and submitted their contributions."
"The draft conclusions will then be examined in the course of the stipulated procedure."
"On the opening day of the European Council, on 23 March, there will, as usual, also be the Tripartite Social Summit."
"This is intended to ensure cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the social partners, particularly with regard to employment, economic policy and social protection."
"In this connection, we particularly welcome the initiatives of the European institutions for greater responsibility and greater ownership at Community level, as well as the valuable contributions made, for example, by the second interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"A great deal is also asked of the public in this connection."
"The governments of the Member States have the task of better explaining the urgency of implementing this partnership for growth and jobs to their citizens."
"In this respect, it is important for regional and local authorities – within the framework of their country's constitution – and civil society also to be involved in designing and implementing the national reform programmes."
"In this constructive spirit, we also want today's debate to include an open discussion on options for solving the economic and social problems common to the whole European Union and on the important role that you have as the representatives of the people."
"As you will be aware, in March 2005 the European Council agreed on an in-depth renewal of the Lisbon Strategy and also tightened up the procedure."
"The new governance cycle is based on partnership and responsibility."
"As part of their summit at Hampton Court, the Heads of State or Government gave greater political impetus to the newly revived Lisbon Strategy, focussing on the issue of how European values can reinforce the modernisation of the economy and society in a globalised world."
"It is also important that the European Council, at its meeting last December, reached a political agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013."
"That in itself is an important sign that the European Union is capable of finding solutions, although we are of course aware that we are in the process of intensive and difficult dialogue with you, which we want to pursue constructively in order to implement this agreement between the governments in cooperation with you."
"Europe is facing new challenges, including the increasing competitive pressure from outside, both economic and technological, the ageing population, rising energy prices and the need to guarantee energy security."
"Since the end of 2005 there have been signs of slow but sure economic recovery."
"It is projected that, in the three years from 2005 to 2007, six million new jobs will be created in the European Union."
"This would then reduce unemployment by almost one percentage point in 2007."
"However, continuing to reduce unemployment, which currently affects almost 19.5 million people, and increasing productivity and growth potential are still the greatest challenges for the European Union."
"This economic recovery, albeit slight, forms an excellent opportunity to press on decisively with structural reforms in line with the national reform programmes and to pursue greater fiscal consolidation in line with the new Stability and Growth Pact."
"Concrete objectives and timetables are a useful tool for accelerating the implementation of the planned reforms and achieving better results in terms of growth and jobs."
"On the basis of its decisions from Spring 2005, the European Council has adopted integrated strategic guidelines."
"The Member States have then used those guidelines as a basis to draw up national reform programmes corresponding to specific national needs."
"The Commission has presented a 'Community Lisbon Programme', proposing measures that should be taken at Community level."
"The Commission's annual progress report also makes an important contribution to the process of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs."
"All the Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes quickly and thoroughly."
"These programmes are tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of each Member State, and serve to implement the reforms."
"The national reform programmes are a decisive first step in progressing with greater individual responsibility and greater consciousness of the reform priorities."
"All in all, these national reform programmes are a good basis for future work on the reform agenda."
"In the opinion of the Commission, however – and at this point I would quite particularly like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for his institution's work, which is of great significance in the preparations for the summit, and especially for the speed and thoroughness with which they have worked – some of the programmes should include more specific objectives and timetables and additional details regarding the budgetary aspects of the proposed reforms, and go into the issues of competition and the removal of barriers to market access in greater detail."
"The necessary instruments are in place."
"The Member States' top priority for 2006 will therefore be the timely and comprehensive implementation of our objectives."
"For this to be possible, it is vital for the Member States to intensify the measures they have already proposed."
"The Commission has not proposed updating the guidelines for growth and jobs, which means that these guidelines will continue to be fully applicable."
"The focus following the major changes last year should now be on more action and more continuity."
"In line with the new governance of the strategy, the Member States have made real efforts to get the national parliaments, representatives of local and regional authorities, the social partners and other representatives of civil society involved in designing their national programmes."
"We now need to get the citizens of Europe more actively involved in the process, in order to convince them that timely and properly implemented reforms will contribute to greater and better distributed prosperity."
"To do this, we really do need your House’s assistance."
"The European Parliament can help us to give all those involved greater responsibility for, greater ownership of, the Lisbon Strategy and to secure their future participation."
"Debates like this one today are a particularly welcome opportunity to do so."
"In this connection, I would also like to point out that the Austrian Presidency attaches very great importance to the compromise on the Services Directive reached at first reading here in Parliament."
"It is a very well-balanced outcome, and it forms a sound basis for future efforts."
"The sheer number of amendments proposed shows that this issue remains highly controversial."
"In the light of this result and of the discussions to date in the Council, the Presidency is keen that the European Council should now call on the Commission to present its amended proposal as soon as possible and express the hope that the institutions will be in a position to bring the legislative process to a swift conclusion."
"It is the Presidency's intention that, within the framework of the integrated guidelines adopted last year, the European Council should lay down specific priority measures to be implemented by the end of 2007."
"As part of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the spring summit will therefore be devoted to those issues given priority in the national reform programmes and the European Commission's report, namely research, development and innovation, policy for small and medium-sized enterprises, employment and energy."
"Of course, we also need to continue to take action in general in the context of all three strands of the Lisbon Strategy – economic, social and environmental."
"For us to be able to embark on a phase of real delivery and visible results, we need to aim for a good mix of verifiable voluntary undertakings by the 25 Member States and recommendations from the Commission."
"How high we should set our sights is currently still being discussed as part of the preparations for the Council."
"One pillar of the Lisbon Strategy is research and innovation, as the driving force behind production and knowledge use."
"It is now four years since we set ourselves the target of achieving research spending of 3% in Europe by 2010, with a significant proportion of this funding, two-thirds, to come from the private sector."
"It would be a good idea for the resources available from the European Union to rise in step with our own national efforts."
"To that end, we also need to increase cooperation between universities, research and business to help increase research funding."
"As we are all aware, though, we have not really got very far in this area, which is so important for our future – research spending in the EU currently stands at only about 1.9%."
"Our joint efforts with the European Commission have enabled us to develop some momentum and to raise awareness in the Member States that specific goals and voluntary commitments to increase research spending are important."
"In this respect all the Member States have already raised their sights and set their national targets accordingly."
"Moreover, in our fast-paced information society, modern communications strategies play a vital role in promoting innovation."
"In terms of higher education, we would like to call on the Member States, by 2007, to make it easier for universities to access additional private sponsorship and to break down barriers to cooperation between academic institutions and business, in accordance with their national conventions."
"Secondly, more needs to be done to open up the framework conditions for businesses, business potential and, in particular, the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This also needs to be a focus within the European Council."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises form a major part of the European economy and can justifiably be described as its driving force."
"There are around 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, providing almost 75 million jobs."
"Measures to strengthen and promote small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy can therefore make a significant contribution to growth and jobs."
"We also want to cut red tape for SMEs and reduce the time and costs involved in setting up new businesses."
"Mr Winkler, forgive me, but there is usually no limit to the time that the Council and the Commission can speak, but this morning we have timetable problems due to the time we took up during the last debate."
"I would ask you, if you can, to limit your speaking time as well so that the Members can speak."
"I would be grateful."
". Mr President, I apologise if I have spoken for too long."
"I will abbreviate my comments and conclude."
"There is an urgent need for action on a variety of subjects."
"My remarks would be incomplete if I did not mention the labour market, including in particular promoting the integration of young people into the labour market."
"Within the European Council itself, we want to pay particular attention to combating youth unemployment."
"One of our aims is to reduce the number of school drop-outs by 2010 and to ensure that more young people complete secondary education."
"Combating long-term unemployment must also be at the heart of our efforts."
"Finally, the subject of energy will also play a particularly important role, not only because of the importance of the sector in generating jobs and growth, but also, of course, in the light of recent events."
"I hope that, in this respect just as on all the other subjects I have mentioned, the European Council will provide an important impetus that will decisively influence the future activities of all the institutions of the European Union."
"No, Mr President."
"There is no restriction to the time that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission have to speak, but today we all have to share the time available, a scarce and non-renewable resource."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next week’s European Council took place at an important moment."
"We are now seeing the first encouraging signs of greater consumer confidence in Europe: investment is taking off again and growth figures are progressively improving."
"That is good news."
"Let us take advantage of this favourable economic context to take a new leap forward towards our objectives of growth and employment."
"Let us move up a gear."
"Last year, we proposed an in-depth review of how to steer economic policy in Europe."
"We agreed to work together within a partnership."
"We shared the responsibilities among ourselves and refocused our strategy and concerns on the essentials."
"Your Assembly accorded huge support to this new approach, and I should like to congratulate Parliament on the role it is playing in this connection."
"In its report to the spring European Council, the Commission proposed several priority measures in favour of growth and employment."
"I do not wish to go into detail concerning all of the specific measures we propose taking but shall single out a number of themes that I think are particularly important today."
"I am now delighted that 25 national programmes of reform have been adopted, describing how, in terms of the actual circumstances peculiar to itself as a nation, each Member State intends implementing the jointly agreed guidelines for growth and employment."
"Admittedly, not all of the national plans for reform are equally ambitious. Nor, it is true, are they all of the same quality."
"Let us be clear. This is only a first stage, and everyone knows that reports do not create jobs."
"We now need to see political will and determination in putting these intentions specifically into practice."
"That is why, this year, it is time to translate words into deeds."
"During the next few months, the Commission will work in close cooperation with the Member States with a view to helping implement their national programmes and to following these up."
"I am very grateful to Parliament for the role it is adopting in this connection."
"The joint parliamentary sittings held by the European Parliament and representatives of the national parliaments and devoted to the Lisbon Strategy have made a significant contribution to raising the national parliaments’ awareness of what is at stake and have encouraged them to participate in the process."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the fact is, however, that, in terms of the Member States’ taking this new strategy for growth and employment to heart, there is still work to be done."
"Within the framework of the partnership, the Member States draw lessons from others’ experience."
"Everyone has something both to offer and to learn, but I can never emphasise enough that we not only need action at the level of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament but also need actively to involve the national parliaments, social partners, national parties – and not only the European parties – and European public opinion."
"That is a condition for our renewed strategy for growth and employment succeeding."
"Another important issue is that of the free movement of workers."
"I noted that, in the resolution it proposed by way of concluding this debate, Parliament called on the Member States, and I quote, ‘to move as fast as possible towards total freedom of movement for workers and other citizens within the EU and to undertake determined action to promote the quality of work in all its aspects’."
"I entirely concur with this proposal of the European Parliament."
"What is more, the facts prove you right."
"A recent study by the Commission clearly shows that the flow of workers from the Central and Eastern European Member States into the old Member States has, in the main, had beneficial effects."
"That is only one of the reasons why the Commission welcomes the announcement made recently – and, more specifically, after the publication of our communication – by Finland, Portugal and Spain in the first instance and now by the Netherlands to the effect that they were joining Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden in lifting the restrictions on the free movement of workers in Europe."
"I am impatient to see other countries join them."
"In a globalised economy, no Member State can allow itself to go it alone."
"This is not the moment for economic nationalism."
"It is not by employing nationalist rhetoric that we shall be able to build the Europe of tomorrow."
"Defending one’s national champions in the short term generally leads, in the longer term, to relegating them to the second division."
"More efficient companies, which have had to face all the rigours of competition, will overtake the national champions once they appear on the international markets."
"Let us be clear. What we need is not national champions, but world champions that are based in Europe and benefit fully from our internal market."
"Let there be no misunderstandings, however. The Commission will exercise its prerogatives if companies abuse their dominant position in the market."
"The Commission is required by law to protect the consumer and to ensure that the rules of competition are applied, and it will carry out those duties in full."
"The challenge of globalisation calls for a strengthening of the internal market."
"Freedom to provide services is an essential element of the internal market, and we have already said that the services sector, on the one hand, and small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, are the most relevant drivers today for employment in Europe."
"I want to thank you for the result of Parliament’s first reading of the Services Directive."
"You came forward with amendments generally based on a broad consensus which can now move us forward."
"The Commission will respond positively to your consensus."
"Early next month we will present an amended proposal, which will be largely based on this first reading and the discussions in the Council."
"We know that the Austrian Presidency will work on the common position of the Council shortly thereafter."
"I hope that this legislation can then be adopted swiftly, as we need to make progress in this area if we are serious about growth and jobs."
"The energy challenges of the 21st century require a strong and effective response."
"After a long period of relative stability, we can no longer take secure and affordable energy supplies for granted."
"Increased import dependence, higher energy prices and climate change are challenges shared by all European Union Member States."
"Only a European response, based on sustainability, competitiveness and security, can deal with the magnitude of these challenges."
"In the Commission’s Green Paper we have highlighted six key actions."
"We must create a truly single European electricity and gas market."
"We must achieve better integration."
"With better integration comes more solidarity between the Member States in times of crisis."
"We must accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, using both new energies and existing ones to ensure sustainability."
"We must change not just energy supply but energy demand."
"There is considerable scope to use energy more efficiently to the benefit of the climate, consumers and our security."
"Europe is at the leading edge of the development of low-carbon technologies."
"We must stay there."
"We need more European innovation for renewables and everything that concerns environmentally friendly technologies."
"Last but not least, we must foster a more coherent and integrated approach in our relations with third countries and in international fora."
"I sometimes hear people say that a European energy policy is not feasible because it touches areas where Member States have national strategic interests."
"I do not need to remind you that the very basis of the European Community was in fact a common European policy on coal and steel, the two areas which were considered the most sensitive in terms of the national strategic interest of the Member States at that time."
"It is exactly because energy is strategic that we need a European strategy and not 25 national strategies."
"That is precisely the reason why we need that strategy."
"The Green Paper invites everybody to contribute to this important debate."
"I am very encouraged by the good reaction that our Green Paper received and by the very committed support of the Austrian Presidency, and I look forward to strong support from the European Parliament for this new European Union strategy."
"I also want to stress the need for social cohesion to be considered an integral part of the growth and jobs creation strategy."
"The Commission is keenly aware of the need to ensure high-quality jobs and avoid precarious working conditions."
"I believe that globalisation offers major opportunities, but we cannot and should not ignore the pressure on companies and workers resulting from fierce international competition."
"That is why the Commission has proposed a European globalisation adjustment fund."
"That fund will act as a shock absorber to the powerful engine of globalisation."
"It will complement Member States’ efforts to help get the workers affected back on their feet again."
"The important thing is to get people retrained and back on the job ladder in a sustainable way."
"We need to involve social partners in our discussions on jobs and labour markets."
"Europe’s economic future depends on having the best educated and trained people, with a full range of skills and the adaptability required for a knowledge economy."
"That is why we must boost investment in higher education significantly."
"The Commission suggests a target of 2% of GDP by 2010."
"At the same time, we must boost Europe’s research and development spending to 3% of GDP by 2010."
"That means more ambitious national targets and more ambitious measures to achieve them."
"We have some excellent universities and research centres which will really benefit from more funding."
"However, our systems are fragmented."
"There is a gap between higher education and research, on the one hand, and companies and the economy on the other."
"They do not appear to be connected."
"Too many of our top brains are leaving Europe."
"That is why the Commission, in search of excellence, has proposed a European institute of technology."
"A European institute of technology would complement other measures; it would use the resources made available by its participating partners and do so more effectively for their benefit and for the benefit of the entire European Union economy."
"It is an ambitious project."
"I will be asking the Heads of State and Government to endorse this idea and I am asking Parliament for support."
"Airbus and Galileo have shown us the importance of successful European flagships."
"The EIT should be the next one; it is a symbol of a European purpose, but it is not just a symbol: it adds value to our collective efforts in terms of research, education and innovation."
"I am also aware of the need to do more in this area and I believe that this can be a clear commitment now for this knowledge triangle."
"In short, more commitment to Europe will bring more prosperity and freedom to our citizens."
"I warmly thank you for your support so well expressed in your motion for a resolution."
"Next week the European Council must show a similar commitment to growth and jobs."
"The time has now come for delivery, not of more words but of action."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon stands for growth, employment and thus, at its heart, for the competitiveness of the economy of the European Union, and I am delighted at the President of the Commission's personal commitment and at the fact that he is focussing his Commission's efforts in this area."
"I would like to thank him for saying that a return to economic nationalism or – some want to put a positive spin on it – economic patriotism would mean the downfall of the European economy and would result in us not being internationally competitive at all in the globalised world."
"I am therefore grateful for the combative attitude, and I hope you will say the same thing in the Council at the meeting of the Heads of State or Government."
"Mr Winkler, we think very highly of you as a person, and we appreciate the fact that you are here, but when the President of the Commission is here it would be appropriate for the Presidency of the Council to be represented at a similarly high level, by a minister."
"We need to bear that in mind."
"I would like to make it clear that I have the greatest respect for you personally, but the institutions must have equal representation in such debates."
"I say that quite independent of any party-political affiliation."
"This is about the institutions of the European Union."
"The European Parliament gives a high priority to the Lisbon process, which is a continuous process and is not limited to 2010."
"That is why we set up the steering group under the chairmanship of Mr Daul."
"I am pleased that the three largest groups – yes, and maybe one day the others will join in too, Mr Wurtz – are putting this at the heart of their activities, as of course is the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, even though they are not here, and maybe some others too ..."
".... it is true, the leaders are not here, and you should be pleased that I am paying so much attention to them."
"The single market, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, is the precondition for the European Union to be competitive on the global markets."
"I call on the Heads of State or Government and on the governments to take Parliament's efforts regarding the Services Directive as their example."
"To the governments I say: anyone who now wants to achieve something different will destroy this compromise on the Services Directive."
"I therefore call on the governments to take the European Parliament as their example."
"I also welcome the fact – this is not my job, but I am pleased as the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that one of the leaders of the Greens is now here."
"Together we will forge Europe, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"We need the entrepreneurial spirit in the European Union."
"Enterprises are not an abstract concept, and getting involved means making freedom a reality."
"Entrepreneurial spirit means creating jobs."
"We need a positive perspective in this connection."
"Mr Barroso, we welcome the proposal you have put forward for a European Institute of Technology."
"This must involve creating not a big new university authority, but a network between the various European technological institutes already in existence, so that we get added value and so that Europe can really be one of the global leaders in innovation and research."
"You referred to GALILEO and Airbus."
"We need new projects, and to that extent we support your considerations."
"One final remark, as I do not have 15 minutes like the Council and the Commission: at some point, Mr President, we need to think about how we can achieve a better balance."
"I would advocate that this House should work closely with the national parliaments on this issue, because it is our joint task, both nationally and in Europe, to make Europe competitive and to ensure that it develops well economically and in general."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rules 166(1) and 121(2)."
"I apologise for interrupting the debate, but before it began Sir Robert Atkins rose on a point of order which you ruled to be out of order because it did not concern the business of the day."
"He was actually referring to an extremely important issue which is covered by Rule 166."
"When the Parliament’s Rules are being disregarded, it is quite in order for a Member to draw that to your attention."
"Sir Robert was stating that the British Government may well be acting and in breach of Community law as regards a breach of confidence."
"The Committee concerned has written to you."
"I ask you whether it is possible for you to give your reply to Sir Robert Atkins before the vote."
"I should like to remind you once again that I am referring to Rule 166(1) and Rule 121(2)."
"I apologise for this interruption."
"I regret this interruption as well."
"Ladies and gentlemen, from now on, the Presidency will have to be stricter when considering requests for points of order, because, over and over again, you are making use of this procedure for purposes for which it was not designed."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lisbon process was launched, it was the first real attempt, and in my opinion a very well thought-out one, at giving a European response to the challenges of globalisation."
"The starting point used in Lisbon was that we would only be able to survive intercontinental competition and continue to compete with competitors on other continents over the long term if we become the strongest knowledge-based society and national economy in the world – but at European level."
"It was the right step to take, but what has happened since then?"
"Those who decided to take this step cannot decide whether they want to take it at European or national level."
"They are pulled back and forth between the message that 'we can only survive in this competition as a united Europe', which is right, and the message in their own country that 'actually, in principle we are strong enough as a government to do it ourselves', which of course is more popular with the voters."
"The result is that there has not been enough investment in the Lisbon process at either European or national level."
"That is the situation after six years!"
"Mr President of the Commission, I am grateful for what you said, but I also regret that you are keeping quiet on something else."
"There is a gaping chasm between what you have once again described as being necessary as a commitment, including financially, and what happens in practice."
"You and your Commission have described what is needed in terms of funding for the EU over the next seven years, and the Council has adopted a financial basis."
"The problem is, there is a gap of 40.82% between what you asked for and what the Council decided!"
"The Council agreed to 40.82% less than you had requested for the financial perspective."
"Those, Mr President, are the different messages, the different-shaped bricks."
"You cannot build a beautiful house with different-shaped bricks."
"You cannot even build a shack. You cannot even build a ski hut in Arlberg am Lech – or rather Lech am Arlberg – to sing sea shanties in of an evening."
"Welcome to the valley, Mr President!"
"The downhill race is now over."
"The troika on the financial perspective, which we will experience in the next few days, and the subsequent summit once again draw attention to this discrepancy."
"The troika is ruled by penny-pinchers, scraping together every last Euro so that the money cannot be given to Europe."
"Three days later, the Heads of State or Government will meet, and once again proclaim how important the Lisbon summit and the Lisbon objectives are."
"That is precisely what is holding Europe up: there is no coherent, consistent approach to the Lisbon process!"
"In the European Parliament, we have tried to combine the flexibility Europe needs with the social cohesion it cannot do without, because these two aspects belong together."
"If we want to take the people with us – yes, Mr Winkler, you are quite right there – if we want the people to come with us, we must depict globalisation as an opportunity, but also reduce the risk that it could be used to break down social standards."
"With the Services Directive, we tried to say yes to flexibility where necessary and possible, but only if we retain social cohesion."
"I therefore assume that the European Parliament's decision will form the basis for the Commission and Council to continue consultations on the Services Directive."
"I can only warn against deviating from it."
"You made the promise, Mr Winkler, and you said today that you would keep that promise."
"We will ensure that you do, you can be sure of that!"
"It is indeed the case that enough ink has been used up on the subject of the future of the Lisbon process."
"What we need is investment in research and qualifications, so that our best people do not drift away to other continents."
"What we need is investment in lifelong learning, because, if good qualifications are a prerequisite for access to the labour market, then lifelong learning is a basic right that guarantees that everybody has that access."
"Yesterday, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany clarified the desires of young people in Europe using the example of the Erasmus scheme."
"However, Erasmus is one of the points where the Council has reduced the financial perspective the most."
"So, I will say it again: in the Lisbon process, nothing fits together."
". Mr President, more than at any time in the Union’s history there is a disjunction between those who seek to move forward and those who wish to turn back; between those who defend the single market and the Lisbon Agenda as the best means to guarantee long-term efficiency, competitiveness and growth, and those who reject free trade in favour of economic patriotism akin – as Giulio Tremonti said – to that immediately before the 1914-18 war."
"The irony is that this so-called patriotism – thinly disguised economic nationalism – will bring as few benefits to the citizens of France, Spain or Poland as it does to the rest of Europe, for it is fair competition that drives the global market, raises quality and lowers prices, and it is fair competition that protectionism undermines."
"If any company can see commercial logic in merging with another, what business is it of ours to put roadblocks in its path?"
"The great success of the euro, as the President of the Commission has pointed out, is that mergers and takeovers are proceeding apace."
"European industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy."
"These are issues for the Spring Council."
"They are issues for the Commission because the Commission is going to be tested in this climate as a defender and guarantor of the Treaties."
"Faced with an unprecedented assault on the internal market, the Commission must hold firm to the Treaties, hold firm to the basic freedoms and speak out when necessary – as you have, President Barroso, and as Commissioners McCreevy and Kroes have too – and act to defend the Union."
"But defence of the single market falls not only to the Commission; the Council has a role, as we stress in the motion we debate today."
"That means the Spring Council expediting transposition and implementation of the Union’s directives to deliver a single market with free movement of goods, services and capital."
"We want to see the European Council deal seriously with free movement of services, free movement of workers and free movement of capital."
"As they discuss the future financing of our Union, let the Heads of State and Government find the funds necessary for the training of our workforce, for the trans-European networks and for research and development through the European Institute for Technology, which will secure future economic dynamism."
"It is time for our Heads of State and Government to formalise the Council meetings that take place in March and October."
"These need not be billed purely as economic policy summits; the demands of energy security, of peace in the Middle-East and of fighting internationally organised crime are equally urgent and should be on next week’s agenda."
"There should be public discussion too of the Union’s burgeoning defence policy, currently being planned behind closed doors."
"The Austrian Presidency opened to public scrutiny a recent Environment Council meeting; why not make this openness universal practice in the Council?"
"My group welcomes the Commission’s proposal to bring forward a concept paper so that we can discuss defence policy here in Parliament and involve our citizens in the discussion of what our continent can become."
"President-in-Office, a century ago your country had a foreign minister who studied in Strasbourg, restored the old regime and dominated continental politics for 30 years."
"If Mrs Plassnik can emulate Metternich’s achievements, Europe will prosper."
"If she fails, she can always follow his example and flee to Britain."
". Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mr Barroso, as time has gone on my group has realised that the Lisbon strategy is no longer the strategy that was set out at the start of this very interesting process."
"This was very clear in Mr Winkler's speech."
"It is now a very one-sided strategy for growth and jobs."
"The idea that the aim of sustainability and social equity, as set out in Gothenburg, should also form part of this strategy has been completely disregarded."
"Following the discussions I witnessed in the coordination structure for Lisbon and in the light of what we have drawn up as a motion for a resolution, on which we will vote today, I am afraid there is a risk that Parliament is no longer prepared to pursue this ambitious strategy to actually link sustainability and growth together."
"Why do I say that?"
"There is absolutely no willingness to discuss important instruments that would guarantee success."
"In this coordination structure, we tried to discuss fiscal policy."
"If we are not prepared to consider uniform company taxation within the EU, how are we going to solve negative location competition?"
"If we are not prepared to talk about ecological taxes, how will the state be able to promote sustainability in a controlled manner?"
"Some of the Members of this Parliament are unwilling to use the word 'tax' at all: they are afraid of frightening the citizens."
"They make promises to the people, but do not ensure that instruments are set up to put us in a position to actually keep these ambitious promises."
"Let us take an important topical example: energy policy."
"To Commissioner Verheugen, to Mr Barroso, I say this: if you are not prepared to incorporate transport policy into your energy policy strategies, if you are not prepared to put the conservation of resources and efficiency right at the heart of your strategies, and if you continue to focus on prolonging the lifespan of nuclear power stations, then you are doomed to failure."
"You will not reduce dependency on raw materials, and you will not be in a position to secure fair prices on the energy market."
"Just look at the countries where a high proportion of energy comes from nuclear power."
"Is electricity in France and Germany cheap?"
"No, it is expensive."
"With regard to the market, Mr Barroso, I have one request: trust Mrs Kroes's proposals from last week."
"The market cannot currently be applied to energy."
"We need the production and distribution of energy, generation and the network, to be separated."
"As Mrs Kroes quite rightly said, we will only have a chance against the energy giants politically if we actually push the market through against them."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, the Commission generally has the knack of finding evocative patronymics for its programmes: Erasmus, Socrates and so on."
"Well, it could have called its Lisbon Strategy ‘Janus’ after the famous Roman deity, traditionally represented as having two faces: one looking to the future and the other to the past, exactly like the Lisbon agenda."
"One of these faces of the Lisbon Strategy for the ten-year period 2000–2010 is pleasing and calls to mind the conclusions of the 2005 spring European Council with their talk of the need for, and I quote, ‘investing in human capital [which is] Europe’s most important asset’."
"It heralds more jobs – even full employment – as well as better quality jobs."
"It emphasises the importance of research, education and innovation, as well as of having a solid industrial fabric throughout the territory of the EU."
"It even puts forward the objective, and I quote, of ‘halting the loss of biological diversity between now and 2010’."
"That particular face of the European Janus looks towards the future."
"It seems to herald such an era of social, economic and ecological progress that, at first sight, it is difficult to understand why the Commission considers, and I quote, that ‘[a] lot remains to be done to convince people that reforms will contribute to greater, shared prosperity and to involve them in the process’."
"Why, for heaven’s sake?"
"It is because there is the other face of the Lisbon Strategy, this one directed towards the EU leaders’ unrelenting liberal obsessions."
"I would refer to the latest Commission communication with its references to, for example, the need to make Europe more attractive to business, to reforming pensions, the health sector and the labour market and to stabilising the budget, raising the retirement age, increasing productivity at work, ensuring genuine competition in the services sector and promoting increased competition in the electricity and gas markets."
"The Commission even expects the unions to play a role in the proliferation of this liberal strategy and expects Parliament also to convey its virtues."
"We are seeing German civil servants joining forces to protest against longer working hours and lower salaries and Italian employees demanding a thorough review of law 30 and the way in which it blithely generates job insecurity. We are seeing young French people rebelling against plans for two-year contracts of employment enabling bosses to dismiss them at will, female salaried staff in Britain challenging plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years and employees in the new Member States of Central Europe opposed to their countries being considered part of a low cost zone and demanding their rights to social progress."
"The truth of the matter is that the two aspects of the Lisbon Strategy are incompatible."
"The second needs to be thwarted so that the first might thrive."
"That is the choice facing us."
"Mr President, following the French and Dutch rejections of the Constitution, the EU summit decided to arrange a break in which to think about Europe’s future."
"It now appears that this was not a pause for thought but, rather, entailed a change in the order of who is to ratify and when."
"Since the two ‘no’ votes, the Constitution has been approved in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Malta, Latvia and, most recently, Belgium."
"The process is under way in Estonia, and Finland will approve the Constitution before it takes over the Presidency on 1 July."
"A delegation of us from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs visited Helsinki the other day."
"Just one small party, representing true Finns, will respect the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes."
"The Constitution proposes that ratifications be allowed to continue until 80% of the countries have approved the Constitution, at which point a special summit would take place."
"The provisions of the Constitution cannot, however, be the basis for changing the Treaty of Nice, where unanimity is the rule."
"The Constitution is therefore formally dead following the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes."
"In the Netherlands the government has stated that it will not ratify the rejected document, and in France the leading politicians say the same thing."
"It is therefore illegal to continue with the ratifications without a new decision, unless France and the Netherlands are engaging in double-dealing and saying one thing at home and something else in Brussels."
"I should like to ask the Presidency whether France and the Netherlands have formally agreed that the ratifications can continue without changes to the rejected document."
"Would it not be better to use the breathing space to think out new ideas and so prepare a document that people can approve in referenda in all the countries on the same day, a document in which the key headings could be transparency, democracy and proximity to the people?"
". – Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Winkler, and President Barroso for their presentations here today."
"Having looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years, one of the things that strikes me is: what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy?"
"The core elements and goals are still as valid today as they were when it was first agreed: to make Europe the most dynamic and innovative economy in the world by 2010."
"Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing."
"Perhaps we are too ambitious or too wide-ranging with regard to the areas that we want to see included."
"One of the most important issues – brought up by all speakers in this House today – has been the investment in human capital: the issue of training, education and the way in which that leads to further research, and future innovation and development."
"Let us really look at what is happening in the European Union at the present time."
"Look at the human demographic situation, where we have an ageing population, a dropping birthrate in most Member States, and where we do not have strategies to respond to that."
"We need strategies that look to the positive facet of that ageing population, to the experience that they have; but also strategies that are realistic in seeing that people are being denied opportunities to access the new labour market."
"We need to give them the skills and training that they require to work in the so-called digital economy."
"Despite all the honeyed words we may spout here, the reality of who is best able to deliver on those strategies – who is best able to give those skills to young workers, students or older people who want to retrain or re-skill – is that it is not the European Union, but each Member State."
"That is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment."
"When we speak about the European employment strategy, social cohesion and social partnership, it is vital that people are carried along, but it is also vital that people wake up and see the reality of what is happening with relocation of industry – as was discussed yesterday – and the lack of investment in research and development."
"Look at the 20 leading biotechnology firms in the world."
"Nineteen are American and one is Swiss – none is within the European Union."
"If we want to be realistic about being the most dynamic then we must take tough decisions to reflect that position."
"Mr President, the report from the high level group chaired by Wim Kok provides a realistic description of the state of the EU economy, which faces the threat of marginalisation in relation to the Asian and American markets."
"The global market is benevolent towards economic entities that are efficient, competitive and which offer cheap, good quality products and services."
"The direct involvement of Member States and parliaments in implementation programmes can be counted as one of the successes of activities aimed at pursuing the Lisbon Strategy."
"Action related to the energy security programme may also create better, stable conditions for economic development."
"The fact that a large group of people is taking part in the implementation of the strategy may also give rise to optimism."
"The problem lies in the effectiveness of the actions and the resistance shown towards them."
"These actions include the creation of an internal market, a labour market, the right conditions for restructuring and the creation of businesses and the growth of innovation, while simultaneously doing away with unemployment and increasing wages."
"We need a consensus between political groups, trade unions and employers."
"There are particularly significant obstacles to the process of restructuring, organising of the agricultural market and limiting agricultural production costs."
"The lack of viability in some production sectors means that large numbers of holdings are facing liquidation and that there is an increase in unemployment and unused land."
"This is why it is vital to take rapid action to establish an agricultural production system with a guaranteed market, such as bio-fuels and biomass."
"We need a multi-annual programme to adapt farming to new market conditions."
"The process of scrapping protectionism, which does not create but only decreases added value and increases social costs, faces large obstacles."
"Finally, I would like to mention an optimistic quote from the German President, ‘We should make challenges into opportunities for success’."
"I think this is something we can achieve."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish all the institutions the very best for the actions they need to adopt over the next few weeks or at the summit, which must be starting points for the future of Europe."
"The motto for all the sittings in the coming weeks must, as Mr Barroso said, be ‘deeds not words’."
"We call for actions that leave no doubt that we reject particularism, protectionism and the 'charity begins at home' mentality."
"We call for courageous, concrete, verifiable European actions from the Member States for growth and jobs and for energy policy."
"We call on the Member States finally to come into line on the Services Directive and the financial perspective and not to stand still any longer."
"What do we want?"
"First, we want decisive actions, so that the European Union can continue to develop towards a political union with greater courage, credibility and decision."
"A political union is our primary goal."
"Secondly, we need to create a functioning internal market and take action so that it ultimately develops into a domestic market."
"When will we be able to talk in terms of a domestic market for all?"
"When we waste as little time as possible in implementing the four freedoms for all citizens of an EU without borders."
"Freedom and responsibility instead of chains, protectionism, nationalism and partitioning transitional rules – these things are our goal, and they will provide common added value for the citizens of Europe."
"Thirdly, anybody who nationalises rather than Europeanises is throwing sand in people's eyes."
"Where are the initiatives and projects to implement Plan D and to get the people involved in the European project?"
"Fourthly, I also call for codecision with the European Parliament on all internal-market related issues, on issues of growth and employment and on the financial perspective."
"It is evident that the unanimity rule in the Council blocks progress, prevents or impedes European solutions and strengthens particularism."
"That is not what we want."
"Fifthly, we need specific European projects, not just national action plans: the creation of a European research framework, the creation of a European infrastructure, the creation of a European energy market, the creation of a European airspace, the creation of a European establishment and innovation offensive, the expansion of the European education programme."
"For all of that, we want to see projects and actions, not just declarations."
"Sixthly, we do not have a common economic policy, which means that we need to coordinate economic policies much more closely."
"The EU is an opportunity."
"Particularism and protectionism are our own home-made risk."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mr Barroso, a strategy without resources is like Napoleon without an army: powerless and ultimately useless."
"That is the threat hovering over the Lisbon Strategy."
"With a meagre financial perspective, unbalanced national budgets and a Community budget representing less than a third of the American budget’s mere deficit, is the EU reduced merely to making gestures?"
"The draft resolution I have prepared together with my excellent fellow Member, Mr Lehne, indicates a few worthwhile paths to go down, even if our Parliament sometimes refuses to look the truth in the face."
"Thus, the majority of MEPs have ignored the fact that a substantial portion of the United States’s growth surplus in recent years was the result of integrating more than ten million legal immigrants."
"We need a more generous European immigration policy."
"Would such a policy be conducted at the expense of developing countries?"
"According to the United Nations, transfers of money from immigrants to their families represent more than double the amount spent on international development aid."
"The spectacular economic development of India, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong owes a lot to companies set up by former emigrants who have returned home."
"The Europe of research is still to be built."
"It is mainly medium-sized companies that do not invest enough."
"One of the causes of this phenomenon is the excessive bureaucracy hindering access to European funds."
"Another is the lack of cooperation between businesses and universities."
"The latter should be able to obtain more resources for themselves by investing in promising young talent and by increasing the prestige of their research activities through the conferring of associated diplomas and degrees."
"Where energy is concerned, Europe must combine with the other big consumers – the United States, Japan, China and India – in order to counterbalance the cartels and oligopolies that dominate the oil and gas sectors."
"Faced with a market dominated by a handful of producer companies, there is no point in seeking refuge in the mere liberalisation of the European market, especially when such liberalisation leads to the emergence of a small number of so-called European champions which will end up dividing the market between themselves."
"In the case of the American energy market, liberalisation was far from being a success."
"The demographic development faced by Europe constitutes more than just a challenge for the funding of social security."
"The ten or twenty years’ increase in life expectancy for generally fit and healthy populations also presents a great opportunity."
"Strategies need to be devised enabling people to remain active as they get older, as well as to be offered a range of retirement options and to be integrated into the wider life of society."
"Europe needs to stop talking in pessimistic terms about the future and instead to seize all the new opportunities for building the dynamic and inclusive society that the Lisbon Strategy is designed to bring about."
"– Mr President, one year on from the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, it is time to ask once more what stage Europe has reached."
"Unfortunately, the answer to this question is a sobering one; following the political shock administered by the ‘no’ vote against the constitution, we now face the threat of economic paralysis, of Lisbon becoming, like the celebrated woman without the lower half of her body, an attraction in a freak show, for, despite the consensus that the strategy’s implementation is the responsibility of the Member States, it is these that we see committing protectionist fouls in the name of economic patriotism, and this is cause for considerable concern."
"Those who imagine that we could achieve ‘more Lisbon’ or become more competitive with less of an internal market have either lost their grip on reality or are being dishonest."
"Europe’s economic success over the last fifty years was founded upon the four freedoms of the internal market, three of which are now in acute danger."
"This began two years ago when, among others, Germany and Austria imposed restrictions on the mobility of labour from the Member States in the east of the EU."
"It now turns out that countries that did not interfere in labour mobility, such as Great Britain, can testify to the benefits of this."
"Let us consider the free movement of capital. Italy is forbidding the purchase of interests in Italian banks;"
"Poland is opposing the merger of UniCredit and HBV; the French and the Spanish are resisting the takeover of domestic energy suppliers."
"That is particularly ironic in view of the fact that it is in the energy sector that a European approach is called for, for are we to believe that we can have a common energy policy without an internal market in energy?"
"The Commission’s unambiguous words on this subject are much to be welcomed, and it is to be hoped that the Council will follow its recommendations."
"The third freedom, of the provision of services, is also at risk."
"What the watering-down of the Services Directive perpetrated by Germany, Belgium and France means is nothing more or less than that the division of labour in this area is not yet forthcoming."
"Were this to apply to the movement of goods, it would mean, for example, that Renault would be allowed to export its cars to Germany only if they were, once there, to cost no more or less than a Volkswagen."
"And what are we to think of Skoda?"
"Workers in Mladá Boleslav earn less than their counterparts who assemble Audis or Citroëns; is that social dumping too?"
"The logical consequence of the trade unions’ arguments on the services directive is that they should call for punitive customs duties on industrial products from Member States where wages are lower, and it is only a matter of time before they do that."
"I might add that, if you consider the issue consistently, the demands made of the new Member States that they should increase their taxes on enterprises amount to precisely the same thing."
"Lisbon is no more an end in itself than is the internal market."
"What is needed at the heart of the continent of Europe is new growth, and more of it, if the millions of unemployed are to have new hope for the future."
"Giving them that is a matter of obligation – politically, socially, and, in the final analysis, morally."
"Jeopardising the internal market is a sin against the unemployed of Europe, to whom we have obligations, in that it is for their sakes, for the sake of the weakest members of our society, that we have to make Lisbon a success."
"The same is true in the case of older people; this House’s resolution stresses the significance of demographic change, and both the elderly of today and those of tomorrow merit our attention."
"Growth is what is needed to stabilise our social security systems; redistribution alone will not do the job."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mr Barroso, Mr Verheugen, I am an ecologist but I am not going to talk to you about energy."
"I have colleagues, whom you know and who are very skilled in that area."
"I should like to talk to you about the Commission’s role in the Lisbon Strategy."
"On many occasions, you have rightly emphasised the fact that, in order for this strategy to succeed, broad popular support is required, as is the proper involvement of all the relevant players, including the national parliaments."
"With this in mind, the Commission needs, I believe, to send out two clear messages."
"The first consists in saying that the Lisbon Strategy is not synonymous with unbridled competition between the Member States."
"Instead, we champion a model of cooperation and solidarity between the Member States."
"The second message consists in saying that, in a European Union of 25 Member States, there can be no first and second class citizens or workers."
"I shall now give you three practical examples, in connection with which I should expect you to communicate a more proactive stance."
"Firstly, the free movement of workers."
"You have referred to this and published a report – which is all very commendable - and you are very pleased that a number of nations have fallen in with the line taken by the Commission."
"I should expect both the President of the Commission and the College of Commissioners to act in the interests of the European Union by politely telling those states that do not wish to fall in with the Commission or that are reticent about doing so that they are going down the wrong road."
"I turn now to my second example. On the subject of the Services Directive, Parliament rejected the country of origin principle (or COP)."
"What was the problem with this principle?"
"It was an unwillingness to organise the single market by having insufficiently harmonised national rules compete against each other."
"In order to reassure workers, you should now state clearly that Portuguese, Germans and Slovaks working on a building site in Poland must receive the same salaries, and vice versa."
"In other words, the Posting of Workers Directive must be strengthened, and it is your prerogative to do that."
"Now for my third example. When it comes to the issue of taxation development in Europe, the Commission has made progress on the matter of harmonising the tax base within the framework of business taxation."
"In 2007-2008, you are to lodge a report on the European Union’s budget and future resources."
"You should have the political will and the courage to say – and this is a matter broached by other Members – that it is unacceptable for the budget to be reduced to the point where the budget envisaged for young students or young workers is cut by a third."
"In other words, Mr Barroso, I expect you, in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, not merely to take refuge behind the Member States, even if they have an important role to play. I expect you, instead, to go beyond your role of honest broker and, because you have a monopoly on legislative initiatives, genuinely to find the strength to champion European interests, which are threatened by the tendency for nations increasingly to withdraw into themselves."
"– The time has come to listen to the protests and the struggle against the neoliberal measures contained in the newly-reviewed Lisbon Strategy, the consequences of which have been at variance with what was promised in 2000 at the Lisbon Summit."
"With the liberalisation of the markets, the privatisation of public services and the promotion of the flexibility of the labour market, or flexisecurity as the Commission now calls it, being stepped up, what we have seen is lower economic growth, higher unemployment, more precarious work, more poverty and greater inequality in the distribution of wealth, in the name of competitiveness and free competition."
"It is clearer now that the two core pillars of neoliberal policies are the Stability and Growth Pact and the so-called Lisbon Strategy, not to mention the swingeing cuts to Community funds, which have served to turn economic and social cohesion into nothing more than a mirage."
"Consequently, as we suggest in the resolution that we tabled, it is vital that the Lisbon Strategy be replaced by a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development, which will promote investment in research and innovation with the aim of balanced and long-lasting development, in the quality of work in all its aspects, in improving qualifications, in basic infrastructure for supporting industry, in public services, in environmental protection and environmental technology, especially in energy and transport, in improving labour, social, environmental and security laws, in order to achieve harmonisation at the highest levels, and in the social economy."
"A new social policy agenda is also required, with a view to developing a society ..."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso wants the European Union to engage with civil society; Mr Winkler wants to motivate EU citizens."
"But there is nothing more likely to cause observers of the European Union to yawn or sigh or say, ‘oh, no, not again!’, than talk of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Can we not accept that the Lisbon Strategy has sunk, just like the Stability Pact has sunk, which is most unfortunate because that is what underpins the euro currency?"
"If the Lisbon Strategy has not sunk, why do we keep needing to relaunch it?"
"We all want economic growth and jobs; we all want the economies of Europe to thrive."
"However, it must be time to recognise that we do not have the right formula."
"Rather than being the force that drives the necessary reforms, it is the EU with its endless regulations and interference that is holding back the economies of Europe."
"Recent modest improvements in some European Union economies have been achieved the European Union."
"They are more a result of global development."
"The economies of the EU do not need a Lisbon Strategy: they need to be left alone to let markets work and to let entrepreneurs create jobs."
"Can we not see that by continuing to talk about the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union is emphasising its own impotence?"
"Therefore I recommend a period of silence: stop talking about an agenda that, year after year, has been universally acknowledged as a failure."
"Mr President, following the review of the Lisbon process last year the hope arose that the strategy had acquired new vigour, but events of the last six months show that actual action to achieve the strategy’s goals continues to lag behind."
"In assessing the Member States’ programmes for implementing the Lisbon Strategy, the European Commission talks about the duplication of efforts for achieving the Lisbon goals."
"I believe that currently a major advance would be to succeed in reducing by at least half those efforts which are expended on avoiding the Lisbon tasks."
"The most recent glaring example is the Services Directive, which had been intended to impart vital momentum to liberalising the internal market and increasing competitiveness, and also served as one of the foundation stones of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The European Parliament’s compromise text will be able to contribute little to energising the common market, at least not while the Lisbon Strategy is still in operation."
"Similarly, in other spheres we increasingly find any changes and reforms being met by increasing social and political counter-action. Enormous energy is expended on preserving the existing situation and restricting changes and reforms, but in fact reforms to the European Union’s internal market and the intensification of its integration are the main steps that could bring about an environment conducive to implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Little has so far been achieved to provide coordinated financial support for the Lisbon tasks."
"During the passionate process of debating the financial framework, the representatives of the Member States’ governments did not have strategic considerations in mind, and the financial framework demonstrates only a very weak connection with the Lisbon tasks."
"Similarly, little has been done to coordinate the use of the Structural Funds with the Lisbon priorities."
"Use of the Structural Funds and closer coordination of the Lisbon Strategy ought to be achieved both at EU and Member State level by harmonising national development plans with the Lisbon Strategy implementation programmes."
"At the basis of any strategy lies the ability to subordinate short-term interests to long-term tasks."
"For this reason, achieving the Lisbon Strategy will also be dependent on how and when the Member States and the European Union as a whole manage to convince the citizens of the EU of the fact that without achieving the Lisbon Strategy in the long term it will not be possible to achieve the goals of growth and employment."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is meant to turn Europe into the world’s strongest economy, and I believe that there is in this House a broad consensus about that goal, although I would question the way in which this is being achieved."
"I cannot avoid the conclusion that Europe today is still far too much preoccupied with subsidies to the detriment of investment and innovation."
"Not only the various Member States, but also the Commission, bear the burden of responsibility in this."
"Whilst the Commission had proposed to double spending for science and development to EUR 10 billion per annum from 2007, the Council rejected this proposal on the grounds that that would have necessitated considerable cuts in agricultural subsidies, regional subsidies and also structural funds."
"When I think of the European structural funds, I am automatically reminded of the bottomless pit of Wallonia, for example, to which annually, millions of euros are being siphoned, without this ever effecting any structural change, because this is being prevented by an all-pervading and corrupt ."
"This is now also being corroborated by various Wallonian politicians and prominent economists."
"Now, along comes Mrs Danuta Hübner, European Commissioner for Regional Policy, claiming that Wallonia manages to use the structural funds effectively and that the Wallonian projects are typical of the so-called remarkable structural changes that take place in that region."
"Well, given that this is coming from someone who is partly responsible for the follow-up of the Lisbon Strategy, this puts a question mark over the whole thing."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by seizing this opportunity to thank my co-rapporteur Mr Goebbels most warmly for the good cooperation in the steering group, in which we succeeded in producing, for the plenary and for the Conference of Presidents, a draft that is the logical continuation of what we came out with last year when the mid-term review was under consideration."
"As it did then, the House endorses the Commission’s strategy."
"We have, in particular, again made it clear that our ability to realise the other main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the way we want to is conditional upon growth and employment."
"This House has also played its part in setting priorities, three of which are mentioned in our resolution, namely population change, energy policy and innovation."
"My only complaint is about something that many speakers have already mentioned."
"The strategic approach is not our main problem; the strategic approach is the right one."
"Our problem is what happens at the end."
"To put it in quite practical and quite blunt terms, what I see as the most negative aspect is what we always see happening when the European Council gets its hands on this issue: it decides on a good and substantially sound strategy, presents it at a press conference, and it ends up being written about."
"The following day, or perhaps a couple of days later, the finance ministers turn up and take back what the European Council had resolved on."
"That is a fundamental strategic problem, and I have no idea how we are to get on top of it; it plays a considerable part in fostering the perception held by some members of the European public that European policy is dishonest and to increasing public despair with Europe."
"What must be spelled out at this summit is that we cannot apply double standards; on the contrary, policy as actually implemented must reflect the strategic guidelines."
"The last issue I would like to address is that of how the impact of laws is to be assessed – something also mentioned in our resolution."
"We would like to point out that we expect the impact assessment to include an independent factor, thus ensuring that the result really is neutral."
"This is part of ‘better lawmaking’, and this demand is addressed to the Commission."
"– Mr President, 2005 was the first year in which the revised Lisbon Strategy was implemented."
"The strategy is now better known and has been debated in the Member States, and the national reform programmes have been adopted."
"That is progress, but it is just about the only progress there has been."
"Otherwise, Mr Winkler was very bold in stating just now that the Lisbon Strategy had been relaunched."
"In fact, it is somewhat bogged down."
"It is, as Mr Schulz said, held back by a tiny financial perspective and by anaemic growth within the eurozone, as well as by a flagrant lack of investment – both at European and Member State level – in the universities, research and innovation and lifelong learning."
"In the same way, we are struggling to complete the trans-European networks, and renewable energy sources and biotechnologies are still the poor relations where our investment and research efforts are concerned."
"Let us move up a gear, you said, Mr Barroso."
"Getting into first gear would be a start, I am inclined to reply."
"If the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success, it needs resources, a coherent financial perspective with defined priorities, investment on the part of each Member State and a macroeconomic framework that genuinely supports growth."
"As you said, Mr President, there is also, however, a need for people to take the Lisbon Strategy to heart."
"If the growth strategy defined by the European Union is to succeed, it needs to be supported."
"That is why we should be doubly mistaken to give up the social dimension of this strategy and let ourselves be taken down the road of all-out liberalisation, precarious employment, enfeebled social rights and undermined public services."
"To do so would be to weaken the bases of the EU’s future competitiveness and to turn away from a Europe of excellence."
"It would also be to turn Europeans off the European Union and its policies."
"The social dimension is not inimical to competitiveness."
"As we have often mentioned in this debate, the Nordic countries have been able to implement reforms successfully because they have negotiated them and arranged for them to be accompanied both by collective investment in research and innovation and by a new economic flexibility and significant compensation for workers in terms of social benefits, lifelong learning and protection of rights."
"However, all this presupposes that a high level both of tax deductions and of social redistribution will be maintained."
"In the same way, Germany has come up with all the aces where exports are concerned and, in common with other European Union countries, has demonstrated that, even with high salary costs and a system of social protection that is among the most efficient in Europe and among the most extensive in the world, it can remain competitive internationally."
"Let us, then, stop invoking global competition as a way of denigrating the European social model."
"Let us invoke it with a view to investing more in Europe’s assets, in human capital and in research and innovation."
"The route to renewed growth is now basically via consumer confidence, an increase in internal demand, a boost to purchasing power and a fairer distribution of income and added value between shareholders and salaried employees."
"In conclusion, Mr Winkler and Mr Barroso, I should like to say that the European Council will be judged on two counts: on the one hand, the lessons it will draw from Parliament’s vote on the ‘Services’ Directive – there must, emphatically, be no return to Bolkestein – and, on the other hand, freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States within the European Union."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, I take a positive view of the fact that the European Union is using its weight to ensure that the whole is worth more than the sum of its parts, by boosting research and development to release the potential of companies, to foster enlargement and the best possible use of the quality of the labour force, with measures intended to secure energy supplies – but this is all subject to one basic premise: the added value of Europe can only emerge fully if it is the product of the work of a genuinely united European society and economy and if the results are achieved through the ‘core business’ of the European Union."
"The establishment of the single market and of a Community united socially and politically in developing the wealth of its cultural identities is a factor of great importance: there is no single market, no European society able to express its full potential without the physical integration of Europe and without transport infrastructure and services providing mobility and ensuring that every point ‘a’ of the Union has access to every point ‘b’."
"This objective should not be viewed as an almost obsolete one compared to the new challenges we are facing; it is a fundamental premise: there is no research without the opportunity for face-to-face contacts, there is no effective potential for companies if markets are not integrated."
"This is a fundamental precondition that we solemnly promised to achieve by approving resolution 884-2004 here in Parliament one year ago, making a commitment to complete the trans-European transport network as rapidly as possible by 2020."
"Unfortunately, there is no trace of this goal in the Commission’s statement – contrary to the initial proposal – or of what happened last year when they made a sober reflection and guided us in that direction, also urging the Member States to do the same."
"If we also add the Council's proposals for a drastic cut in funding for that sector, making achievement of the goal virtually out of the question, or at least delaying it enormously, we are in a situation of red alert."
"In any event, I view the intervention of Parliament as an attempt to stiffen its resolve and an invitation to all the parties involved to ensure that the trans-European transport network actually sees the light of day."
"My heartfelt appeal today is to avoid a disastrous political error: a true political error since, after resolution 884, intellectual, political and financial energy was unleashed in Europe, with enormous expectation surrounding the idea of continuing the TEN project."
"There is no corner of Europe in which the TEN is not being discussed."
"Today, however, it is one of the items not included – and therefore inadequately supported – in that Plan D that is intended to bridge the interest gap between the European Union and its citizens."
"If we fail to keep our promises or respond to those expectations, the results will be much more far-reaching and serious than those that we are seeking to achieve in the attempt to construct the European project."
"I hope this idea is not approved and that we are able to avoid the disastrous effects that a possible interruption of the project would have on the expectations of many European citizens."
"Mr President, if we envisage Europe becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, we need to boost investment in education and in the field of research and development."
"Unfortunately, Europe now suffers from high emigration of our own researchers towards the USA."
"In today’s Europe the best way for a researcher to excel is by joining a leading American university."
"We need to compete with the USA by improving our policies to help our scholars remain in the European Union."
"We need to launch a European research area, with the aim of analysing and finding ways to improve the field of research and make it a useful tool for the needs and purposes of our researchers."
"I believe we must link the Lisbon Strategy to the Bologna Process in order to establish a good connection between our university system and our economic and welfare policy objectives."
"If we do not improve the current educational and R[amp]D instruments at EU Member State level and at the level of supra-state bodies, what is known as the Lisbon Strategy will prove to be a big failure."
"– Mr President, It goes without saying that the Lisbon Strategy’s goals – of 20 million new jobs, a 3% average annual growth in GDP, and a similar increase in the amount spent on research and development – are the right ones, but I have to tell Mr Lehne that the problem lies not in the destination, but in the strategy whereby it is proposed that we reach it."
"Let us consider the present-day realities: our economic growth is averaging out at 1.5% and we have created only something like a quarter of the new jobs we hoped for – and very badly paid ones at that."
"That is the fundamental problem."
"This is the course we have been steering for six years, and the newly-adopted guidelines, which now have to be implemented as part of the national plans, reflect it."
"Just take a look: in every Member State of the European Union, profits from productivity are going through the roof!"
"But what about wage rises?"
"Wages are staying where they were!"
"How, then, do you propose to stimulate domestic demand?"
"What is done always reflects the idea that social security benefits have some sort of adverse effect on a national economy, yet they do no such thing; they do it some good!"
"In the final analysis, high wages result in economic growth, but policy needs to be thought out all over again."
"What we do not need is permanent deregulation and privatisation."
"We do need competition, but what we need to compete for is higher social standards and higher environmental standards."
"We need to come to the insight that the goods that we produce need to be manufactured in line with international labour standards."
"That is what we need!"
"We will then have a chance of really following through the Lisbon Strategy to the goal we want to reach, and we will not do that by constantly reducing social security benefits in order to give businesses even more freedom; that is the wrong way to go about it."
"Mr President, each year in March, we hold debates in preparation for the spring summit, and since 2001, we have discussed why the Lisbon process fails to meet the prescribed goals."
"To that question, the Kok report, back in 2004, gave an unambiguous response: the Member States must shoulder their responsibility and set down to the task of reforming their economies and their welfare state, thereby making room for sustainable growth and employment."
"Now that economic growth is back on the cards, the necessary reforms are at risk of being shelved, but growth alone is insufficient to keep our social model intact."
"Could the Commissioner indicate what the Commission intends to do to avert this danger and implement the conclusions of the Kok report?"
"I hope that the period of reflection will also be discussed, for that is desperately needed."
"It appears that Europe’s elite is unable to discuss the EU’s future without the excess baggage of a rejected constitution."
"Nine months of reflection should be sufficient for a first follow-up."
"( Mr President, it is a great shame that the high-flown talk of implementing the Lisbon Strategy has come to nothing more than words."
"The Lisbon Strategy relates in particular to the competitiveness of the Union."
"As we all know, increasing competitiveness mainly requires an increase in productivity, which in turn threatens jobs."
"This threat will not materialise if the increase in revenue created by greater productivity is sufficiently high and is not limited to individual countries but also applies to integrated economies such as those of the EU."
"However, increased productivity requires not only the implementation of technological advances, but also the relocation of production from locations where it is more expensive to those where it is cheaper."
"The increase in revenue resulting from these activities will be beneficial to all in the Union, while abandoning the process threatens to result in stagnation and decreased competitiveness, as the world does not stand still."
"Therefore we must choose either certain stagnation or a risk which could pay off."
"We should not be afraid of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is an opportunity for us all."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Our view is that the actions to achieve the Lisbon goals – growth, employment and competitiveness – have been few in number and lacking in clarity."
"More support is required for small and medium-sized enterprises, the core of our industrial fabric, such as improved access to credit, European finance and research and technology programmes, as well as better defence of high-quality European industry against unfair international competition – I refer, for example, to the textile and food sectors."
"We need an energy plan to free Europe from the current geopolitical instability, and maximum attention should be devoted to new sources of energy in order to ensure sustainable and durable development – also on an environmental level."
"In specific terms, we need to invest in education, training, research and innovation in order to render our production processes competitive."
"Finally, we need to safeguard our primary resource – workers and human capital."
"We must not allow our citizens’ jobs and well being to be viewed as less important than the laws of the market and international trade."
"We must not forget that industry must be at the service of the workers, not vice versa."
"Mr President, chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, I do not make a habit of paying compliments, but in this debate it would be really improper not to express any appreciation for the co-rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Goebbels."
"They deserve our congratulations for the draft resolution they have prepared, which is more than satisfactory and which we back 100%."
"It goes without saying that as coordinator of my group in the Lisbon steering group, I would also like to extend my appreciation to the group colleagues who have given the necessary input."
"The discussion of this resolution was far more constructive in Parliament than last year, and I hope that this bodes well for the hoped-for implementation itself of the renewed strategy for growth and jobs."
"The mid-term review seems to be fruitful, the Member States appear to be cooperating, and I wish the most courageous Member States perseverance and the others courage of the conviction to make a start or to pick up pace."
"We also have a responsibility as a European institution, of course, though, and in this connection I welcome the intentions, from both the Commission and the Council Presidency, to deal with the services directive swiftly and in this connection, to respect the difficult balance we have struck after much hard work in this House."
"We are familiar with the nature and extent of the challenge Europe is facing."
"We like to live well in Europe and we want to keep it that way, but in order to make our dream come true, in order to retain our level of prosperity and keep what we call our social model intact, we must become a competitive global player."
"I cannot put it any better than did the German President yesterday: we must be all the better the more expensive we are."
"We must translate our restlessness into creativity and we must have faith that only by changing can we retain the potential to realise our ambitions."
"We know what we have to do."
"Let us act accordingly on all fronts, for there is no other option."
"Mr President, the chairman of my group, the PSE Group, has spoken about the necessity for action now."
"It is time for action."
"I shall focus upon that."
"We all know that we have slightly better economic growth, but 2.2% instead of 2.1% growth a year as an average is not creating enough employment to seriously bring down our unemployment of 19.5 million. I therefore fundamentally agree with President Barroso and the President of the European Council."
"We need more growth."
"I have two short questions."
"Number one: investment."
"President of the Commission, do you envisage that at the forthcoming European Council meeting the governments can get together – perhaps we do not have the capacity and powers in the Treaty to force them – to make a sort of intergovernmental agreement to decide to invest in the next two to three years in the goals you have recommended in your papers and recommendations?"
"If you could envisage that, I would be happy because then we will have taken a step towards coordinated investment action."
"Secondly, I was happy to see that the Employment Council took a decision on flexi-security on the basis of the proposals from the Commission."
"President-in-Office, do you envisage that the conclusions will ensure not only flexibility, but also modern security?"
"In France I see a government which only focuses on flexibility and I have seen the reactions of the young people."
"That is why it is so necessary that we ensure both."
"I would like your response and if you could give us that response today it would be very timely and wise."
"It is time to deliver and I hope that we will all join forces."
"I will do what I can in the European Socialist Party and I know that my colleague, our group chairman, will do what he can to deliver, because it is now time and people expect us to do that."
"Mr President, I want to offer a few general reflections on the whole Lisbon Agenda."
"In my view, it is based on a misunderstanding of the way in which economies – and, for that matter, human civilisations – develop in the course of history."
"There was a period in history – beginning at the end of the eighteenth century and continuing through the nineteenth - when Europe became the world’s most dynamic knowledge-based region."
"It began with changes in the United Kingdom, including legislation on economic issues and the abolition of the guild system. Huge and rapid progress was made, which spread incredibly quickly to large parts of the world."
"Other countries too began to use steam engines and the spinning jenny."
"That is how development proceeds."
"The idea that there might today exist unusually wise people who know in detail what measures European countries should take in order to help Europe develop into a dynamic knowledge-based region is quite wrong."
"It is the countries themselves that try to find their way towards solutions, keeping an eagle eye on each other and copying constructive solutions."
"That is how development proceeds."
"To go on as we are doing now will set us thinking in the wrong way."
"We should occupy ourselves with proper issues in the European Union."
"Mr President, the next spring European Council will have to respond to the challenges of our time, including those presented by the environment and by energy policy. The expectations of our young people will have to be taken into account, and there will be a duty to recognise our ever growing number of older people."
"All this presupposes the adaptation of our infrastructures. Our society is undergoing huge changes, and that is what worries people."
"We need, therefore, to help them out by anticipating the difficulties of the next few decades."
"The all-encompassing welfare state of the Eighties is no longer the answer."
"We have to reconcile flexibility and security, to find other ways of according priority to employment and to give our fellow citizens their confidence back – confidence in their politics and in a Europe that is getting its act together."
"It is a confidence that would spontaneously give a boost to growth, as well as to the birth rate, which is a good barometer of the state of our society."
"It is a confidence that would lead to immigration being considered a great opportunity and that, instead of hampering private initiative, would free it up and encourage and support it. This restored confidence would enable us to train our researchers better and then to keep hold of them."
"It is in the interests of a more successfully knowledge-based society that we should do these things, although, in view of what is happening with Erasmus, there is genuine reason to be worried about the prospects for such a society."
"Finally, this is a Europe that would be without taboos and that would therefore dare to talk in terms of nuclear power and of independence where energy sources are concerned."
"I could give many more examples of what it could do."
"What is the point of speeches, however, without an appropriate budget?"
"We are now told, Mr Barroso, that a choice will have to be made between the trans-European networks and Galileo."
"Is that possible?"
"No, it is not."
"Galileo is needed, and the internal market needs to be completed by means of better communications."
"Allow me, moreover, to put in a word here for the Lyon-Turin rail link."
"I do not, then, want this morning to be the umpteenth occasion for talking about the Lisbon Strategy."
"Words, words, words … It is time to translate words into action."
"I would call on the Heads of Government to take their courage in both hands. The Lisbon Strategy is the only antidote to the various forms of national protectionism."
"Mr President, I shall use this brief minute to concentrate on an amendment by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in which we welcome the proposal by the Heads of Government of six countries that a European pact for equality between women and men be set up."
"We propose measures in three areas."
"We wish, firstly, to reduce the imbalance between the sexes in the labour market; secondly, to make it easier to combine gainful employment and parenthood; and, thirdly, to introduce an equality perspective, to be followed up in all policy areas."
"The purpose of this equality pact is not to create a new process but to reinforce already existing processes, such as the Lisbon one, so that the objectives of sustainable growth, full employment and social justice become attainable."
"The objectives in terms of child care and of being able to combine gainful employment and parenthood are particularly important."
"– Mr President, the meeting of the Council later this month will provide an opportunity for Member State governments to affirm the vital need for reform to proceed more rapidly than it has before."
"On two issues I believe that the Council should speak clearly and forcefully in its conclusions."
"In the light of the Commission document ‘Time to move up a gear’, launched in January, this is certainly not a time for drivers to now run out of fuel."
"I am delighted that Mr Barroso seems to be running on high-octane fuel and long may that continue, but the rising tide of protectionist rhetoric and protectionist actions by Member State governments is unacceptable."
"It is extraordinary that the European Union should still have governments wedded to an outdated protectionist mentality and the promotion of economic and industrial patriotism."
"I welcome the Commission’s statements condemning that drift."
"I welcome the recent comments of the German Economics Minister, who said that we do not need industrial patriotism and said that foreign investors should be welcomed with open arms, not just tolerated."
"If the national reform plans submitted by governments are anything like those provided by the United Kingdom Government, then heaven help us."
"The debate on protectionism goes to the heart of the debate on future economic development."
"There is no room for the policies we have seen of late."
"The time for diplomatic niceties has passed."
"We must allow the voice of small and medium-sized businesses to be heard."
"On the Services Directive, the compromise package agreed by Parliament must be improved upon by governments."
"We have made progress, but not enough."
"The Council should get its act together on the Doha Round and work harder towards world trade agreements."
"I am afraid that at the moment the jury is out."
"I urge the European Council to show the same vigour and determination as Mr Barroso."
"I urge it to avoid the usual fudge at the meeting later this month and give some real leadership."
"Then we can judge it on its resolve and we can then give our verdict."
"– Mr President, even Mr Poettering, in his opening statement today, finds himself obliged to criticise the Austrian Presidency’s representation – specifically the absence of Chancellor Schüssel – and it may well be the case that that absence has something to do with the fact that the news that the Austrian Presidency had to convey is very far from being either something to boast about or even adequate."
"Such a thankless task is one that he is happy to leave to someone else."
"The message is modest and inadequate in terms of the objectives, particularly of the intended reduction in unemployment, if we bear in mind just how much unemployment there is and what we originally intended that the Lisbon process should achieve; it is not merely modest and inadequate, but also false, in terms of the means to be applied – these goals, modest though they are, will not be achieved by structural reforms alone."
"The EU and the Member States must get their hands on more money."
"If you do not pay up, the band does not play – that, too, we learned from Mozart."
"Mr President, a competitive European economy as set by the Lisbon Agenda cannot be built upon insecure gas and oil deliveries."
"It cannot be built on differentiated and uneven access to and security of energy supplies."
"It is contrary to the logic of the single market and competition principles."
"It is welcome, therefore, that security of energy supply constitutes one of the Presidency’s and Commission’s priorities."
"It is high time that the Union undertook concrete action in this field."
"Security of energy supply is crucial for the economic activity and competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole."
"Energy, as we have witnessed recently, is also sometimes used as a weapon for exerting political influence."
"Hence, it should also be considered within the context of foreign and security policy of the Union."
"Recent problems with energy supply expose our weakness, vulnerability and dependence on third parties."
"Therefore it is essential for the EU to develop a true energy security policy."
"If we treat the internal market and the Lisbon Agenda seriously, we should endow our economic operators and citizens with equal access to and security of energy supplies."
"Steps taken by the Presidency, and especially the Commission’s Green Paper, are going in the right direction, although they are too modest."
"Solidarity is one of the main principles of European integration; it creates an obligation to assist all those states that are in difficulty."
"We must extend this principle of solidarity to problems related to energy supply shortages caused by political action."
"What we need in securing external energy supplies is cooperation and solidarity, not competition between Member States."
"Energy security also has a financial aspect: the biggest cutbacks in the Financial Perspective, as agreed by the Council, occurred in the field of trans-European energy networks."
"We have to remedy that situation in the course of budgetary trialogue, otherwise our priorities will remain on paper."
"Energy security also constitutes one of the cornerstones of the neighbourhood policy."
"Close cooperation in the energy security field is indispensable and the most effective confidence-building measure, both within the European Union as well as between the Union and its neighbours."
"Mr President, there are three priorities for the spring summit – action, action, action: action on the fact that over a third of our working-age population is economically inactive, which is a disgrace."
"You cannot embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens."
"We need proactive labour markets."
"We need to take action on the implementation of legislation: too many Member States are not implementing legislation they have agreed to and, frankly, that is a situation which is unacceptable."
"Finally, 13 years after creating the single market, it is time we accepted that there is a European single market which demands European champions, not national champions."
"So, let us see less of the talk of this summit and instead see many more plans for concrete action from Member States."
"Deliver, do not talk!"
"Mr President, this debate is about the spring summit and we have a fine resolution with splendid recommendations."
"After all, the European public are still being promised more growth and more jobs, but let us not pull the wool over each other’s eyes, for paper can wait."
"When after the summit, next week, the Heads of Government return to their capitals, they must also take with them ownership of Lisbon, for it is the Member States, in tandem with the social partners, national and regional politicians, who will ultimately bring about an increase in employment."
"The message to the Member States is both simple and clear."
"The internal market must become a reality, come what may."
"More should be done in the area of research and development; innovation must be supported and education and training must be organised on a more efficient and better-quality footing."
"The Lisbon Strategy also has a social dimension, though."
"We will not become competitive if we reduce our principles and values on solidarity with the weakest, our citizens’ own responsibility, social justice or wages to such a level that we start to compete with our Asian competitors."
"That is not the European answer that will inspire public confidence."
"Reforms are necessary, though. Demographic change, in the shape of an ageing population and a declining birth rate, must be addressed."
"We should summon up the nerve to scrutinise the ways in which social security systems are funded, for the demographic reality is drawing nearer at ever-increasing speed."
"There is no point in pondering an entrepreneur-friendly climate or lifelong learning, if we fail to deliver."
"There is work to be done."
"We have arranged the European structural programmes in such a way as to ensure that three quarters, or 55 billion, will contribute to the Lisbon objectives, and if the funds for those programmes are lacking, or if the Member States are not prepared to pay up, then I have to conclude that growth and employment in line with Lisbon will not be achieved."
"As far as the ageing population and the declining numbers of young people are concerned, we will need to adjust social security and employment policy in such a way that active young people and fit elderly people can make their contributions to society in the near future, to prosperity and happiness for our citizens."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to talk about two of the issues which I regard as highly important to fulfilling the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, or in other words growth and employment."
"The first of these is the completion of the single internal market."
"It seems that the concept of the four freedoms underpinning the European Union is something that, sadly, often exists only on paper."
"We took a very important step here last month with the first reading of the Services Directive."
"I firmly believe that this was a step in the right direction, but I would like to say something about the free movement of persons."
"The report from the European Commission, which has already been mentioned here, stresses that labour mobility, not only between the new and old Member States, but also within the ‘old’ EU, is still insufficient."
"And yet it is precisely this mobility upon which economic growth relies."
"The second of these issues is the approval of the Financial Perspective."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not have the Financial Perspective by the middle of the year, Europe will face a crisis."
"An economic crisis, a political crisis and also, I fear, a crisis of confidence."
"I would therefore call on all three institutions to work hard at this issue so that the Financial Perspective will be, so to speak, ‘home and dry’ by the end of June, or in other words by the end of the Austrian Presidency."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank President Abbas for giving me this unexpected opportunity to contribute to this debate."
"I thank Lisbon for giving us the Agenda, and the son of Lisbon on the Commission front bench for his leadership of that Agenda."
"There is nothing more important to Europe than to ensure that the Lisbon Agenda succeeds."
"That is the way to give our people new hope that Europe will contribute to their futures and that we can cooperate together to give new hope to other parts of the world as well."
"I want to highlight two aspects of the Agenda highlighted in this resolution."
"The first is the health of the people of Europe, because I believe that is a prerequisite of Lisbon."
"Without healthy people you do not have a healthy economy."
"It is important that we look first at some of the health threats that we are facing, including the possibility of a flu pandemic, and at health opportunities such as those now arising from patient mobility, and see these as part of the Agenda."
"As my colleagues have said, we need to look at the ageing population to ensure that ageing is an opportunity, and not just a burden."
"We need to see a healthy environment too as a prerequisite for our economy."
"That too is not a threat."
"The opportunities for business to innovate and meet the demands of the higher standards that we expect in our environment will stand them in good stead vis-à-vis the rest of the world."
"We have the opportunity to lead the world on sustainability, on innovation, on eco-labelling and so forth, and I believe that is a challenge that the Commission must take up with Parliament."
"Lastly, let me give credit and pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency for the work it has been doing in both these areas, in relation both to a healthy people and a healthy environment, because that will lead to the healthy economy that Lisbon can bring us all in the very near future."
"Mr President, on 15 March, Hungary remembers the fight for freedom and revolution of 1848."
"Looking back, we can say that the lasting results of the revolution have been the change in the economic system, the freedom of people and the continuing competitiveness of the country."
"Today, competition is no longer between nation-states, but between continents, at a global level."
"Therefore, lasting competitiveness, too, must be created at this level."
"The European Union needs a serious change in its economic philosophy."
"We must, at last, switch from the outdated, unproductive competition between Member States to a European internal market ensuring the highest level of freedom and human dignity to its citizens."
"The Lisbon Strategy is not only a five-ten year plan, but the foundation of our competitiveness and survival for the next 100-150 years."
"In 1848, politicians understood the message of the times and spearheaded the change."
"I ask the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Prime Ministers preparing for the spring summit to finally understand and implement the message of the 21st century."
"This is what we, European citizens, expect of them."
"– ( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in March 2000, European leaders decided on the shape of Europe in 2010."
"They had understood that the actions of individual Member States would be even more effective if supported by joint action from their fellow Member States."
"Today, the growing gap between European growth and that of the United States and Asia, as well as the ageing of the population, require the Lisbon Strategy to be implemented urgently in order to make up for lost time."
"Moreover, it will be possible to achieve better results by adopting the additional measures and structural changes agreed within the European Union."
"Timely intervention is needed in the sectors previously identified, in order to make Europe more attractive for researchers and scientists, to complete the internal market in order to permit the free movement of goods and capital, and to create a genuine single market for services."
"In order to create a more favourable climate for companies, the recommendations of the European Employment Taskforce need to be implemented rapidly."
"Individual Member States have made progress in some of these sectors, but none of them has obtained positive and lasting results."
"To achieve its goals, Europe must show a far stronger commitment, even bringing pressure to bear on individual Member States."
"The Member States must give up their old national habits and devote more resources to building Europe."
"The citizens must be made to understand that today’s sacrifices are tomorrow’s advantages."
"The European Parliament is a key player in the strategy for growth and in the commitment to build the new Europe."
"It therefore has to act increasingly as a stimulus for all parties interested in relaunching Europe."
"Mr President, we have obviously now driven ourselves into a corner of the Union."
"The majority of the Member States are slowing down the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for totally selfish reasons, and for short-sighted ones too."
"Every week, for example, we lag badly behind the United States of America and Japan in terms of investment in information and communications technology."
"At the same time, China and India are competing with us ever more fiercely."
"We are completely stuck, and we are going nowhere."
"The Nordic countries, however, have maintained peak levels of competitiveness, the welfare state and a large knowledge base."
"That has happened now."
"I would ask Mr Barroso, President of the European Commission, whether it is possible that you have the sort of southern temperament to pass this example on to those who are still afraid of the bold solutions which we adopted a long time ago."
"It has not turned us upside down, and not even the cold winter has made us change direction."
"In other words, it is possible; why should it not be?"
"Mr President, when we discuss the Lisbon process, we can see how different countries are succeeding with it to greater or lesser degrees."
"Those countries that have implemented reforms and changes are coping that much better with globalisation and managing to be that much more competitive."
"Those that have not introduced reforms are faring less well."
"What is remarkable, though, is how little has in actual fact happened at a common European level and the limited degree to which we have given new companies, services and markets more room to expand and products more scope for development."
"The Commission’s primary and overarching task is to combat the new protectionism we see developing among governments and politicians in Europe."
"This new protectionism is directed against the new Member States and the world outside where the big future markets exist. However, it is directed against the old Member States, too, in relations between which it is also increasingly to be found."
"If the Lisbon process is to be managed successfully, the main task is that of combating this protectionism, which contravenes the Treaty and everything that European integration stands for."
"Europe has fantastic potential, and where we have implemented reforms we have been successful."
"Look, for example, at the telecommunications market, where we are most successful of all."
"What the Commission must do is drive home the importance of safeguarding the free trade that is at the root of Europe’s prosperity."
"It should be positive about globalisation, but it should, above all, be sure to implement measures leading to more new companies and new jobs."
"It must be the results that count, and not the objectives."
"Then, we shall be able to give Europe a new future."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, I wish to make just a couple of points."
"In order to achieve the objectives of growth and job creation, gender mainstreaming in the Lisbon Strategy needs to be enhanced, especially in the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines."
"We need to raise the rate of employment among women, develop an active ageing strategy and build a society characterised by lifelong learning."
"The second point relates to the financial perspective."
"There is an urgent need for an interinstitutional agreement."
"There is no time to waste."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament must act quickly to reach agreement."
"The citizens of Europe will not accept any more postponement."
"The time has come to ‘Lisbonise’ the EU and adopt a budget that will promote growth and more and better jobs for all, including women."
"Without women, the Lisbon Strategy will not be a success."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I promise that I shall keep this as brief as possible."
"Many important and interesting things have been said on this subject, and I can assure Mr Poettering and Mrs Berger that the Federal Chancellor, even though he is absent, is following very closely what your House has to say."
"It goes without saying that what you have to say will have an important part to play in the preparations."
"I would like to tell Mrs Berger that my being here today must not be taken as an indication of any lack of ambition; on the contrary, the Austrian Presidency has the ambition of joining with the Commission in achieving great things for the benefit of Europe’s citizens."
"I can also tell Mr Schulz that we are of course well aware of the need to deploy the necessary financial resources."
"We are not talking here only about European resources, but also about national resources, and their quality and efficiency are what matter; for we should not always consider only the quantity of resources, but should also take care that the right resources are deployed in the right place."
"Mr Watson, I certainly agree with you that there are many subjects which the European Council ought to deal with, but with limited time not everything can be dealt with."
"As to your reference to Metternich, I assure you that Metternich is not a role model for us."
"His way of seeing Europe is not the way we see Europe."
"We do not want a directory of five big countries that rule the rest."
"Let us recall that he was the head of a police state, which we do not want either."
"What I would like to tell Mrs Harms is that sustainability does of course play a major role in the European Union, and I can remind the House that the sustainability strategy is to be revised before mid-2006."
"I can assure you that sustainability will also, of course, play a large part in everything that the Council and the Commission endeavour to do."
"I also have something to say to Mr Bonde."
"I would like to firmly repudiate the idea that those states that wish to exercise their sovereign rights by pressing on with the process of ratifying the constitutional treaty are acting illegally."
"I would refer you to the decision of the June European Council, which, in ordering the period of reflection, also stated explicitly that the validity of continuing with the ratification process is not to be called into question."
"I believe that the Council is going full steam ahead in order to achieve the goals we have set ourselves."
"It might very well be, Mr Kirkhope, that the Council does not operate on high octane, unlike the President of the Commission."
"Maybe we operate more on biofuel, in accordance with the spirit of our time."
"Several speakers mentioned, in this context, the Commission’s ‘better lawmaking’ initiative, and for this I would like to thank in particular Commissioner Verheugen, who is here with us today, and encourage him to press on with this initiative, for it is the sort of initiative that the public understand and that brings the European Union closer to them once more."
"Mr Rasmussen and others mentioned the issue of ‘flexicurity’, and I can confirm and emphasise that we are concerned here with flexibility through security as an overarching paradigm for reforms in the fields of labour law and social policy."
"It goes without saying that the intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and security on the European labour markets."
"Mr Titley, I agree with you that action is needed, because this will convince our citizens."
"We, together with the Commission, are determined to take the right steps towards taking this action."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although ‘growth’ and ‘employment’ are the keywords of the Lisbon Strategy, it seems to me that they need again to be clarified."
"When we, in twenty-first century Europe, use the term 'growth', we cannot be talking about any kind of growth other than that which is sustainable, socially defensible and environmentally responsible."
"Anything else would mean that we had learned nothing from past decades, and I ask that that be taken to heart once and for all."
"When the Commission talks about growth, it is talking in terms of sustainable growth, which involves environmental innovation, energy efficiency, competition for higher quality rather than for lower social standards, lower environmental standards or lower wages, so I hope that is now clear once and for all."
"When we talk about jobs, we are not talking about just any old jobs, for we have come to recognise that the great social question of our time is whether we will, in amidst the storms of globalisation, succeed in making available sufficient well paid and skilled jobs."
"That is the big issue with which we have to deal."
"Our concern is not with just any old jobs; what matters is that they should be jobs that will last in times when competition is getting tougher."
"The consequence of that in our present situation is that certain clear demands must be made of the Member States, which must be told quite firmly that the time for a change of course is now upon us."
"Now is the time for us to take – and with all the determination we can muster – the step into the knowledge-based society."
"We cannot afford any societies in Europe whose educational policies exclude rather than foster or discriminate against people rather than integrating them."
"We need an education policy that makes the fullest possible use of this continent’s reserves of education."
"We cannot afford social policies that, while allowing young women to get a good education, do not thereafter give them the chance to make something of it for lack of any compatibility between family life and working life, and we cannot afford social policies that simply spit older workers out of the production process because it is believed that they are no longer needed."
"Today, none of these things is a viable proposition any longer, and our strategy makes that abundantly clear."
"We also affirm that the European single market, a policy that faces up to international competition, is good for growth and employment, and it is for that reason that this Commission does not believe in economic patriotism of any kind whatever. We wish to reiterate that those who want a big European internal market must also accept the fact that businesses are coming into being in order to operate in it without reference to borders."
"If there is to be a European market, there must also be European enterprises."
"The Commission notes with concern the renationalisation of economic thinking in some parts of the European Union and warns against it, for – as almost all speakers today have said – the right way is to address Europe’s problems together."
"I also, though, have something to say to European businesses."
"For years now, we have been pursuing a policy of improving conditions for European businesses, but what we expect of them now, at a time when the biggest of them are doing better than ever before, is that they should be aware of their responsibility for Europe as a business location."
"Businesses are not only under an obligation to make short-term profits; they also have a responsibility for the site where they make them."
"If a company undergoing structural change resorts to making staff redundant, then the primary responsibility for this does not lie with policymakers; on the contrary, we are dealing in such a case with a failure on the part of the business, for businesses can recognise in good time when structural change is going to become necessary and when it has to be set in motion, and we demand of European businesses that they do more to give structural change a positive outcome."
"Laying staff off is always the worst way to handle it, and it is one to which they must not have recourse."
"There is something else we must say to European businesses, however: It is that it is possible to grow by using high business profits to create new products, to develop new technologies and new capacities, rather than only to buy up other businesses."
"I would like to point out – in the most friendly way possible – that all our experience with the buying-up of businesses over the past twenty years has shown, in the vast majority of cases, no positive effect on the business or on the economy as a whole."
"I would prefer it if European companies were to use the huge profits they have made in recent times to invest in new research and production capacities in Europe rather than for funding campaigns to take over other businesses."
"There is also something that members of parliaments need to do."
"It has been complained, and quite rightly, that the general public have not been involved in developing the strategy for growth and employment."
"That is a task for national policy-makers and national parliaments."
"I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to talk to your counterparts in the national parliaments in the countries from which you come, and get this issue put on the national policy agenda."
"It is, after all, no part of the Commission’s business to prompt opposition politicians in the Member States to do their jobs and to ensure that this issue is put on the agenda."
"That is for parliamentarians to do, so I really do urge you to bring your influence to bear here, for only if we succeed in setting in motion a broad political debate in the Member States and their legislatures will we succeed in creating the necessary awareness of the need for a joint effort, not only by policymakers, but also on the part of the public, if our competitiveness is to be unimpaired."
"– Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Commissioner Verheugen for the speech he has just delivered, which was an excellent one."
"With my headphones on, I was able to listen to it, although I have to say, Mr President, that if I had not used them I would scarcely have been able to understand it, the House’s loudspeakers notwithstanding."
"There is no point in you, in your characteristically amicable way, speaking your own language into the microphone to tell the Members to sit down; the fact is that they will not understand you if what you say is not interpreted for them."
"If you wanted to get them to sit down, you ought to have wielded the gavel."
"I would just like to address a request to the House, and I do so as one of its own Members."
"I do not think it is acceptable if we are unable to exercise the very minimum of courtesy and listen to those who address us."
"I hope that everyone here will treat what has been said seriously."
"I accept the criticism and will therefore call Members to order either in a more widely-spoken EU language or using the gavel."
"I have received two motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I just want to raise a small housekeeping point."
"Some of us have received no e-mails since 11 O’clock this morning, except through webmail."
"I do not know how many this concerns, because there is more than one server."
"However, one server is down and it was down for a while yesterday morning as well."
"I believe this is a problem particularly related to Strasbourg, which, of course, is another joy of coming here."
"Could you please ensure that the administration gives priority to solving this problem, which is deeply inconvenient?"
"– We shall bear it in mind, Mrs Ludford."
"Mr President, it was specifically Rule 140 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure to which I intended to refer."
"This states that we are entitled to consult documents directly via Parliament’s internal computer system."
"I should like you to review the agreement with the private company that is supposed to provide this service."
"It is in both our democratic and economic interests to do so."
"– Thank you very much."
"We shall look into it."
"The spring meeting of the European Council looking at Europe’s economy takes place just at the moment of an outbreak of protectionism in a number of European Countries, especially France."
"President Chirac often tries to portray France as a champion of European integration and blames other countries for any perceived lack of enthusiasm."
"Yet France’s record of applying EU law is one of the worst, its attitude to trans-frontier mergers is obstructionist, it has deliberately failed to meet its obligations under the stability and growth pact and it has consistently slowed down the pace of CAP reform."
"The European Council should be an opportunity for other Member States to press France to put its house in order."
"Themes linked to competitiveness and growth have always been at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Today – and I want very much to say how excellent a development this is – the resolution on which we are to vote introduces the social dimension."
"The resolution must not be regarded as extending the time it will take to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy as it will, for example, give all European Union nationals access to a high-level education and to lifelong learning. I would point out the importance of a European exchange programme for apprentices."
"I should also like to emphasise the role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"Such enterprises are among the main sources of tomorrow’s jobs."
"We must therefore provide ourselves with the resources for removing the obstacles that stand in the way of these companies, particularly the smallest ones, and, over and above that, give them resources for innovation."
"Hence, the importance of an ambitious budget for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP)."
"As you will have appreciated, I deplore the lack of a budget to match the ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy and hope that we shall manage to improve the financial perspective with a view to remedying this situation."
"– The next item is voting time."
". – Mr President, I ask that the second part of the amendment be altered by removing the figure stated and substituting a wildcard."
". – Mr President, I ask that the vote on the legislative resolution be adjourned pursuant to Rule 53(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, since the problem of global warming cannot be solved by the EU alone, my oral amendment seeks to enlarge the audience by adding the words ‘and the international community’ after ‘EU and its Member States’."
"Mr President, I should like to table an amendment so as to clarify matters."
"A fund designed to support workers affected by restructuring is going to be set up."
"Mr Cottigny’s report refers to this as a growth adjustment fund, and I propose that, in order to avoid any confusion, we revert to the name used by the European Commission, that is to say a European globalisation adjustment fund."
"Mr President, my group would like to propose an oral amendment to this paragraph."
"Our split vote concerns the deletion of the time-limit."
"We would like instead to insert the words: ‘which should enter into force as soon as possible’."
"This is to conform to the wording which will be proposed in the 2004 discharge report, in paragraph 55."
"Mr President, I wanted to take the floor initially to propose the withdrawal of Amendment 1, which has finally been rejected."
"As regards Amendment 24, I should like to propose to our fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that a word be changed via an oral amendment."
"I should like to replace the term ‘education’ with ‘higher education’ because we are concerned here with cooperation between research, the private sector and higher education."
"I believe I can say that I am tabling this oral amendment on behalf of Mr Lehne and Mr Lambsdorff, who is also in agreement."
"–That concludes voting time."
". It is my view that the partnership between the European Community and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on fishing in the FSM should be concluded in accordance with the proposal for a Council regulation."
"The Western Pacific is one of the richest tuna fisheries in the world and scientific studies show that the current state of stocks is such that it can be extended to third countries."
"The agreement provides for benefits for both sides, and safeguards a sustainable fisheries policy in the FSM."
"Although I lend my backing to this fisheries agreement, I should like to draw attention to the excessive fees for longliner licences, which constitute a prohibitive burden for some shipowners."
"We are highly critical of the EU’s destructive fisheries agreements with third countries and thus regret the fact that the EU is choosing to conclude fisheries agreements with new countries."
"A series of reports has shed light on the harmful consequences of such agreements for the coastal populations of the countries that conclude the agreements."
"The agreements lead to over-exploitation of fishing waters, which hits the local populations."
"Both the Commission and the overwhelming majority of the European Parliament choose, however, consistently to close their eyes to this criticism."
"According to one of Parliament’s opinions, the fishing agreement at issue may, moreover, have harmful environmental consequences."
"At the same time as the EU recommends increased aid efforts, people’s taxes are used to finance fisheries agreements that militate against development."
"This is neither a consistent nor credible policy."
"We believe that the fisheries agreements should be phased out with a view to their eventually being cancelled."
"Those EU Member States whose vessels operate in third countries’ waters should be liable for the costs of the agreements."
"Those same Member States should then decide independently whether they are to fund this expenditure by, in turn, levying charges in relation to their own particular fishing vessels."
"In light of the reform of the common fisheries policy, it has become vitally important to update Regulation No 3690/93 of 20 December 1993. Information on fishing vessels must be brought into line with new rules on managing stock conservation, in order to ensure compliance with the key principle of ‘management of fishing effort’."
"The amendments that are being proposed, such as the introduction of the Community Fishing Fleet Register number and the staggering of the fishing methods used by the vessel, are important elements not included in the original regulation."
"The Commission’s proposal and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur in his report are worthy of my support."
"We Moderates have chosen to vote in favour of the current report, but we regret the fact that the protection of fundamental rights has not been highlighted sufficiently at EU level and believe that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice should extend to individuals’ fundamental rights in relation also to issues concerning internal security."
"Thanks to Mrs Hazan’s own-initiative report on evaluation of the European arrest warrant, we can further increase the legal certainty enjoyed by our citizens."
"The report points to improvements that have been made."
"I wish, however, to emphasise the problems mentioned in the report that still constitute obstacles to guaranteeing legal certainty."
"It is incredibly important for people arrested in connection with the European arrest warrant to be guaranteed legal aid and help in the form of translation and interpretation."
"It is the responsibility of each Member State to solve this important problem that at present leads to human rights violations."
"This report shows that efforts are clearly being made to obtain increased cooperation within the area of criminal law."
"The Council is called on to prohibit the Member States from reintroducing systematic verification of double criminality, as well as to integrate the European arrest warrant into the first pillar."
"The report reveals major problems in implementing the arrest warrant."
"The Member States have clearly shown that they wish to retain parts of the traditional extradition system."
"Some countries have refused to enforce the arrest warrant against their own citizens, citing discrimination or the infringement of fundamental rights as grounds for not doing so."
"Others have retained or reintroduced verification of double criminality."
"The June List believes that these are clear signs that the Member States are safeguarding their sovereignty in the area of criminal law."
"Few measures that can be taken against an individual are as far-reaching in their effects as legal proceedings or the requirement to serve a sentence."
"That is why legal certainty must take precedence over the simplification and efficiency that, according to the report, the European arrest warrant brings about."
"The June List rejects increased supranationalism and believes that this is an issue for the individual nations."
"We have thus chosen to vote against the report."
"As we pointed out in 2001, the Commission put forward proposals on the pretext of the fight against terrorism that advocated the supranationalisation of crucial aspects of justice, thereby sidestepping necessary cooperation between Member States and existing legal instruments such as extradition. This was tantamount to an attack on the sovereignty of Member States and their duty to safeguard their citizens’ rights."
"We said at the time that the European arrest warrant, which is aimed, , at removing the principle of double jeopardy, albeit to a limited extent, would be a Trojan horse that would lead us further along the supranational path."
"The report before us confirms our criticisms."
"It looks upon legal sovereignty as an obstacle and refers to the political authorities’ current ‘interference’ in the extradition process, even on the grounds of respect for human rights."
"It is significant that the German Constitutional Court has decided to annul the legislation transposing the European arrest warrant and that, in light of that decision, a number of Member States have returned to applying the extradition instruments. The rapporteur criticises these decisions and supports the activation of the ‘’ referred to in Article 42 of the EU Treaty, thus integrating the European arrest warrant in the first pillar."
".Like the European immigration policies, the European arrest warrant is very dangerous and fraught with consequences for everyone."
"It is concerned, in actual fact, as much with serious offences as with minor offences (terrorism, theft, deliberate damage, insulting behaviour in meetings, remarks considered racist and xenophobic and so on) and, in every instance, people’s rights are less protected than they were with the extradition procedure that previously existed and that, for its part, permitted the political power either to agree to, or refuse to, extradite a person."
"The arrest warrant has today become an exclusively judicial procedure as a result, on the one hand, of the abolition of the administrative and political phase and, on the other, of the control exercised by the administrative jurisdictions."
"This arrest warrant has been hastily created in response to the attacks of 11 September, and, for the sake of protecting their media image rather than of being sensible and responsible, the EU Heads of State or Government have not hesitated to dispense with everyone’s individual freedoms and rights of defence."
"The European arrest warrant, which was devised by our Eurocrats ideally as a tool to protect the fundamental rights of the person, today appears in its true colours: as a tool of totalitarian repression, which is potentially dangerous for each and every one of us."
". I welcome this report which attempts to evaluate the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), its effectiveness and the problems it has encountered since its adoption."
"The EAW's role in strengthening judicial cooperation and mutual trust is extremely innovative and improves the Member States' ability to fight against organised crime and terrorism."
"I agree with the recommendation that the Parliament should be more involved in the evaluation of the EAW and that fundamental rights in the context of the EAW need to be ensured in order to make sure EU citizens from different Member States do not experience any discrimination."
"– The European Arrest Warrant is yet another link in the chain of measures to complete the institutional network to safeguard the power of capital, within the framework of the Euro-unifying 'area of security and justice'."
"It allows nationals of the Member States to be extradited and it basically abolishes the principle of double jeopardy and the facility for the political leadership to decide on the extradition of an individual, thereby reversing the basic principles and guarantees of protection of individual rights safeguarded under previous extradition law."
"It restricts national sovereignty, in that it questions the right of each Member State to exercise criminal jurisdiction over its citizens, while at the same time touching on basic, constitutionally safeguarded personal rights and guarantees."
"The report calls for even more reactionary changes to the European Arrest Warrant, by proposing that the abolition of double jeopardy be extended, that all rights of the political leadership to intervene in the extradition of individuals for reasons of national policy and expediency be abolished and that all judicial verification of the compatibility of the warrant with fundamental rights be abolished."
"'Terrorism and organised crime' are being used by the European Parliament once again as the necessary pretext, in order to provide a more stable foundation for yet another means of restricting rights and freedoms, to be used against the grass-roots struggle and against all those fighting and contesting imperialism and the exploitative capitalist system."
". It is quite incomprehensible that the Hazan report, as adopted by a large majority in this House today, should testify to such enthusiasm for the European Arrest Warrant."
"What is most objectionable is that it recommends that the judge who is to execute the arrest warrant should ‘not be required to systematically examine its compatibility with fundamental rights’."
"In other respects, too, it is concerned to do away with control by judges."
"This decision takes Europe further down a wrong track of opposition to fundamental rights."
"If decisions, whether or not arrived at by courts, are to be mutually recognised in the absence of uniform standards, then fundamental rights in the European Union will lose out."
"The fact is that the accused risk being mangled in the machinery of the quite totally different criminal law systems that exist in the European Union."
"There is not the least hint in this report of the fact that individual states' – such as Germany’s – attempts to incorporate the European Arrest Warrant into their laws have been rejected by their constitutional courts on the grounds of their plain unconstitutionality."
"Despite that, the Member States are still being urged to ‘act without delay to take the measures needed to remove constitutional or legal obstacles to the application of the European Arrest Warrant to their own citizens.’"
"That means no more and no less than that the German legislators are being called upon to violate their own constitution in order to make it possible for the European Arrest Warrant to be enforced."
". The positive aspect of the analysis of the European arrest warrant is that it addresses one of the most important judicial cooperation mechanisms in the EU, at a time when such cooperation is both increasingly necessary and increasingly more difficult."
"Traditionally, the national authorities have not found it easy to share security-related information, and have had difficulty in cooperating on judicial matters."
"The European arrest warrant goes against this particular grain by seeking to impose cooperation, which is vital, both from the point of view of increased security – it is the most effective way of preventing criminals from benefiting from the advantages of the freedom of movement – and from the point of view of greater legal certainty, which is a similarly fundamental asset."
"That being said, it is unfortunate that Member States need reminding that they must take ‘the appropriate measures so as to avoid any constitutional or legal obstacles to the application of the European Arrest Warrant to their nationals’."
"We also wish to mention, with some pride, that Portugal was one of the first Member States to transpose the framework decision in question."
".I abstained from voting on the Grässle report aimed at reforming the Financial Regulation."
"I believe that, instead of increasing the responsibility of the administrators, which would have meant having greater flexibility and clearer rules, Parliament is further adding to the complexity and bureaucracy."
"All of that does not help to make Community action effective and does not result in the Union’s funds being administered better."
"I do not know of any other public, and least of all private, entity in which 40% of the workforce is involved in financial management and management control."
"The Union will soon have more auditors than auditees."
".A Financial Regulation is the same thing as a financial constitution."
"It is therefore important."
"We must reform this regulation, which is jamming Europe’s bureaucratic machinery, because it is the benchmark or expression of Europe’s pathologically proliferating bureaucracy."
"If bulky manuals are needed in order to understand this Regulation, if a ‘helpdesk’ is needed to come to the daily rescue of those officials who are lost in the maze of its procedures and if businesses, institutes, organisations, small farmers and Europeans cannot take advantage of all of the subsidies or participate in all of the markets, then it is quite simply because the Financial Regulation is based on the fundamental philosophical principle running throughout European integration: the smoke and mirrors principle which, in 1905, the Italian financier Puviani called the financial illusions principle and which consists of using complexity to hide the truth – the European truth in this case."
". I fully support this resolution and urge the Football Association, and football clubs, to help end human trafficking and forced prostitution and prevent international sports events triggering dramatic increases in this horrific trade."
"They must 'Show the red card to forced prostitution'."
"They should work with the clubs to inform and educate the general public, and especially sports fans and supporters, about the scale of the problem of forced prostitution and trafficking in human being."
"Up to 800 000 women are victims of trafficking every year, 100 000 of them in the European Union."
"This is one of the most serious abuses of human rights in the world today."
"Organised criminals are now preparing to exploit the World Cup."
"Thousands of poor women will be lured to Germany by false promises of work, only to be forced into prostitution and a life of misery."
"We need Europe-wide action and the involvement not just of the police and politicians but also of the Football Association, clubs, and the fans themselves."
"I urge all fans attending the World Cup to be alert to this scandal and to report any suspicions of trafficking that they might have."
"We voted in favour of this resolution on forced prostitution, which recognises the reality of the situation in Germany and the need to take the opportunity presented by the World Cup to condemn the trafficking of human beings and prostitution. We have always maintained, however, that forced prostitution is not the right term to use, as it suggests that there is such a thing as voluntary prostitution."
"Of course, the fight against forced prostitution and the trafficking of human beings is very important, but it must not be forgotten that all prostitution is forced, even when there is no trafficking."
"It is the result of poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, precarious and poorly paid employment, and the psychological pressure of the consumer society."
"Prostitution is therefore always an attack on human rights, an attack on women’s dignity and is tantamount to slavery."
"It is appalling that attempts are made to market everything, including the female body."
"Hence our struggle for social inclusion and for the rights of all women to dignity. We also condemn all forms of trafficking of human beings and call for effective measures to guarantee all women and all human beings a dignified life."
"The distinction between legal and forced prostitution is an artificial distinction."
"It is also hypocritical to condemn forced prostitution, because it stabilises and extends legal prostitution."
"Whether prostitution is legal or forced, what is being sold is the human body, as a commodity subject to all the rules of the market."
"The legislative framework regulating the rules of hygiene which must be complied with by registered prostitutes basically recognises prostitution as a profession and manages the problem."
"Thus, in the face of this spiralling social phenomenon, prostitution is being legalised as a profession; in other words, it is being uncoupled from the social causes which produce and reproduce prostitution (unemployment, poverty, impoverishment and lack of social benefits)."
"In other words, the rot in the exploitative system is being concealed and exonerated, and it is rejecting its responsibilities and referring the problem to the individual sphere."
"Prostitution cannot be called a profession or a free choice, because it is incompatible with the value and dignity of the human being, it is the most extreme form of attack on human rights."
"Prostitution, when called a profession, goes on to the career guidance list, as an alternative to the unemployment which affects young women with such barbarity."
"At the same time, it legalises investments in companies on the prostitution market, establishing the porn culture, and promotes the prostitution of young women."
"We say no to all forms of prostitution."
". I welcome this resolution, which, in preparation for the World Cup, attempts to put a stop to the dramatic increase in the demand for sexual services by protecting trafficked women who are the victims of organised crime."
"The resolution stresses the need for an integrated Europe-wide campaign and therefore calls on Member States to launch and promote the ‘Red card’ campaign in close cooperation with NGOs, the police, law enforcement agencies, churches and medical services."
"As well as seeking to inform the general public, the resolution calls on the International Olympic Committee and sports associations, including FIFA, UEFA, the German Football Association and others, as well as sportsmen and sportswomen, to support the ‘Red card’ campaign and roundly condemn trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution."
". In voting for this resolution I am concerned that, in particular, the FIFA World Cup is producing a major and unacceptable increase in the trafficking of women."
"In tackling those incidents, and in general, the Commission and others should ensure that the priority must be to tackle the gangs which force women into these situations, rather than 'softer options' of targeting often vulnerable women forced into sexual slavery."
"We support the resolution because we think it important to focus on measures to reduce the number of victims of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual slavery."
"However, we take the view that the resolution should extend to include all prostitution."
"The term ‘forced prostitution’ might be interpreted as implying the existence of its opposite, so-called voluntary prostitution."
"We believe that all prostitution is forced, for no woman chooses voluntarily to prostitute herself."
"She is forced to do so for one or more of a variety of reasons, for example poverty and unemployment. Above all, however, there are clear links between a woman choosing to prostitute herself and previous physical, psychological and/or sexual abuse."
".I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the Fourth World Water Forum to be held in Mexico City from 16 to 22 March 2006 because I believe that water is one of the key elements of our fellow citizens’ well being and of world peace."
"The European Union must rise to this global challenge, which consists of giving human beings access to this precious natural resource that is water."
"We have a collective responsibility to monitor this issue, which affects the fundamental rights of human beings, animals and plants."
"At the same time, I wonder whether the time has not come to examine whether the Union should reflect on an extensive European water policy in order to guarantee EU citizens, wherever they find themselves on EU territory, a sustainable and renewable supply of sufficient quality and quantity."
"I believe that the Commission should anticipate submitting to the European Parliament and the European Council the report provided for in Article 18(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy."
"Nature provides water free of charge; water belongs to everyone and everyone must have access to it."
"It cannot be a commodity for the profitability of capital, because access to water is a fundamental right, closely connected with health, environmental protection, development and the quality of life."
"The management of water resources must be the sole responsibility of the state, so there can be a universal supply of good quality water at an affordable price."
"The Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico will basically take place under the aegis of the World Bank and its class policy; in other words, its policy of privatising water supply systems, which means a lack of drinking water for the poor, grass-roots classes and new profits for capital."
"The ΕU is promoting the policy of liberalising services within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It agreed on services (GATS) with the other imperialist centres during WTO negotiations."
"The privatisation and destruction of forests and mountain massifs, which are important water storage areas, comes within the philosophy of profitability, which holds basic human needs in contempt."
"We MEPs of the Kommounistiko Komma Elladas express our opposition to the Fourth World Water Forum because, in the face of profit, basic human needs are being held in contempt."
"We call on the working class and the grass roots to fight to overturn the barbaric, anti-grass roots plans of their exploiters."
"– Mr President, in times when dividends and profits are rising, and managers’ salaries with them, the jobs available are doing the opposite and decreasing in number."
"Looking at Europe as a whole, as many jobs are hit by restructuring as by insolvency."
"In Austria alone in recent years, between 15 000 and 20 000 jobs are estimated to have been lost to the new Member States."
"Restructuring is a panacea enabling today’s businesses to depict themselves to the world as success stories, on paper at any rate."
"There has been even more restructuring in the public services than in the private sector, not least in response to guidelines from the EU."
"It is now coming to be realised that there is often a high price to be paid for economy measures, in the shape of lost quality, know-how, competence, staff motivation and strategic potential."
"Despite the great risk of failure if restructuring is used as a substitute for a clear strategy, this is a trend that the EU’s privatisation guidelines and preferential treatment for subsidy tourism has positively encouraged."
"It is high time that it faced up to its responsibility and desisted from further enlargements, to which these developments are in part attributable, and got back to being more concerned about social justice."
".I voted in favour of the report on restructuring and employment because we must continually prove to our fellow citizens that the European Union is the source of solutions with regard to today’s profound economic and social changes, and not the cause of problems."
"The seriousness of the economic and social issues linked to restructuring, and particularly industrial restructuring, requires a strong European policy aimed at reconciling the necessary changes with the Union’s competitiveness."
"I welcome the proposal to set up a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"There was a growing need to be able to reconcile, on the one hand, the inevitable industrial restructuring processes linked to the economic changes with, on the other hand, the protection of the main victims that are the redundant workers and the economic activities that depend on the restructured sectors, foremost among which are sub-contractors."
"Finally, I totally support the idea of having the European Union step in to help those regions that, after having gone through restructuring processes, must move into new economic areas."
".I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources, an enhanced role for the social partners and tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring."
"Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, who are the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned."
"It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the EU’s duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion."
"I regret, therefore, that the EU itself encourages competition among the Member States by allowing social and fiscal dumping to prevail."
".Industrial restructuring is a long-standing and permanent phenomenon, which results from technical progress and improved productivity."
"Restructuring often cannot be avoided if competitiveness, and hence long-term employment, is to be maintained."
"It always has a high social cost, particularly in regions housing traditional industries in which employees who are poorly qualified and not particularly mobile have difficulty in changing occupation."
"The social consequences of restructuring must therefore be alleviated."
"That is why I voted very firmly in favour of the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment."
"I sincerely hope that its proposals are taken up by the Council and the Commission and that they result in practical measures."
"The European Union should adapt its responses, enhance the role of both sides of industry and put in place tools designed more successfully to anticipate restructuring."
"Increased attention to SMEs, the creation of a globalisation adjustment fund, the right to lifelong learning and so on are all measures that should enable us to show the people that the European Union is aware of their concerns and that it is as anxious as they are to obtain genuine social cohesion."
"In the report on restructuring and employment, the rapporteur, Mr Cottigny, adopts the same unfortunate attitude also present in the report on relocation in the context of regional development, which we voted on yesterday."
"We voted against such economic protectionism yesterday and are doing the same today."
"Once again, it is our firm view that it really is not for the state or the EU to tell companies how to engage in restructuring."
"That being said, we obviously must not put our heads in the sand and pretend that the restructuring and relocation of companies does not in some cases affect people and basic social conditions in the area affected."
"We support the demand for closer dialogue between the social partners where these issues are concerned, but we can counter the harmful effects of restructuring and relocation in ways other than that of preventing the private sector from developing."
"Instead, we should invest our energies in improving the basic conditions in which a greater number of long-term jobs might be created by more companies."
".I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on restructuring and employment, which proposes financial resources and an enhanced role for the social partners, as well as tools for analysing and anticipating restructuring."
"Businesses are restructured for various reasons, sometimes for the purpose of defending them and sometimes in order to make them more combative, but the process always has the same effects on employees, namely that they become the adjustment variable where the strategies of industrial groups are concerned."
"It is commendable and necessary that the European Union should be looking into this problem with the aim of anticipating the consequences of restructuring for employees, but it is the European Union’s duty to establish an economic and industrial policy that is dynamic and concerned with preserving and creating jobs for Europeans, as well as social and territorial cohesion."
"I regret, therefore, that the European Union itself encourages competition among the Member States by leaving the path clear for social and fiscal dumping."
".This afternoon, I will be in the town of Le Syndicat in the department of Vosges. An event is taking place there that symbolises the consequences of the policies laid down in Brussels."
"The SEB group is going to close a production unit in the town, since competition from low-price Chinese imports has become intolerable."
"More than 400 employees are out of a job, and that is without mentioning the subcontractors who are losing one of their main customers and who will also have to lay people off."
"This is a labour market area that is devastated by unemployment."
"Nevertheless, the SEB group is doing well."
"Its profits are growing."
"It is setting up overseas and buying up brands and so on, but it is closing down factories in France."
"That is because, caught between bureaucratic and financial constraints – stemming directly or indirectly from Europe - and the unfettered global competition negotiated by the EU, it has no other option."
"It is not SEB that has established the rules of the game; it is Brussels."
"In an attempt to curb the logical outcome of European competition policies (restructuring, relocation and so on), the Cottigny report now proposes a list of bureaucratic measures that will not solve the problem, but rather will accentuate it and cause it to develop more quickly."
"The entire rationale must be changed, starting with the cult of ‘free’ competition coupled with the proliferation of regulatory and fiscal constraints."
"The job market would gain from this being done."
". The EU has for a long time taken political measures to cope with restructuring within different sectors."
"This report contains some constructive proposed changes to these measures whereby, for example, resources paid out from Community funds would be monitored more efficiently and such funds not used for relocation within the EU."
"The June List’s basic attitude is that the consequences of relocation and restructuring are a matter for the individual nations."
"We do not believe that the EU should take measures to ensure that companies accept liability for such consequences."
"Important issues of this kind must be decided on in the Member States."
"The European Parliament wishes, among other things:"
"– to establish criteria governing the conditions under which it shall be permitted to carry out restructuring (in order to save jobs and increase competitiveness and not purely, for example, for the purpose of making a profit);"
"– to set up a special ‘growth adjustment’ fund;"
"– to have the EU accept responsibility for the ‘hidden effects’ of restructuring, such as the consequences for workers’ health, psychological problems among workers and increased mortality among those who are dismissed;"
"– to bring about equity participation by employees so that they might then participate in decisions concerning restructuring;"
"– and to take a dim view of Member States’ requiring workers to take early retirement as a consequence of restructuring."
"No matter what political views are taken in relation to the aforesaid issues, they are issues to be dealt with by the individual nations."
"We have thus chosen to vote against this report."
"The Lisbon ‘strategy’, which is supposed to offer us a brilliant future, will be a bitter failure, and a few extra funds by way of support are not going to save the casualties of an industrial sector that, in my region of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, has seen its jobs destroyed for nothing."
"This is a sacrifice that will not have enabled economic and social prosperity to be exported elsewhere in the world."
"Not only do we not need charity, but we do not need yet another interventionist report designed to correct the bad habits of the European Commission."
"The destruction of jobs in France and in an enlarged Europe will continue, despite our churning out tonnes of paper, which only express our powerlessness and our submission to the rules of unfettered globalisation and of the ultraliberal approach of zealous Europhiles."
"Europe is also suffering from a kind of neo-Marxism favouring more state interventionism, thus adding European bureaucracy to our national bureaucracy, which is already characterised by its administrative red tape and overwhelming emphasis on taxation."
"The driving forces of our economy are fleeing, only to be replaced by immigration on a huge scale, the negative contribution of which is an unbearable economic and social burden."
"We need economic nationalism, the re-establishment of customs and tariff barriers, Community preference in Europe and protection and national preference in France."
". – I have voted in favour of the Cottigny report following the achievement of a sufficient majority for amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which incorporated proposals I had made in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The restructuring of businesses needs to be seen in a nuanced light."
"On the one hand, the relocation of businesses to cheaper sites abroad results in a collision between different enterprise cultures, with the loss of the synergy effects that this is often said to bring about and workers – including those at management level – losing out."
"On the other, restructuring is necessary whenever businesses need to respond to the demands of new markets, the proximity of customers and the need to become more competitive."
"In order that workers in the EU may be better prepared to be as mobile as they will need to be, they need adequate support in further training and retraining and to be involved in lifelong learning programmes."
"It is SMEs that should benefit most from restructuring aid, which must be in line with the Lisbon objectives."
"For the purpose of determining whether or not subsidies are lawful, it must become easier to trace funds back to their source and thereby facilitate the recovery of wrongly-obtained funding."
"Since the structural funds we have at present are inadequate, I welcome the creation, as an expression of our solidarity, of a special fund, amounting to EUR 500 million per annum, for retraining and help with switching jobs."
"There remains, however, the need for discussion of its criteria, since it is envisaged that it will operate only in the case of relocations to non-EU states and where a given business makes more than 1 000 workers redundant."
"Administering it must not result in the creation of new bureaucracy within the European Commission or in the authorities at national level."
". I welcome the report written in response to the Commission’s communication on restructuring and employment."
"The report agrees that restructuring is not necessarily synonymous with social decline provided that such measures are correctly anticipated and managed through good collaboration between the affected firms and trade unions, plus a suitable training policy for workers."
"It calls for support to be given to SMEs and proposes that the financial programmes under discussion for 2007-2013 should be geared more closely to anticipating and managing restructuring."
"To prevent ‘subsidy tourism’, the report argues that firms subsidised from EU funds should not receive any further Community aid for a given period of time if they relocate part or all of their activities within the EU."
". I voted for the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment."
"I voted for paragraph 9, part 2, on the endowment of the globalisation and adjustment fund by businesses as this is a voluntary donation."
". Globalisation is not simply a process of drawing closer together, reducing distances and maximising scale; it is also a process of speeding up."
"These days, everything is about movement and everything moves faster."
"It is therefore understandable that some people are apprehensive about the high-speed nature of modern times."
"The end of a cycle, the dismantling of a model, a break with the past; this is always a time of crisis."
"It is clearly unlikely that the victims of these processes would believe in the virtues of 'creative destruction'."
"This, however, is as real as destruction itself."
"I make these remarks in response to the Cottigny report on restructuring and employment, which falls down precisely because it is out of tune with reality."
"Social structures, especially public ones, must be ready for the impact of the transformations that this time of economic revolution is set to bring. After all, we cannot turn our backs on those who have been excluded from progress."
"Then again, nor does it strike me as desirable to reverse the process entirely."
"Our objective should consist of endeavouring to make the most of this time for our economies and for our citizens, and this is the project on which our efforts should be concentrated."
"The report is constructive in the main and sheds light on many of the problems entailed in an economy geared to short-term speculation."
"I am therefore voting in favour of it."
"However, the report refers in positive terms to the fund that the Commission wishes to set up."
"This fund would involve direct payments to individuals and be the start of a process whereby the EU would assume power over social policy, which would be an unfortunate development."
"If this fund were to be introduced, it would however be helpful if private capital were used to finance a fair share of it."
"I am voting against new EU directives on labour legislation in relation to restructuring because this would undermine the Swedish model of collective agreements between the social partners."
"– ( Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Bauer’s report on social protection and social inclusion and I should like to ask a question to the European Council – that is, to the 25 Heads of State or Government – to which I hope they will reply: why are pensions constantly falling in value and increasingly proving inadequate for subsistence?"
"The reforms that the 25 Heads of State or Government are pushing through are designed to pay ever smaller pensions to our retired population."
"In Italy alone, by 2050, young people will receive a pension of only one third of their final salary."
"I want to send this DVD recording of my voice to the 27 Heads of State or Government, who I hope will clearly say what they intend to do."
"Perhaps abolish the status of retired citizens or provide for the survival of those who have worked in the past but are now too old to do so."
"This report contains a long list of exhortations to the Member States concerning the action they should take to deal with relative poverty in the individual Member States."
"There are obviously good reasons for the Member States to cooperate on issues of this type by, for example, voluntarily sharing experiences and best practice."
"Social integration and poverty are, however, issues that must be dealt with nationally or through voluntary cooperation between the governments of the Member States."
"It is difficult to see what added value or specific competence the European Parliament is contributing by churning out opinions on these and similar issues."
"The report contains proposals to the effect that:"
"– the Member States should increase the opportunities for lifelong learning (paragraph 11);"
"– the Member States should provide access to affordable, good quality care services for children (paragraph 24);"
"– the Member States’ pensions systems should be reformed so as to guarantee social justice to the greatest possible extent (paragraph 44);"
"– reforms of public pension systems in the Member States should not lead to an increase in the total tax burden on labour (paragraph 45);"
"The June List recommends that important issues such as those referred to above be resolved by means of broad national debates, whereupon the Member States should, either independently or by cooperating voluntarily with other relevant players, use the ordinary democratic channels to decide on suitable legislation and other appropriate measures."
"We have thus voted against this report."
". The Commission’s report on social protection and social inclusion confirms that Member States are stepping up their efforts to combat poverty and to ensure that pension schemes remain capable of delivering adequate incomes for pensioners."
"The report points out, however, that more than 68 million or 15% of the EU population were living at risk of poverty in 2002."
"In spite of significant structural improvements in the labour market in the EU, employment and participation remain inadequate."
"Unemployment remains high in a number of Member States, particularly among the young, older workers and women."
"Labour market exclusion has a national but also a local and regional dimension, according to the report."
"I wholeheartedly back the Bauer report, which commends the measures put forward by the Commission aimed at helping the Member States to recognise the difficulties facing people at a disadvantage and to support the integration of such people, to boost job creation, training and career development, the reconciliation of professional and family life and the right to equal access to healthcare and decent accommodation, and to ensure the sustainability of social protection systems."
". I welcome this report which focuses on a number of key policy priorities including: increasing labour market participation; modernising social protection systems; tackling disadvantages in education and training; eliminating child poverty; ensuring decent accommodation; improving housing standards and addressing the lack of social housing for vulnerable groups; improving access to quality services such as health and long-term care services, social services and transport; and overcoming discrimination and increasing the integration of ethnic minorities and immigrants."
"In the final vote, we have chosen to vote in favour of the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure, in spite of our having serious objections where two points are concerned."
"We are opposed to the devising of a statute for Members’ assistants, who would then be in danger of living under quite different conditions than the people with whom they have to work closely in the constituencies."
"There would also be a significant risk of the profession of Member’s assistant becoming a distinctive lifelong career."
"We are also opposed to setting up a Centre of European Houses in Brussels for the purpose of conducting a policy for providing information about the EU."
".I voted against the Grech report, because I do not agree with questioning the establishment of the European Parliament’s headquarters in Strasbourg and the establishment of Luxembourg as a place of work."
". I am voting for the Grech report."
"I voted for both parts of Article 47, because I believe there should be a statute for Members’ assistants by 2009."
"We welcome the introduction of more environmentally friendly fishing methods."
"We are not, however, in favour of the proposal that the EU should introduce a system of support and compensation for professional fishermen affected for the worse by such methods."
"The report makes no mention of any particular sum by way of compensation. Nor does it state from which budget item such compensation should be taken."
"We are in favour of fishermen and their representative associations being involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted stocks (Amendment 1)."
"We are not, however, in favour of the proposal that the suggested compensation measures for fishermen be funded by the Community (Amendment 2)."
"We disapprove of further budgetary expenditure within the EU and have chosen to vote against this report in its entirety."
". Following the previous debate, we welcome the support of the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr Borg, for the amendment that we tabled, which stated that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations who will be applying such measures, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation."
"We also note his openness to considering our proposed amendment, which calls on the Commission to propose socio-economic compensation measures, with the guaranteed Community funding, for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks."
"The majority in Parliament has inexplicably rejected these proposals, which is something we regret."
". A sustainable fisheries sector based on the very latest scientific and technological research is crucial if we are to meet one of the EU’s main objectives, namely an exploitation of living marine resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"This Commission communication is a step in the right direction, playing a stronger role in promoting the ecologically sustainable management of fisheries."
"I should like to reiterate the importance of these measures for fishermen; making any economic activity more environmentally-friendly is in their interest because it would guarantee healthy fish stocks to them."
"Given that these measures could have a significant socio-economic impact in the short term, the interested parties should be involved in the planned reforms and we should look into ways of compensating fishermen adversely affected, in the short and medium term, by environmentally-friendly fishing."
"In light of the points I have mentioned, I feel that the content of the communication before us makes a relevant and significant contribution towards building a positive future, for those whose livelihoods depend on fisheries and for environmental protection."
".I naturally voted in favour of this report, which encourages fishing methods that are more respectful of the environment."
"The priority today is to achieve a reduction in the intensity of fishing activity in order to allow stocks to replenish."
"This is a sensitive subject, we know, but it is urgent."
"46% of the 28 000 species of fish surveyed in the world are threatened."
"Furthermore, the United Nations programme for the assessment of ecosystems stresses that 25% of commercial species are over-exploited."
"We must clearly take account of socio-economic imperatives and not penalise the fishing sector, which is already subject to excessive constraints."
"Reducing fishing activity is acceptable if it is linked to compensations."
"However, other measures may provide significant results, such as strengthening the fight against pollution from ships or promoting sustainable fishing methods."
"The sustainability of fisheries resources is an essential objective, and that is the principle upon which my opinion report on the Commission’s communication on a Community approach towards the eco-labelling of fisheries products is based."
". I support the goal of modernising the European economy through the Lisbon partnership for growth and employment."
"I accept that this strategy also has to be seen in the wider context of sustainable development requirements - that our current needs have to be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
"Undoubtedly Europe has the resources to sustain our high living standards, but we need to take action to unlock them."
"I would like it to be on the record that while I support the overall objective of Parliament's resolution on the Spring Summit 2006, I do not support amendments which state that nuclear energy is a viable alternative to Europe's current energy dependency."
"Ireland in no way supports the use of nuclear energy."
". Almost a year has passed since the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, agreed by the Spring European Council last March."
"In its Annual Interim Report on the Lisbon Strategy published on 25 January ahead of the next Spring European Council, the Commission says that although it recognises the significant progress made since then, the priority is now to produce results and the time has come to speed up the reforms."
"Accordingly, it has identified four priority areas for action, whereby EU Heads of State or Government must commit themselves to taking the following specific additional measures, at national and European level: greater investment in education and innovation; unlocking business potential, especially SMEs; responding to the challenges of globalisation and the ageing of the population; and setting the wheels of an affective, integrated European energy policy in motion."
"The motion for a resolution before us offers comments and suggestions on the four priority action areas, which I wholeheartedly support. I therefore voted in favour."
". Although I am disappointed that the resolution that we tabled was rejected, it is worth pointing out that some 100 Members of the House either voted in favour (79) or abstained (20), which is more than double the number of members of our group and indeed more than the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance put together."
"It was similarly significant that an even bigger number refused to vote for the joint resolution, which was nevertheless adopted by the majority."
"Experience has taught us that the open coordination method provided for in the Lisbon Strategy has not reduced poverty."
"As a result of the Lisbon Strategy, the priorities have been liberalisation and privatisation of public sectors and services."
"Given that poverty is a violation of human rights, greater attention must be paid to its causes. Accordingly, the necessary measures must be taken to promote social inclusion, as viewed from a multidisciplinary perspective."
"We therefore advocate replacing the Stability and Growth Pact with a genuine development and progress pact, and the Lisbon Strategy with a proper economic and social cohesion strategy. In turn, we believe that the accent should not be placed on the proposal for a directive on the creation of the internal market for services."
". I will be supporting this resolution, along with my colleagues in the Socialist Group and the Labour delegation, but nevertheless I must point out a key omission in the section on energy policy, namely tidal power."
"Global warming pushes us away from conventional power, while safety and security concerns threaten nuclear power."
"The gap can be filled with renewables only with great difficulty, whether solar, wind or biofuels."
"The one opportunity that is being neglected is tidal power."
"The French built the power station across La Ranche estuary demonstrating the technology; in the UK both the Mersey, on a small scale, and the Severn, on a massive scale, are suitable sites."
"The Severn scheme alone could supply nearly 10% of Britain's energy needs."
"Why are we neglecting 'big' renewables in favour of covering our hillsides with windmills and our roofs with solar panels?"
". – As a general rule, this Parliament’s resolutions on the preparations for European Councils consist of a litany of desiderata to the governments and the Commission."
"What they have in common is that they never point out that the difficulties being experienced by our countries are caused by European integration, and always call for more interference by Brussels in the policies of the Member States."
"Salvation cannot come from the Europe of Brussels, because the majority of the problems mentioned in this text come from there."
"For example, we are now at a point where the problems resulting from the liberalisation of the internal energy market – which Brussels wanted and which was based upon the sole and sacrosanct principle of competition – are prompting Members of Parliament to call for a common energy policy, even a single policy. This field of action is not provided for in the Treaties, however, and there is good for reason for that: the opposition of the governments, which are aware of the strategic importance of this sector and of their diverging interests."
"The general impression is that European integration, as it stands today, is an end in itself and that it feeds off the negative consequences of its own mistakes."
"We must put an end to this vicious circle."
"In this resolution, the European Parliament enters into areas that it is for the parliaments of the Member States to attend to in order to achieve the agreed European targets concerning increased growth and employment."
"The basis of the Lisbon Strategy is that the Member States should implement what has been agreed on."
"The Lisbon Strategy must not be used as an argument for constantly demanding increased appropriations to the EU’s budget."
"The June List believes instead that the respective Member States’ budgets must make provision for the Lisbon Strategy."
"Paragraph 3 of the resolution states that the EU’s budget must be increased if the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are to be achieved."
"For that reason, we are choosing to vote against the resolution."
"The resolution contains many positive proposals but is based on the EU having a financial perspective that we do not support."
"Responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Strategy lies with the Member States, which is why it is important for their contributions to the EU not to be increased. Rather, they should have scope themselves for taking care of what is required by the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have therefore voted against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
". What will take place on 16 and 17 March could be termed the employers’ general assembly, and it is no coincidence that it has been scheduled for shortly before the European Council."
"It will be attended by the Austrian Chancellor and President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Commissioners, along with the big guns from business, industry, the environment, research and the media, not to mention government representatives from the so-called national reform programmes."
"The captains of industry will set out their wish list calling for the implementation of the so-called structural reforms, which is a euphemism for the politics of the Right, the true meaning of which is well known to the workers: that is, more precarious work, lower salaries, longer working life and working hours, later pensionable age, the dismantling and subsequent liberalisation and privatisation of public services, with the accent on energy and communications, social security, health and education, and research, with exploitation, unemployment and poverty following in its wake."
"The majority in Parliament has joined forces to adopt this agenda, although we voted against."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues fully support all measures within the Lisbon Strategy which genuinely enhance the competitiveness of European economies."
"This requires real economic reform that delivers more growth, flexible labour markets and higher employment throughout the EU."
"While we are fully supportive of the efforts of the President of the Commission and some Member States to reduce burdens on business and impediments to job creation, we are concerned that some of the measures outlined in the resolution could lead to higher costs on business and detract from the over-riding priority of making Europe more competitive in the global market place and thus significantly reducing unemployment levels."
"We cannot support those suggestions in the resolution that would lead to a Financial Perspective higher than agreed at the European Council in December 2005."
"On these and other grounds, we have decided to abstain on the resolution."
"The joint motion for a resolution signed and being promoted in the European Parliament by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Lisbon Strategy aims to speed up capitalist restructurings even more, by drawing up national programmes."
"The attack by Euro-unifying capital is being extended and embraces all the basic links, with the invasion of capital in and the commercialisation of health, education and energy, the dismantling of labour relations and the sweeping away of any rights acquired by the working classes, with the new attack on its insurance and pension rights."
"The Lisbon Strategy is also based on the Maastricht Treaty and the four freedoms (of capital, of trade, of workers, of services) voted on jointly in our country by Nea Dimokratia, the Panellinio Socialistiko Kinima and Synaspismos."
"The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas has given the working class and the people timely warning of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It calls on the working class to step up its fight against the barbaric attack by capital, to make its fight an anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist fight and to build up its alliance for grass-roots power and prosperity."
". It is scandalous that, even 20 years after the Chernobyl disaster, two-thirds of MEPs should endorse the continued use of nuclear energy by voting in favour of the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy."
"Nuclear power remains a high-risk technology with incalculable consequences."
"The spiralling use of nuclear power violates fundamental rights and irreparably worsens the living conditions of future generations."
"The extraction of uranium entails the massive over-exploitation of nature and the radioactive pollution of groundwater."
"Uranium can also be enriched, which is a means of producing material capable of being used in atomic weapons."
"It is in fact not really possible to absolutely separate ‘civil’ from military use of nuclear energy."
"Even the normal operation of nuclear reactors involves a permanent state of risk through such things as low-level radiation and the risk of contamination of the rivers used for cooling them."
"There are recurrent instances of reprocessing plants causing the radioactive pollution over wide expanses of land and sea."
"To date, nobody has been able to solve the problem of how to manage and store highly radioactive waste, more of which is being produced on a daily basis and which will continue to emit radiation for another 10 000 years at least."
"The EUR 3.1 billion allocated to nuclear research by the EU’s seventh research framework programme (2007-2011) is double the amount allocated by its predecessor."
"Instead of investing in nuclear technologies, the EU should do more to develop renewable forms of energy."
"Decentralised supplies from renewable energy sources are the only way to guarantee long-term security of energy supply."
". I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the input to the Spring 2006 European Council in relation to the Lisbon Strategy, as I accept most of the points it raises and the proposals it makes."
"I particularly welcome the proposals relating to a demanding, competitive and innovative approach to the European economy, which sets out a roadmap for European economic reform marked by the completion of the internal market, investment in research and development, and solidarity between communities and generations."
"There are some points that I feel need to be clarified."
"In my opinion, it is regrettable that one year on from the 2005 Spring Council, we remain more or less exactly where we were, in many areas, namely freedom to provide services, freedom of installation for citizens from the new Member States, the deepening of the internal market and reform of budgetary priorities."
"These points have certainly not led me to vote against the resolution, but they do reinforce my disappointment at the lack of commitment to EU reforms."
"The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal Council of foreign ministers (10-11 March 2006)."
". Mr President, in the western Balkans the EU can really make a difference."
"This was discussed at the Foreign Ministers’ ‘Gymnich’ meeting in Salzburg."
"The region is at the crossroads and the EU will guide it down the peaceful and reformist path."
"We have seen many positive developments in recent years, but we should not be lulled into a false sense of security."
"This year the remaining status issues, Kosovo and Montenegro, must be solved with patience and determination."
"We must also move the region beyond the era of war."
"We must thus clear the way for progress on issues that really matter to the citizens of the region: economic and social development and bringing the countries into the European mainstream."
"How can we best encourage the countries to stick to an ambitious reform agenda?"
"Most importantly, we must stick to our commitment that the countries can make progress towards the EU with membership as the ultimate goal, once they have managed to meet the rigorous accession criteria."
"Moreover, we must strive to make this perspective concrete and tangible, as the Commission has done in its recent communication."
"Let me mention a few examples of our concrete objectives and proposals."
"Firstly, we should remove obstacles to trade, production and investment."
"The Commission, together with the stability pact and the countries concerned, is pursuing the creation of a regional free trade agreement, which would replace the existing patchwork of 31 bilateral free trade agreements."
"This may be attained through a simultaneous enlargement and modernisation of CEFTA, on which there will be a CEFTA summit meeting in April in Bucharest."
"Secondly, we should ‘Europeanise’ the next generation – or why not the current generation?"
"That is why we have proposed increasing the mobility of researchers and students by increasing the number of scholarships provided for them."
"Thirdly, we need to facilitate people-to-people contacts."
"We shall put forward measures on visa facilitation, and I trust that the Member States will move them quickly forward through the Council, so that we can start negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"Let me underline the fact that the more the countries in the region can do to ensure border controls and document security, the easier it will be to convince the EU Member States to make progress on visa facilitation."
"I am glad that the EU’s Foreign Ministers in Salzburg last weekend endorsed these practical measures and, even though she is not present today, I want to pay particular tribute to Mrs Plassnik and her personal commitment to ensuring progress in the western Balkans."
"Finally, I must say a few words about the death of Slobodan Milosevic."
"When we received the news of his death at the end of the Gymnich meeting, my immediate reaction was to remember my visit to Srebrenica last July, at the tenth commemoration of the most appalling massacre in post-war Europe."
"I regret that Milosevic died before justice could be served for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the crimes for which he was indicted."
"In his memoirs, Chancellor Kohl writes that each generation must work for a necessary consciousness of history to avoid repeating our mistakes and to ensure that ‘the voices of victims are heard’."
"These are very wise words."
"The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is putting on record evidence that will help the Serbs of current and future generations to understand that many crimes were committed in the name of Serbia, while certain individuals were responsible for these crimes."
"The death of Milosevic makes it even more important for The Hague Tribunal to complete its work and for the remaining indictees to be transferred there."
"This will help Serbia to close the tragic chapter of history over which Milosevic presided and to come to terms with the legacy of its past."
"Today Serbia is truly at the crossroads and I sincerely hope that the leaders and people of Serbia have the will and wisdom to choose the European future instead of the nationalist past."
"The country now truly holds its future in its own hands."
"We can help the Serbs to make the right choice by keeping the European prospect open for them."
"– Mr President, this was announced as a debate with the Council."
"You have just said that the Council is not yet present, but I do think we should wait for it to arrive, for what we want to do is to hear, and then discuss, a report on the Salzburg summit."
"There is no point in us having the debate before we hear the report; it would be a pointless ritual."
"I agree with Mr Posselt's remarks, although it has come to my attention that the minister will be arriving shortly."
". Mr President, I would like to add my voice to Mr Posselt's protest, because I believe that we in this Parliament must not forego what is really important just because of a failure to comply with formal arrangements, and if a debate with the Commission and the Council has been scheduled, the Council should be present."
"Mr President, I would like to say that, as if the situation in the Middle East and in Palestine following Hamas's victory were not complicated enough, the assault on the Jericho prison by Israeli troops − which I believe we must condemn − makes the situation even more complicated and has unleashed a wave of indiscriminate violence which has harmed European Union citizens and interests and which we must condemn in the strongest terms."
"Mr President, since I know that it has been debated in the informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, I would like to ask the Commission what approach the European Commission and the Council, which is unfortunately still absent, is going to take to European Union aid to Palestine, and whether it is going to insist, as is logical, on the need to demand that Hamas renounce violence and recognise the State of Israel and the previous agreements."
"Secondly, Mr President, with regard to the issue of Iran, which has been referred to the United Nations Security Council, I would like to ask the Commission whether it prefers a gradual approach, that is, that the Security Council should issue a statement, or whether it is hoping that sanctions will be applied."
"With regard to enlargement, Mr President, in view of the comments by the French Home Affairs Minister, Mr Sarkozy, to the effect that there is a degree of fatigue when it comes to enlargement and his request for a debate in the Council in June on assessing the limits to the European Union’s capacity for absorption − and Mr Brok’s report is the next item on the agenda − I would like to know whether the Commission agrees with Mr Sarkozy’s request to the Council and whether it believes that the Austrian Presidency of the Union should provide a definitive response to the issue of the geographical limits of our political project."
"Some of the issues that you have raised should be addressed to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who is not here at the moment, whereas many of your other questions will be answered as part of the debate on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA), which will take place in due course."
"Mr President, due to the fact that speaking time for the Commission is tight for this debate and it would be impossible to report on such a wide scope of issues, covering all external affairs, all global issues, it was agreed that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner would deal with Iran and Palestine and the cartoon crisis when she speaks later this evening."
"That is why I have concentrated on policies relating to the Western Balkans."
"This is how the Commission’s contribution will be allocated, meaning that after the debate I will respond regarding the western Balkans and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will respond on the other issues later this evening."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Rehn has described how things stand, so let us now discuss the Brok report, which has to do with enlargement, before we move on to doing everything else when Mrs Plassnik has got here."
"I urge you to do it this way, or else we will be unfair to the Commissioner and the debate will not be in the proper order."
"I understand the unusual situation in which we find ourselves, but unfortunately, according to the agenda, the debate on the Brok report will take place after statements by the Council and the Commission."
"– Mr President, I too have a proposal to make."
"We can of course take a break if the absent Presidency of the Council invites us to take coffee with it in the meantime."
"Mr President, I am perfectly aware of the pressures involved in the drawing up of Parliament’s agenda, but you have said that we have a particular order of business, and what we cannot do is establish an item on the agenda which says that we are going to deal with the Informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers when it turns out that the Commissioner responsible for the majority of the items relating to that Council has decided that it should be done at a later point in our debate."
"I believe that what Mr Posselt and Mrs Pack have proposed is entirely justified."
"If the Commissioner responsible is not here to deal with the main issues of the informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, let us debate Mr Brok’s report and then we can deal with this item when the Commissioner responsible comes, because it is not acceptable for subjects to be distributed without hearing the opinion of the Members."
"I understand the concerns that you are raising, but I have to say that I am unaware of anything in the Rules of Procedure that would help us resolve this problem."
"– Mr President, the problem is, of course, that certain Members who are down to speak on the Brok report are not there now and will be arriving only later on."
"We can, of course, rearrange things somewhat."
"Mrs Napoletano was ready to speak, and I am speaking now because I do mainly speak on the subject of the Balkans."
"We can now, of course, simply combine the two, but some Members will be cross at not being able to speak to the Brok report because they were not there."
"That is the problem!"
"– Mr President, can I just, politely, ask whether you are in possession of information as to when the Council is actually going to turn up?"
"If what I hear is indeed the case, and they will be here in another quarter of an hour, then we can wait for a quarter of an hour, for we have had plenty of 15-minute delays in this place."
"What I would suggest, then, is that, if the Council is going to be here in 15 minutes’ time, we can suspend the sitting for that long."
"If they are going to turn up in an hour’s time, then we will have to think of something else."
"We have no information on this whatsoever, but perhaps you do."
"I suggest that we suspend the sitting for a few minutes while we wait for the Council representative to arrive."
"Given that the Council representative has now arrived, we can resume proceedings."
". Mr President, I crave your forgiveness for our late arrival."
"We have just had two traffic accidents to contend with, one on the road to the airport in Vienna and one on the road from Entzheim."
"Thank you for the opportunity to inform you about our informal, Gymnich-format, meeting of foreign ministers, which took place this weekend in Salzburg."
"This was primarily concerned with two subject areas, the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us, notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine."
"The second day was devoted to the Balkans, the Thessaloniki agenda, its implementation and its future."
"If you will permit me, I would like to discuss the Middle East first and then move on to the Balkans."
"To the Middle East, then: this region is, following the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council and in the run-up to the elections in Israel, in a transitional stage, one in which we have a very clear and consistent message to send to the future Palestinian Government, for we need to make clear what are our own fundamental principles, on the basis of which we are prepared for further cooperation."
"The fundamentals are perfectly clear and consist of three elements."
"We are calling upon them to abandon violence, to agree to negotiations – which means recognising the existing agreements – and to acknowledge Israel’s right to existence."
"It is on this clear and consistent basis that our policy is developed, and on which we have launched an appeal to our partners in the Middle East."
"Hamas, in particular, will have to become aware of the fork in the road and come to a decision as to which path it wants to take in future."
"It must make clear which route it is going to take; we have spelled out what the conditions are, and in no respect has there been any change in them."
"We shall continue to support the Palestinian people, and also took the opportunity at ‘Gymnich’ to discuss what shape financial support might take in future."
"What is clear is that any such support must benefit the Palestinian people rather than being used for terrorism or for violence."
"We are, then, with a great deal of attention, following developments, the efforts being made to put together a new Palestinian Government, and its future programme."
"Yesterday, President Mahmud Abbas and his delegation visited Vienna, where we had the chance to raise these issues with him."
"He and the interim government have our support in this difficult period, and I shall be happy to discuss events in closer detail if I get the opportunity to do so later on."
"Turning to the Balkans, this issue was and is an important one for the Austrian Presidency, and I therefore regard the Gymnich meeting and its engagement with it as a message of encouragement, even in a dual sense of the term, addressed to the people of the states of the Western Balkans."
"The road they have to travel towards Europe and towards meeting European standards may well be a difficult one, but the journey is worth it, and on that road they have our good wishes and support."
"It is also a sign to our own peoples, encouraging them in the belief that it is indeed possible to find solutions to difficult problems – even to the most difficult ones."
"I therefore see it as a sign of hope and confidence that we succeeded, in the Salzburg Declaration, in underlining and making visible the prospects that the Balkan states have of acceding to the European Union."
"For it was important, particularly at a time when people are talking in terms of 'enlargement fatigue', that this signal should be sent out in order to give our partners a good idea of what to expect in view of the extremely difficult decisions that we will have to take in 2006."
"It was evident from the guest list for our Salzburg meeting just how much the path we shall take this year will demand of us, for our guests included Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy to Kosovo, and his deputy Albert Rohan, and we were able to discuss with them the future of that region."
"We had also invited Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; Søren Jensen-Petersen, the head of UNMIK was present with his delegation, as was Ibrahim Rugova’s successor as President of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu."
"I was also pleased that this segment of our Salzburg meeting managed to achieve something of a ‘first’ in the presence of Mr Brok, the chairman of your Foreign Affairs Committee, who took part in our discussions."
"The Balkans are at the heart of Europe, and without them, European unification will be incomplete."
"We know that the road ahead of us will be a difficult one, but we are determined to go down it."
"We have decided to take a step-by-step approach to the work in hand, working through the issues one by one and resolving each of them in turn."
"It is working on the European standards that is actually the core issue for each and every one of these countries."
"Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister visited me in Vienna, and told me that what was crucial was not a date or a particular point in time in the course of development, but working together on European standards."
"Javier Solana, who has been keeping an eye on developments for a long time, describes what has been achieved since Thessaloniki in 2003 as a success story capable of being read on the agenda, and, more specifically on the order of business for the Salzburg meeting, since the issues with which this meeting concerned itself were issues of easier and improved trading arrangement, the fight against organised crime, young people and the facilitation of easier travel."
"We gave attention to the visa issue in view of the need to address the expectations that the people of these countries have of us."
"We also, though, have to make clear to them what options are open to us, and join with them in seeking, step by step, solutions to the problems that remain outstanding in this area and elsewhere."
"There is no doubt about it: Europe is making a difference in this region, but we have also emphasised the responsibility that the countries concerned have for themselves, for in some of them, which have already been stabilised, we need to move on to their dynamic Europeanisation."
"As we proceed down that road, it must be made clear to them that they need the willingness to take the necessary action and demonstrate that quality that is described so well by the English term ‘ownership’."
"We have stressed the need for regional cooperation, especially in view of the work being done on a regional free trade area, with a single free trade agreement, based on CEFTA, intended to replace 31 individual agreements."
"Speaking personally, I am very grateful to Commissioner Rehn and to the Commission as a whole for their commitment to this."
"The Council and the Commission are working on this hand in hand and side by side in the best sense of the word."
"I wish to thank the Commission for its communication at the end of January, and also for their willingness to join us in continuing to work towards the achievement of the goals set out in the Salzburg statement."
"Continued work is also called for on the part of the ministers of the national government within their own remits, for it is they who, along with other things, will have to network with their partners in the Balkan states in addressing actual problems."
"The ministers of the interior, in particular, are highly committed to this and bear a great responsibility, for it is they and their cooperation that determine what practical headway can be made on important issues."
"We also discussed the topic of the EU’s assimilation capacity and explored its implications."
"As you know, this is a topic that I brought into greater prominence last autumn, and I believe I was right to do so, for we are not seeking to put up an additional obstacle, but, essentially, to make us more aware of something that ought to be quite obvious, that being that it is not only the candidates for accession of whom homework is to be demanded, but the European Union itself also needs to do its own."
"At this joint meeting, at a moment at which all of us were united around one table in Salzburg, we all had an experience that was not only disquieting but also, at the same time, gave us a sense of hopeful confidence: our deliberations were interrupted by news of the death of Slobodan Milošević, and there was a European symbolism in our being able, at such a moment, to work on our common European future."
". – Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would just like to make two brief observations on the subject of the Middle East."
"Firstly, we are right to demand that Hamas should face up to reality and renounce violence, but that must not be licence for Israel to continue with its policy of unilateral violence, which is what we have just seen it engaging in."
"Secondly, Europe, and the USA, must be consistent in their nuclear policies, particularly in view of the different ways in which India and Iran are being treated, and the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna must be given a larger role in a multilateral system of uranium enrichment and nuclear waste management."
"If we stick with these principles, we will make progress."
"Turning to the Balkans, it strikes me that our actions are being guided by the principle that progress is to be defined as whatever is not regress."
"I have to say that my group and I are very embarrassed by the conduct of certain Member States, which are making themselves culpable for the way in which the business of making Europe fit for the accession of new Member States is being played off against the Balkan countries’ prospects of accession."
"Europe will not, however, be made any stronger by the Balkan countries being robbed of their prospects of accession or seeing them deferred to the distant future."
"The guiding principle must still be the vision of EU membership, for which this House – my group included – has so often voted unanimously."
"Perfectly understandable though it is that demand should be made for the EU to be made more capable of welcoming new members – I am thinking here of the constitution and of the financial basis – this cannot be used against the countries of South-Eastern Europe and as a means of fending off their efforts at accession."
"Preparations for this on our side and in the Balkans must run in parallel."
"The preparation of both sides must be consistent and thorough, and while it is in progress, practical action needs to be taken to prepare the countries of the Balkans for accession to the European Union, not least by making visa arrangements simpler and easier."
"Further to what you had to say about the ministers of the interior – Mrs Gottes and Mr Ohr – I hope that they will do something tangible in order to give this region’s young people, in particular, a chance to get to know Europe at last."
"Despite Slobodan Milošević’s death – which was in many respects premature – it remains in the interests of the victims and of Europe’s shared future that all those who committed crimes should be brought to The Hague for trial, and on that we must certainly insist."
"The countries of the Balkans, which have so often in the course of our continent’s history been the playthings of the European Great Powers, must progressively be integrated into the European Union."
"We will not, in any case, accept their being relegated to an earlier stage of their relationship with it."
"When, tomorrow, we vote to adopt the Brok report, we must do so stating clearly only that which is in the text, and without the interpretations that have, regrettably, been placed upon it in the last few hours and have the effect of falsifying what it actually contains."
"We defend the Balkan countries’ prospects of membership of the European Union."
". – Mr President, I had hoped that a strong and positive message would have come out of the Balkan Conference."
"I believe that was also the hope of both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission."
"You each can ill afford to voice your disappointment, so I will do it for you."
"We all acknowledge that the entire Balkan region remains volatile and potentially unstable, which is why clarity is absolutely indispensable."
"The joint press statement, notably weaker than previous declarations, states that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union."
"We note the absence of any mention of membership."
"It adds that a debate on enlargement strategy is due in 2006 and that the EU’s absorption capacity has to be taken into account."
"That is disappointing."
"I will come back to that during the debate on the Brok report."
"Allow me to comment on the Middle East."
"I fully share my group chairman’s reaction to the deplorable and unacceptable behaviour of Israel in Jericho yesterday, not to mention the strange behaviour – to say the least – of US and British troops."
"Needless to say, that action makes the EU’s position more difficult."
"While my group strongly agrees that Hamas must renounce violence and endorse existing international treaties and agreements, we must note with sadness that Israel is making it increasingly difficult to hold this line."
"We will nevertheless do so, but we must also make it very clear that actions like those witnessed yesterday run totally counter to the search for a peaceful outcome."
"– Mr President, Mrs Plassnik, the reason why we suspended our sitting in order to wait for you was that there are things about which we are very concerned and which we wish to discuss with you."
"At the time they began their presidency, the Austrians were planning Thessaloniki II, yet there is no word of it in the Salzburg statement; nor has anything more been heard about the prospect of Member State status for the Western Balkans."
"The statement is a compromise, one, insubstantial though it is, that is given a critical hearing in the Balkans and was in no way a sign of encouragement, but at best invited misinterpretation."
"That, at any rate, is the valuation I would place on the statement by Mr Brok, who also took part in Salzburg and who has, since Monday, been telling the German media about an end to the Balkans’ EU prospects and talking up what he calls a third way, a privileged partnership."
"If Europe wants some credibility, we have to uphold the European prospect for the Balkans not only in words but also by our actions, and this is where I agree with Commissioner Rehn in what he has said."
"Mr Brok, let me conclude by saying one thing, namely that a third way is precisely what the Libyan Head of State, Colonel Gaddafi, was looking for as long ago as the 1980s."
"He, fortunately, failed miserably in this, and you will have the same experience."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say a few things about the matters that have nothing to do with the enlargement countries, which I shall shortly be discussing as part of my report."
"I would like to say something briefly about the Middle East."
"We find ourselves in ever-greater difficulties, as a result not only of developments over the past few days, but of those that have taken place over recent weeks and months."
"On the one hand, there is the situation with which both sides in the Holy Land itself are presenting us; on the other, there is the issue of how probable it is that Iran will be deterred from a military nuclear programme. And if, as is indeed possible, there is a closing of the circle – with Iran, Syria, a multilateral agreement in Lebanon with Hisbollah and contacts with Hamas – there arises the great danger of an alliance that is highly problematic and to which we have to find a response, not only in order to secure peace and fight terrorism, but also to guarantee the security of our energy supplies."
"I am grateful, Madam President-in-Office, for having been able to be present for some of the discussions."
"Whilst the negotiations will see us tackling hard political facts, we must also ensure that there is a real dialogue of cultures, so that the fundamentalists will be unable to prevent the moderates – who are present in all the regions – from forming a majority."
"Perhaps, Madam President-in-Office, I might be permitted to address another aspect of great significance in some areas, that being the issue of the European Union’s mission to the Congo."
"I would be very interested to know whether there is already a mandate in place for this, setting out what it is to do and for how long and over what geographical area it is to do it, and whether the Congolese authorities have officially invited such a project and the European Union’s participation in it."
"If decisions are to be taken concerning this both here and elsewhere, it is extraordinarily important that there should be clarity as regards what the Presidency of the Council and the High Representative are doing about organising such a mandate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is excellent that you are giving the Balkans a high profile."
"We do all have an interest in the region being stabilised and democratised, and the EU really has an opportunity to play an important role."
"I wish you both good luck in the task of raising the ambitions of your colleagues in the other Member States to the same high level."
"Be assured that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is with you on this."
"The various initiatives for getting the countries to cooperate with each other and with ourselves are excellent."
"It is also good that, in the end, the decision has been taken to use CEFTA, which already exists and is already up and running, as a basis for doing this instead of creating something new, as there was talk of doing previously."
"I think that this was an extremely wise decision."
"At the same time, we are also talking about different countries with different traditions, different histories and different degrees of development."
"It is therefore important that we keep sending out the message that all these countries are welcome to apply for membership of the European Community if they wish to do so and that, in that case, they will be treated on their own merits."
"There is at present a concern in certain quarters that we wish to lump the countries together again and that they will be treated as a unit."
"I believe that that anxiety is exaggerated, but it is very important to be extremely clear on the point that has been made, namely that each country is to be treated on its own merits."
"With regard to the death of Slobodan Milošević, we are talking here about an odious dictator, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and a large part of the tragedy that has taken place."
"I also regret that the trial could not be brought to a conclusion, and it was, I believe, an obviously quite pathetic man who ended his days."
"We must still be crystal clear about the need for Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladić to be extradited and to be so right now."
"There is no room for compromise on this."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Union’s Foreign Affairs Ministers redefined the European prospects of the Western Balkans and stipulated that the ultimate objective of the stabilisation and association process under way with those countries is no less than accession to the European Union."
"They have therefore gone further than the Thessaloniki declaration of 2003, which talked about the great challenge represented by the integration of the five countries of the Balkans and their eventual accession to the Union."
"The MEPs from the UMP agree with this vision and this prospect and are convinced that, without the Balkans, European unification is not complete."
"They also share the view that it will be a long journey with many obstacles along the way, but first of all they would ask that, in relation to the Balkans and any other possible future enlargement, the real questions be set out clearly."
"What are the real questions?"
"Firstly, does the European Union have the capacity to absorb these countries?"
"I would point out that this is one of the Copenhagen criteria, a criterion that is too often forgotten; financial capacity, institutional capacity, but also political capacity."
"Are our Member States and their people ready to receive other Member States into the Union and, if so, when and how?"
"Furthermore, another member of the Union, France, has amended its constitution, making it obligatory to hold a referendum on any further enlargement, following the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia."
"Our partners may welcome this, or lament it, but that is now the institutional reality."
"Finally, for years, the MEPs from the UMP have been calling for an in-depth debate within the European Union on the subject of Europe’s borders."
"It is high time that that debate took place!"
"We must look reality in the face and make a mature choice on the future of the European Union, in terms of political content and geographical borders."
"This is a duty for us, and it is a duty towards the countries that are knocking at our door."
"We must take on our responsibilities."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, while I would like to endorse what Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck said about my group’s stance on Israel’s policy over the past few days, I would also like to respond to what you said about the importance of this transitional stage."
"It is one in which the EU should send out a clear message highlighting the principles of cooperation, those being renunciation of violence, acceptance of existing agreements and the recognition of Israel’s right to exist."
"That is incredibly important, and the EU must not distance itself from it in any way."
"That is why I believe the EU is making a grave mistake in continuing to give the interim government financial support."
"While the EU should send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian areas and help the people who live in them, it should not be supporting the authorities there, for Hamas has neither acknowledged Israel’s right to exist nor renounced violence, and the message we are sending is a deadly one, in that Hamas has reiterated its view that the EU’s decision to continue sending money is an indication that it accepts its policies, while it is still refusing to negotiate with Israel on the grounds that it does not recognise its legitimacy."
"The whole object of EU support is the promotion of the peace process, but it is wrong to give financial support to those who seek its downfall."
"The EU must keep to the course it has set so far and must not abandon financial aid, which is its most important bargaining counter, and it is for that reason that I ask you to take another look at this."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I will start by congratulating you on your historic achievement in Luxembourg, in which you paved the way for the accession of Croatia, the only central European state other than Switzerland not yet to be a Member State of the EU."
"I will also congratulate you on the great courage with which you launched there the debate on the frontiers of Europe, which is long overdue."
"Secondly, let me say how grateful I am to you for having, in Salzburg, argued in favour of the other South-East European states being given the prospect of accession."
"I do indeed believe that we must not budge on this; there must be no doubt whatever about the fact that the states of South-Eastern Europe are indeed European, and that they are entitled to become full members of the European Union as soon as all the criteria have been satisfied – which includes the enlargement criterion that applies to us."
"Thirdly – and here I have to disagree with Mrs Koch-Mehrin – I would like to say that what we should be doing for Palestine is not just giving humanitarian aid, but also helping them to achieve pluralism – difficult though that must be conceded to be."
"Corrupt and dubious though the Fatah state was, a state ruled by Hamas would be even more objectionable."
"We must promote the peace process and pluralism by every means to hand in order to prevent an Iranian zone of influence extending from the Gulf to the Mediterranean coming into being."
"Fourthly, Iran, which is second only to China as the oldest great power in the world, is not a monolithic block, and that is why we have to apply a combination of stringency and intense diplomatic effort to dealing with it."
"Here, too, no matter how unacceptable the country’s current President may be, we must not lose faith in dialogue."
"There is more to Iran than its president; it is one of the oldest states in the world, and we Europeans must do everything in our power to reinforce the pluralistic forces within it and to prevent it from degenerating into aggressive uniformity."
". Mr President, returning to the subject of the Balkans, I do believe that the time was ripe, and I feel even more justified in my decision to make the Balkans a priority for the Austrian Presidency of the Council."
"The time was ripe for a debate on enlargement, and the one we had in Salzburg went well."
"I see that as progress, for the worst course of action is to keep silent and fail to address the issues that need to be addressed, to fail to make the public aware of them, or to explain to them what is at stake, what is being done and why."
"And so I am glad we had this debate, not least also that we gave attention to the frustrations felt by the states of the Western Balkans."
"I reject the idea that the Salzburg statement was a superficial compromise or even a retrograde move, and I would ask you to examine the wording carefully."
"Let me remind you that, in paragraph 3, we explicitly speak of EU membership as a long-term objective, as the ‘ultimate goal in conformity with the Thessaloniki Declaration’, and so what matters, and was our concern in our discussions, is that the prospect of accession be made more credible and tangible, not least for the people of the Western Balkans."
"That explains why we discussed the topics we did, and why we discussed them in a very constructive spirit."
"Moving on to the Congo, work is underway on clarifying the conditions in terms of time, scope and substance; this is being done at Council level, jointly with Mr Solana, and in liaison with the Congolese authorities."
"It is very much in the interests of all of us that this matter should be clarified."
"Moving on to Iran, we are now in a period of diplomatic wrangling in the United Nations, and, as one speaker pointed out, what really does matter is that the authority of the International Atomic Energy Authority be reinforced and the implementation of the many resolutions adopted on this subject be proceeded with apace."
"Let me close by saying something, briefly, about what is currently going on both in Jericho and in Gaza."
"What happened yesterday is a matter of grave concern to the presidency."
"We have emphasised the need for appropriate action to restore peace and order; we have said that Israel’s use of force in Jericho and the activity by Palestinian extremists in response to it are both capable of further destabilising a situation in the Middle East that is already tense."
"We have urged restraint on both Israel and the Palestinian Authority."
"Both sides must now give very careful consideration to the consequences of their actions."
"We denounced in strong terms the taking of hostages and – as Mr Winkler told you today – immediately called on the Palestinian Authority to do whatever was necessary, both now and in the future, to ensure the safety and protection of European citizens and buildings."
"It has to be said that, while we are willing to give aid – aid of a humanitarian nature, that is – such aid can be effective only in a peaceful environment, and all parties must play their part in creating one."
". Mr President, as I said before the break, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will present the Commission’s views on the Middle East, Palestine and Iran later this evening."
"I will comment on the next agenda item: issues related to enlargement and absorption capacity."
"I should also like to use this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Plassnik on her personal commitment to the policy on the western Balkans."
"It has been extremely important and the Austrian Presidency has taken new steps towards integrating this region into the European mainstream."
"That is indispensable to the security and stability of the whole of Europe and of the Union."
"All participants in the debate have recognised that the road ahead for the western Balkans is a challenging one and that many reforms must be implemented before the countries meet the required criteria."
"It is equally clear that there is a consensus in this House on the absolutely fundamental role the European Union plays and is bound to play in the western Balkans through a credible accession perspective – albeit a medium- to long-term perspective – but a credible accession perspective."
"That is the driving force behind the reforms and that is the basis of our work on security and stability."
"Especially with a view to the Kosovo status process, we all have to be extremely responsible as regards the western Balkans and its stability."
"We should not undermine the EU perspective, which is the foundation of security and stability in the region."
"Thus, to avoid eroding our own credibility, we cannot take back with the left hand what we gave with the right hand."
"The key objectives to work for are security, stability and progress in the western Balkans."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A6-0025/2006) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Commission’s 2005 enlargement strategy paper (2005/2206(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, right up to the present day, the enlargement of the European Union has been the most successful aspect of its foreign policy, for it was a means of extending the area of stability and peace in Europe, and also of further advancing the cause of peace, freedom, human rights and the rule of law."
"This is an important point, and one of which we must not lose sight either now or in the future."
"It also has to be clear to us, though, that stability is an achievable goal only if the European Union is strong enough to develop the ability to master these tasks; that, for example, was why the Constitutional Treaty was a retrospective attempt at really making the addition of ten new Member States workable in institutional terms and in terms of the objectives involved, and the reason why we are in such difficulties now is that the ratification process is going nowhere."
"We also have to realise that the European Union's capacity for accepting new members is one of the essential aspects of the Copenhagen criteria, although there are good reasons why that has been purely declaratory in nature."
"When we reach the sort of interface that we will reach after Bulgaria and Romania we will, however, have to bring this into play and redefine it."
"It is for that reason that we ask the Commission, by the end of the year, to define what is meant by the European Union’s absorption capacity with reference to this and this will enable us to make use of it."
"What makes that so extraordinarily important is that this is not just a constitutional issue but also touches on issues of the European Union’s financial capacities and much more besides."
"I also think that we have to make it clear to just what extent the European Union is capable of accepting new members, and that this can affect the ‘yes or no?’ decision at the end of the day."
"The prospect of EU membership is to be held out not only to countries that have already commenced accession negotiations, that have candidate status or to whom one has been promised post-Thessaloniki – which promise, let me point out for the avoidance of former doubts and in order to re-clarify matters, cannot be withdrawn – but also as an incentive to highly-important internal reforms and to such states as Ukraine, European states that are currently subject to dictatorships and need to have such a perspective if they are to be kept looking westwards."
"For that, the Neighbourhood Policy alone is not enough."
"In some instances, the countries themselves or the European Union itself are currently finding it too much to combine this with the prospect of full membership, for it can in many cases be realised only in fifteen years’ time."
"If this project is to be credible, something between the two is needed, something with which these countries can have the prospect of full membership held out to them, without us being put under unrealistic pressure to give it to them at once."
"This should be open to every state that is not currently a Member State of the European Union."
"I would like again to emphasise that this can be the final stretch in countries such as Norway – which is also a party to the Schengen convention – so decide on the basis of their participation in the European Economic Area."
"If I may be permitted to talk in terms of a ‘European Economic Area plus’, then there is much that can be done with such a multilateral project in the fields of the internal market, internal and external security, environmental policy and much else besides."
"It can also be an intermediate stage, though."
"If states that, today, have the prospect of accession held out to them post-Thessaloniki – such as for example the countries of the Western Balkans, whose development is expected to take different periods of time – should decide to use it as an interim stage to full membership, then what was promised at Thessaloniki would not be made void."
"It is on this basis that we can achieve a new degree of flexibility by making this prospect credible, for things can happen at once without the intervening fifteen years of negotiations, and then we will have to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’."
"So, yes, I do see that enlargement, in some countries, entails plebiscites, and so we have no idea whether ratification will eventually happen."
"What that means is that this is not just an attempt at an ‘everything or nothing’ strategy, but also at creating ways in which these countries might be given credible perspectives, while at the same time saving and driving forward the political project that is the European Union."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank your House and the chairman of its foreign policy committee for the thorough report on the Commission’s 2005 strategy paper."
"This topic is the subject of constant discussion in the Council, not least with reference to the practical decisions that we have to take."
"As has been reported, we had in Gymnich a very good and thorough debate on this subject, and we will continue with it."
"I believe it to be quite essential that we should do so, since refusal to debate is a cause of public suspicion, and we must take care to reinforce the confidence of the European public in the European project as a whole and to create more trust and more clarity."
"That is one of my core concerns in my position as President-in-Office, and it is for that reason that I welcome the debate that is now underway."
"It is because we need public support for the enlargement process that we have to improve the flow of information and our public relations work, while also explaining the individual steps better."
"We quite simply have to make it clear that we will be thorough and circumspect, and that, while we will not act precipitately, we will not arbitrarily step on the brakes either."
"This is something I regard as an essential consideration."
"Heaven forbid that we should, by introducing this concept of ‘assimilation capacity’, impose an additional and arbitrary obstacle; on the contrary, it is about being aware, becoming aware, and making others aware of certain quite central and self-evident fundamental truths."
"Every step in enlargement, every new accession requires two participants, one of them being the European Union, and the other the country that is to become a Member State."
"We want to prepare for the next accessions as best we possibly can."
"In this sense, too, Salzburg was important to me, for it was important that we should look back over the last three years and forward to the next practical steps, in that it enabled all of us to be clearer about where we stand and what actual preparedness there is, whether at home or abroad."
"We can also have confidence in the expert knowledge that we gained during the last enlargement and should be determined to apply the knowledge of transformation that we have on a partnership basis."
"As was said in the earlier debate, ownership, too, underlines European standards, which, though fair, must be stringently complied with, as was made unmistakeably clear in the Commission’s report in November 2005."
"In this debate, though, we should also be honest about the expectations people have of the European Union, not least the expectations of the people who live in it."
"We owe each other clarity, and it is we alone who can give it to each other."
"We must not make out cheques with nothing to back them up."
"Moreover, I urge a more nuanced approach to each individual country, for we need to be fair in our dealings with each and every one of them, and we must make that a certainty."
"The presidency will therefore be giving particular attention, in the ongoing debate, to the contributions made by your House."
"Let me sketch out, in just a few words, the actual decisions that we are currently working on."
"The first has to do with Romania and Bulgaria, concerning which the reports are encouraging and we already have the goal of accession on 1 January 2007, albeit with the possibility of its being delayed by a year."
"Turkey and Croatia’s accession negotiations have begun; the starting pistol was officially fired on 3 October last year."
"We are now engaged in screening the , that is to say in analysing the We, the presidency, have written to Croatia and Turkey to invite them to set out their negotiating position on the first chapter, ‘Research and Development’."
"We share your House’s view that continued progress in the fulfilment of all the political and economic criteria and in the effective realisation of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy is required."
"As regards Turkey, we in the presidency welcomed the closure of the Orhan Pamuk case and made it clear, at the recent meeting of the troika in Vienna, that we expect the trials still pending under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code to be dealt with similarly, or, indeed, the law to be changed."
"We, too, are closely monitoring the implementation of the Ankara protocol and will ensure that it is reviewed this year in the relevant bodies and in accordance with the Council statement of 21 September 2005."
"We regard the commencement of the accession partnership with Croatia as equally important, and have welcomed the Croatian prime minister’s undertaking to ensure unconditional cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the continuation of the same."
"We share your House’s view that Croatia is contributing more to regional cooperation and that further efforts are required."
"I have said what needs to be said about the Western Balkans."
"The Council’s strategy for obtaining Serbia and Montenegro’s full cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal is also clear, and we sent out a very clear signal relating to it at our last meeting."
"We support the UN special envoy in Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, in his work, and I believe that the European Union, through the efforts of its special delegate Javier Solana, is capable of helping, in an enormously positive and diplomatic way, to reach an agreement on the conditions for the 21 May referendum."
". Mr President, as he is still here, let me commend Mr Brok for his important report."
"As he rightly said, enlargement is indeed one of the EU’s most powerful policy tools to pursue peace and prosperity, liberty and democracy."
"The eastern enlargement of 2004 sealed the peaceful reunification between Western and Eastern Europe."
"Now our energy is focused on a peaceful unification in south-east Europe."
"Our gradual and carefully managed accession process is based on three key principles."
"First, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda."
"It means that we must be cautious before taking any new commitments, but likewise we must stick to our prevailing commitments towards candidate or potential candidate countries already in the process."
"Our consolidated enlargement agenda focuses on south-east Europe: Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans."
"Secondly, we apply rigorous conditionality."
"Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works."
"It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies."
"More recently, it has inspired bold and significant reforms in Turkey and increasingly in the western Balkans."
"This is also proven by some recent important events, as General Ante Gotovina is behind bars in The Hague, while the novelist Orhan Pamuk is free to express his opinions."
"Enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other."
"Furthermore, the Commission is ready to deepen further and upgrade cooperation with our neighbourhood partners once the main priorities in the current action plans have been properly addressed."
"At the same time, we should avoid the pitfalls of an overly theoretical debate on the final borders of Europe."
"As we now have a consolidated enlargement agenda, a theoretical discussion, for example about whether Ukraine should even join the European Union, would benefit neither us nor the Ukrainians, now that Ukraine’s future path and democratic development is at stake."
"Certainly, the pace of enlargement must take into consideration the EU’s absorption capacity."
"The Commission has always had this view."
"Enlargement is about sharing a project based on common principles, policies and institutions."
"The Union must ensure that it can maintain its capacity to act and decide according to a fair balance within its institutions, respecting budgetary limits and implementing common policies that function well and achieve their goals."
"For over three decades, the EU has successfully absorbed a very diverse set of countries, as we can see from the composition of this House, for instance, including the President in the Chair in charge of this debate and the Commissioner involved."
"By developing its policies and institutions, the Union has responded positively to new circumstances, such as the fall of dictatorships, the collapse of communism and the rise of economic globalisation."
"Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe."
"Thirdly, we need better communication."
"The report rightly calls for a communication strategy and, indeed, broad public support is essential for everything the Union does, including enlargement."
"I rely on the political and financial support of Parliament to pursue a well-informed debate on enlargement."
"To conclude, consolidation was necessary to avoid overstretching on our enlargement commitments."
"But let us also keep in mind our own strategic interest: it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe."
"If we were to go wobbly about the western Balkans’ European perspective, our beneficial influence, our political leverage, our impact would be seriously eroded, just when the region enters a difficult period of talks on Kosovo’s status."
"The EU perspective is the key to a sustainable settlement for Kosovo and to democratic development in Serbia and the rest of the region."
"It is the foundation that keeps the region on a peaceful and reformist track."
"Therefore, for the sake of Europe, let us not shake this foundation, ensuring that the still fragile Balkans building does not collapse at our feet, in our own front yard!"
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, on his very important report and, at the same time, congratulate you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, for the interest and the decisiveness which you demonstrate, both as the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and as President-in-Office of the Council, on the question of the Balkans."
"Congratulations also to the Commissioner for the Commission's global and integral communication which you have presented to us."
"I should very quickly like to make the following comments:"
"Firstly, the central view in the Brok report on the importance of the European prospects of a number of countries, most of which are in the Balkans, is correct."
"At the same time, paragraphs 5, 9 and 10 of the report, if read together, give the reference point on the basis of which the European Union now sees future enlargements."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, I want to say that I support the European prospects of Turkey, but I think, as you quite rightly said, that we need to focus, initially, on the question of the Ankara Protocol."
"The Protocol alone – I repeat the Protocol alone – must be ratified, not the unilateral declaration, and, of course, the question of updating the legal framework within which this country operates."
"As far as Kosovo is concerned, I agree that attention should be paid during negotiations to its final status, but we also need to prepare ourselves for how the decision taken on the final status of Kosovo is to be applied."
"As far as the FYROM is concerned, it now has the status of a candidate country, that is correct but, precisely because it has the status of a candidate country, it also has rights and obligations, one of which is to demonstrate a constructive attitude in dialogue with Greece, so that the final issue pending, that of the name, can be resolved."
"Finally, as far as Serbia is concerned, I agree with the need and with the fact that Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal in the Hague is its obligation, but this is one part of a set of criteria which Serbia needs to meet and I want to ask that we be careful not to 'Croatise' the case of Serbia."
"On this issue, Minister, you also have a personal view."
"."
"Mr President, the Commission, in its document, is not mincing its words: while there will be no fresh enlargement round involving a large group of countries at the same time, it is arguing – and rightly so, I believe – that the European Union is, and indeed will be, an organisation that remains open to new members, but under certain conditions."
"Whilst the addition of ten new countries in 2004 was a success, not all citizens see it that way."
"An extra effort to recount this success story is therefore called for."
"On behalf of the group, I can say that we support the thrust of the Brok report, and I would thank him for the interesting preparation round we have been involved in over the past few months."
"The Social Democrats are emphatically in favour of the extra attention that is being devoted to the criterion of absorption capacity."
"The surrounding the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty plays an important role in this."
"Without internal reforms, it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively."
"As expressed in previous resolutions, we take the view that the Treaty of Nice is not a basis for new decisions on accession."
"There is, however, more need for more clarity surrounding the concept of absorption capacity, as laid down in the Copenhagen criteria, and the report is right to devote attention to this aspect too."
"I should like to take this opportunity to outline where the Social Democrats stand in respect of the possible accession of various countries."
"As far as our easterly neighbours Ukraine and Moldova are concerned, we think that now is not the right time to discuss their accession."
"Instead, we should invest in practical cooperation."
"We have concluded action plans with those countries, and we should try to bring them to a successful end."
"With regard to the Balkans, we back the Council’s position."
"In principle, the western Balkan countries hold out the prospect of membership, although they will join at different times."
"As for Turkey, as far as we are concerned, we will continue on the chosen path."
"We are on the eve of starting a process that will last many years, and it is extremely important that we hold firm to the pledge, but also to the conditions, that we prescribed in this connection."
"While I am on the subject of the Balkans, I should like to add that, whilst it goes without saying that the Copenhagen criteria remain of vital importance to us, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament continues to set great store by cooperation with the Yugoslavia tribunal as a criterion."
"I also think – and there has been much talk about it – that regional cooperation can make a significant contribution to the of those countries to the European Union."
"Finally – and this may well be the most important point of the whole discussion – the report mentions the possibility of setting up a fresh multilateral framework for European countries that have not yet joined the European Union."
"For some countries, that could be an alternative to membership, while for others, this could be an intermediate step towards it."
"For Ukraine and Moldova, for example, a structure of that kind could be a sound follow-up step, but for the countries that are already recognised as potential members, I would stress that this is an option, and not an obligation."
"This is also how it is set out quite clearly in the Brok report."
"It is something for which those countries can opt, should they decide that it would be useful to them to do so."
"It is not an alternative to the prospect of membership."
"That applies to Turkey as well as to the Balkan countries."
"I want to stress that this is how we interpret paragraph 10 of the draft resolution."
"It is in that way, and no other, that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have reached agreement with the rapporteur."
"Mr President, enlargement is the EU’s greatest success in terms of European cooperation."
"The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy, free trade and respect for the rule of law."
"EU membership was the spur that helped the powerful forces for reform in the former Communist dictatorships. The prospects of EU membership are also hugely important to the negotiations and reforms in Turkey and the Balkan states."
"In these regions, the EU has incredible reserves of what is known as soft power and which contributes to a more stable and more democratic Europe."
"We in my group believe that it is important, as the Treaty says, for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open."
"Naturally, the criteria must be applied, and the EU’s capacity to receive new countries is an important consideration."
"We need, however, to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it."
"I am aware of the fact that there is an ongoing debate in many countries and concern about the rapid pace of EU enlargement and about the way in which things might develop."
"That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly, but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these."
"In that context, the debate about economic protectionism is extremely worrying."
"We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries."
"Our promises to the Balkan states and to Turkey must be kept."
"It is they that set the pace, and we do what we can to speed things up."
"We must also keep the door open for other countries such as Ukraine and perhaps also, one day, Belarus, even though the situation there now is incredibly troubled."
"The hope of EU membership is what keeps the opposition and the forces of democracy alive there."
"That is why we are opposed to defining Europe’s geographical borders."
"This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement, and, a year ago, we stood in the Chamber in Brussels, wearing our orange scarves, and applauded President Yushchenko."
"We adopted a resolution in which we talked of Ukraine’s prospects of membership."
"That is an objective, and perhaps a distant one."
"Just as Mr Brok said, the Ukrainian people are poised between democracy and dictatorship."
"If we establish borders for Europe, they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face."
"It would be an historic mistake."
"Instead of introducing new concepts such as multilateral agreements, let us – as Commissioner Rehn also said – take the opportunity to customise the neighbourhood strategy for prospective Member States and to give practical shape to it."
"To now put forward new concepts which we have not properly debated and of whose implications we are unaware does not seem very productive at the moment."
". Mr President, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, my group has voted in favour of the Brok report for two reasons."
"We think that the concept of absorption capacity should be better defined."
"It is a trendy, all-purpose concept on which everyone can hang whatever they like, and that means that the question of geographical borders will need to be answered, for we can no longer dodge that question."
"We share the view that it is necessary that the EU will think about an intermediate step between full membership and neighbourhood, for the sake of those countries that have no membership perspective as yet."
"I am not, therefore, talking about Turkey or the western Balkans, but rather about Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus."
"I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed, and extremely vexed frankly, to see that in the run-up to this debate, the media twisted the words in the report, the result running counter to a number of central points."
"If we read the media ahead of this debate, the ultimate conclusion is that an intermediate step should be created for countries including Turkey and the western Balkans."
"It is no coincidence – for let us be quite honest about this – that this happens to be the view held by the rapporteur, and one that he never had any intention of concealing."
"Mr Brok has always been opposed to opening negotiations with Turkey and has, since the rejection of the constitution, increasingly grown sceptical about the membership perspective of the western Balkans."
"The rapporteur is fully entitled to his view, but that is not the view of the majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. What is more, it is not what his own report states either."
"It would become the rapporteur to spell out, outside of this Chamber, what is in his report, and does not mistake its contents for notions of his own."
"What Parliament states in this report is that we do not want to tamper with the membership perspective of Turkey and the western Balkans and that intermediate steps would only be an option for those countries if they themselves were to decide in favour of it."
"Everyone knows just as well as I do that all those western Balkan countries and Turkey do not want to go down that route; they want full membership."
"Let us stop creating ambiguity in this Chamber, but, above all, also outside of it."
". Mr President, up until recently, a swift and extensive enlargement of the European Union was suggested as a tremendous step forward, and as something meriting universal support."
"It was seen as a reunification of Europe and as the victory of the West in the Cold War."
"After the major enlargement of 2004, that climate changed dramatically."
"Public opinion in the old Member States does not experience this enlargement as a success, particularly as a result of the increasing exploitation of the disparity between high-wage and low-wage countries."
"The politicians too, are distancing themselves from it."
"This change is palpable in the report on the enlargement strategy that is the topic of today’s debate."
"Attention is being drawn to the EU’s absorption capacity, to the external borders, the costs that are involved in enlargement and to administrative problems that are attributed to the absence of a European constitution."
"As a result, Romania and Bulgaria are likely to be the last countries that are allowed to join in the short term."
"Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy."
"Even for the three countries that have already been selected as candidate countries, no date of accession has been given."
"Everywhere across the western Balkans, in recognised states, as well as in federal states or protectorates striving towards independence, where groups of people who speak different languages and practise different religions, and who, in the 1990s, were at daggers drawn with each other, public opinion now expects miracles of a swift accession process to the European Union."
"The EU uses those expectations to demand reforms, and in that way, makes deep incursions into the administrative choices that are being made over there."
"The EU does not, for the time being, want enlargement, but it does want influence outside of its borders."
"That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina now have a tax system that nobody asked for, and the regional autonomy that was guaranteed in the Dayton agreement is being pushed back."
"According to the propaganda posters, it is thanks to the EU’s military presence that this country is on its way to joining the European Union."
"Public opinion in Montenegro and Kosovo, areas where four years ago, along with 12 Member States, the euro was introduced as legal tender, take it as read that they will soon be admitted to the EU as independent states, while the Hungarian-speaking people of Vojvodina expect protection against Slav dominance."
"So far, the EU’s actions have left all these people disappointed."
"Do we not have anything to offer those countries in the western Balkans other than the invitation to form a common market in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to adapt their government and their economy to our wishes without them being able to join before 2020?"
"My group can muster little enthusiasm for this proposal."
"We also recognise, however, that thanks to this text, it is possible to stress that the forthcoming referendum in Montenegro must be taken seriously and that the conflict about the use of the name Macedonia should be resolved quickly in sound consultation between Greece and its northern neighbour."
"What is also positive is that in Kosovo, a solution must be found in the short term which accommodates the needs of both the large Albanian majority and the Serbian and Roma minorities."
"Mr President, it is difficult to reconcile hyper-nationalism, also known as chauvinism, with EU membership, and that is of course equally true in the case of candidate countries."
"Sad to say, there is one candidate country pervaded by chauvinism: that country is Turkey, which is the subject of enough controversy already."
"Against this current backdrop, I have two questions I would like to put to Commissioner Rehn."
"Is there any truth in the information, which I received from an expert last night, that the position of the Christian churches in Turkey has visibly deteriorated lately?"
"In light of this information, the assassination of the Italian priest, Andrea Santoro, on 5 February, in the port of Trabzon is not an isolated case."
"An identical murder was attempted very recently in the town of Mersin and direct threats are against churches via the telephone or even in newspaper columns."
"Incidentally, according to the Anglican vicar Ian Sherwood, who is active in Istanbul, the Turkish elite regards the spread of Christian literature in Turkish as intellectually unacceptable, if not potentially criminal."
"How, Commissioner, can that be reconciled with freedom of religion in Turkey?"
"As far as I can gather, no progress whatsoever is being made with regard to this important item of the political criteria of Copenhagen."
"I happened to hear last night that Trabzon is situated in what is called the valley of wolves."
"‘Valley of the Wolves’ is also the title of an original Turkish film production which literally oozes chauvinism and is known to be radically anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-American and anti-Kurdish."
"It is already a huge box-office hit in Turkey and has won euphoric acclaim from Prime Minister Erdogan’s immediate and the president of the Turkish Parliament."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has taken Prime Minister Erdogan and Minister Gul to task over this Turkish chauvinism, which is completely incompatible with European values."
". (Mr President, it is very important that the report drafted by Mr Elmar Brok has today provided us with the opportunity to speak about enlargement."
"We definitely need to strengthen the Neighbourhood Policy and we need a new, more serious relationship between the Union and the countries with which it shares its borders."
"Until now, the Neighbourhood Policy has not been sufficient as an instrument."
"This has been proved by the fact that during its implementation, the countries influenced by its scope experienced periods of crisis and destabilisation on a large scale."
"New forms of cooperation as proposed in the report cannot, however, close the door to membership."
"We have to be aware today that either we offer countries on our eastern borders the prospect of membership or our appeals for democracy, market economy and respect for human rights will remain empty words."
"Unless they are offered at least the prospect of membership in the distant future, these countries will return to the sphere of Russian influence and all that this entails with regard to democracy and human rights."
"However, in the very same report we see the development and strengthening of views on enlargement in terms of absorption capacity."
"This term was never clearly defined and today is nothing more than a clever-sounding excuse, a cheap explanation for backing out of the enlargement process."
"If absorption capacity is to be based on acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, then one could have the impression that the authors of this text definitely want to close the door to everyone."
"The Treaty, in the version we know today, can never resurface."
"Demanding that the European Commission defines the borders of the Union is a mistake."
"It will only bring embarrassing political discussions on the subject of geography and will definitely weaken the influence the Union has on the processes of democratisation, stabilisation and the strengthening of pro-western policy in neighbouring countries."
"This Parliament has often been at the forefront of the integration process."
"It has set far-reaching goals."
"Today, this same Parliament is proving to be the most conservative and passive of bodies."
"This begs the question: why?"
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to a few imperfections and contradictions in the report on Turkey."
"The report lists such a catalogue of fundamental problems that it is puzzling why people fail to draw the only logical conclusion, which is that it was a fatal mistake to start negotiations about Turkey’s accession to the European Union in the first place."
"As Mr Belder explained in detail a moment ago, there are violations of the rights of national and religious minorities."
"Torture is still rife, and based on Article 301 of the criminal law among others, the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press cannot be guaranteed."
"Also, Turkey blatantly fails to meet its obligations in connection with the customs union."
"Cypriot ships and aircraft are still not admitted to Turkey’s territory."
"Over the past weeks, we have also noticed tension escalating between the Turkish authorities and certain Kurdish groups."
"No one other than the second-in-command of Turkey’s army is being accused of having stage-managed a bomb attack with a view to blaming the Kurds."
"Some of the military see this indictment as a ploy directed by the government, which would like to destabilise the general in question on account of his attitude towards Muslim fundamentalism."
"In some quarters, the possibility of a fresh military coup is even mooted, should the situation escalate any further."
"It must be admitted that there seems little to look forward to, and that in a country that aspires to join the European Union in a few years’ time."
"We should, in fact, come clean and say that it is totally absurd."
"The report is right to remind us that the Copenhagen criteria include our own absorption capacity."
"On that basis alone, we should reverse the decision to open negotiations with Turkey."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, speaking as chairperson of the delegation for South-Eastern Europe, let me say that I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Brok’s report has to say about each individual country and what it demands of them."
"Each of them has its own particular problems and needs to be judged on the basis of its own achievements, and so it would be highly desirable for consideration to be given to Croatia’s accession at an early date."
"To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region, since Croatia's achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries."
"Now, though, that we are coming to the close of the debate, I want to address an idea – one that is concealed in the Brok report, but more prominent in the public media. I refer to the allusions to changes in the enlargement strategy."
"The question is asked as to where the borders of the EU are, but nobody is answering it."
"Commissioner Rehn himself said earlier on that this is a question that has to be answered, and it is precisely this that has the public worried."
"My personal view is that the accessions of Bulgaria, Romania and the countries of the Western Balkans will mean that the EU will have reached its limits."
"For all the other countries, we have devised the new instrument of the Neighbourhood Policy and must get to grips with it."
"The rushed negotiations with Turkey have done what remained to be done to make our citizens insecure and disoriented."
"For ten years we have been saying that there must be no enlargement without institutional reform of the EU, but the Council did not begin to do justice to that until after the last enlargement, and for that we were all punished by the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"But it would be fatal if we were, on that basis, to draw the conclusion that no further accessions must be allowed."
"We must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments, for which, of course, the Constitutional Treaty makes provision, and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members."
"If we do not want to jeopardise what has been up to now our great commitment to the Balkans, we must remain consistent and purposeful in continuing to bring these countries closer to the EU."
"I very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject."
"All these states were rightly promised accession to the EU subject to their fulfilling the criteria."
"That was and remains an important motor for change in the aftermath of the terrible conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and of Ever Hoxha’s dictatorship in Albania."
"It is apparent to any rational person who even casts a glance at a map that this region is in the middle of the EU."
"If it enjoys stability, then so do we."
"The 1990s saw us all experiencing and suffering the opposite of that, but I do fear – and I can tell the President-in-Office of the Council that the vagueness and imprecision of what was said in Salzburg gives me reason to – that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen."
"– Mr President, I welcome the change of perspective that is set out in Mr Brok’s report."
"Our debates can no longer be about our preference for one country rather than another; instead, we must, at last, face up to the question as to what sort of political system the European Union can actually afford if it is to become better able to take decisions and act on them."
"That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend."
"It is for that reason that our next step must be to clarify terms that have not as yet been defined."
"The Copenhagen criteria make reference to the concept of ‘assimilation capacity’, while not, however, defining it."
"As I see it, it must involve at least the political and institutional arrangements set out in the Constitutional Treaty."
"While I have listened attentively to what the Commissioner has said, he can correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard him say anything about this."
"Inherent in the decision as to what is a criterion of capacity to assimilate is the potential source of dissent between us and the Commission."
"Among the important criteria are that the European Union should be funded in such a way as to have a viable future and its being accepted by the people who live in it."
"If we are to talk in terms of credibility, that credibility, and the criteria that can properly be applied to capacity to assimilate, require that it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so."
"Credibility is about more than a promise to accept people at some unspecified time; it is also about specifying the conditions under which they can be accepted at all, and that means that we have to be more precise about such concepts as ‘enlargement perspective’ or ‘prospect of accession’."
"We have to be very clear in our own minds that the belief that a country’s accession will resolve tensions and internal security problems is an erroneous one."
"Such tensions and problems must be resolved before accession negotiations start."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Brok report asks pertinent questions and provides answers, even though I do not agree with all of them."
"It also reflects the doubt felt by many in respect of further enlargement."
"That is why such great store is set by absorption capacity, which, if the report were to be approved without any amendments, would even be given a geographical dimension."
"I share the view of most in my group that absorption capacity does not require any prior geographical demarcation in order to be fleshed out, since the Union’s demarcation will in the first instance be political – not that that will be easy, either."
"What matters most is that the EU should deliver on its promise of enlargement, certainly also with regard to the countries of the Western Balkans."
"Whilst the countries in question are still years removed from possible membership, the time has come to set down some firm agreements on this matter and even to put forward a time schedule."
"Needless to say, all the criteria, particularly the political ones, need to be met."
"From what I gather, that is exactly what the President-in-Office of the Council said in her response."
"I take the view that vagueness about eventual membership and a fleshing out of the criteria will only delay the process, because this vagueness would be used as an excuse, from which nobody stands to benefit."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report calls for the geographical boundaries of the European Union to be determined and its nature defined."
"Not only some Christian Democrats, but also some Social Democrats, are casting around for alternatives to membership of the European Union."
"I would like to remind the House that, a few years ago, political scientists and analysts could not imagine that the day would come when the Iron Curtain would no longer be there."
"But it has gone now, and in that we can rejoice."
"I appeal to the House to be cautious in predicting what the European Union will be like in twenty, thirty, or forty years’ time, when most of us will have long ceased from active involvement in politics."
"I believe that would become us well in view of the way in which most of us were wrong about what was going to happen in 1989."
"The other thing I would like to say is that everyone has been talking about the need for the Ankara protocol to be implemented, and they are right to do so, but what also has to be said is that Turkey and Northern Cyprus are also in favour of a solution, and we have given undertakings."
"The old ‘’ maxim applies, and what that means is that the isolation of the northern part of the island, must, as the European Union has promised, be brought to an end."
"What I have to say to Mr Brok is that I wish Helmut Kohl were not consigned to the history books, but might also, from time to time, again play a part in shaping the CDU’s policy on Europe."
"– Mr President, my political group will not be voting in favour of the Brok report, mainly for the following reasons:"
"The report, especially point 10 with its deliberate obscurity, formulates a dual strategy."
"It leaves the back door wide open for accession prospects to turn into a formula for a special relationship, about which the German Christian Democrats are passionate."
"The point on Kosovo, with its hazy wording, reflects the doublespeak within the Union and the trend towards gradual disengagement from the clear requirements of UN resolution 1244."
"My political group emphasises the demand for Turkey to implement the preconditions set with a specific timetable, starting with the faithful application, without infringements, of the Ankara Protocol."
"Finally, my political group supports, among other things, Amendment 19 on a mutually acceptable resolution of the problem with the name of the FYROM and the revised Amendment 4 on Cyprus."
"– Mr President, the first question we need to debate is, where does Europe end?"
"We no longer know where Europe is: we have reached Diabakir and, if tomorrow the Americans tell us that Iraq needs to join Europe for reasons of equilibrium, shall we reach the Indian Ocean?"
"That is the question."
"Who decides who will join Europe?"
"Until recently we said no to Croatia."
"The prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, said no, Austria put on the pressure and Croatia is in."
"Is this the political will of Europe?"
"Of course, it is not very smart to have to tell our friends the Turks that they must not insult the President of the European Parliament."
"It is not very smart for us to take them EUR 139 million in the occupied areas and for them to pelt the members of the European Parliament with eggs and stones."
"They need to change their attitude, not just one article in their constitution."
"They cannot have this special treatment."
"They cannot threaten a state of Europe with war, with a , while we talk about letting them in."
"Can they not recognise a government which has been recognised by the other 24?"
"These are not logical formulations."
"That brings me to the FYROM which, of course, is claiming a name."
"May I remind you that, when you applied to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria, Germany – at that time vanquished Germany – vetoed it and you entered as Austria?"
"May I remind you that the Bretons did not allow Great Britain to enter because they had Brittany and they joined as the United Kingdom?"
"So why should you not support us, when we have a 3 000-year history with Macedonia?"
"Why do you not call a spade a spade?"
"Why do we not have, at long last, an independent policy and have to follow the Americans' game of upsetting Russia and taking their satellites and opening up a front with Iran and so on? When at long last will Europe – and this is the question – decide that it is not the Americans' baby?"
"We do not need prefects in order to develop our own initiatives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union to date has without a doubt been a successful formula, since it has fostered reforms in many states by extending the area of peace, stability and the rule of law in Europe."
"Further enlargement of the European Union is necessary, but we will have to find new mechanisms and ways which will lead the European Union out of the impasse of its current capacity to absorb new states."
"Certainly, by defining precise criteria the European Commission must develop this concept of absorption capacity."
"In addition to the possibility of full membership we also need to offer various forms of multilateral cooperation and partnership with countries which, at least in the short term, will not be able to join the European Union."
"Here I would like to express my full agreement with what Mr Brok said."
"This could be a way to draw in Turkey, Ukraine and the Balkans for example, and later on, other countries to the path of reform and European values."
"(Mr President, it is a myth that, without further enlargement, the Union will be strong and competitive."
"Yet it is also a myth that the Union can extend its borders indefinitely, for example with Russia joining the EU."
"Let us simply focus on priorities when it comes to enlargement."
"The countries of South-Eastern Europe should be in line after Romania and Bulgaria, which should accede to the European Union in 2007 and not 2008."
"After Croatia and Macedonia we should open another set of doors to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania."
"This is the logical direction to follow."
"It is a question of strategic thinking and also of increasing security on the Old Continent."
"All in all, it will be beneficial from an economic point of view, as we will spend less on enlarging the Union by the next few Balkan states than on throwing money into the bottomless Balkan pre-accession coffers."
"The resolution of permanent conflicts in this part of Europe costs more than it would cost to have these states in Europe and thereby have them following the political and economic rules of play of the EU."
"Let us not fear expanding the Union as a result of the accession of the next few states."
"I know that this fear has become what you might call ‘trendy’."
"It is particularly useful in election campaigns which are continuously taking place in various EU Member States."
"If our Union is to be more effective economically and is not to fall behind in relation to America and Asia, it should progressively abolish the division of Europe into two parts: Europe A, or in other words the European Union, and Europe B, meaning all that which is not part of the Union."
"History has also shown that a Union that expands is a Union that is more secure."
"An invitation to accession negotiations, even without the prospect of joining the Union in the near future, is like the starter’s flag that is raised at the start of a motor race."
"The drivers must have a goal to aim for; they must know where the finishing post lies."
"Then they may travel far, negotiating many turns and even overcoming engine failures."
"What is important, however, is to set the wheels of accession in motion."
"Parliament’s motion for a resolution rightly highlights the fact that it is precisely this impulse that supported reforms in Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan states."
"Yes, enlargement is expensive, particularly in the short term, but it is a worthwhile investment in the long term."
"Mr President, I welcome this generally positive report by Mr Brok."
"I welcome its boldness in recognising the fact that the western Balkans should be an integral part of the European Union in the future."
"I am convinced that we have to respect our commitments; we cannot close the doors to those countries that were offered a membership perspective or to those countries that deserve such a perspective in future in the light of the EU Treaty provisions."
"Let us not, however, repeat our old mistakes."
"We have to be prepared for enlargement."
"First and foremost we have to provide the financing."
"We also have to prepare our citizens for the enlargement perspective by explaining the great benefits of it."
"We have to stop making past and future enlargement a scapegoat for our internal, mostly domestic, problems and inaction."
"In preparing for enlargement, we have to be rigorous, we have to adhere to conditionality, we have to be sincere with our partners."
"Let us not, however, be overly dogmatic."
"It is perfectly possible to open the doors to Croatia without the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is enough to introduce the necessary adjustments in the Accession Treaty."
"Croatia should not be a victim or hostage of our problems with the Constitutional Treaty."
"I welcome the report’s innovativeness and courage."
"We could discuss the idea of intermediate steps towards reaching accession provided they were not permanent – intermediate steps, yes, but not as a substitute for membership."
"Various considerations should not be used as an alibi for inaction or for closing the doors to countries that will one day merit membership, such as Ukraine."
"The Union’s borders are already defined by the EU Treaty, which provides that ‘any European state which respects the principles ...’, etc."
"Finally, let me repeat: enlargement is one of the most successful of the Union’s policies and therefore we should make good use of its potential to build a strong, secure and influential Union, faithful to its values of solidarity, democracy and openness."
"Mr President, I would like to highlight the particular responsibility the European Union has for creating a community of countries, nations and citizens on the European continent that is based on peace, liberal democracy, human rights, market economy and the rule of law."
"However, today we face the question of whether the European Union is capable of further enlargement and of really opening up while also facing the problem of how to define the character of the European Union, including its geographic borders."
"Absorption capacity is currently complicated by the impasse in the ratification process of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and by the obstacles on the path to the deeper political and strategic integration of the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"At the same time, over the next few years, the institutions of the European Union have to implement enlargement strategies that are based on strictly defined terms that take into account the European Union’s obligations towards Turkey, Croatia and all the Western Balkan states."
"The European Union should also elaborate a long-term European perspective in relation to Eastern European countries, and Ukraine in particular."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing enlargement, we are, in essence, discussing our understanding of the European Union."
"Do we think of it as a means to an end or as a political entity in itself?"
"Do we want a free-trade OSCE to stabilise a problematic neighbourhood, or do we want a political union empowered to act on the basis of its own laws?"
"The Brok report is a good thing, in that it really does change the perspective in favour of the second option."
"It is said of us politicians in general that we are incapable of giving praise, but the SPD’s Mr Kuhne has just spoken on the basis of an outstanding document that the German Social Democrats have adopted, and the absolutely marvellous thing about it is that it defines where the SPD stands on enlargement."
"It is indeed the case that, as regards Bulgaria and Romania, the decisions have been taken, but we have to consider the possibility of treating them separately if their performance so warrants."
"It is not the means that are crucial, but the ends."
"It is quite possible that negotiations with Turkey will produce an outcome other than full membership, and here comes a key sentence: ‘We will no longer go along with the progressive softening-up of the accession criteria,’ say the German Social Democrats, and we German Free Democrats agree with them one hundred per cent."
"Assimilation capacity is also defined; here, the main problem is that the European Union’s capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the Member States."
"I see that as quite crucial if we want to carry the public with us. If we want them to remain good and faithful citizens of the European Union, we will have to take their wishes into account."
"Mr President, I very much appreciate the references in Mr Brok’s report to the need to respect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the rights of minorities in Turkey, Croatia and the western Balkan countries."
"When debating the Turkish application to join the Union, I urged the Commission not to repeat the mistakes that were made in the case of the accession of my country, Latvia, in not using this process to promote the rights of minorities."
"The European Free Alliance Group has called upon the European institutions to urge the Turkish Government to improve its policy on ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities."
"Unfortunately, we do not see any progress here and, in particular, innocent citizens are still being killed in Kurdistan."
"Two weeks ago the parents of Derwich Ferho, the prominent human rights defender and President of the Kurdish Institute based in Brussels, were killed."
"Indications suggest that Turkish special forces were involved."
"I am for further enlargement, but I am for enlargement based strictly on the Copenhagen criteria."
"– Mr President, as far as paragraph 29 of the report is concerned, the Council decision to block financial aid to the Turkish Cypriots was a development in the right direction and for that I should like to thank the minister."
"As far as the question of trade is concerned, it can still be addressed within the framework of the recent agreement on discussions of a package of confidence-building measures."
"In their joint statement after their meeting in Paris, the UN Secretary General and President Papadopoulos stated, among other things, that it would be beneficial for all concerned and would greatly improve the atmosphere for further talks if progress could be achieved on further disengagement of forces and demilitarisation on the Island, on the complete de-mining of Cyprus and on the issue of Famagusta."
"In particular, progress on the issue of Famagusta might also result in progress on the question of trade."
"We are all aware of the relevant proposal by the government of Cyprus, whereby the return of Famagusta to its legal residents and the re-opening of the port of Famagusta could resolve the question of trade from and to the occupied areas."
"Unfortunately, however, Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership have not yet taken a position on this specific issue."
"Mr President, first our misguided rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Commission strategy paper ‘advocates an outward-looking Union’."
"He does not really mean an outward-looking Union; what he means is an expansive Union and not, apparently, a period of reflection following the Dutch and the French referendums – not at all!"
"They were saying ‘no’, particularly to Turkey."
"All we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole, and this in the very week that Germany has been told to get its economic house in order!"
"Far from sending shiploads of money to Eastern Europe, they would do better to make sure that the prosperity of Europe as a whole is not compromised."
"It is fashionable at this time to pretend there is a long queue of countries wanting to join this place."
"The fact is that the Balkan countries have just left one bossy, bureaucratic, corrupt organisation called Yugoslavia, and do not wish to join an organisation with similar characteristics merely for the benefit of their health."
"The truth is that they want money."
"They want yet more money."
"What they should not be doing in the Balkan countries is trading their sovereignty as though it was a commodity, for that way lies great disappointment."
"I fear a great deal of disappointment lies ahead for them."
"– Mr President, members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in particular those from Germany and Austria, congratulations! Rather than doing as you used to do, and using populism as a club – the term is your own – with which to beat your former party leaders or leading candidates, you have now hit yourselves over the head with it."
"People are waking up to what the voters are saying, waking up to the real economic figures, and, it is to be hoped, coming to some sort of insight."
"The debates that your group has been having for years on end have now brought forth a document with which we can actually do something."
"Well done, Mr Kuhne!"
"Change of perspective, prospects for accession, capacity to assimilate – that is precisely what it is all about."
"There is cause for hope there, for what you are arguing for is capable of gaining majority support not only among your own voters, but right across Europe too."
"With a proper perspective, things can move forward, but they certainly cannot if we carry on beating about the bush in the way we have been."
"Mr President, enlargements have been beneficial to the European Union; not only the people of the newly admitted countries, but also, certainly, those in the others too, have done well out of them."
"The predominant feeling in my country during the referendum was one of fear of being inundated by Polish plumbers."
"Reality is different: since the most recent enlargement by those countries, the Netherlands has earned EUR 2 billion annually."
"It is precisely those people who have always advocated this enlargement that have to communicate this very information on enlargement, while at the same time keeping an eye on the balance between enlarging and deepening, for this balance is lopsided at present."
"The Treaty of Nice was not really good enough for 25, and it will certainly not be enough when another two countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria, join us shortly."
"I think it would be good for us to commit ourselves to putting our own house in order first with a new treaty before we accept two more countries."
"We should commit to this off our own bat."
"Secondly, I think it important that countries on the edge should not wait for the European Union to finish its homework before they can start the deepening process with a kind of partnership."
"If they wish to become true members, and Europe appears to be able to cope, moving closer towards membership could then be the next step for them."
"This report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment, and I should like to make this quite clear."
"This credibility, however, must also go hand in hand with us attaching credibility to the criteria."
"This means, and Mrs Plassnik is right in saying, that Turkey must monitor the free expression of opinion, not only for the sake of this one author, but also for others, that freedom of religion must be guaranteed and also that we make progress where Cyprus is concerned."
"We welcome the Age Package Deal, but it would be brilliant – and I hope the Commissioner is taking note of this – if Turkey could be persuaded to ratify and implement the protocol."
"How do you intend to achieve this clarity, Commissioner?"
"For once that is done, much progress will also be made in relation to Cyprus itself."
"From that point of view, I am completely behind Amendment 4, in which we in this House spell out once again that we want to do our duty for the sake of the people in the south, but certainly also for those in the north of the island."
"Mr President, enlargement is Europe’s greatest success story which has and will spread stability, security, prosperity and democracy across our continent."
"However, when majority opinion in seven Member States, including my own, opposes future enlargement, it is time to make the case to the public and confront those who seek to block progress; to reject those who even in this resolution seek to use language like ‘operational possibilities’ or ‘redrawing borders’ to undermine Europe’s existing commitments; to confront those like the British Conservatives who say that Europe has to choose between widening and deepening – we do not; to confront the far right who deliberately stoke fears that new migration threatens people’s jobs and livelihoods, when the evidence is just the opposite; to expose those who, even in this resolution again, welcome progress in Croatia, but not the very same progress in Turkey; to recognise that majority Muslim populations in Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania share a European destiny too; and to underline that a pause for reflection on the Constitutional Treaty cannot be an excuse to put a full stop on new enlargement."
"– Mr President, regional integration in the West Balkans is a crucial element in the enlargement strategy of the Commission."
"This endeavour is right, because it encourages cooperation and taking responsibility, and it also brings economic advantages."
"It is not right, however, to force an economic or political unity that is not wanted by those affected, or is not viable in itself."
"It would be much more effective to enlarge the already existing CEFTA, as proposed by the Croatian Government, because it has already proved to be a successful and good cooperation, and this is where the Balkan States should be included."
"The true guarantee of stability in the West Balkans is the authentic promise of European integration."
"In this respect, it is extremely worrying that on the basis of the proposal of the Council, affected countries will not receive adequate financial support in the future, and they will have less support next year and in the following years than they have had so far."
"And this casts doubts on the credibility of the entire accession process."
"Therefore, we want to see a considerable increase in available funds."
"Thirdly: when assessing each country, we must consider their individual achievements, and en bloc or collective assessments of any kind cannot be accepted, because these countries must show their maturity individually."
"Croatia has done a great deal in order to become a Member State of the European Union as soon as possible."
"We must recognise these efforts, because Croatia deserves to conclude the negotiations successfully, as soon as possible."
"– First of all, I would like to thank Mr Brok for his very constructive and logical report."
"I am sure that if the European Union was able to formulate its position on all matters in this way, it would certainly be better supported and understood by its citizens."
"I would like to speak about the section of the report which talks about Turkey."
"I entirely agree that the European Union's expansion strategy has undoubtedly encouraged democratic, political and other reforms in Turkey and the other states mentioned in the resolution."
"However, it is equally important to note that, and I quote, ‘while a political transition process is still underway in Turkey, in 2005 the pace of reforms has slowed and the implementation of reforms remains uneven’."
"This is the exact reply I received yesterday from Commissioner Rehn to my verbal question on the implementation of the European Parliament's resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey."
"This is also indicated in the draft resolution we have debated today, that is, that the pace of reforms in Turkey in 2005 was not only insufficient, but it actually has slowed down."
"This may be interpreted as Turkey's unpreparedness to carry out reforms which would bring it closer to the European Union, or perhaps even as an unwillingness to commit itself to the elementary obligations of possible membership."
"I also share the regret expressed in Mr Brok's report and in the resolution over the unilateral declaration made by Turkey when signing the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement."
"I believe that it is necessary to remind Turkey that recognition of all European Union Member States is an indispensable component of the accession process."
"True, what I am about to say is not in the report, but I am sure that the acts of genocide committed against the Armenian nation 90 years ago should be recognised by Turkey at the highest level, as this more than any other action would bear testimony to the fact that Turkey's position, even regarding these painful events of the past, is in tune with the spirit of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Mr President, the Brok report does not define anything concrete in respect of ethnic minorities."
"The European Union often uses double or even triple standards when it requires and expects something completely different from two candidate states, while it hardly ever calls to account its own Member States in matters regarding ethnic minorities."
"Following an armed insurrection, Albanians living in Macedonia were given administrative and even territorial autonomy of the widest extent, while in the case of Romania, the European Union does not press for territorial autonomy for the almost one million Hungarians living in Székely Land."
"The European Union promises independence to Kosovo, but for Vojvodina, it does not even recommend the autonomy that had been stripped away by Milosevic."
"Please support the Hungarian amendment proposals aimed at the preservation of the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina, the protection of minorities and the widening of provincial autonomy."
"Commissioner Olli Rehn knows very well that there is no solution without autonomy for Swedish-speaking Finns in Finland, and there cannot be a solution in the Balkans or for the Kurds living in Turkey, either."
"– Mr President, we need to be particularly honest and accept that the enlargement strategy is not the reason for the current institutional crisis in the European Union."
"However, as a strategic objective, enlargement can be the scapegoat for collective European impasses and that, in my opinion, should be avoided."
"Within this framework, the message sent by the Austrian Presidency and the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Salzburg on the final objective of the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union is indeed especially important."
"We are saying yes to the integration of the countries and no to special relationships."
"From this side, the Commission should speed up the submission of its proposal for the granting of entry visas to the citizens of the Balkan countries."
"The question is deeply political, not bureaucratic."
"The doublespeak in the European Union on Kosovo is causing concern."
"The absence of a joint EU policy will have negative consequences."
"Finally, as far as Cyprus is concerned, I believe that the time has come for political initiatives to be taken to create necessary political and social osmosis at the level of civil society between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots."
"The role of catalyst belongs to the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur Mr Brok has done thorough work in showing the countries of the western Balkans the path to the European Union."
"It is my duty as leader of the Moldova delegation, however, to remind us all of the fact that there are two countries even closer to the heart of Europe which need the promise of European Union membership just as much as the Balkan countries and Turkey."
"The European Parliament has clearly expressed its support for the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova to become candidates for membership of the European Union."
"Moldova has been making a huge effort for two years."
"Ukraine has also recently shown that it wishes to become a European country."
"I sensed that very clearly when I visited Ukraine last week."
"I am disappointed, however, with the excessive emphasis placed on the fourth Copenhagen criterion in the report."
"At the same time, I agree with Elmar Brok that the European Commission should define the nature of accession capacity as soon as possible."
"This should not be a vague excuse for rejecting countries wishing to accede to the European Union."
"Since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, our union has been reformed."
"This is the success story of those countries that fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria."
"Potential candidate countries must in future also be evaluated on the basis of transparent criteria."
"Expansion must continue, because Europe needs stability in the same way it needs air."
". Mr President, I am grateful for this exciting and certainly tense debate, which the Council, too, will regard as important."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am from a country that, according to all the figures and data available, benefited very considerably from the last enlargement, yet, even so, the popular view of both the European Union itself and its enlargement is a very critical one, so let me make a few personal observations on the subject."
"There will be no Europe without frontiers; yet Europe was always a political project."
"That is why neither geographers nor historians nor rulers will be any use to us in the political decisions that we have to take; what will decide the issues will be the common will of those who share in this community of values and laws, namely us and – as is the norm in democracies – the people themselves."
"Where, then, do we stand now?"
"Looked at objectively, 3 October last year saw the taking of political decisions with far-reaching implications; what is ahead of us now – ‘us’ being the Council and the Commission with our partners around the world – is a period of quietly working on the issues."
"Let me just make three more comments on the geographical issues in the Balkans: what is this, in essence, all about?"
"What are we working on?"
"I believe we are working on Europe as a peace project, on its reunification, on the overcoming of the East/West divide, on doing away with the division created by Communism."
"It is intolerable that the Balkans should end up in some European no man's land; we must again spell out where we see the added value for ourselves, for our own people, and for the peoples of the Balkans an added value made up of the rule of law, of security and of economic opportunity."
"If I may turn to Turkey, to which many Members made reference, in the currently ongoing process, the Commission and the Council are addressing not only the progress Turkey has made with its reform process, but also, and quite specifically and directly, what remains to be done in such areas as religious freedom and the free expression of opinion."
"We did this in our troika meeting."
"Let me say something about Ukraine."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and I were recently on a troika mission in Ukraine together, and I can give you the same message that I gave there: it is that Europe, the European Union, would like to see a stable, self-confident and successful Ukraine, but, above all, a Ukraine that faces up to the task of transformation and tackles it with determination."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan that is about to be reviewed for the first time during the Austrian Presidency provide us with a good and appropriate array of instruments."
"There is also considerable potential for such things as a deeper agreement that might well include a broad-based free trade agreement."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by imparting to you some breaking news: the decisions of late 2005 have created a solid political framework for our enlargement policy for 2006 to 2010, and in some cases even further."
"For instance, the accession negotiations with Turkey are likely to take 10 to 15 years."
"I do not expect anyone seriously to question our existing commitments in South-East Europe because it is really a matter of our own security and stability that we can enhance peace, democracy and increase prosperity in that very sensitive area."
"We now have a consolidated and sufficiently demanding enlargement agenda."
"The enlargement train is no bullet train, no TGV, no Eurostar; it is a normal train or, in some cases, even a local train, but, most importantly, this train is moving, it is in the process and is thereby transforming the countries that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union."
"Concerning the borders of Europe, the Commission works on the basis of Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European country that respects and applies the European values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms may apply for membership of the Union."
"That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country, but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all, which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood."
"Meanwhile, although no final borders of the Union have yet been determined, the EU is developing other forms of partnership and cooperation with our neighbouring countries, for instance in the form of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which can be further developed and upgraded."
"A few comments and points have been made concerning absorption capacity."
"I would like to give a very brief historical overview."
"That concept was first explicitly mentioned in Copenhagen in 1993 when the European Council stated that the Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interests of both the Union and the candidate countries."
"That concept and its consequences have been examined regularly by the Commission."
"In its Agenda 2000 – and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda 2000, which was adopted in 1997 – the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences."
"As a result, this work led to the setting of critical parameters in the negotiations that followed, in the decisions of March 1999 at the Berlin Summit and in 2003, when the countries of eastern and central Europe were allowed to join the European Union."
"This facilitated the accession of EU-10 and, by those means, we successfully combined our historic mission of reunifying the European continent and taking care of the practical considerations, which are also of concern to our citizens today."
"Later on, we examined that concept during the accession negotiations, in some chapters in particular, such as that on the free movement of persons and the financial chapters, and more recently the Commission also examined that concept in our 2004 Issues Paper on questions arising from the Turkish accession perspective."
"I would recommend this paper of October 2004 to all Members of the European Parliament."
"It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if, one day, Turkey meets all the conditions for accession."
"Thus, the upsurge in capacity is an important concept, and it has also been referred to in the negotiating frameworks for Turkey and Croatia."
"I can assure you that we bear this in mind throughout the negotiations, and it is also a leading concept in our strategy document of last November."
"We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration."
"Finally, referring to what Mr Eurlings said about deepening and widening, I belong to the camp that thinks that the deepening of political integration is indispensable in order to make the European Union more effective and democratic."
"We must make the Union function better, and that was and is the purpose of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Therefore, we need a constitutional debate and, in time – sooner rather than later – we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations, in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism."
"That must be done in the near future, not in the distant future – not in 10 to 15 years, for instance, when Turkey might be able to join – for the sake of Europe, and we need it already for the European Union of 25 or 27 Member States."
"Therefore, rather than talk about absorption capacity, I would prefer to talk about the functioning capacity of the current European Union to ensure that we serve our citizens better in terms of both policies and institutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"– Mr Brok’s report is comprehensive and complete in terms of the current state of enlargement, and takes account of countries that are undoubtedly making genuine efforts to meet the political and economic goals requested for accession to the European Union."
"In particular, we agree with the invitation to Croatia to ‘resolve on-going bilateral issues, particularly […] property related ones’, but regret to note that no reference is made to problems concerning changes to that country’s law in relation to access to the property market by Community citizens, specifically Italians and exiles from Giulia and Dalmatia."
"No EU citizen can be prevented from taking up residence in a Member State and having access to the property market."
"To justify the ban by application of the principle of reciprocity is not sufficient to show that Croatia meets all the requirements to be eligible to join the EU in the future."
"Mindful of its failure to comply with a principle of freedom now accepted by all Member States, and although we are voting in favour of the report, we would request that Croatia be requested to remedy this serious breach which, if it continued, would make it impossible for us to support its accession."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on mergers in the internal market."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that will naturally be dominated largely by the Commissioner’s speech."
"I can imagine that the Members present will be particularly interested in hearing what the Commission has to say."
"I shall therefore confine myself to just a few remarks on behalf of the Council, as we are convinced that, in applying the new provisions and the EU competition rules, the Commission is showing great responsibility towards achieving the objectives of competition policy in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"The sector studies that the Commission is already preparing and wishes to carry out in further depth form a crucial basis for this, and the issue of market definition is also significant in this regard."
"It is important to bear in mind that the medium- and long-term aspects should also be taken into consideration when making decisions on mergers."
"The economy is not static but dynamic, and so enterprises are faced with the daily challenge of arming themselves for the future and remaining competitive."
"There are more than 23 million enterprises in the EU as a whole; every day sees the establishment of new enterprises and the closure of others."
"Following on from the debate that we held this morning, it should be pointed out once more that 99% of enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises, which between them account for 80% of employment."
"Competitiveness also has a considerable impact on the labour market, therefore, and presupposes effective competition."
"There must be no distortion of competition in the internal market: that is one of the essential bases for the success of the European economy."
"Completion of the internal market and of economic and monetary union, EU enlargement, and the reduction of the barriers to international trade and to investment will lead to even greater reorganisation of enterprises, including in the form of concentrations."
"Reorganisation such as this is welcome in so far as it meets the requirements of dynamic competition and is likely to increase the competitiveness of European industry by improving conditions for economic growth and by raising the standard of living in the Community."
"This is perfectly in line with the Lisbon objectives that have been discussed today."
"The present issue is currently being discussed in the light of the current examples of concentrations in the energy field, in particular."
"Particularly important to the public and consumers in this regard are trends in prices, which are negatively influenced by a lack of competition, and considerations of job preservation."
"Consumers can easily imagine that the only way of preventing unjustified price increases is through sufficient competition."
"It also holds true, however, that jobs can only be safeguarded in the long term if enterprises are competitive."
"In this connection, we should actively pursue a pan-European competition policy in the context of the four fundamental freedoms."
"Another important task of competition policy is ensuring that instances of reorganisation and concentration cannot result in permanent damage to competition."
"That is why, as you know, Community law comprises provisions regarding concentrations that could distort competition either throughout or in a large part of the common market."
"To reiterate: we are convinced that the Commission will take the right action and proceed responsibly."
"The rule of law and thus the predictability of decisions is also particularly essential to the success of Europe as a business location."
"To this end, the work on the more economic-based approach will have to be carried out in even greater depth."
"If, following an evaluation phase, it becomes clear that the legal framework for mergers needs to be supplemented in this regard, the Council will address this issue, too."
"It is also clear that it is not possible to cast all eventualities in regulatory frameworks; instead, a certain level of abstraction is necessary."
"The Council Presidency also assumes that, when making its now-imminent decisions, the Commission will exercise its judgment on such issues as market definition and the determination of efficiency with the utmost care."
". Mr President, Europe thrives on breaking down barriers between Member States, not on erecting them."
"Open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe."
"Companies that are successful players in the European market are also well placed to compete globally."
"The Commission will always look with concern at any attempt by national governments, directly or indirectly, to interfere unduly in the process of cross-border corporate restructuring in Europe."
"The Treaty enshrines the principle that there should be no unjustified impediment to the fundamental freedoms it establishes – in particular the free movement of capital – or to the right of establishment within it."
"Fundamental to these rights is the freedom for companies to re-structure, including by change of ownership."
"To deny this possibility to companies as a matter of principle or by failing to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition in the markets – such as energy, telecoms and financial services – would amount to a serious restriction of their ability to adapt to the challenges presented by the integration of markets in the EU, to the rapid advances in technology which many industries are experiencing, and generally to the evolving dynamics of doing business in the Europe of today."
"European industry is rising to these challenges, including by the appearance of an increasing number of cross-border European businesses."
"Whilst the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition in the Member State concerned, thereby contributing to the realisation of concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice."
"Take the energy sector as an example."
"The Green Paper published by the Commission last week was very clear."
"Sustainable, competitive and secure energy will not be achieved without open and competitive energy markets, based on competition between companies looking to become Europe-wide competitors rather than dominant national players."
"Open markets will strengthen Europe and allow it to tackle its problems."
"At the same time, the process of cross-border corporate restructuring enhances the competitiveness of European businesses by equipping it to succeed in global markets."
"Any interference in this process by national governments which is not justified by legitimate interest as provided for in the Treaties, secondary legislation or jurisprudence, risks being seriously damaging to Europe’s prospects of benefiting from the opportunities presented by market integration and globalisation."
"The Commission, as you know, has two principal legal instruments at its disposal – the single market rules in the EC Treaty and Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation – for addressing undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring."
"It has the duty to enforce these rules accordingly wherever appropriate."
"As guardian of the EC Treaty, and as the institution responsible for merger control on competition grounds at the European level, the Commission is determined to guarantee that companies can effectively benefit from the advantages of the EU’s internal market."
"That is why enforcement of these provisions is, and will remain, one of the Commission’s central priorities."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is being tested; in the field of energy, in particular, it could even be said to be at risk."
"The promotion of national champions results in national monopolies, which means that there is no competition, and this also means that there is no more competition in the European internal market."
"This scenario is bad for consumers."
"European energy enterprises face the additional problem that, if they are not competing in Europe, they will also no longer be internationally competitive in future."
"That, too, aggravates the situation in Europe."
"Incidentally, it also aggravates the situation for all other enterprises, as they have to pay the high energy prices and thus also lose out in terms of international competitiveness."
"Although I explicitly support the efforts of the Commission and, in particular, the Commissioner on this issue, I believe that the Commission’s options are simply limited."
"The Commission is trying to present instruments of competition law, but the famous two-thirds rule in mergers law almost always applies in the field of energy, in particular – and, as a result, the Commission’s scope for intervention is minimal."
"I am aware that Commissioner Kroes is considering changing this, but to do so would require unanimity within the Council, and I do not believe that such unanimity will be possible in the present situation."
"That is why it is vital that the Council, too, concern itself with this problem."
"Governments can be expected to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Treaties and of European law."
"Ultimately, the fact is that we want to see an internal market in the field of energy enterprises, in particular."
"That is why I expect the Council to become involved with this issue."
"I should like to make one comment on takeovers law: newspaper reports in the past few days have alleged that European takeovers law is promoting this development."
"I consider that inappropriate."
"Member States can be expected to transpose takeovers law, but this is a case of relations between enterprises; it has nothing to do with the exertion of political influence."
"The exertion of political influence is not covered by decisions under takeovers law at European level, and should be avoided and prevented."
"It is vital that this issue be put openly on the table in the Council and that an appeal be made to all those responsible within the Council."
". Mr President, imagine that next weekend President Barroso called a press conference to announce the merger of Euronet, Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange."
"A dream scenario or a nightmare?"
"I tend to say neither, but simply note that it is rather improbable that would happen."
"The message of my group, nevertheless, is that President Barroso, the Commissioner and their colleagues should not be caught napping in the situation we now find ourselves in, with the mergers, acquisitions and developments we see in the financial markets, energy and other sectors – sectors that are all very important for the European economy."
"We Social Democrats still believe that the state has a role to play in the economy as a facilitator, as a regulator and as a defender of the public interest."
"I do not say that we politicians should take the leading role and be the stars at press conferences, but we should play a role in silent diplomacy and in creating the conditions in a dialogue with companies; we should not only commence with what has happened but also anticipate what will happen."
"That is why I do not like your approach, Commissioner, which is only negative and seeks to prevent authorities from interfering in what is happening with companies."
"I think there should be a proactive approach and I shall mention three questions on which we should have a thorough debate in Europe."
"The first is industrial policy."
"I was very happy with some of Commissioner Verheugen’s remarks this morning, which were made more from the perspective of industrial policy."
"The second – which was also mentioned by Mr Lehne – concerns what is happening in takeovers and the way we organise this."
"We need a debate there, not only on shareholder democracy, which the and are preaching, but on other aspects too."
"The third is the European approach versus the national approach."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are really facing a situation of great importance for Europe: the Member States are still attached to the perception of a national dimension still viewed as predominant in all circumstances, while we are forgetting that a change of dimension has occurred and that we must move consciously towards a continental dimension, aware that we are moving in that direction and also knowing how to manage it."
"That is why I fail to understand the problems being raised, for instance, in relation to bank mergers in Poland; in Italy, we accepted a takeover offor precisely that reason."
"I detect a conflict of interest behind these problems, because very often these are companies that are wholly-owned, or at least majority-owned by the State."
"It is a conflict of interest between the immediate political interest and the long-term interest, not only of consumers, but also of the overall efficiency of the European system."
"This also happened in the case of and , where a serious conflict of interest emerged between the need to rationalise our companies in order to equip them to compete on a global level and the need to avoid them being embarrassed in the very short term."
"I also ask that the competitive framework be organised; this is something we also discussed this morning with Commissioner Kroes, whom I thank for her readiness to act on energy competition."
"We need to create electricity networks, gas and electricity on a completely European level."
"This is our mission and I urge quick action to achieve it."
". Mr President, I fully understand the anger of Italy and Spain at what I would call German-French energy imperialism in Europe."
"It is the German and French economies that pay the highest price for it."
"Austria has electricity and gas prices that are 20% lower than those in Germany because it has lower grid costs and because it has more competition in its market than the German market has."
"The answer to what has happened over the past weeks, Mrs Kroes and Mr Barroso, is not European champions."
"European energy champions would squeeze out even more money from our major industry and consumers, and from us as citizens, and pass it on to the shareholders."
"So the only answer is to have competitive markets, which have to be enforced by strong and independent regulators, strong competition authorities and full ownership unbundling."
". –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always said that energy and Europe did not need a laissez-faire approach, but rather valid policies on which a consensus existed."
"The proof of this is what is happening now: Europe is finding it extremely difficult to develop an innovative energy policy commensurate with the problems raised by the Kyoto Protocol and the needs of a new and different kind of development."
"The world is experiencing tragic wars for control of oil resources, and this conflict is now moving into Europe: obviously the solution is not protectionism, but instead a fairer use of available energy and the promotion of energy savings and renewable sources."
"I reiterate our firm opposition to dangerous sources such as nuclear power."
"We need to introduce economic and social models that are not ‘energivorous’, and emphasise cooperation with other continents; as we can see, this is quite different from becoming involved in trade wars that have nothing to do with our future."
"To reduce everything to goods and trade is a serious error."
"Neither laissez-faire nor protectionism, but a diverse and shared energy policy and one of solidarity for Europe and the world – that must be our role."
". (Mr President, I would like to speak on the subject of the merger of two banking groups: and ."
"It is a subject that has caused a great deal of controversy in Poland."
"In 1999 acquired a majority share in , one of the largest Polish banks."
"It was, as it turned out, a very profitable decision."
"Seven years on, the value of the shares has increased fourfold."
"When buying the Polish bank, the Italians had to agree, however, that they would not invest any capital in any company in competition with that bank in Poland."
"The acquisition of and, by that token, also of another Polish bank, , is therefore a clear breach of the privatisation agreement."
"The Polish authorities are therefore obliged to block this merger and to enforce the terms of the agreement."
"It is worth pointing out that this dispute is by no means about the Polish Government seeking to prevent a foreign entity gaining control of a national company, as has been the case recently in France, Spain or Italy."
"Accusations of protectionism levelled at the Polish Government are therefore completely unfounded in this case."
"We should also remember that, while the European Commission has control over mergers at a Community level, obligations relating to agreements and the control over banks remain the competencies of national governments."
"I therefore hope that the European Commission will take these arguments into consideration and that Poland will cease to be on the receiving end of a barrage of threats related to this subject."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unification of markets is a fundamental aim of the Union, but it is also more than that: the market is one of the pillars on which the whole process of European integration was – and is – based."
"A true market requires, firstly, that capital should be able to circulate freely and be invested where it earns the best return; secondly, it requires companies to have a cross-border dimension and the ability to set up wherever the interests of their competitiveness dictate, through the medium of mergers and acquisitions, which may even be hostile."
"The market does not tolerate the abuse of a dominant position that prevents free competition."
"An open market and one that operates smoothly is crucial for European competitiveness in international markets."
"Protectionism causes the opposite effect, as we have seen in recent months; states blocking cross-border takeovers, mergers or acquisitions to protect strategic national interests."
"Protectionism really serves to defend weak and inefficient companies, or to create national champions artificially."
"The damage caused is significant for clients unable to obtain goods and services at the best prices, and is a serious matter for a society forced to bear the costs of uncompetitive companies."
"Moreover, protectionism is inherently incapable of guaranteeing workers safe and sustainable employment prospects."
"Protectionism means putting Europe into reverse."
"To operate properly, the market must be efficient and avoid distortions."
"Everyone must play by the rules: we cannot accept unfair competition from those States and companies that, on the one hand, protect themselves, and, on the other, exploit the virtuous openness displayed by others."
"This is why we are asking the European Commission to take firm action to ensure freedom of movement for capital and unfettered competition."
"We are therefore pleased to hear the comments of Mrs Kroes here in Parliament."
"To have the courage to take that decision means really being a serious European: competitiveness, growth and the well being of citizens, based on an integrated market, are vital to prepare the ground for the birth of the European Constitution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you want the market to operate properly."
"You must therefore renounce this frenzied liberalism that you are proposing to us and that clearly does not achieve its objectives."
"What we need is a mergers strategy that works, certainly, but one that also comes with a well-regulated industrial policy strategy and with business strategies that respect objectives relating to the environment and social standards."
"I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council was right to say that it is also necessary to include medium- and long-term objectives, which an unfettered liberalism cannot fulfil."
"Furthermore, if we want the takeover bid directive to work properly, the Member Sates will have a great responsibility."
"We will have to also perhaps provide for its review – this is included in the text - so that the power of shareholders is not that kind of blind power that, without taking account of any interest, or the State in question, or the industrial strategy in force, or the interests of the employees, could destroy companies that, over the years, have accumulated a know-how and a business strategy that could also contribute towards a European industrial policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves faced with two possible mergers."
"The first, between and , is undesirable, because it creates an energy monopoly in the Belgian gas and electricity sector and further closes off the French market to competitors."
"The second merger, however, between and , could give rise to a diversification of the French and Belgian energy market."
"The principle of reciprocity in relations between European countries in the energy sector seems essential for a European energy market that benefits the consumer, and for a common European policy in the energy sector."
"In Italy, ample space has been given to energy companies from other countries by means of privatisation and liberalisation policies."
"This has also happened in other European countries."
"France’s breach of the principle of reciprocity in this case cannot be justified by a need to guarantee an autonomous energy sector by means of national champions, but is rather an expression of an excessively nationalistic policy. France already has its national energy champions: it does not need to create any more."
"The merger between and , which controls the Belgian company , carries a serious risk of encouraging protectionist trends, not only in the energy sector, but also in other industrial, financial and service sectors."
"In other cases, the European Commission has strictly applied its antitrust instruments to prevent the development of dominant positions and retaliation by international competition."
"This has happened recently in the cases of , and , which now seems to have gone in favour of , a French bank."
"It is to be hoped that the Commission employs a similar strictness in ensuring the free movement of capital, because even in these circumstances the principle must apply to everyone, for we cannot allow some countries in Europe to be more equal than others."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are holding this debate this afternoon in the context of extremely serious events in the energy markets, essentially in electricity and gas."
"We are seeing takeover bids led by governments − as in Spain – or prevented by governments – as in France."
"This is all the wrong way round, and is contrary to the spirit of the European Union."
"We are hearing political arguments from top politicians of important European countries who have no hesitation in questioning the fundamental principles of the European Union: the free movement of capital and full competition in the markets."
"These include arguments such as those we have heard over recent days from Ministers who appear to be talking about planning: the most antiquated and failed form of economic planning."
"They are quite happy to talk about protectionism, about economic patriotism, about nationalism; in short, they are using the worst kinds of populist argument."
"In light of this, we must commit ourselves fully to European construction, which means the free integration of markets, acknowledging that there are asymmetries in those markets."
"Of course there are asymmetries!"
"We have hardly seen a single example of economic integration in which there have not been asymmetries."
"But despite that, here we are, we have come this far, and these political positions simply add more problems and difficulties to the problems and difficulties we have already had to face."
"We are talking about strategic sectors, but equally strategic are communications, transport and finance."
"Faced with these nationalist temptations, we would call upon the Commission to prioritise the objective and ideal of European integration and, in the face of this populist and isolationist attitude, to dedicate itself to the objective of creating a single market."
"In short, we are calling upon the Commission to do its duty as guardian of the Treaties and to promote real development and employment policies for all of the European citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of industrial and financial concentration can strengthen the European Union on the world stage."
"In certain cases and for certain phases this process can usefully occur through national channels, but all too often these are defensive and run the risk of triggering a dangerous spiral of protectionism that must absolutely be stopped."
"We have to move the legal framework further and promote greater convergence of national regulations for mergers and acquisitions, otherwise the race for reciprocity clauses will swamp all these countries beneath more closed and protective legislation."
"Finally, we will inevitably have oligopolistic structures in certain sectors, for example in the energy sector."
"These structures must not be collusive or unfavourable to consumers, nor must public control of certain companies facilitate market abuse."
"In conclusion, we need the regulatory authority to be strengthened and integrated, antitrust to be strengthened and, in the immediate term, a more active and effective attitude from the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you know that very many eyes in Belgium are fixed on you at the moment."
"The general expectation is that you will tell the newly merged French groups Suez and Gaz de France in no uncertain terms that their position on a market as small as the Belgian one is untenably monopolistic."
"I know that your offices have not been officially told about the merger, but we do not believe that that means that you cannot, at this stage, send out a clear message to the effect that situations of that kind contravene European law, because the newly merged group is set to supply no less than 90% of the gas distributed in Belgium."
"I hope you can confirm that a company with a market concentration of that kind will be required to surrender a substantial share of its activities."
"Commissioner Kroes, you are the only guarantee the customer has, and I mean both private persons and industry, that they will not have to pay an unacceptably high price for their gas and electricity in future."
"You also have the power to restore public confidence in Europe, at least to some extent."
"You can do so by making it clear to those mammoth industrial groups that they are cashing in on liberalisation, that what they are doing is illegal and is in contravention of those competition rules."
"You have also said that soon, you will table fresh proposals in order to put an end to the concentration of power in the energy distribution."
"I would like to know if you can confirm that what you mean by that is that major producers will be required to relinquish their blocking capacity in distribution companies."
"I should like to finish off, Commissioner, by saying that you can write history by asserting your influence and spelling out that the European authorities are equal to these monster mergers."
"You have the reputation of being a tough cookie, and we would appreciate it if, in the next few weeks, you could give us reason to believe that that reputation is warranted."
"Mr President, I agree with the Commissioner’s view that it makes no sense to talk about national champions and continental giants and that the approach taken in competition law is to decide on a case by case basis."
"The competition policy is key, but it does not resolve everything in the field of energy, and nor does the internal market policy."
"To talk about energy is to talk about security and general interests."
"Energy is vital and it essentially falls within the Member States’ current competences."
"There are currently 25 energy markets with great disparities, asymmetries in regulations and operators who work according to differing strategic options and foreign policy commitments."
"We need a homogenised system with harmonised conditions of play."
"The big operators cannot impose or predetermine these conditions."
"A European energy market, with European energy services, will not create itself, but will result from the European method, from common commitment and action."
"Europe needs an agenda and leadership in order to make this possible."
"We Socialists advocate a European energy policy, as laid down, for the first time, in the European Constitution."
"Rather than resentful words condemning patriotism, we need intelligent action in favour of Europeanism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks the Italian UDC-SVP delegation has presented a written question to the Commission in order to highlight the contradictions of a European energy policy apparently in crisis."
"The decision of the French Government to create another energy giant by breaching the principles of the European market will have negative consequences."
"The merger between the companies of and risks setting Member State against Member State just as Europe is about to embark on a 100% liberalisation of the market of this sector."
"This political initiative flies in the face of all plans for transparency and free competition, replacing, in fact, the right to financial wrangling that ought to be a part of a single market."
"Furthermore, France’s adoption of the directive on takeover bids, which the National Assembly will, after a long silence, take up tomorrow, gives cause for concern."
"A draft law such as this could obstruct ’s potential capital transactions by granting excessive powers to companies that are subject to a takeover bid."
"Faced with such an anomaly, we had no choice but to raise the problem responsibly, asking ourselves what kind of energy policy our Europe intends to pursue."
"We wish to make clear in this House, Mr President, our fear of a dangerous drift towards a Europe made up of nations that are against the ideals and spirit of the Treaties, and against the spirit and values handed down to us by Alcide De Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schumann and Jean Monnet."
"A Europe that has created for itself a single currency, that seeks to harmonise laws, legislation, statutes and institutions, that has created a central bank and that has established the Schengen area, cannot be reduced to a game in which national interests prevail over community interests, and where policy is fast taking the place of the market."
"The prospect of a pan-European industrial context, relaunched by President Barroso with the approval of the Green Paper on Energy, at last gives cause for hope."
"The Commission’s main objectives in the coming months must be to create open markets that benefit the consumer and to focus on global European policies that protect against national self-interests."
"Mr President, when I hear Members of this Parliament treating the principle of the free movement of capital as sacrosanct, forgetting about the social objectives laid down in the Treaty, such as employment, the development of a balanced economy or the maintenance of solidarity and cohesion, I get the impression that some Members of this Parliament have not read the European Union's Treaties."
"With regard to takeover bids, in general, we must take account, for example, of the interests of the workers, which are recognised in the Directive on takeover bids, and, secondly, we must take account of public service obligations."
"As Mr Turmes said earlier, the large multinationals are currently demanding higher sums from their subscribers in certain countries than in countries where that free movement does not exist."
"Those of us from outlying island regions are wondering who is going to pay the additional cost that will arise for these regions in deficit."
"Finally, I would like to point out that it is not true that the Directive on takeover bids does not provide for political interventions: Article 4(5) provides for the establishment of exceptional measures in accordance with national circumstances."
"European Union regulators will have to take this into account."
"Mr President, I am going to take notice of my compatriot Sánchez Presedo and talk about the takeover bids – plural – for the company, Endesa."
"What has the Spanish Socialist Government done in this case?"
"Firstly, it has systematically occupied all of the regulatory bodies and the Competition Court."
"For the first time in the history of Spanish democracy, the three are presided over by persons of known political affiliation."
"Secondly, it has blatantly supported a particular takeover bid for Endesa, to the extent that the Council of Ministers approved it contrary to the opinion-report of the Competition Court."
"Thirdly, it has built a wall − repeated today by the Minister for the Economy and the Minister for Industry − to prevent the takeover bid by another Community company."
"To the Prime Minister’s cry of ‘they shall not pass’, the Minister for Industry deployed all of his ‘weapons of mass obstruction’ to the point of changing the rules of the game in the middle of the match − which incidentally had to be rectified during the stage between the Cabinet and the Official State Bulletin − turning Spain into a kind of banana republic in which legal certainty is trampled upon."
"If we are to talk about economic patriotism, what Spain needs in order to continue growing and creating employment is more competition rather than more protectionism, more liberalism rather than political interference or haggling, more energy security, which means integration into Europe, rather than continuing to be an island where energy is concerned."
"I would ask the Commission, firstly, to clear up the political doubts surrounding these operations."
"As soon as the takeover bid took place, I asked the Commissioner to seek a resolution of the issue, because I warned her of the political risks involved in that bid."
"She did not wish to do so, and that has brought us to where we are today."
"Secondly, I would ask that the application of the competition rules as they stand be guaranteed."
"Thirdly, as she has said, I would ask for integration into a common market, which will be the only way to ensure energy sufficiency and cheap energy and into an internal market, which is what we want to see."
"That is Spanish patriotism and it is also European patriotism."
"(Mr President, Community law governs mergers and acquisitions on the internal market by creating a competition policy which is one of the main Community policies and also one of its earliest."
"It is supposed to guarantee the removal of barriers to internal trade within the single market and to ensure that they are not replaced by other actions by businesses or governments which would distort competition."
"Unfortunately, recent events have shown that in some Member States protectionist and short-sighted activities are being carried out."
"This applies to the German company which is trying to acquire the Spanish company , the merger of the French gas giant with , the Italian-based, multinational fuel and energy group and the recent blocking by the Polish Government of the merger involving the . bank and bank, which is the product of a merger between the German and the Italian ."
"The opposition of the Polish Government has a dubious legal base with respect to Community law and shows Poland in an unfavourable light in relation to foreign investors."
"Unfortunately, this case has also become a weapon for the right-wing government in its fight against the independence of the Polish National Bank, which is also the central bank."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, did you know that yoghurt is a matter of national interest?"
"That was the argument put forward by a large founding Member State on the question of whether a takeover of Danone was permissible, even though the company’s turnover and profits are predominantly generated abroad."
"The present discussion is astonishing."
"Everyone is in favour of his country’s enterprises going on a buying spree around Europe and the world – but not in his own country."
"I did not hear anyone in Spain complaining when the Spanish Telefónica took over the German–British enterprise O2 or when Banco de Santander took over a large British financial services provider."
"I did not see anyone becoming agitated about France seeking to buy up an Italian bank, or Electricité de France acquiring a stake in Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, or UniCredito in Italy acquiring Hypo-Vereinsbank, even though ABN AMRO encountered problems when it tried to take a similar course of action in Italy."
"We are seeing a great deal of hypocrisy here on the part of Member States and the Council."
"They are closing their own doors behind them and seeking to do business elsewhere; and thus weakening the European economy."
"We are labouring under a misapprehension if we believe that the Lisbon objectives can be achieved and we can become stronger by means of national protectionism, when we cannot even withstand the relevant competition in our own area."
"We need strong enterprises, and also enterprises that go to other countries and introduce more competition there."
"The Commission faces challenges on two levels."
"It must examine each case carefully and answer the following questions."
"Does the fusion benefit consumers?"
"Does it enhance competition? That is the Commission’s real task when it comes to examination, and the answer is often ‘yes’, and occasionally ‘no’."
"The Commission must take a strict line towards the Council, as confidence that Member States and the Council are thinking in terms of a European approach and of the internal market has suffered greatly in recent years."
"– The Commission’s initiative to review the regulation on mergers is a welcome one."
"The legislation has become ineffective, as evidenced by unbalanced and economically unsustainable legal decisions in relation to the energy market in Portugal and Spain."
"The recent upsurge in large-scale operators in Europe exacerbates regulatory problems, especially in smaller countries with more fragile resources."
"Essential goods and services that should be universally available at the lowest possible cost are now being provided by private companies operating monopolies or oligopolies."
"When the imperfections of the market become the rule rather than the exception, the objectives that competition should be able to produce become unattainable, and it is in this area in particular that the role of regulation is vital."
"Commissioner, will the ongoing legislative review provide answers to some of these questions?"
"How does the Commission envisage regulating the power of the European oligopolies?"
"Can Europe live without deep reflection on industrial policy and services of general economic interest?"
"I thank you in advance for answering these questions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great to deal to add to what I said at the start."
"I declared my support clearly, on behalf of the Council, for competition in the interests of consumers."
"At the beginning of the debate, Mr Lehne requested that the Council deal with this issue."
"Mr Radwan made a similar appeal to the Council."
"I can only say that, where an effort is required on the part of the Council, and where we have the competence, the authority, we shall of course take action, and we shall do so in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties."
"I should like to take this opportunity to engage, if I may, in a little self-promotion."
"I should like to draw the House’s attention to an event that is being organised jointly by the Austrian and Finnish Council Presidencies, which may be of interest to those present."
"On the occasion of the now traditional European Competition Day, Austria and Finland, the two Council presidencies for 2006, are holding an event entitled ‘Competition law and its surroundings – links and new trends’ in Vienna on 19 June 2006."
"The main emphasis of this event will be on current trends in mergers and merger control."
"Under the heading ‘Do mergers keep what they promise?’, the issue of the extent to which the Merger Regulation has brought in a new approach will be discussed on the basis of examples of a merger and the situation in an economy in transition."
"We shall have the pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Kroes and also Martin Bartenstein, the Austrian Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Labour, to this event."
"I can imagine that this will meet with some degree of interest."
". Mr President, I am grateful for the initiative of the Austrian Presidency in organising, together with the forthcoming Finnish Presidency, a very important day in June: Competition Day."
"With regard to other matters, I am impressed by the priority that has been given to the SMEs."
"The issue has been approached in a way that really represents a great step forward."
"The Presidency has not only fulfilled an agenda, but has also been very pragmatic in trying to find solutions."
"We are aware that it is not only Members of Parliament who are interested in the issue but others too, especially the SMEs themselves."
"I am very grateful to all the Members who, in their remarks, gave quite clear backing to the policy of the Commission."
"I also take into account that not everybody agrees on the policy."
"However, I sincerely hope that we are all aware that open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe."
"It was rightly mentioned that this is what we promised to deliver in the Lisbon Agenda: more jobs, better jobs and economic growth."
"As many of you have recognised, an internal market has enormous potential."
"We have to let our businesses and industries exploit it to the full."
"That is what was decided."
"It includes, by the way, the process of corporate restructuring."
"That is looking promising and it is not only a matter of looking at the internal market itself, but also of looking at the position of the internal market outside Europe."
"For we have to be aware that there is a global competitiveness and if we are serious in saying that we want to play that game then we need to be aware that we have to restructure in some circumstances."
"While the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance – there is no doubt about this – with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition."
"This in turn leads to concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice, and that is why the Commission would look with great concern at any unjustified interference in this process by national governments."
"As regards the free movement of capital rightly mentioned by a number of Members, the Commission will uphold the single market rules, as you expect us to do."
"We will be tough against Member States which fail to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition into markets such as energy, telecoms, financial services or banking."
"As regards individual mergers, we will enforce the Merger Regulation in a fair, objective and coherent way."
"You will recall that under the Merger Regulation the Commission has exclusive competence for controlling, on competition grounds, the effects of mergers with a Community dimension."
"I take careful note of the concerns expressed here about specific cases in the energy sector."
"I have no information at this point so I cannot discuss them."
"I say once again that we control mergers on competition grounds only, and that is the basis on which the Court reviews our decisions."
"As you know, Article 21 of the Merger Regulation also gives us a tool for addressing any undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring."
"I would add that I will not hesitate to use this tool wherever it is necessary."
"Regarding the two-thirds rule for mergers touched upon by some Members, will that rule for mergers be amended?"
"The split of competences due to the two-thirds rule may lead to inconsistency in the approach to substantially similar mergers."
"That is basic."
"I think this seems particularly inappropriate in the energy sector, where an EU-wide policy on liberalisation is currently being implemented – it is not ready yet but it is currently being implemented – and where different players should be treated in a similar way across Member States."
"So, no different treatment in one Member State than in another."
"However, the Commission is at a very early stage of its thought process."
"The first step is a consultation with stakeholders in the Member States on the question of whether it is advisable to modify the two-thirds rule."
"I am aware that we need the backing of the Council and I am aware how difficult that will be."
"That is a possible instrument and I am in favour of tackling it, but that is not my goal."
"The goal is to ensure fair and equal treatment, rather than one being more equal than another."
"So, if there is a possibility of arriving at that policy, from whatever direction, then it will be D-day for this part of my policy."
"The Commission has a duty to enforce the rules wherever appropriate."
"As guardian of the Treaties we will do our job fairly but firmly, as was rightly said by the Austrian Presidency."
"I thank you again for your support; I am grateful for it."
"We badly need to do our job as quickly as possible, for it is indeed quite hectic in merger country."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Euro-Mediterranean policy and the preparation for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Brussels."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of the short debate on the Middle East that has been held today in response to current events, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation has also rightly been mentioned."
"This cooperation is of the utmost importance, not only with regard to the Middle East issue, but also in other contexts."
"I do not wish to reiterate at this point what I have already said today on behalf of the Council about the events in the Middle East."
"In the meantime, the Presidency, too, has issued a statement on this."
"I should now like to turn to the Euromed process itself."
"The Austrian Presidency follows on the heels of last November’s Summit in Barcelona on the tenth anniversary of the first Barcelona Summit, which adopted a five-year work programme for the Partnership, oriented towards political and economic reforms, and also a Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism."
"I believe that these documents and agreements are of the utmost importance."
"We and our Mediterranean partners have also agreed to increase investment in education and to tackle together all aspects of legal and illegal immigration."
"That is another very important issue."
"It is now up to the Austrian Presidency to work towards implementing all of these projects."
"This we shall do willingly, vigorously and with conviction."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that a meeting of Trade Ministers is to be held in Marrakech on 24 March, and there will be a meeting of Euromed Finance Ministers in Tunis on 25 and 26 June."
"We shall also be giving particular support to the Commission in prioritising the media, because we are convinced that the media plays a particularly important role in intercultural understanding."
"In this connection, the Euromed Seminar on Xenophobia and Racism in the Media that has been planned for a long time is now scheduled to be held in May, during the Austrian Presidency."
"As the House has already heard from the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Council has been intensely preoccupied with the issue of the caricatures in recent weeks, including at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Salzburg."
"This issue is another about which I have already had the opportunity to speak to you here."
"This problem, in particular, has made clear to us that we have to specifically take the route of forward-looking dialogue between the EU and the Islamic world and with Muslim communities in Europe."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership offers an ideal, particularly important forum for the dialogue with Mediterranean countries in this regard."
"I consider this dialogue to be particularly important at all levels, particularly the direct contact between young people, and I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership can, and must, indeed play a key role."
"It was with this aim in view that the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between Cultures was established last year."
"This Foundation has a key role to play, particularly at this time."
"The Conclusions of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council of 27 February 2006 expressly mention the Barcelona process and the Anna Lindh Foundation, along with other multilateral organisations playing a role in this field, a fact that we consider most welcome."
"It is now important to take all the available instruments of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and use them to defuse tensions, such as those seen recently."
"A meeting of leading Euro-Mediterranean officials has already taken place, on 22 February: this enabled a very open exchange of views on the events and gave all the participants the opportunity to propose specific measures."
"In essence, there is agreement on the fact that the structures required to tackle this problem are already in place;"
"I do not believe that we should create new ones."
"The challenge for us now is to make use of all the appropriate opportunities for dialogue to successfully continue the long-standing efforts towards bringing the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean closer together."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly brings together representatives of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"We expect it to make a particularly important contribution to further calming this situation and to better understanding."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has given the Barcelona process an urgently needed new dimension and, in particular, increased its legitimacy."
"Relevant working committees were put to work even at the stage of preparing for the Barcelona Summit in November 2005."
"The Committee on Political Affairs, Security and Human Rights of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly debated the problem of the caricatures calmly and in detail at its meeting on the sixth of this month and it, too, pointed to the necessity of increasing dialogue."
"I am convinced that the plenary session to be held on 26 and 27 March will also be able to provide an appropriate response to the questions that have arisen."
"The Austrian Presidency is following and supporting the diverse initiatives that are being taken in this regard."
"Just today, at the meeting of the Senior Officials Committee for the Barcelona process, the Euromed Committee, the title of a seminar to be held in Vienna was changed at the request of our Mediterranean partners, to take account of their request for religious feelings to be respected."
"It is my conviction that there is scope for further improvement in communication between the traditional Euromed committees and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"I hope that, with a little imagination, we are able to achieve further progress on this issue under the Austrian Presidency, to the benefit of all of the Euromed committees and the Partnership as a whole."
"Furthermore, particularly in the light of current events, enhanced cooperation could be initiated, for example with the OSCE or even with the ‘alliance of civilisations’ – which, as we know, is a Spanish–Turkish initiative under the auspices of the United Nations."
"Austria would like to continue its involvement in this wider context, and has already invited the High Level Group on the alliance of civilisations to hold its third meeting in Vienna at the end of May."
". Mr President, we are here to discuss the Barcelona Process and the preparations for the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"Let me just say a few words about the recent events in the Palestinian territories, because today the time was so short during the speeches on the Gymnich and there were only two Commissioners."
"I ceded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now, if you permit me, I shall say a few words on yesterday's events."
"It is not only topical but also goes to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, to our shared objective for a region of peace, stability, prosperity and opportunity."
"I fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives."
"The Israeli attack on the prison in Jericho and the Israelis' public treatment of prison guards and inmates is unacceptable and should be condemned."
"I also deplore the violence, the kidnappings and the attacks on the Commission offices and other offices of the Member States in Gaza and the West Bank."
"The first victims of this breakdown of law and order are the Palestinian people themselves."
"In the current circumstances, with key political deadlines ahead in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility."
"Attacks, such as the ones that took place yesterday, and provocative statements do nothing to improve prospects, and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to violence and insecurity."
"Yesterday evening, I had a good discussion – as you, Mr President, no doubt did – with President Abbas before he returned to deal with the mounting violence and confrontation."
"He is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now, which was not made any easier by yesterday's events."
"How he manages to compose a new Palestinian Authority Government will affect the prospects for peace in the Middle East and will also have repercussions for us all."
"The European Union is a reliable partner of the Palestinian people."
"No donor has done more to help them."
"I told President Abbas once again that we want to continue our support for a better, peaceful and prosperous future, but that we stand firm on our principles, leaving the door open to positive developments."
"All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap."
"Those with whom President Abbas negotiates must know and understand that their decisions on their issues will have important repercussions."
"Let me now say a few words about the Euro-Med Partnership."
"The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future."
"The five-year work programme agreed at the summit and the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism constitute a very ambitious agenda which will render the partnership more tangible, more politically relevant and more operational."
"To follow up on the summit, we must now ensure constructive and effective contributions by all partners to attain the commonly agreed objectives on political and economic reform, growth and job creation, human rights and gender issues, education and management of migration, regional stability and the fight against terrorism."
"The Commission has already launched work on the implementation of that five-year programme."
"Initiatives have been taken with the current and the incoming Council Presidencies, as well as with Mediterranean partners, to ensure the success of this common endeavour."
"We have reserved appropriate funding for assistance and support, provided through MEDA and the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including a substantial facility to encourage progress on governance reform that we call a 'governance facility'."
"As of this year, several new and innovative activities will be launched."
"Preparations are well under way to organise the first Euro-Med ministerial meeting on gender issues at the end of the year."
"Two sub-regional conferences, one in the Maghreb and one in the Mashreq, will pave the way for government and civil society representatives to examine the importance of gender equality for economic and social development and propose practical measures to improve women’s access to jobs and public life."
"At the Barcelona Summit, Euro-Med partners highlighted the importance of migration, social integration, justice and security as issues of common interest in the partnership, which should be addressed through a balanced and comprehensive approach."
"Work has begun on preparing a ministerial meeting to tackle all issues from illegal migration to trafficking in human beings and people smuggling."
"This regional initiative is complemented by our bilateral programmes aimed at strengthening institutional capacities, managing legal migration, improving border controls, fighting illegal immigration and people trafficking."
"Mr Winkler has already mentioned the Trade Ministerial Meeting, which will be attended by Commissioner Mandelson and will advance the objective of a European free trade area."
"We also hope to see similar progress on South-South trade – the 'Agadir process'."
"The so-called cartoon crisis has highlighted the dangers of leaving prejudice, misinformation and misunderstanding to fester."
"We regret the offence caused by those cartoons to Muslims across the world, but we also strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against individuals and property of the European Union and other countries."
"Support for intercultural dialogue at all levels is important."
"I am glad that in Salzburg this has been very strongly recommended."
"We are convinced that the Barcelona Process has a framework for it and that the architecture is already there: there is the Anna Lindh Foundation and 35 other structures within an entire network."
"We must reach out to civil society and the media, and all the media seminars that are being planned by the Austrian Presidency are very welcome."
"In this context, I am very happy with the initiative to exchange views on this subject during the next Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly."
"From there, I would go to the Arab League summit in Khartoum, because it is highly important that we now use every opportunity to really talk to our Arab friends and colleagues."
"At this critical juncture, our message has to be clear: it is through a vigorous but also peaceful dialogue of opinions, with full respect for freedom of expression, that understanding can be deepened and respect can be built."
"Indeed, that is the essence of the Barcelona Process."
"Therefore, what we want to do is give more hope to progress."
"Together, we want to realise the objectives of security, stability and prosperity."
". – Mr President, it is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair at the beginning of this debate on the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which you do so much to elevate and enhance."
"Of colleagues here in the Chamber, the pioneers of the Euro-Mediterranean policy are very numerous on the left, but not so numerous on the centre-right, with the distinguished exceptions of Mr Busuttil, Mr Kasoulides and Mrs Saïfi, but more may come."
"As was mentioned earlier today, Veronique De Keyser and I had the honour to meet the President of Palestine last night."
"We profoundly regret the circumstances in which he had to return home."
"I believe it is ironic and tragic that the two countries who talk most about encouraging democracy in the Middle East – the United Kingdom and the United States – should be the very countries who left their posts in Jericho yesterday."
"The governments of both those countries should have reinforced and not withdrawn their garrisons."
"It would be appropriate at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly that we should hear, particularly from the Council, where the responsibility lay for the decisions, who took them, when and why they were taken."
"I hope that, if possible, we will get a statement from the Council at that meeting, with the assistance of the Commission."
"The work of the Euromed is based largely on its committees."
"We are deeply grateful for the work that takes place there and for the opportunity that the Assembly provides, uniquely in the world, for Palestine and Israel to work together."
"It is an unusual meeting, taking place on the eve of an Israeli election, and following the election in Palestine on 25 January."
"It may be that representatives from those two countries are not present, but that does not mean they have gone out of our minds."
"They are very much at the forefront of our concerns."
"I believe that this meeting – the last under your chairmanship under the Presidency of the European Parliament – will be a great opportunity for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to underline our commitment to giving the parliamentary dimension of the Mediterranean real substance."
"I hope that the work I am doing on my subcommittee may give the European Parliament the opportunity to become the operational and organisational heart of the Euromed Assembly in the future."
"That is my intention."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events of the last few hours in Palestine force us to reach a view and, as you said, Commissioner, go right to the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"I would like to say to the Israeli authorities that an electoral campaign, however important, cannot permit the distortion of existing legal frameworks."
"One of these frameworks, the main one, is the role of President Abu Mazen, damaged and deprived of authority by the irresponsible attack on the prison in Jericho and by the capture of prisoners whose detention was the competence of the Palestinian authority."
"I would also like to hear a view from the Council on the conduct of the United Kingdom and United States forces present in the area."
"All our moral and political support goes to the President of the Palestinian Authority, who should have been among us here today."
"We are aware of his very difficult position, particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine."
"As you said, Commissioner, Europe must remind the Israeli authorities of the need to respect the law and their legitimate partners, just as we demand of Hamas itself."
"Defying the legal framework means opening the door to the sort of retaliation and violence that is already going on and that we need to try and stem."
"We are relieved in this matter by news of the freeing of the hostages."
"As for the crisis in Iran, another sorry chapter, I welcomed the words of Mr Straw, which I hope he will hold to completely."
"He stated that no military option exists. He made explicit a position that the whole of Europe ought to take and to which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully subscribes, as it is also our position."
"Stopping negotiations would lead to the disastrous state of affairs already seen in Iraq."
"This does not make us weaker: on the contrary, it opens up the chance for close dialogue, and reassures the Iranian and Syrian people, who feel threatened."
"Let us relieve the tension and avoid creating undesirable alliances forged in the name of the fight against the West."
"Let us keep the international community united in putting pressure on Iran to respect the obligations it signed up to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, with a view to disarmament in the Middle East and in the whole of the Mediterranean."
"It is to be hoped that over this extremely delicate period Europe can express itself with one voice, autonomously and effectively, and that the next Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly can become the perfect occasion to confront these issues."
". Mr President, I too wish to condemn yesterday’s assault by the Israeli Defence Forces on the Jericho prison."
"Such actions can only make Hamas's policy more radical and hence make the already very tense relations in that region even more complicated."
"In view of the violations of international law and human rights and of the democratic challenges in that region, we must deplore the fact that the declarations and commitments resulting from the Barcelona Summit have not been accompanied by a stronger and more concrete commitment to promoting human rights and democracy."
"Freedom of expression is a universal right, which is both crucial and essential to the development of any democracy. The European Union should not, therefore, spare any effort in defending and promoting it."
"We are not just talking about the events following the publication of the cartoons."
"In Algeria, people who attack the President are being tried for slander and being imprisoned or fined."
"They include Ali Dilem, the correspondent of , Bachir El Arabi and Hakim Laâlam, the columnist for"
"Mohammed Benchicou, the director of , has been held in the El-Harrach prison since 14 June 2004."
"Despite his constantly deteriorating state of health, the authorities refuse to treat him."
"He has been convicted of or is charged with almost fifty press crimes."
"He is a prisoner of conscience and not a criminal prisoner, as some people claim."
"In Tunisia, whose delegation will soon hold the presidency of the EMPA, Mohammed Abbou, the human rights activist and lawyer, has been in prison for more than a year, following the publication of two critical articles."
"He had already sown up his own mouth in protest against his imprisonment and the conditions in which he is being held."
"He now plans to stage a hunger strike."
"In Morocco, Aboubakr Jamai and Fahd Iraki, of the newspaper , have been sentenced to pay the equivalent of 143 times the minimum Moroccan annual salary."
"The 2 February 2006 edition of the Spanish daily was banned from distribution as a result of an article written by Ali Lmrabet."
"Journalists from the weekly have also been convicted of slander."
"I shall end by calling for more account to be taken of human rights and democracy in the discussions within the EMPA, as we are urged to do by the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2005, Reporters without Borders."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the Karni crossing checkpoint in Gaza, a man called Ayman told me he wished us and our money to the devil, not because he did not actually accept our help, and was ungrateful for it, but to say that he and his people had had enough, that they needed freedom and dignity and not just humanitarian aid."
"At the same time we ourselves cannot have an easy conscience just because we continue to help; what we really need to do is continue to help the Palestinians."
"Yesterday’s action, like so many others, was illegal, cynical and inhumane."
"Illegal because it was illegal, but cynical because it was done with a thought to the elections."
"It was actually an example of vengeance and brutal colonialism."
"I think it is time Israel understood that its very existence, its very love for democracy, can only exist if it respects other peoples."
"Yet Israel is not doing this, and we certainly cannot be a party to this, and we are not."
"The Commission and the Council stated this very openly this morning."
"Our Parliamentary Assembly is extremely important, but we ought to face up to a problem: the involvement of Palestinian representatives in the Parliamentary Assembly."
"We must accept absolutely the presence of whoever is recommended by the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"It is a shame that this is happening the day before the Israeli elections because it means that an essential component of the Assembly will not be present."
"We must, however, make sure that the Assembly works, that it functions, not least because if we do not solve the Palestinian question our Assembly will constantly have as the focus of its discussions the subject of Palestine and Israel."
"Nor will we be able to confront the problems that the Commission and the Council have very clearly set forth, namely how to succeed in establishing a Mediterranean that is truly cooperative."
". Mr President, I would like to take advantage of this debate to congratulate the bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly on the communication that it has published on the infamous cartoons."
"The figure of Mohammed is what we might call the point of communion for an Islam that is more fragile and diverse, and even more divided, than we might think."
"Targeting that figure means targeting its heart."
"There is no way we could not have known that, just as there is no way we could not have considered the consequences of what was being done, namely inflaming the conflict between civilisations."
"Who exactly do these cartoons serve: who has an interest in stirring up these conflicts?"
"I would like to put that question."
"Certainly not us, the Europeans, surely not France anyway, which is the main Mediterranean coastal power and whose influence depends on a fine balance between its European continental policy, on the one hand, and its Mediterranean and African policy, on the other."
"Admittedly, there comes with this statement a dual concern: on the one hand, the EMPA and Euromed are still like frail barques cast out to sea."
"Frail not just in terms of resources, but above all in terms of their intellectual inspiration, since it seems to me that they are still clinging to a very Eurocentric view of democracy and human rights − we have just seen yet another illustration of this − which not only smells of colonialism, but which furthermore prevents us − we saw this in December in Barcelona as well − from dealing with what is really important, that is to say, economic, financial and commercial cooperation and the management of migratory flows."
"Contrary to what the Commission has just said, I personally would talk about cooperation, rather than a free-trade area, which I believe to be a very dangerous formula."
"The second concern is that the issue of civilisations has been an obvious one for a very long time, which we have known about since Charles Martel: we have not had to wait for American thinkers to point it out to us."
"One would have to be foolishly immersed in the delusions of globalisation to be all of a sudden amazed to discover that civilisations are not interchangeable and men even less so, and that coexistence between different peoples is not automatic."
"This kind of Huntington approach is clearly intended to send a different message, namely that we are all destined to be part of a ‘West’ − in emphatic inverted commas − the capital of which would have to be Washington, with the Europeans simply having to follow the warlike ventures of the United States."
"This very idea of the West is, as we know, an ideological sham."
"It is precisely because civilisations endlessly clash that we need a policy, that we need politics, that we need a will to live collectively, something for which, in short, the EMPA and Euromed offer a framework."
"So let us begin by strengthening them, since it seems to me that they are getting increasingly fragile while becoming increasingly necessary year by year."
"– It is a pity that no sooner than we take a step forward in the Barcelona Process, than something happens in the Middle East which sets back the development we would have made."
"However I wish to remain focused on our theme and I wish to talk as a member of the Economic Commission of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"I wish that both the Commission as well as the Council analyse a study which was done by the University of Manchester entitled ‘Sustainable Impact Assessment Study of the Euromed Free-Trade Area’."
"We started to discuss this study in the Economic Commission of the Assembly and it gives a worrying picture of the impact of the European Union’s policy on the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean."
"It forecasts a rather negative effect on our partner countries in the Mediterranean who are supposed to benefit and not lose by the Barcelona Process."
"Among the negative effects it mentions the possibility that in these countries there could be an increase in unemployment, a decrease in the level of wages, as well as a great impact on resources such as water and biodiversity and other environmental impacts."
"Naturally the report is not telling us to halt or to dismantle the plan for the setting up of a free-trade area, but it is saying that we should take these negative effects seriously and we should take preventive measures now, before it is too late."
"Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean."
"For example there is the need, no doubt, that the European Union policy towards these countries should balance the commercial aspect with a more intensive cooperation in the financial, social and educational sector as well as in the environmental sector."
"I conclude by appealing to both the Commission as well as to the Council to take a more active part in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also to reply to the questions put by the Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to thank you for being here and above all to congratulate you on having led the work of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly so well over the six months that it has fallen to this House to head its work."
"We must be able to acknowledge what we do well and also what we do badly."
"In this case, let us acknowledge what we do well."
"The Euro-Mediterranean process has been a success and so was the Barcelona Summit of last November."
"This is a live and developing process."
"Let us consider the situation had the Euro-Mediterranean process not existed, in light of the events we have seen surrounding the cartoons crisis and the events yesterday in Jericho for example."
"It would be an enormous problem: how to establish dialogue, how to seek methods of cooperation in order to resolve the problems."
"The action plan approved in Barcelona contains some extremely important points − some have been mentioned."
"I would like to mention something that seems to me to be essential: yes to the free trade area, but with economic and social cohesion as well."
"We know a lot about this in Europe and this will be the key to the success of the first objective."
"Another issue that was dealt with was the Code of Conduct on counter-terrorism."
"In an area such as this, such a Code of Conduct was unimaginable just a few years ago."
"Today we have one."
"Furthermore, the Barcelona Summit accepted the joint Spanish-Turkish initiative on the alliance of civilisations, which does not mean accepting cultural relativism, but rather guiding cultures in the same direction: the defence of democracy, freedom, human rights and equality between human beings."
"Within this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly provides us with an extremely important forum for political debate."
"I believe that, with a view to the meeting on the 26th and the 27th, we need to do four things: speed up decision making, refocus the debates around rapporteurs by committee, ensure that the Commission and Council attend and participate, as President Borrell demanded this morning at the beginning of our sitting, as events require, and finally to involve civil society."
"In that way, we will be moving in the right direction."
"Mr President, in the one short minute available to me, I would like to make a very specific proposal."
"I entirely agree of course with the opinions expressed in relation to the events in Jericho."
"From a political point of view, given this spiral of violence and following the cartoons of Mohammed conflict, now more than ever we must strive for peaceful co-existence in the Mediterranean."
"In the context of the EMPA committee responsible for cultural affairs, we have proposed the creation of a cultural contact committee made up of respected experts who are capable of dialogue, in order to respond to cultural and religious conflicts, to mediate, clarify and diffuse cultural and religious tension between the two flanks of the Mediterranean."
"The Anna Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria, is in a perfect position to organise this committee of experts, which could act in a preventive manner in the event of similar conflicts, in order to clear up misunderstandings of the cultures of others, in order to clear up any doubts about what really happened."
"I believe that in this way, at the Assembly on the 26th we could take a small step towards the tolerance that we want to see in the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, we have to admit that the work of the Barcelona Summit has been disappointing in the face of enormous challenges."
"We must therefore look to the future with greater determination and achieve results now."
"In view of recent events, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is the ideal place to reinforce our partnership, on the basis of dialogue, exchange and mutual understanding."
"More than ever, the action of the EMPA needs to be reinforced and supported."
"More than ever, the objectives of establishing peace and guaranteeing security should be the focus of our decisions and accompanied by concrete action."
"Urgent action is needed in order to deal with a difficult local situation and an increasingly uncertain regional context."
"I believe that the European Union has a heavy responsibility today, and I am saying that as chairwoman of the political committee of the EMPA which, flanked by a Palestinian vice-president and an Israeli vice-president, wishes to place the resolution of the Middle East conflict at the heart of our work."
"The Union must speak with one voice and condemn the perversity of actions that increase the escalation of violence and undermine an already fragile peace process."
"It is regrettable that the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, has not been able to speak to our Parliament following the events in Jericho, and I would like, in this Chamber, to express my concern about this situation."
"Commissioner, we have listened to you."
"We have noted your conviction and your will."
"In the EMPA and together with President Borrell, we are determined to move forward."
"I believe that it is time to stop disappointing the people."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, there was nothing random about the events in Jericho, which have deprived us of a meeting with Mahmoud Abbas; they are politically significant."
"The first person to be affected was certainly Mahmoud Abbas; hardly had he left his country than the Israeli forces launched their assault on the prison."
"He is not the only one to be affected, though."
"It has not been mentioned that Ahmed Sa’adat was a member of the newly-elected Palestinian legislative council."
"Nor has anyone pointed out that Hamas, which had made tentative steps towards recognising the State of Israel within its 1967 borders, could not proceed any further towards such recognition, after the humiliating images of half-naked, bound and blindfolded prisoners."
"We Europeans have also been snubbed."
"We were expecting Mahmoud Abbas but he did not come."
"What is at stake is our entire policy towards Palestine."
"Today, with our offices ransacked and our nationals taken hostage, there are some Members of this Chamber saying to me that we, the main donors, must not continue to finance Palestine, after the ingratitude shown."
"That has been the effect of Jericho."
"I should like to say to those MEPs hesitating about supporting Palestine that there is not one Palestinian today who would not swap the money we are giving to Palestine for a firm EU stance on current events."
"Can we, after all, turn a blind eye to the fact that Israel has chosen a unilateral path, focused on law and order, which no longer has anything to do with the roadmap?"
"The Olmert plan is a unilateral one, as were the Gaza disengagement - warmly applauded as it was - the annexing of the West Bank and the capture of East Jerusalem."
"The reality of Palestine is an interminable occupation and a wall which was condemned by the Hague but which is still standing."
"All the money that we give to Palestine to help it survive does not enable it to escape this reality."
"In other words, the peace process is dragging its feet."
"To conclude, Commissioner, if there is to be a Plan B to help Palestine, Europe must take a clear and courageous stance."
"How otherwise can the Palestinians be expected to have hope and to believe us when we talk about the road map?"
"Mr President, the Jericho events have been long debated by colleagues, this morning and later, but in the Committee on Quality of Life, Exchanges between Civil Societies and Culture the issue of the cartoons will certainly come up."
"We must be unequivocal in condemning the content of the cartoons."
"Respect for the religious values and identity of others, such as Muslim fellow European citizens, is a European value and only stupidity cannot understand it, but in Europe we are obliged to defend even the right of stupidity to express itself freely, and our Arab partners must understand it."
"On the issue of migration, the new initiatives by the Commission and the recent decisions by the Council to manage migratory flows instead of talking only about illegal immigration are commendable."
"Policies such as the well-anticipated and organised legal reception of migrants needed in the domestic markets, the establishment of brain circulation as opposed to a brain drain, facilitation of remittances, civic integration of migrants, the single asylum policy and so forth will be more appealing to our Mediterranean partners."
"It is true that some of these countries have changed from countries of origin or transit to terminals."
"That is why we need to work together, by sharing technical means, expertise and responsibility, to fight the trafficking of human beings and illegal immigration."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as chair of the European parliamentary delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I naturally endorse what has just been said about the recent events in Palestine and, in particular, the condemnation of the attack on the Jericho prison, which is certainly not a step forward on the road towards peace and democracy."
"I should like to mention the Anna Lindh Foundation, which fosters dialogue between the civilisations and which was the subject of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) working party."
"This institution is already experiencing a number of structural difficulties."
"Some partner states have yet to structure their national networks, and there have been serious delays in disbursing contributions."
"There is the greatest uncertainty as to whether funding will continue after 2008."
"This is why these difficulties must be addressed forthwith: the continued financing of the Anna Lindh Foundation must be guaranteed; the measures undertaken by the foundation and the priorities thereof must be accorded higher visibility;"
"To conclude, the EMPA, along with the Council and the Commission, must put the necessary effort into examining this question."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent tragic events, the abundantly clear conclusions of our last meeting in November have taken on particular relevance."
"Economic prosperity and social progress are not within everyone’s reach, which means that issues of violence are very visible."
"We already know that those denied healthcare and the right to acquire qualitative and quantitative knowledge tend to be our partners in the southern Mediterranean and in particular the least privileged sections of society, that is, women and the poor."
"The future scenario concerns us."
"This is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, which we want to see up and running by 2010, as the Commissioner pointed out."
"In this case, the data shows that in terms of reducing poverty, the immediate gains are considerably lower, although other benefits may accrue from the far-reaching changes taking place in the economies of our Mediterranean partners."
"In the areas of health and education, there is little chance of any short-term gains. Accordingly, with nothing to hold back this effect, it is likely that we will see health and education being adversely affected."
"As regards human rights, it is vital that we look into the near-total absence of a guiding concept in the EU and the Euro-Mediterranean institutions on the issue of economic and social rights and the part that this plays in the Barcelona process."
"I feel that in the current framework in particular – albeit, in reality, across the board – this is a vitally important question, which should be given due prominence in the MEDA programme."
"Our most pressing priorities in this partnership should be to step up social dialogue, the fight against child labour, cooperation in combating discrimination in the field of social security, dialogue on social reforms and promoting equal opportunities between men and women."
"In the context of today's reality, this issue should be brought to the fore in the Barcelona process."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to all of you for mentioning the positive impact of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in your speeches."
"It is of course possible to enumerate a large number of issues where fairly great deficiencies remain, as Mrs Madeira has just done."
"This means that we can by no means rest on our laurels – and, indeed, we are not doing – but rather must set ourselves the task of continuing work on all the fields that Mrs Madeira cited – health care, social dialogue, sustainability, gender issues, opportunities for education and many other issues."
"That cannot be done overnight."
"We would be deceiving ourselves if we were to believe that this Partnership alone would be sufficient to enable us to make changes in a short space of time, but we must work at it, and, as the Commissioner said, the instruments to do so are available."
"The human rights issue has been mentioned many times."
"This is a particular concern of mine personally and also of the Council’s as a whole."
"I would add that I do not believe that the Council or the EU as a whole can be accused of not having a coherent, methodical human rights policy;"
"I believe that we do have one."
"Incidentally, I believe that the Human Rights Agency, which I hope will be established soon and will have your support, will be able to make a contribution to a methodical approach to the issue of human rights."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank all those very engaged parliamentarians like yourself and your subcommittee and Mrs De Keyser and others who are working constantly and with great commitment towards better understanding between the peoples in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"We should be grateful to them and we should do our best to support you and help you, even if you do not fully agree with one or two Council measures."
"Iran has also been mentioned in this connection."
"I should just like to say in this regard that it is of course the Council’s policy to use peaceful means, negotiation, to achieve results."
"Mr Carnero González said something very important, which was that something happened at the November summit that would have been impossible a few years ago."
"A close look at this declaration on terrorism, this Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism, reveals that it contains a good approach to even the difficult, delicate issues – and, of course, the fight against terrorism, with all the familiar political problems, is an extremely difficult one. It is an approach that enables us to continue to achieve further results, and the Council shares this objective."
"I should like to thank all the Members for their good ideas and suggestions, which we shall, of course, be happy to take up and look into."
". Mr President, I entirely agree on the importance of the next Euromed Parliamentary Assembly meeting."
"It is highly important and I can already confirm my personal presence."
"This time it is possible and I certainly will want to come."
"Your motion for a resolution is an excellent one."
"All the important topics are there: freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs, the outlook for a real partnership."
"That is what we want."
"That means that not only do we have to deliver, but our partners also have to deliver."
"Together we have to find the right mix in order for them to develop more and more."
"There are some specific issues that we also have to highlight, one of which is very dear to my heart and is also in our communication: education."
"I have always felt that with education we can promote the next generation."
"We can do our utmost to make things happen."
"I also totally agree with Mr Carnero González."
"I believe Barcelona was a success."
"However, is not right to say that it was not a complete success because only Heads of State were there."
"The content was good."
"Now we have to see to it that it can all be implemented in our five-year programme."
"I am in favour of liberalisation, but I agree it must also take account of social cohesion and social stability, social rights, questions of energy, and of course education."
"Let me quickly say that some studies that have been undertaken; the Manchester study is rather negative, but there are others that are much more positive."
"As I said, what we wanted to create with the Euromed Partnership is exactly that: a partnership, which means both sides will have to do their utmost to get things moving and quite a lot of reforms are still necessary."
"What we would like to achieve, with more trade, is also the creation of more jobs – that means more jobs for more young people – as also, of course, trying to provide the right prospects for the labour market, and sustainable development that takes account of social and environmental imperatives."
"The Neighbourhood Policy is the policy that tries to complement this Euromed Partnership."
"While also focusing very clearly on human rights, it tries to promote all the other factors that will assure these countries a better life in the future."
"Finally, unfortunately all of that is being overshadowed by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and unfortunately, this is not the best moment; we are at a very critical, crucial moment."
"Hopefully we can make the future, even at this critical stage, a better one."
"The debate is closed."
"– The President of the Palestinian High Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was forced to return urgently to his country and cancel his address to Parliament, due to the extremely serious turn of events."
"The EU must take a firm line on Israel’s continued attack on Palestine, of which the destruction of Jericho prison is one of the most serious and humiliating episodes."
"Israel committed this crime after a recent agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the USA and the United Kingdom on prisoner security, yet nothing was done to stop it."
"The Commission and the Council’s predisposition towards the Israeli Government and the escalation of criminal violence perpetrated against Palestine must not be allowed to continue."
"Measures must be taken to stop Israel from continuing to act in this appalling manner, undermining Palestine's most fundamental rights."
"At the next meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, Parliament must show clear solidarity with Palestine and must condemn the violence perpetrated by Israel, which is jeopardising peace in the Middle East."
"UN resolutions must be complied with and the free will of the people of Palestine must be upheld."
"– The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the 62nd session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR, Geneva)."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing now, at this relatively late hour, is also a great personal concern of mine, which is why it was important to me to remain here for this debate."
"I am pleased to have the opportunity to join you for this debate."
"As you know, a summit on the reform of the United Nations was held last year in New York and, naturally, the participants – Heads of State or Government – were asked whether or not they considered the meeting to be a success."
"The President of the Republic of Austria stated that he did indeed consider the meeting a success."
"Of course – as is always the case in a multilateral environment – there were some things that were pushed through and others that were not, but, in the final reckoning, last year’s United Nations Summit in New York could be described as a success."
"It was a success in that agreement was reached, in essence, on a number of things that were very important particularly to us as Member States of the EU, to the West as a whole."
"We all stand up for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The decision of principle taken last September in New York to establish a Human Rights Council in place of the Commission on Human Rights was one decision that justified a positive assessment of the Summit."
"Of course, last September’s decision was only a decision of principle, and it took difficult negotiations to breathe life into this Human Rights Council."
"I believe that special thanks are due at this juncture to the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr Jan Eliasson, for tirelessly working to enable a decision on the Human Rights Council to be reached a few hours ago in New York."
"The results of the vote adopting this Human Rights Council are impressive: 170 votes in favour and 4 against, with 3 countries abstaining."
"The countries that voted against were the US, Israel, Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands."
"Venezuela, Iran und Belarus abstained."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 170 votes in the United Nations is a great success."
"The EU put up a united front at the United Nations General Assembly with a common position."
"This is something of which we can be proud, and we can congratulate ourselves and the international community on this success."
"The establishment of the Human Rights Council represents an important, I would even say historic, step towards further strengthening the United Nations human rights system and the protection of human rights around the world."
"Naturally, there were a number of issues on which even the EU was disappointed."
"We should have liked to see a different outcome on one issue or another, but, after all, compromises are necessary in a multilateral framework, and we need to ask ourselves whether what proved possible in the end is, in essence, still consistent with what we actually wanted."
"As regards the Human Rights Council in its current form, the answer was a clear ‘yes’."
"I am very much obliged to all those who were involved in bringing about this decision."
"I am pleased that the Council succeeded in gaining the support of all the Member States for this."
"I do not wish at this point to concentrate so much on the things that did not succeed, but on a number of – I believe – particularly positive aspects of the new system of the Human Rights Council."
"Firstly, unlike the Commission on Human Rights, which operated under the aegis of the Ecosoc, which met once a year in Geneva for a six-week session, the Human Rights Council will meet throughout the year, and will be directly responsible to the General Assembly."
"The option of the Human Rights Council possibly one day becoming one of the main bodies of the United Nations has been left open."
"This would of course require changing the Charter of the United Nations, and we all know how difficult that would be, but the option is open."
"At all events, however, it is now a permanent body of the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"The direct and individual election of members subject to the requirement of an absolute majority of all Member States of the United Nations also represents progress."
"All of those who, like myself, have taken part time and again in recent years will be pleased that this will hopefully now mean, if not an end to, then at least a substantial reduction in the – often undignified – process of horse-trading over votes: who is voting for whom, when to vote on this matter, whether to vote for another in return."
"Another new aspect is the possibility of suspending members of the Human Rights Council in the case of gross and systematic human rights violations subject to a two-thirds majority."
"Incidentally, this was ultimately the decisive reason why the United States withheld support for the Human Rights Council."
"The US attempted until the very end to push through the requirement of a two-thirds majority for membership, and also the automatic exclusion of members on whom the Security Council has imposed sanctions."
"The EU offered to issue – and has indeed issued – a declaration in the General Assembly on the occasion of the establishment of the Human Rights Council making a political commitment to refrain from voting in favour of admitting to the Human Rights Council any country which has been accused by the Security Council of human rights violations and which is subject to Security Council sanctions."
"Here, too, the EU has sent out an important political signal."
"Thirdly, there will be a regular human rights review of all countries through the creation of a universal review mechanism, which will also help obviate accusations of double standards and selectivity in future."
"Fourthly, the Human Rights Council has the competence to make direct recommendations to all the bodies of the United Nations, including the UN Security Council."
"We believe that this has the potential to substantially strengthen the United Nations human rights protection system as a whole."
"The fifth point is that, ultimately, the important achievements of the Commission on Human Rights remain, namely the system of special rapporteurs and the active participation of non-governmental organisations in sessions."
"Although it was not possible to achieve everything, this new Human Rights Council represents a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, which was no longer effective."
"The Commission on Human Rights will now meet again – presumably briefly – to conclude its business and subsequently hand it over to the Human Rights Council."
"In May of this year – soon, in other words – the first members of the Human Rights Council are due to be elected, and the inaugural session of the Council is due to be held as soon as this June."
"We – as the EU and the Council – shall do our utmost to ensure that the Human Rights Council is able to carry out its work successfully and effectively from the outset."
"Although the United States did not endorse this proposal, I nevertheless believe that a certain amount of trust was established in recent days and weeks, particularly in transatlantic relations between the EU and the US, since the US stated, on the occasion of the establishment of the Human Rights Council, that it was not its intention to hinder the establishment and financing of this Council, and that it agreed with the objectives of this Council in principle, but that the two problems I have mentioned – the issues of the election of members and of the exclusion of members – were too serious to enable it to vote in favour."
"I hope that the work of the Human Rights Council in the coming years will convince all parties that this was a good choice, that this represents progress, and that, ultimately, we have also done something positive for the protection of human rights around the world."
"I believe that we, as the European Union, can be proud to have made a contribution to this."
". Mr President, I should like to say: Eureka!"
"We have a Human Rights Council!"
"That is extraordinary and I am very happy to be here tonight to celebrate it with the Council and the European Parliament."
"As you know, the European Union and the European Commission have contributed substantially to that result."
"Last week, when the EU decided to support the draft resolution introduced by President Eliasson, we made it possible for a number of countries to copy us."
"We had hoped that a number of our proposals would be in the resolution."
"However, I agree with the Presidency that the compromise text represents a marked improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, and that is key."
"Let me say a few words about the Commission on Human Rights."
"Over the last few months there has been much criticism of that Commission."
"Typically, it is accused of doubled standards, of over-politicisation, or of being too tame sometimes in the face of flagrant human rights violations."
"No doubt there is some truth in those allegations, and it is not by chance that the UN Summit document has proposed the establishment of its replacement."
"But equally it is true that what could be done has been done."
"It was that Commission, in 1948, that oversaw the drafting of the most important statement of human rights principles of all: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"I wanted to mention that because now, of course, we are looking forward, but we should also have looked at the past."
"I should also like to draw Parliament’s attention to one element of the Human Rights Council: the universal periodic review."
"If implemented properly, it should help to address the issues of double standards and selectivity, which have plagued the Commission on Human Rights."
"After all, we see peer review working very effectively in other fields, for instance in trade, the trade process review mechanism, or even in the conflict on diamonds and the Kimberley Process."
"Remarkably, throughout the complex and lengthy negotiation process on the Human Rights Council, the European Union has been able to maintain a common position."
"There is no doubt that this has positively influenced the course of the negotiations."
"Therefore, the Commission was very relieved that, after the recent differences between Member States on the final draft resolution, the European Union was able once again to adopt a common position and thus demonstrate its commitment to the crucial part of the UN reform process."
"The Commission, like the Member States, is concerned about the US vote against the text."
"However, on the other hand, we are also comforted by its declaration expressing the wish to work with the Human Rights Council."
"Kofi Annan today said that his understanding was that the United States, even though they might not be able to vote for the Council as it was currently proposed, would be able to work with the Council, and I am sure that the US, which has done so much for human rights, will find a way to work with the other Member States to make the Council what it ought to be."
"So I think the omens, on the whole, are not bad."
"We have to pay tribute to the Human Rights Commission, but now we want to see a new development and, hopefully, together, we can get it."
". Mr President, the creation of an effective, functioning and widely supported human rights commission is an essential part of the UN reform package outlined by Kofi Annan last year."
"Unlike the political minefield that surrounds the reform of the UN Security Council, the UN has shown the capacity to agree on a new structure for dealing with human rights questions."
"Most people agree that the current, large-scale, six-week, once-a-year UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is now outdated and needs to be replaced."
"We need a more permanent mechanism that can respond, year round, to the multitude of human rights crises that arise."
"The issues of debate in formulating the new structure for human rights have been many:"
"1."
"The need for a permanent structure/council."
"2."
"The members of that council must have credibility on human rights questions."
"3."
"The council should not be too big."
"4."
"The council should be reflective of the geographical difference globally."
"5."
"It should not be seen as an elitist council, a small group preaching to the others."
"6."
"The question of how we should select or elect members to that council."
"7."
"The need for a continued role for NGOs."
"8."
"A suspension mechanism for those who consistently have a poor human rights record."
"Trying to find agreement and, if necessary, compromise on all of those considerations was never going to be easy."
"However, in my view, the draft resolution by the President of the General Assembly is a reasonable attempt to do just that, an effort to find common ground."
"I welcome the strong endorsement by the UN this evening of that draft resolution."
"It is unfortunate that the US could not support it."
"I do not view the document as perfect by any means, however, and I would be critical on two points in particular."
"First, I think the Council is too big: 47 members are too many."
"Secondly, the election procedure whereby members are elected by an absolute majority is not ideal."
"I would have agreed with the US and would rather have seen a two-thirds majority for that purpose."
"I should like to finish by saying that it is a job well done by the UN today, and I think it will add credibility to its stance on human rights issues."
"– Mr President, today there has indeed been a very positive development as regards the agreement achieved in New York."
"This agreement, with a huge majority of 170 countries, constitutes a dynamic and progressive compromise towards improving and strengthening the efficacy of the international system for defending human rights."
"Of the very serious reforms and changes made, I should like to comment in particular on the provision for the participation in the proceedings of the new Council of international non-governmental organisations and agencies working to defend human rights."
"I believe that the Commission and the Commissioner will work with non-governmental organisations to strengthen the role and the efficacy of the Council."
"These clear reforms may give new momentum for human rights to the institution of the Council and reduce the lack of credibility and efficacy of the UN."
"Similarly, the European Union can work with the UN and with the other countries within the framework of the Council in order to strengthen the new institution."
"Unfortunately, the ostentatious search on the part of the United States for a better result undermines this positive compromise achieved today."
"It is high time that fundamental humanitarian values were placed before political expediencies."
"Mr President, this is, of course, in many ways an historic day – the day on which we have set up a Human Rights Council."
"The fact is that the European Parliament has pushed this issue in the past, and we know that it is in actual fact possible to change the human rights situation by working hard and in unison."
"We do support the UN in this work."
"The decision concerning the Human Rights Council was one of the few practical decisions taken in September, and it is therefore very gratifying that there now in actual fact exists such a Council and that we have obtained a permanent body that does away with the need for those six weeks of intensive lobbying in Geneva, characterised, just as you said, by constant horse-trading in connection with who was to support which resolution."
"If we obtain a permanent body that can take the lead on these matters, we shall hopefully also do away with the situation in which some of the worst rogue states have sometimes chaired the sessions in Geneva."
"I also share the analysis that the Council is rather weaker than had been hoped."
"I agree with Mr Coveney that a two-thirds’ majority would have been better."
"The regional quota system that at present applies in appointing Council representatives will unfortunately mean that states that infringe human rights will also be represented."
"Secret voting and the ability to exclude countries do, however, mean that a big step forward has nonetheless been taken."
"I hope that, in the future, the EU will adopt a unanimous and consistent approach and not be afraid to point the finger if a country with a place on the Council is guilty of seriously violating human rights."
"That is because, if it acts in concert, the EU will be able to play a fantastically substantial role in the UN."
"We in my group should like in time to see a joint European seat on the UN Security Council."
"This is a large step forward."
"Now is the time of reckoning, and it is important not only to be able to act promptly when crises occur but also to remember too events that are not so sexy from the media’s point of view, that is to say the permanent human rights violations committed against people in somewhat forgotten, out-of-the-way places."
"If the Human Rights Council can safeguard these people’s rights, we shall have taken a big step forward."
". – Mr President, I should like to commend the far-sightedness of Parliament, which arranged this debate hours after the adoption of the resolution, and which will follow suit in adopting such a resolution tomorrow."
"We can together express our satisfaction and our huge relief in seeing this resolution adopted. Not everything is perfect, of course."
"For example, the members of the Council will not be elected by a two-thirds majority; certain groups have seen their number of seats increase; and paragraphs have been added. I have no need to go on."
"That being said, the resolution that has been adopted establishes a permanent Human Rights Council, which boasts some most welcome aspects."
"For example, members are to be elected by secret ballot by the general assembly; the Council will be able to meet throughout the year, instead of less than three times a year; it will be in a position to react quickly to human rights crises; it retains the UN’s special mechanisms; it guarantees a particular role for NGOs, even though UN reform is needed in this area – something I consider extremely important – aimed at delivering better representation for independent NGOs, including those not recognised; this Council will set up a system for taking stock of the human rights situation in Council Member States."
"These are all entirely positive aspects."
"It will also be possible to suspend a country guilty of human rights violations, by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly."
"These positive points were precisely what Parliament and the EU as a whole were looking for and enjoyed the full support of all of us."
"I turn finally to the 62nd session of the Human Rights Commission."
"In all likelihood, it will be a transitional committee, essentially tasked with passing on files to the Council."
"I call on Member States to remain vigilant, however, and to secure the vote on important issues, such as the adoption of the draft international convention for the protection of all victims of forcible disappearance, the declaration on indigenous peoples and the renewal of mandates such as that of the special representative for human rights defenders."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s approval by the United Nations represents a hugely important step forward."
"Up until now, a system of double standards has been in force. It is unacceptable that Russia has never been condemned for the odious conduct of its special forces in Chechnya."
"It is unacceptable that China has never been condemned for its tragic repression of the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people. It is unacceptable that the United States does not have to answer for its conduct in Iraq, where an occupation that is illegal in terms of international law has led to over 100 000 civilian victims."
"Furthermore, what can one say of Israel, which is taking illegal measures of collective punishment against the Palestinian people that are expressly forbidden by international conventions?"
"Reason of state cannot be a justification for the negation of the rights of millions of men, women and children all over the world."
"The European Union must show greater courage on this issue: at stake are our credibility and our policy of promoting human rights."
"It is not enough to protest against countries that are unprotected by often dubious international alliances."
"Human rights are enshrined in codes: legal treaties apply to everyone, especially to the powerful."
"The for the credibility of the now defunct Commission on Human Rights in Geneva was dealt by the presence in that institution of governments that represent dictatorships and that have used their institutional position before the UN as a means of avoiding criticism of their policies and conduct."
"What right, for example, does the Sudanese Government have to participate in the Commission in Geneva, as is happening today?"
"I therefore welcome all the reforms that have been announced to transform the Commission in Geneva into a restricted council on human rights."
"I applaud the news that has just reached us that the UN has approved the resolution of radical reforms to that institution despite opposition from the United States."
"I agree with the suggestions of the resolution we will approve tomorrow, especially when it states that only countries that demonstrate respect for fundamental rights may participate in the future council."
"We must also grant a more important role to international non-governmental organisations, which are truly democratic and independent, through the creation of a UN committee on NGOs, which needs to able to provide both encouragement and criticism for the UN system of human rights."
". Ladies and gentlemen, the goal of the UN reforms and particularly the changes to the Commission on Human Rights was to create institutions that are better, not the same or worse."
"A compromise has finally been found and the Human Rights Council has just been formed, which in itself is a good thing."
"The current solution, however, whereby at the General Assembly only a majority is needed for a state to be elected to the Council, but three-quarters of those present must vote in favour of exclusion from the Council, is a very weak compromise."
"There is no certainty that, under this method, states in which there are clear violations of human rights will not gain entry to the Council."
"It will be even harder to remove such states from the Council."
"So there is a possibility that states which do not respect human rights may continue to operate within the Council, bringing it into disrepute."
"The agreement that the Human Rights Council will now meet not for six weeks a year, but for ten weeks, is also not yet cause for optimism."
"These compromises give rise to doubts as to whether Europe’s position on UN reform issues was put with sufficient force."
"In the field of human rights, if we at the European Union do not guide processes then no one else will do it."
"The European Commission ought therefore to mobilise the greatest possible support for further suitable reform to the UN human rights institution, as well as for the election of states to the Council which will not discredit it but which will lay a solid foundation for effective work in the future."
"Mr President, the final document of the United Nations Summit in September established the foundations, in some cases the minimal foundations, on which the institutional reforms would be built."
"This was the case with the Human Rights Council: agreement was reached simply on its creation, the rest remained in the air."
"It was difficult to reach an agreement in a few months to establish the body that would replace the discredited Commission on Human Rights."
"President Eliasson's final proposal, which has just been voted for by a large majority in New York, is the result of a difficult negotiation."
"It was not the ideal proposal — Europe would have liked more — but it creates a new body which is better than the one we have at the moment."
"The members of the new Council will be elected by the Assembly by absolute majority, that is to say, a minimum of 96 votes in favour will be required."
"Furthermore, during its mandate, all of the members of the Council will be subject to scrutiny and also, as has been said, it will be possible to suspend them."
"Furthermore, as we have demanded, the meetings will be far more frequent and will last much longer than the meetings of the current Commission on Human Rights."
"The new Council therefore represents clear progress compared to the UNHCHR."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the quota of countries allotted to the Western Europe group is less than that allotted to us in the Commission."
"Mr President, I would have liked this proposal from Mr Eliasson to have been adopted by consensus, but in the end it has been put to a vote."
"I very much regret that the United States has voted against."
"It is a key country in the United Nations and I hoped that the initiatives to obtain their support for Mr Eliasson's proposal would succeed and that, in the end, the new Council would be established with Washington's support."
"But I am pleased that, in any event, their constructive cooperation with the new Council has been ensured."
"Furthermore, the work and the operation of the Council will be reviewed after five years, which will enable us to overcome the deficiencies of the new mechanism: one of the most ambitious objectives of the final document of the September Summit."
"Mr President, combating poverty is treated as a priority in this document and I would like to point out that, as this Parliament has already stated, poverty should be seen as a breach of human rights, since it violates human dignity and denies people other fundamental rights."
"( Mr President, today the UN General Assembly voted to create a Human Rights Council to replace the UN Human Rights Commission whose position has been compromised."
"The new UN Council fails to meet many of the criteria for the effective monitoring of human rights and reacting to abuses of these rights throughout the world."
"It does, however, represent a step towards establishing a new international structure based on respect for fundamental rights and political freedoms."
"The creation of the Council has been supported by Nobel Peace Prize laureates as well as human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch or the Open Society Institute and Soros Foundation Network."
"The European Union should now play a key role on the UN Human Rights Council."
"The European Parliament has the opportunity to take a leading role in supporting the Council’s efforts to create a new global system for the protection of human rights."
"As part of transatlantic dialogue, the European Union should encourage the United States to collaborate more closely with the Human Rights Council and work towards further reform of the UN."
"The USA was one of four countries which voted against the creation of the Council."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed the United Nations reform summit in late September of last year, one of the few things that we could really describe as a success was the planned replacement of the discredited Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council."
"The only thing that was not yet settled was its composition and procedures."
"It would really have been a serious defeat for the cause of human rights, but also for the United Nations, if we had failed in our attempt to replace this discredited Commission with a new Human Rights Council in a timely manner."
"For this reason, today’s outcome of the lengthy negotiations was an important success, including for President Eliasson."
"We congratulate him on this, as real improvements have been made."
"To elaborate: the members of this new Human Rights Council have to be elected by secret ballot, namely by at least 96 countries."
"Members can be excluded from the Human Rights Council subject to a two-thirds majority if they are guilty of gross human rights violations."
"The Human Rights Council has to meet at least three times a year."
"More continuity has been introduced into the work, and there is to be a regular review of the human rights situation in all the UN Member States."
"These are five important successes."
"I was at a loss to understand, therefore, why the United States attempted to block this."
"Mr President-in-Office, the US made not only positive demands, but also the demand that the five members of the Security Council retained their privileged status, that they remained on the Human Rights Council, as it were, without being elected."
"That would have been a serious error if one considers the human rights situation in the People’s Republic of China."
"It is a good thing that today’s vote supported the proposals in this form."
"– Mr President, the abolition of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the creation of a Council with far fewer members is intended to exclude and to be able to expel the countries which do not submit to the United States of America, the European Union or other imperialist forces."
"The aim is to have a submissive Council that can be turned into an agency which will judge infringements of human rights with partiality and against the criterion of imperialist ambitions."
"Thus, decisions to order will provide the pretext for various interventions, even war, in the name of the defence of human rights."
"The United States of America have indeed done a great deal for human rights: they have murdered tens of millions of people from Hiroshima and Nagasaki through Vietnam to Iraq today."
"That is their contribution."
"To paraphrase Brecht – because time is short – who wrote, 'When imperialists talk of peace they are preparing for war', I would say that, when you talk today about protecting human rights, you are preparing to massacre them, as you do every day."
"However, there is no Human Rights Council, Commission or UN that can prevent the fight of the peoples against their subjugation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, even though I would have welcomed this debate a short while ago, and today it is perhaps a little overdue, we all share a great and definite new hope, and of course we all welcome the creation of the new Council."
"Above all, we congratulate the Swedish president of the General Assembly, not only for what he managed to negotiate between the UN member countries, but especially for the way in which he succeeded in bringing together the voluntary organisations of the non-governmental sector that are now giving him so much support."
"We naturally welcome the longer lobbying periods in Geneva."
"We hope that the improvement witnessed over recent weeks in transatlantic relations will not turn sour, and that it will prove possible to overturn the current vote."
"In my view, it is important that the EU has spoken and that it has a clear and unified position, which it shares with the entire developed world."
"It is the developing world, however, that has the majority."
"Despite all the talk of loss of civilisation, it is clear that the new Council must fully adhere to the principle of the universality of human rights, with the same rules applying to each and every woman and each and every man."
"It is always apparent whether or not human rights have been upheld or violated and in this pre-review the Council will play a very important role."
"The exclusion instrument is also very important in this context, even though it requires a two-thirds majority, and in my view it creates a new opportunity for European foreign policy, a new opportunity to really address the violation of human rights, which is a problem that results from the failure of some states to function properly."
"Commissioner, I hope that we and especially you will have the courage to take clear steps towards upholding universal human rights across the whole world."
"Mr President, I was present with Parliament’s delegation in Geneva at the Human Rights Commission last year and saw with my own eyes how discredited that Commission had become and how it was being held hostage in its proceedings by countries which were themselves the worst perpetrators of human rights abuse."
"So, like Members across this House tonight, I welcome the creation of the new Human Rights Council."
"I believe it will be a step forward by meeting all year round, by being elected by a majority from the UN General Assembly, by having a system of suspension for those countries which are members and then violate human rights and by maintaining the tradition of access for non-governmental organisations."
"I am very proud of the role that we as MEPs have played in the margins of the process."
"When we met Louise Arbour, the Commissioner for Human Rights, in Geneva, and when she made her return visit to us in Brussels, we explored in detail her proposals for the universal review procedure now agreed, which will enable, it is argued, a much stronger, more objective examination of the record of all countries."
"We insisted in our resolutions that membership of the Human Rights Council should be open only to countries which issue standing invitations unimpeded to special rapporteurs."
"That is part of today’s agreement."
"Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Nepal and Zimbabwe will not and should not be members of this new Council."
"Finally, this UN reform results from the Millennium Review Summit and comes at a historic point in the defence of the principle of multilateralism in our world."
"We in the European Parliament should send a message to the US – not simply to the government but to its people – that whether it is the Human Rights Council, whether it is Kyoto, whether it is the International Criminal Court, or whether it is the principle of multilateralism itself, the United States is deeply and dangerously isolated in this world and it is no role for the world’s last remaining superpower to play. If the United States wants to be nominated to this new Council, it will have to allow unimpeded access to Guantánamo Bay."
"I wonder whether the US will stand."
"– Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that a decision has been taken not to leave this Human Rights Council in an embryonic state."
"Respect for human rights in the classical sense is one of the cornerstones of the European understanding of values, which will be reinforced by the creation of this new body."
"Although the proposal adopted is not ideal, it is a clear improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, which was still susceptible to influence from countries who had themselves committed extremely serious human rights violations."
"It is an important step for human rights in the world."
"A functioning body will be able to intervene more quickly in urgent cases and must oblige countries to stand up for, fight for and promote human rights."
"A blockade would have meant the international community losing credibility in the fight against human rights crimes."
"That is why it is a very good thing that this project did not fail; including in view of the important work of the many NGOs."
"(Mr President, the work of the current UN Human Rights Commission has been severely criticised from nearly all sides."
"It has been accused of being overly politicised and excessively active as well as of being corrupt."
"We should therefore welcome the ambitious attempts to reform the Commission and to transform it into the Human Rights Council, whose work will be more independent."
"Although the scope of these changes seems to be well thought out, there is a danger that they will be partially restricted in the course of international talks on the proposals."
"The European Parliament should clearly state its position on the issue, highlighting the need for these changes in order to promote and develop a culture based on the rule of law and democratic government throughout the world."
"The most important challenge related to this reform is, as has already been mentioned, the independence of the proposed UN Human Rights Council."
"Demanding that it be made into one of the main UN bodies is one of the main means of achieving this goal."
"What should really change is the way in which candidates are elected."
"They ought to be elected by the General Assembly according to a voting majority that would make membership impossible for a country whose government behaves in a way that may lead to doubts about its human rights credentials."
"It is also important for a vote to be taken on the candidature of every country, even if there are fewer candidates from the region than places allocated for that given region."
"Avoiding the presence of countries such as Libya, as has happened in recent times, or of Cuba, as is the case at present, is one of the basic steps on the road back to the UN regaining its credibility in the field of human rights protection in the world."
"It is also important to decrease the size of this institution so that its actions may be more efficient and its decisions more effective."
"Reform of the Human Rights Commission is a great opportunity to make significant improvements to the human rights situation across the world."
"We cannot, however, treat this topic as a one-off transformation."
"We have to see it as an opportunity to start a process of continuous improvements to the system for the protection of human rights in a way that will ensure it gains the trust of global public opinion and the status of a mechanism that draws attention to the most serious human rights abuses in the world and is not bound by political ties."
"– The news from New York brings us relief and satisfaction."
"The compromise proposed by the President of the General Assembly, Mr Eliasson, will not be perfect, but it is a good one. This is for the reasons expressed by a number of speakers and, in an article, by various Nobel Peace prize winners, including ex-President Jimmy Carter."
"We are disappointed that the United States has voted against, although we are not surprised, given that the US – a country that has traditionally done so much for human rights and for international law on human rights and the UN – is currently at the mercy of an administration that lacks any credibility or consistency on this matter. It is an administration that will go down in history as that of the ignominy of the Iraq invasion, of Guantánamo, of Abu Ghraib and of the extraordinary rendition act."
"Eleanor Roosevelt and other honourable defenders of human rights must be turning in their graves."
"Where the Bush Administration went wrong was in attempting to hold the creation of the new Council to ransom in last minute negotiations."
"We must make sure that, if it attempts to boycott the proceedings of the new Council, it does not succeed."
"It is the EU’s responsibility to continue to pursue a sound and clear-sighted working relationship with Mr Eliasson, via the Austrian Presidency and future presidencies, and via Mr Solana and Mr Barroso, whose voices we should like to hear louder and clearer on this issue. Europe needs to use all of its considerable influence to ensure that the Human Rights Council is up and running at the earliest opportunity."
"(Mr President, it is unacceptable that in the face of commonplace abuses of human rights the world lacks an organisation through which to condemn these events."
"The UN Human Rights Commission has, over the last few years, unfortunately become a symbol of the indolence of this organisation."
"It was an Old Boys’ Club, where countries notorious for human rights abuses such as China, Sudan, Zimbabwe or Russia could meet."
"Their main aim, however, was to prevent any kind of discussion of their own activities."
"The proposal for a Human Rights Council is an attempt to create an institution which would react more rapidly to crises throughout the world and whose activities would go beyond simply sending a symbolic UN mission to the country that is the subject of criticism."
"The project is not perfect, but it seems that the Human Rights Council’s duty of carrying out an assessment of the situation in each of its member states will at least prevent the abuses that have hitherto been perpetrated by its own members."
"The creation of a Human Rights Council is without doubt the best solution available to the problem of the UN Commission whose integrity has been compromised."
"The European Union should give the new institution its full support so that it can deal effectively with global challenges in the field of human rights protection."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the opinions expressed here."
"They largely confirm that the position of the EU was the right one."
"The expectations of the new Council are high, and a consistent position on its use is required to enable it to meet those expectations and to function properly."
"Of course, we cannot abolish the laws of political reality from one day to the next, but I do believe that we have a chance."
"The EU must play a key role in this."
"I am obliged to the House for the support that you have expressed here."
"It has been pointed out repeatedly that the election of members of the Human Rights Council is of the utmost importance."
"We all regret that the original proposal for a two-thirds majority could not be pushed through."
"Nevertheless, I should like to reiterate that the EU’s commitment, which I mentioned earlier, to vote only for countries who have a clean human rights record, is extremely important."
"We are not talking here about just 25 or 27 votes, but rather, if we include associated countries – indeed, the community of democratic nations as a whole – we are talking about a large number, which is capable of blocking membership of countries who are in fact flagrant human rights violators."
"Mr Coveney said that the figure of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council is too high, that the instrument is too large."
"That is open to debate."
"It should be borne in mind that, at all events, the membership of the Human Rights Council is a little smaller than that of the Commission on Human Rights."
"Compared with 191 Member States of the United Nations, I personally consider the figure of 47 perfectly appropriate."
"Incidentally, that has in fact meant rather fewer seats for the Western group, owing to the fact that members are to now be elected not at Ecosoc but directly in the General Assembly."
"That, too, is regrettable, but we have to take the rough with the smooth. If we want a powerful, relatively small instrument, we have to accept that we shall have somewhat fewer votes."
"I actually agree with everything Mr Schmidt said."
"The demand by the United States that the five permanent members of the Security Council be given automatic membership of the Human Rights Council was a relatively early proposal that was no longer supported in the latter phase."
"It would certainly not have had the support of the EU, and as such was never really going to be able to command a majority."
"Mrs Flautre pointed out that the important dossiers that are still being dealt with by the Commission on Human Rights must be completed."
"The EU will of course ensure that the outstanding issues are brought to a close, namely in such a way as to benefit human rights, and such that these dossiers can be taken over immediately by the Human Rights Council."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the motion for a resolution creating the Human Rights Council was adopted by such a resounding majority – 70 votes in favour, 4 against and 3 abstentions – would certainly give the impression that this Council will have a certain credibility."
"There is no doubt that 9 May, election day for members of the Council, will be a landmark day in the emergence of the fledgling council."
"On this point, I trust that candidate countries will submit their candidacies one month ahead of the vote, as the Union has requested they do."
"The Council is set to meet for the first time in Geneva on 16 June, and I trust that we shall be attending the session in good numbers."
"Whilst the Human Rights Council is undeniably a happy outcome of the last UN summit, it is also true that the big winner has in fact been multilateral architecture, with the creation, also in December 2005, of the Peacebuilding Committee, which is similarly set to meet soon."
"The year 2006 is set to be a good one for multilateralism."
"In both cases, the EU has shown its commitment to effective multilateralism. It has also demonstrated leadership and its ability also to wield some influence in this UN reform."
"I feel that we can continue down this path together."
"– To wind up the debate, I have received four motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"– The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed (COM(2005)0694 – C6-0026/2006 – 2005/0270(CNS) (A6-0033/2006), and"
"– the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (COM(2005)0698 – C6-0027/2006 – 2005/0275(CNS)) (A6-0034/2006)."
"I should like to remind speakers in this debate of what I said for the previous one, namely that this is a very long late-night sitting and that I shall therefore be ruthless when it comes to speaking time."
"Please understand, therefore, if I have to take disciplinary action to keep you to the time officially allocated to you to speak."
"This remark naturally does not apply to Mrs Kroes, to whom I now give the floor."
". Mr President, I want to start by thanking Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on both reports, the first on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin and the second on traditional specialities guaranteed."
"The Commission appreciates the efficient organisation of your work, which has enabled adoption of the reports within a short period of time."
"In my opening statement I address both reports, thereby focusing on the general background that has led to these Commission proposals."
"Firstly, as regards the report on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, almost 14 years ago the European Community established a voluntary system of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines and spirits."
"Since 1993, over 700 names have been registered."
"Almost 300 requests are currently waiting for registration; this gives an idea of the success of this system."
"This success may explain the interest shown by our trade partners in this regulation."
"The conclusions of the recent WTO panels on cases brought by the US and Australia impose on us the obligation to open the Community scheme to direct applications and objections from individuals in third countries."
"This is the fundamental reason for the proposal you have on the table: to ensure conformity with the conclusions of the panels."
"On the basis of experience gained in managing the registration process, we realised that the current system would not survive an additional burden of direct applications from operators in third countries."
"Thus we had to streamline the system and make it more efficient."
"If we simply conform to WTO rules without increasing the efficiency of the functioning of the system, the whole approval process could come to a standstill."
"I should add that, in order to avoid any risk of a new complaint at WTO level, the procedure for third-country and EU denominations should be as similar as possible."
"We have all been surprised by the extent of the changes required under the WTO ruling."
"While the Community won the panel on the substantive trademark issue, we lost on the procedural questions."
"We also included one clear policy change, namely promoting the use of Community logos for enhancing the credibility of the system."
"Apart from that, however, there are no policy initiatives, as the primary purpose of the proposal is to conform to the WTO panel findings within the deadline."
"The many demands and suggestions for policy development set out in the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are issues that deserve more time to be adequately addressed."
"Let me turn now to the other proposal, which concerns traditional specialities guaranteed."
"In spite of the modest number of products registered, some producers have shown their interest in this regulation."
"There are only 50 names registered as traditional specialities guaranteed, but there are 19 applications pending at Community level and a number of others under examination in the Member States."
"This regulation has not been amended since its adoption in 1992."
"The procedures have been designed neither for 25 nor for 27 Member States, or for handling a significant number of applications."
"There is a similar need to streamline and standardise the content of applications so that more efficient procedures are adopted and so that producers who make the effort to engage in quality schemes are not disappointed by approvals being delayed for several years."
"I also consider it important to correct a number of inconsistencies and to reflect substantial advances in legal drafting standards since 1992."
"At the same time, we propose simplifications and clarifications and other improvements identical to those proposed for geographical indications and designations of origin."
"Finally, we are keen to make it clear in this regulation that WTO rules are respected and to forestall any criticism."
"In conclusion, these proposals achieve WTO conformity and introduce limited but necessary housekeeping that is designed to streamline and clarify procedures."
"We can thereby underpin the mechanisms and better serve producers and consumers who rely on denominations."
"However, particularly in the light of the WTO deadline of 3 April 2006, we did not propose deeper policy changes."
"Those will be addressed in due course within the framework of a wide reflection on agricultural quality policy."
"– Mr President, I am glad that the Commissioner is here to represent the Commission at today’s debate on this report."
"Her colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, cannot be present, but that should not prevent us from making this a good discussion."
"The Commissioner said that this is not the beginning of a legislative process, but that we are just responding to a request from the WTO."
"The beginnings of a legislative framework for quality assurance came in 1992, as much as 14 years ago, but, of course, that was not the start of high-quality production in the areas that were protected at that time."
"It was rather the case that, as with organic farming, the matter of the products at issue here had been introduced onto the market long ago, over a period of decades, by producers, and proceeded to gain consumer acceptance."
"There then followed harmonisation and streamlining measures, clarifications and safeguards."
"With regard to quality policy, there are only two areas within agriculture that are designated ‘quality’."
"These are the area under discussion today, and organic farming."
"Everything else is covered by the concept of food safety."
"Here, however, we are talking about and focusing on quality, in particular."
"As the Commissioner has already mentioned, this is no trifling matter, it is a billion-euro business."
"Granting regions and businesses protection of geographical indications, designations of origin or specialities creates genuine added value."
"It is understandable that others will covet this added value."
"The dispute is with the United States, in particular – and when I say United States, I mean the large multinationals. These are looking very carefully at whether the products now being protected here as designations of origin can perhaps be incorporated into their empires as trademarks."
"In exactly the same way as Coca-Cola, they want to include Feta cheese, Parmesan, Spreewälder Gurken (Spreewald Gherkins), Karlsbader Oblaten (Karlsbad Wafers), Thüringer Rostbratwurst, and also Tiroler Speck – from both Austria and South Tyrol (Südtiroler Speck) – with their trademarks; not because they consider them particularly good, but because there is money to be made from them."
"That is why they, too, have joined the discussion in the WTO, and now we are presenting our response."
"The good thing about the discussion is that the WTO has said from the outset, as a matter of principle, that our rules are in accordance with its own rules."
"What is not in accordance with its rules, and where improvements need to be made, is the issue of third country access to these protected quality indications."
"We are making good this shortcoming, and I also think that this makes sense."
"I should also like to point out, however, that another kind of desire also comes to the fore here."
"For example, producers of Parma ham or Tiroler Speck may think to themselves: if we were to buy the pigs on the wider market, it would be cheaper than having to produce them in the region or stipulating that the regions from which we obtain them be specifically geared towards such production – because this would naturally mean an increase in production costs."
"If we do not do that, however, we run the risk, in the international discussions within the WTO – and the multinationals will keep on and on at us about it – of lapsing into arbitrariness, of undermining our own quality indications and thus ultimately losing the protection."
"This being the case, it would be a highly dubious business to believe it is possible to buy raw materials at cheaper prices, and that is why we have stipulated and are stipulating that there be a special relationship between the regions in this regard."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words of a procedural nature."
"As the Commissioner is also aware, the Council has already made a decision."
"We are once again holding a discussion here despite the fact that everything has already been decided, and that is unacceptable."
"The matter has to be debated first."
"I hope that we can also make that clear in the Constitution once it has been ratified."
"We considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure annoyance, because, once again, we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored."
"However, we believe that this would project an outward lack of unity on our part in the WTO proceedings, and enable others to say: aha, they are not even agreed among themselves."
"Since we are in favour of strengthening and securing the EU position, we shall let it pass, but we should like to make clear where the Council’s weaknesses lie in some regards, and would ask Commissioner Kroes to communicate that in her role as Commissioner, so that she reconsiders her decisions."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of geographical indications and of traditional specialities for agricultural products and foodstuffs is an important instrument for the development and sustainability of quality products."
"On the whole, I consider the work carried out by the Commission to be very positive."
"Given that two phases of analysis of the question had been foreseen, one on a national and one on a Community level, it was absolutely necessary to make sure they were coordinated."
"I am convinced that the greater responsibilities given by the Member States, the precise terms articulating the procedure and the new system of oppositions, address the need for faster and more efficient recognition, that is to say for a quick check that is also endowed with the crucial characteristic of completeness."
"The opportunity for third countries to access the European system for the protection of agricultural products makes it necessary to protect the consumer from a false association between Community symbols and the actual origin of a product."
"The indication of the origin of a product on a label, along with the diversification of the colour of Community logos and the authorisation of the use of expressions for processed products, are all innovations that address the need for greater protection of consumers."
"Furthermore, I believe that these measures will encourage producers to take greater and fuller advantage of the labelling of excellent products by following the approach to food quality that the European Union promotes."
"Lastly, I support Amendments 48 and 50, which are aimed at allowing the involvement of regional authorities in the national checking phase and greater protection of the protected designation of origin (PDO) and the protected geographical indication (PGI) with respect to other forms of protection like trademarks."
"I hope that my fellow Members will share this point of view by approving these two amendments tomorrow."
"Finally, I wish to thank the Commission, which has put this before Parliament, in which regard I also pick up what my fellow Member said earlier, for these procedures and for their recognition of the production of quality products."
"They have addressed a widespread need for fast action, but also, and above all, the protection of the excellence of rural areas in Europe."
". – Mr President, as the rapporteur has said quite rightly, I believe that quality is European agriculture’s great asset."
"In view of the global market in which we increasingly have to compete, as a result of extremely low labour costs, scant environmental and hygiene requirements – in other words, lower prices – I believe that quality must set us apart."
"We therefore need guaranteed and certified quality by means of a simpler and easily recognisable system in which the consumers have confidence, both inside and outside of Europe – and that is what we are working on."
"Furthermore, it is essential that these denominations are recognised outside of the Union, in the WTO, so that we can establish a market in high-quality agricultural products."
"We are working on that, and I believe that the work that has been done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this position."
"The first challenge facing us is to strengthen our system of consumers and producers even further."
"We need a faster system, with clearly defined time periods and procedures, in which competences are properly allocated."
"I believe that the way the sector itself perceives it is as important as the way the consumers perceive it, and it must be shown the economic advantages of a high-quality market: the security of a system of denomination which properly controls the products that do not comply with the conditions set, and a quick and not too burdensome procedure."
"I believe that the issue that we are dealing with is very important, particularly for countries such as my own, which are pioneers of ecological agriculture."
"As I have said, I believe that this issue deserves more in-depth consideration, and we must do this once the requirements of the WTO – and this must happen as soon as possible – have been complied with, simplifying access to the system for third-country products."
"During the subsequent examination and reflection that we will hold in this House, I believe that it is essential to listen to the sector and to be attentive to its needs, thinking at all times of directing our products and our quality towards the global market, these being the values of a truly competitive European agri-food sector."
". Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has once again done his duty as rapporteur with his usual enthusiasm, and on that I should like to congratulate him."
"I concur with the thrust of his conclusions."
"In the light of increasing liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, it is necessary for us to recognise more geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs at international level."
"His conclusions are completely justified therefore."
"What also comes into play for me is what precisely the definition of a geographical indication in Europe itself is."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned the example of Parma ham, that that should originate in that region."
"I have always been puzzled by the fact that Germany, rather than the Netherlands, is the largest producer of Edam cheese, and I believe that that state of affairs should change."
"If we regulate this in the WTO – and I am pleased that he sees eye to eye with me on this – and we ask the others to recognise our products, it seems only natural to me that we also recognise theirs."
"I am not entirely of the same mind as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf when he says that at present, there are only two quality categories of agricultural products in the European Union, namely those with geographical indications and those that are produced organically."
"Whilst this may be true at the moment, we must go much further."
"It is necessary to introduce a European quality mark for agricultural products."
"If we ask our farmers to respect animal welfare standards, environmental objectives, and suchlike, then it would be very unfair to expect those farmers to compete with the rest of the world, with farmers who do not need to adhere to those same standards."
"Since customers must be able to distinguish them in the shops, we must develop a quality mark for products other than geographical and organic ones."
". Mr President, Commissioner, on the topic of a proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, I would like to draw attention to something that is said in the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, namely that intellectual property is the last raw material remaining to Europeans."
"It is precisely for this reason that we may express wonder and regret over the fact that we have so far had no targeted plan for developing a system specifically for the protection of intellectual property."
"The new instrument should finally eliminate the persistent disputes at the WTO between the EU and some of its trading partners."
"Once this matter has been resolved, we can only hope that the Commission will then return to the issue of geographical indications and designations of origin with clear conceptual aims."
"I would like to add that designations of origin and geographical indications constitute an integral component of intellectual property, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation."
"Under the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the issue of intellectual property belongs unambiguously and exclusively to the remit of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"It is therefore odd both from a procedural and a practical viewpoint that the drafting of this report was entrusted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without including in it even an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs."
". (Mr President, the aims of both proposals for regulations seem well-founded."
"It is difficult not to support an increase in the income of farmers, fair conditions for competition and protection from fake copies of original products."
"There are, however, doubts as to whether the aims set are realistic."
"Let us consider the result to date of existing solutions."
"Within the framework of guaranteed, traditional specialities only 15 agricultural and food products have so far been registered throughout the Union."
"Is it really necessary to create complex procedures and expand bureaucracy for the benefit of a dozen or a few dozen products?"
"Will the farmer-producer really gain anything by it?"
"Within the framework of the system for the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin over 700 names have been registered across the EU including 150 cheeses, 160 types of meat or meat products, 150 types of fruit and vegetables and 80 types of olive oil."
"There are 300 new applications pending examination."
"By creating this legislation, will we not soon find ourselves in a ridiculous position, bordering on the laughable?"
"In a few years we will have thousands of original product names wanting to conquer supermarkets across the whole of the EU."
"As customers, we will be worn down by them and the costly bureacratic system will turn out to be inefficient when dealing with applications."
"Would it not be better to give up the idea of regulating local delicacies?"
"If we turn delicacies into mass products, they will no longer be delicacies."
"Let them remain a natural attraction of particular places or regions, but without the support of the European Union."
". ( Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on his excellent reports."
"I am delighted that we will achieve the necessary simplifications in the registration procedures for local food produce and that we will have more of these products available, or rather that they will be more familiar to us, as we are of course talking about traditional products that have been on the market for a long time."
"The real future of Europe lies in supporting traditional, regional products which represent the achievements of local communities."
"It is something at which we can excel, at which we can surpass others and thanks to which we can build a European market that is a common market and yet is rich thanks to the variety of regional specialities."
"It is a great opportunity for regional producers."
"Most of all, however, it is good news for consumers as these products are made according to traditional recipes and using methods that go back generations and are healthier and better than mass-produced goods."
"It is also the best way to face the challenge presented by biotechnology companies."
"They want to force us to consume their mass-produced food which is the result of genetic engineering."
"We should be clear on this matter."
"We want to consume products that are healthy, varied and produced using traditional, regional methods, and we do not want to be forced to consume food products made using methods that cheat nature."
"Mr President, for the last few decades the common agricultural policy has encouraged farmers to produce more, regardless of quality."
"As a result, they have two Mercedes in the yard and shops are full of produce which is neither palatable nor cheap."
"We have to pay more for so-called ‘organic’ products in order to buy what should be normal food."
"It is cynical to say that consumers today regard quality as more important than quantity."
"They simply want to eat food once again that they have not seen for a long time and to which they have a right."
"We, meanwhile, are spending most of our budget on the common agricultural policy, mainly in the old Member States."
"Let us hope that, by simplifying the current procedures, these regulations relating to the protection of geographical indications, designations of origin and traditional specialities will favour farmers who produce healthy and tasty produce."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for addressing this important issue."
"I hope that farmers, especially those from the new Member States who have not yet had the time or money to take up agricultural production on an industrial scale, will be rewarded for their traditional production methods."
"We do not have such splendid processing methods as those for which French cuisine is renowned, but we do have healthy, tasty farm produce and food."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, there is no need for me to spell out how much we value our system of protected geographical indications (PGO) and protected designations of origin (PDO) and how keen we are to defend them and ensure compliance with them, within and outside the Union."
"As things stand, following the repeated and, to my mind, all-too-frequent reforms of the common agricultural policy, producers in many of our regions only survive on account of the quality of their products and their expertise. Happily, consumers are increasingly appreciative of this and are prepared to pay reasonable prices, thereby helping to keep people in work up- and downstream and, in turn, contributing to rural development."
"It has been well documented that the United States and Australia had the nerve to attack our successful regulation on the issue at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"Over 700 product designations have been registered since 1993, the commercial value of which is put at over EUR 10 billion."
"I feel I should mention at this point the registration of , which Mr Ebner, who has given me his two minutes of speaking time in this debate, holds especially dear."
"The WTO’s competent body has fortunately come to the conclusion that our regulation was not in breach of WTO rules."
"All we have to do is adapt it by 20 April – there is no time to waste, in other words – so as to place third country nationals on an equal footing with EU citizens as regards the application procedure and the right to object."
"I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to commend him on the excellent spirit of collaboration, which is not always in evidence between factions across the political divide in Parliament."
"I welcome the fact that – with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and with other luminaries of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, including the chairman, Mr Daul – we have succeeded in reaching agreement on amendments aimed at clarifying and simplifying matters and at making them more specific, as well as at ensuring respect, via adequate monitoring, for this intellectual property of our farmers, which is one of the last raw materials possessed by Europeans."
"What we especially want to do – by means of specific deadlines: six months for the Commission to examine applications, four months to raise objections – is to avoid there being damaging delays for the operators involved."
"We want to see Community symbols, our logos, distinguished by specific colours and to ensure that these are not used by third countries."
"Lastly, we wish to ensure that if the registration of a PDO or PGI is cancelled, it cannot be registered as a trade mark for five years. This is to prevent any economic pressure being put on producers."
"I know that many Members of this Chamber have had many ideas and suggestions for improving the law, but we would call on the Council, as time is ticking away, to implement initially only the changes made necessary by the WTO’s ruling."
"According to ..."
"(Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on two excellent reports."
"I would also like to express my conviction that it is precisely these new regulations adopted by Parliament that will further the development of agricultural food production, and in particular the revitalisation of rural areas by promoting their traditions and cultural values and increasing employment outside of the farming sector."
"I think that a transparent and simplified registration procedure and a clear division of competences between the Member States and the Commission will provide more effective protection for consumers and producers, citizens of the Union and, most of all, for those who manufacture these products."
"They will be protected from fake copies, the misuse of original names, the copying of lists of ingredients and other fraudulent practices used by people looking to make a quick profit."
"The proposed regulations do indeed contribute to guaranteeing a credible system to protect the quality of registered products which are trusted and whose popularity is growing in the Union and across the world."
"These products will now not only feature the producer’s label but also the label of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must be in a position to guarantee and protect the quality of its agricultural and food production."
"In order to achieve this objective it is necessary to defend traditional specialities and geographical indications, even against attacks launched from inside the World Trade Organisation by the United States and Australia."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job to improve the two regulations."
"We need to protect products in order to have a real impact on improving food safety and prevent the homogenisation of flavour, which is occurring on a global scale."
"All too often, sadly, we find examples of counterfeiting: the largest market in southern Italy, Vittoria in Sicily, is every day flooded with counterfeit products that are put on the market as protected geographical indication products, for example Pachino cherry tomatoes."
"For this reason, we believe that labelling is needed to reveal the indication of the place of origin and processing of a product."
"We must question ourselves, however, over one matter: all too often those in favour of the PDO and PGI scheme are more concerned with commercialisation than with production."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for helping to protect regional individuality and rural self-sufficiency."
"Europe has such rich and varied produce and food, and we certainly need to protect that from trade liberalisation absolutists."
"The family recipe, the local flavour, the hand-made product, the quality and unique character need our protection to keep our regions as rich as they are now."
"But what use will all this valuable work be if, concurrently, we allow GM to infiltrate our crops, and thus our food and produce?"
"Here we are trying to protect the individuality of products and the uniqueness of local ingredients."
"How can we claim that our ingredients are local if they are all modified in a laboratory?"
"Those seeds are certainly not your family's variation; they are an identikit Monsanto seed of a particular batch number, exactly the same seed as millions of others around the globe."
"How can we then claim that our products are unique, that they are our rich regional flavour, or that they are from our region at all?"
"Would honesty not require us to label our produce as 'Monsanto Corporation, produced in St Louis, Missouri'?"
"We must allow regions to choose whether they wish to be GM and we must protect those which do not."
"We must not only appreciate and preserve local specialities but also the farmers' markets at which they are still sometimes locally sold."
"We must ensure that, in regulating food marketing, we do not kill off the remaining traditional local farmers' markets."
"( Mr President, it is fortunate that we are holding a joint debate on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s reports."
"In one of the reports, in point 5 of the justification, the text reads that ‘the aim of the proposals is to simplify the procedure and to provide an accurate definition of the remits of the different bodies during the examination process for the proposal’."
"This, along with other annotations, such as those under point 9, gives us hope that in the final Council regulations we will be able to avoid red tape and legal inconsistencies."
"This is particularly important with regard to the regulation on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"We have to remember that geographical indications are part of the heritage of certain local communities and individual nations and that they are responsible for protecting them."
"The protection of geographical indications and designations of origin of foodstuffs at a Community level should only fulfil a supporting function and prevent dishonest practices."
"However, ‘only national bodies shall have the authority’ to impose penalties at a national level, as stated in Article 11(3)."
"Regional products and foodstuffs have to support regional development and broaden the range of tourist attractions, including agro-tourism."
"No one wants a Union where everyone everywhere dresses the same, eats the same food and speaks in the same manner."
"Mr President, I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary."
"Regions have a right to exploit and protect such specialities for their own economic benefit."
"I note that it is estimated that, in those Member States where this is done, around EUR 5 billion a year is raised, in terms of added value, by promoting such geographical indications."
"Of course, there is also a knock-on effect in terms of impact and job creation and in population retention in rural areas."
"My sole regret is that, to date, my region – Northern Ireland – has not yet availed itself of this facility, though I would have to say, biased as I am, that we are rich in such commodities."
"Ulster beef, which all Europeans will soon be able to savour again when the beef ban is lifted, has a taste and quality which makes it renowned and which caused the Greenfield label to be synonymous with the highest quality."
"Our wheaten and soda breads are must-taste delicacies and Armagh Bramley apples have a very distinct reputation."
"I would therefore call on the British Government in this debate to avail itself forthwith of the opportunities available under these regulations."
"In terms of these regulations, a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic."
"I would therefore make a plea that the maximum effort should be made to simplify the process so that regional products may be protected and promoted more swiftly, and I welcome what the Commissioner had to say in that regard."
"In the context of the WTO, it is vital that Europe defends the rights accrued under those regulations and does not give in to the pressures coming from third countries."
"I agree strongly with our rapporteur that the EU must use all its clout and diplomatic skill to defend geographical indications."
"Whilst we should take encouragement from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body's rejection of recent attacks by the United States and Australia, we cannot afford any sense of complacency."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to join in thanking the rapporteur for his really excellent reports, and also the shadow rapporteurs for their very efficient cooperation on this."
"I regard both of these reports as among the very important dossiers of this parliamentary term: particularly the report on protected geographical indications and protected designations of origin."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, there are already over 700 products that have been registered and 300 procedures that have been commenced."
"That represents a key aspect as far as European agriculture and rural areas are concerned."
"I believe that intellectual property is also relevant to these products, and that these products, as it were, contribute towards the identity of a region."
"If we open up our markets to products from third countries, we must be able to make this conditional on these countries applying the same standards in terms of quality and social aspects as prevail within the EU."
"The fact is that we are living in a global world, but nevertheless fair competition can only be afforded if the same requirements and rules apply within the WTO and are put into practice."
"Generally speaking, however, we must take care that the procedure involves careful scrutiny, and that there is no levelling down."
"Quality has its price."
"As Horst Köhler, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, said yesterday, the EU’s higher prices must be matched by superiority in quality."
"To cite an example, in Austria, there are 180 000 farmers engaged in production."
"These demonstrably safeguard approximately 600 000 jobs upstream and downstream."
"This also reveals how important active farming enterprises and family-run farms engaged in production are to rural areas."
"– Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur and my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report, one of the strong points of which is that it emphasises a key concept, which is that Europe’s farming will only survive on the basis of quality."
"Consequently, at the heart of any political measure taken by the EU, not least in international fora such as the World Trade Organisation, must be the defence of labels and other protected designations, as this is the only way of guaranteeing the sustainable competitiveness of European products in a globalised world."
"I personally come from a region that has more than 30 products registered under the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) schemes."
"These designations are without question an asset for the producers who benefit from them."
"It is a similar idea to one we have always used in another sector, which does not fall under the scope of this text but which requires support and protection from Europe."
"I refer, of course, to the winemaking sector, which accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in my region, southern France, and hundreds of thousands of jobs around Europe, and which is currently enduring a major crisis."
"If nothing is done, including at European level, there is a danger that Europe will lose its soul."
"( Mr President, today we are discussing how to protect traditional, speciality agricultural products."
"The regulation mentions the time scale of a single generation of production required in order for a product to qualify as a product that is produced using traditional methods."
"Concerns have been raised regarding the amendment which restricts the definition to products that were in use before World War II."
"This discriminates against Eastern European Countries."
"As a consequence of World War II, Poland lost half of its territory and several million people were displaced to lands that had been regained."
"Therefore, the continuity of tradition was broken."
"During Communist rule, production of traditional products for trading purposes was also banned."
"Only for the past decade or so, after independence was regained, have communities in specific regions returned to traditional, healthy production methods for foodstuffs, for example traditional Polish sausages and hams."
"This had previously been impossible."
"Another extremely important question is the issue of certainty regarding whether foodstuffs will be sufficiently monitored with respect to quality and whether a situation can be avoided where the increasing supply of genetically modified plants across Europe leads to traditional products becoming tainted."
"There are, after all, countries in Europe where genetically modified plants have spread beyond all control and will certainly soon threaten traditional products because of the change in the ingredients list."
"The annexed register of products classed as traditional products should also be expanded to include delicatessen goods."
"Mr President, the report on designations of origin and geographical indications presented to us by the Commission states that its intention in drawing it up has been to clarify procedures and to bring Community legislation into line with a judgment of the World Trade Organisation."
"The protection of geographical indications is naturally extremely important. It is essential in order to provide consumers with accurate information concerning the quality, origin and production methods of the products they consume."
"It therefore seems logical that we should avoid confusing consumers, and the use of the Community logo on third-country products should not therefore be authorised."
"Furthermore, the Members of this House have an obligation to the diversity and wealth of European gastronomic heritage, which has so far enjoyed an international reputation."
"We must conform to the judgment of the tribunal of the World Trade Organisation − there is no question about that; that is what it is for − and we must modify the Regulation in order to guarantee that it complies with those requirements."
"Nevertheless, until the WTO includes in its debate the international system of geographical indications and thus until we have an international register of geographical indications, it does not make much sense for the modifications of our Community Regulation to go any further than is strictly necessary."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that the changes to the Regulation do not lead to delays in the register or lead to discrimination between the European Union and third countries, because the procedure for Community authorisation demands compliance with very strict quality and food safety requirements."
"Would the Commission be able to ensure that third-country products conform to those same standards?"
"In all honesty, I do not believe so."
"I therefore believe that the amendment from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats should be supported and I also believe that the differing views on health systems amongst the Member States must ensure that the farmers and producers are not the only ones who have to pay for the extension of the legislation on food hygiene to designations of origin."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate our rapporteur."
"The establishment of the protected designation of origin (PDO), the protected geographical indication (PGI) and the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) is a step in the right direction for the development of rural areas. It will help both to preserve natural and cultural heritage, and to extend the range of high-quality products to a growing number of demanding and well-informed consumers."
"I can bear witness to this from the experience of my country, in which more than 100 products have become subject to these arrangements, and most of them have registered reasonable commercial success."
"In some cases, the success of the market represents both the rehabilitation of indigenous breeds that had been heading for extinction and of operating methods which would otherwise have been seriously at risk or would have disappeared."
"The thrust of the proposals before us will help to enhance the existing regulatory framework and bring it into line with WTO rules, with which we wish to comply."
"I wish to underline that clearer identification of Community symbols by means of colouring, identification of the origin and place of processing of products from third countries, and the fact that the Commission’s decision was upheld, render the process more credible and will lead to cheaper prices and less bureaucracy."
"Mr President, before I address the subject of today’s debate, it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally."
"The announcement was made today in Ireland."
"When we talk about the WTO, Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production."
"Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3 500 farmers will be very badly affected."
"Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead, as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies?"
"If sugar beet is sacrificed today, as it has been in Ireland, what about EU beef farming tomorrow?"
"With regard to this report, I thank the rapporteur for his good work."
"However, I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity – as we should – but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union, which also needs protection."
"I regret that in Ireland we have only three products that are registered under the PGI description, but we have many hundreds of small food companies that could take the protection offered by these regulations."
"I would urge them to do so."
"We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO."
"We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it cannot be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards."
"By all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods, but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection."
"– Mr President, I must first add my tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his remarkable work aimed at providing better information and better protection for producers, manufacturers and consumers. His report managed, on the one hand, to steer clear of conservative protectionism, and, on the other, to show recognition and respect for our expertise."
"This will not please everyone, however, and the best proof of this is the firm line taken in the United States and Australia, which want geographical indications only to be admitted under exceptional circumstances and are seeking to have them restricted to certain wines and spirits."
"The EU must do all it can to defend these geographical indications and must use all its diplomatic acumen, especially in the forthcoming negotiations on the transposition of the Hong Kong decisions."
"Geographical indications are an excellent way of delivering a qualitative approach to international trade."
"Unfortunately, there has not been a single sign of the geographical indications being sustainably enshrined at the WTO."
"The Commission must be capable of playing an important role in this respect."
"We need to be aware that quality and recognition bring hope for the future of Europe’s farming."
"– Mr President, I am obliged to my fellow Members, and should like to pass on some of this great praise to my collaborators."
"Mr Mulder, I was also pleased with your contribution."
"We agree with each other in substance, but I am also pleased that you have praised my commitment."
"Of course, we are both now getting on a bit and have been in this business a long time; yet we are still concerned with things, we have not tired of fighting for what we think is right."
"When you complain that there are only two types of quality indication, I share your criticism."
"This must be extended; we must not only afford safety in the sense that people will not die from eating something, but also respect pleasure in eating, as well as quality, origin and the endeavours of generations."
"This combination of free-market economy and quality assurance is exactly what we need."
"Market orientation is a good thing, of course, but it needs to be combined with an appreciation of what is being achieved here."
"In reply to the question a little while ago as to whether this is a purely administrative matter, I can only say: no, it is not an administrative matter, it is a system developed over generations that is now being given legislative and administrative safeguards."
"That is rather different from having something imposed on us."
"If there were no benefit to be gained from this, we would not be having this discussion within the WTO."
"It is natural that the multinationals are keeping a watchful eye on the added value being created here – and that is considerable."
"Among us, Ireland – of which I have now twice heard mention – has unfortunately yet to set a good example, and I would urge it to encourage those of its regions manufacturing products in this way to submit a request."
"There must be no omissions in this regard."
"This is one aspect of the information that we, Parliament included, are able to provide."
"I should also like to mention the cooperation with Mrs Lulling."
"She may not be the eldest, but she is the longest-serving among us."
"Anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task."
"This is not only to do with political orientation, but also with Mrs Lulling as a person."
"Nevertheless, we have managed to table joint amendments in some fields."
"I should like to mention some of the particularly important of those here."
"For some obscure reason, the Council has introduced a provision that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest can have a registration of a designation of origin or of a special quality indication cancelled."
"Indeed, since we are talking about added value here, the desire to transform this into trademarks will naturally arise."
"To show that we are not carrying out a commercial activity here, we have tabled a joint amendment."
"I would ask the Commission to really ensure that the Council incorporates this."
"If a protected designation is cancelled, it cannot be transformed into a trademark for a period of five years. This gives us some leeway, and makes it that little bit more expensive for those who wish to transform designations into trademarks and are offering the people or the regions something in return."
"We must proceed very carefully in such situations."
"I hope that the Commissioner will take this further."
"I should like to express my sincere thanks for such a constructive discussion here today."
". Mr President, the rapporteur has received flowers from quite a number of honourable Members and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to add a couple of flowers to the bouquet."
"Thank you again for the interesting exchange of views."
"Let me comment on some of the points raised during this debate."
"As a general comment – Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Castiglione touched upon this point – I should like to stress again that with these proposals the Commission wants to bring our legislation into conformity with the findings of the WTO panels."
"This includes numerous aspects of the procedure and elements of simplification, so the system can support the implementation of the WTO findings."
"That was a point mentioned by Mr Allister and, in my opinion, it addresses his concerns."
"In response to Mr Mulder, I reiterate the intention of the Commission to further review the various policy issues not related to the WTO findings and the wider issue of the agricultural quality policy in the EC over the next year."
"I have learnt a lot this evening, including the point Mr Mulder made about Edam cheese."
"I should explain to Mr Mulder that Edam is a type of cheese that can be produced anywhere."
"It is a Codex standard."
"However, North Holland Edam is protected, and that is a Dutch quality product."
"So eat more Edam from North Holland!"
"Let me comment in more detail on the exchange of views and address some of the issues you have raised."
"Concerning the logos, the three logos established by Commission rules are already different from one another."
"I also want to make it clear that any advantage given to EC producers – and I believe the use of a Community symbol is such an advantage – will be equally open to third country producers."
"That answer is for Mr Castiglione and Mrs Herranz García."
"However, the Commission agrees that this needs to be further explored."
"This will be done within the framework of the wider policy review, which the Commission intends to conduct as soon as this proposal has been implemented."
"Several amendments deal with the obligations of the Member States and the Commission, which Mr Podkański mentioned."
"The Commission has no intention of altering the current distribution of competence between the Member States and the Commission."
"Amendments 23 and 24 ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications."
"I agree that the Commission should carry out its duties within a reasonable period of time."
"Mrs Lulling and Mrs Salinas García touched upon that."
"I agree that we should take into account the definition of a reasonable period of time, which is not easy, given the complexity of applications."
"It is certainly not realistic to have all the applications scrutinised and published in six months; twelve months would be more acceptable."
"Your amendments on controls reflect the aim of the Commission proposal, which is to ensure that there is a clear understanding that all over the EC there are authorities in charge of enforcing the Community rules on geographical indications and traditional specialities."
"There is also no doubt that these controls will be carried out within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law."
